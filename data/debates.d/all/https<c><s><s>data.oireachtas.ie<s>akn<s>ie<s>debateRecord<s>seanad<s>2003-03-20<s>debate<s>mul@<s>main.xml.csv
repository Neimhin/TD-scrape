#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I have received notice from Senator Norris that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:The need for the Minister for Education and Science to make special provisions to ensure the continuing education of all eligible students at the Conservatory of Music and Drama, Chatham Row, even in circumstances where a restricted budget presented by the Dublin Institute of Technology is accepted, and to consider if the continuing governance of the conservatory by the Dublin Institute of Technology is satisfactory.I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	1	The Order of Business is No. 1, Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003 – Report and Final Stages. There will be a sos from 1.30 p.m. until 2 p.m.I would like to make clear that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, will be present in the House after the Order of Business for the debate on No. 1. He will, however, have to leave at about 4 p.m. as he has to travel to Brussels.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I am looking for clarity from the Leader in respect of No. 1. I do not doubt that she is aware that a statement was issued yesterday by the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service which "strongly recommends, as a matter of urgency, that sufficient time be allowed for further limited hearings to be held, as important areas have been identified in the legislation which the joint committee agrees will need further significant amendment".Given the fact that members – both Senators and Deputies – of the joint committee have given all-party support to the motion, it would be premature to advance to Report Stage when we have not yet seen the significant Government amendments that have been promised. The committee wishes to continue with its hearings before the Dáil considers the legislation and it would be a gross denial of the constitutional position of the House if we were to take Report Stage today. The committee is continuing its work on behalf of the House, which has often heard speeches about the importance of committee work.The joint committee should be permitted to conclude its hearings and I ask the Leader to reconsider the Order of Business in light of the unanimous motion supported by her colleagues, my colleagues and others. If it was acceptable to freeze Report Stage of the Bill last week, it is again acceptable to do so. There is no reason that we should not instead take statements on Iraq in order that all groups in the House could present their views on the matter to the Minister for Foreign Affairs or one of the Ministers of State from his Department. It would be extremely wrong to proceed with Report Stage, given the timely intervention of the joint committee in the form of its unanimous motion.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	3	We need to examine the ordering of our business in the context of Report Stage of the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003. Given the joint committee's unanimous agreement that the Bill requires further significant amendment and the need to ensure the Bill is passed by both Houses by 18 April, the Government should agree to make and accept amendments today. If it does not, we should not waste time by taking Report Stage now. The Government should indicate whether it will either bring forward Report Stage amendments today or whether we can return to the matter when the Bill has been considered by the Lower House. I am a realist and I understand that amendments must be taken. There is no point in our spending the day dealing with issues to which we will be obliged to return.The joint committee has spent two days considering this matter and has adopted a position on the matter. I ask the Leader to recognise that fact. It seems practical that we should defer Report Stage and take it next Tuesday morning, if necessary, in order that the Bill can be sent to the Dáil in its proper form, or that the Government should indicate what it intends to do with the legislation. The Government has indicated that it intends to introduce amendments and we should be informed as to their likely content.There are disturbing reports in this morning's newspapers about a garda in Portlaoise who received compensation for doing his job properly. As the public service vehicles officer, he discovered serious problems with school buses which were being approved for transportation use. When he brought this matter to the attention of certain people, he was bullied and had to leave his job. There are many 25 and 30 year old buses in operation throughout the country, but until now we had been led to believe that age was not an issue because these vehicles are properly maintained. This is a major issue and I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Science to come before the House to reassure Members that checks and balances are in place to ensure children being transported to and from school are safe.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	4	In October 2001 a large number of letters arrived in Leinster House. They were in a large, addressed envelope which was sealed but not franked. However, the letters it contained were franked. Because of the anthrax scare they were taken away by the Garda, opened, kept in its possession and used as evidence to charge a member of the force with a breach of discipline. I understand the charge has been dropped which is the reason I feel free to raise the matter now. I raise it in public because if I was do so in private, I would be liable to the Garda wanting to sequester my telephone records to find out my source. I have to do it this way to ensure any communication I had with a person involved in the matter is privileged.My colleague, Senator O'Meara, was cited in evidence because the letter to her was examined by a Garda handwriting expert who said it was the handwriting of the garda accused of a breach of discipline. Where did the Garda Síochána get the authority to take letters to Members of the Oireachtas and bring them to Garda headquarters for use as evidence in a disciplinary hearing against a member of the force without the knowledge of Members of these Houses? I want to have the matter clarified.Before I come to today's Order of Business, I want to mention Rachel Corrie who was deliberately killed by an Israeli bulldozer in Gaza last week. She was an American peace activist who sat in front of the bulldozer and eyewitness accounts make perfectly clear it was no accident. If it had happened in Baghdad, the world would have been screaming in outrage, quite rightly.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	5	Hear, hear.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	6	It was an outrage against humanity. As long as such incidents happen, there is no moral basis for those who claim to be defending decent values in Baghdad. How can an ally of the United States tolerate the deliberate murder of an innocent peace activist? Accidents can happen and war is rough but this was murder in regard to which we should be prepared to take a moral position. Regrettably, it appears we do not understand the need to take such positions. Murder was perpetrated by what claims to be a democratic government. It is our duty in this House and every other forum to condemn murder.There are no Government amendments to today's business. I note what was said by my two colleagues about the decision of the Oireachtas committee, which I also welcome. The Opposition in this House is willing to accommodate the Government on the issue of Cabinet papers, in respect of which there is an 18 April deadline. I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to the effect that all Stages of No. 3, the Labour Party's Freedom of Information (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, be taken before No. 1. We would agree to the removal from it of all clauses except the one which provides for non-disclosure of Cabinet papers for six years, which would give us 12 months in which to look at these issues. It would leave the Government's position on Cabinet papers untouched and enable us to move on and have a dispassionate discussion about the practicalities of freedom of information, which is what we need. We must reflect what is now the broad consensus of all parties in both Houses of the Oireachtas. Let us deal with the Government's immediate concern, with which I do not agree, but we are prepared to be reasonable. Let us extend the period to six years and allow the calm, dispassionate investigation which began at the joint committee to continue.

Given that this is the view of the all-party committee, I am sure the Minister for Finance and the Government would wish to be reasonable and accept it. I urge the Leader to do likewise and look forward to hearing her response to the points made by Senators Brian Hayes, O'Toole and Ryan. Perhaps Report Stage should be frozen or the Minister for Finance will introduce amendments.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I would like to raise the issue of waste, particularly the waste of time. It will be ridiculous to spend time on a topic that is clearly going to change. If we spend time on this Bill, no result will stem from it. I hope the Leader will respond to my concern about wasting time by accepting one of the amendments to the Order of Business or come to another solution.There are also issues of waste at the Mater Hospital. This probably applies also to every other hospital. Due to budget constraints a number of public service consultants are not working. While being paid, they are standing around with nothing to do. This is happening at the same time that the State is sending public patients to private consultants or abroad for operations. This is ridiculous. I ask the Leader to bring the Minister for Health and Children to the House to debate this waste of public money. This is only one example of what is happening in many hospitals. I will raise this as an Adjournment Matter next week, if necessary.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senator Ryan. I know the Leader has made an attempt to accommodate the many concerns raised by Members on this side of the House – deferral of Report Stage of the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill was an attempt to do this. That the Minister for Finance is prepared to come to the House today is due in no small part to the Leader's efforts. However, in the light of the findings of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service it would be wrong to proceed with Report Stage of the Bill. Presumably, the Dáil will make substantial amendments to it and it will return to the Seanad for rubber-stamping when we will not have an opportunity to debate them in any real way.We have put substantial time and effort into this legislation and the least we are due is the opportunity to peruse Government amendments when they are brought forward. The alternative is that the Government accept all Opposition amendments, particularly those of the Labour Party which reflect the views of the Information Commissioner and would probably go a long way towards meeting the concerns of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service.

This portrays the wrong image of Ireland. We are very proud of our equality legislation. The slogan, "Brits out of Ireland", was also used in the parade. This is not appropriate to the peace process.

The Government Ministers who attend these parades in America should make their displeasure clear. It is astonishing that these people in America, who think they are so Irish by excluding gay Irish people, ignore the fact that parades in Dublin and Cork have welcomed them for years and given them prizes.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	18	As I explained to Senator Browne, we have no control over parades in America.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	19	I understand that. However, we have some moral influence on our Ministers and we can ask the Leader to request Ministers to raise the issue with people when they are marching with them. The Cathaoirleach and Senator Browne are correct in that it was shamefully determined by a court in New York that the parade is controlled by a sectarian organisation which maintains it as an exclusively Roman Catholic festival. That is a pity and it is a contradiction that should be resolved.This is not the most important issue before the House. It appears, and is widely believed, that no amendments will be taken on the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003 today. I hope that is not true.I am astonished that the House, which feels it is relevant to the people, should have spent so little time and given so little mention to the one matter that is uppermost in people's minds across the globe, namely, the Anglo-American attack on Iraq, which is taking place as we speak. It is taking place with our collaboration because we are allowing planes to refuel at Shannon airport and fly through Irish airspace. This is despite the fact that Austria, a neutral country – as Ireland claims to be – has denied the US and UK the right to—

Like many others, I watched television news reports last night. We were informed that three-quarters of the Iraqi army had surrendered, whereas only 17 soldiers had done so. We were then told that Tariq Aziz had been shot trying to escape and that Saddam had been killed. All of these reports were untrue.

The health board housing aid scheme for the elderly has been substantial and successful. Some 1,200 individual projects were carried out by the Western Health Board last year. The scheme has many critics but it should be looked at as a basis for improvements that can be made in relation to housing repairs schemes.

To do so would be an important and timely intervention on the part of the House.Will the Leader ask the Tánaiste to come before the House to discuss the recommendations of the task force on life-long learning? A report launched yesterday highlights the fact that by 2006 there will be a massive increase in the older section of the population. I have always believed that people should not be put on the scrap-heap when they reach 60 years of age. They have much to offer and have great expertise. In the rest of Europe, many elderly people are involved in consultancy work. We should start a serious initiative to underline that we need all the expertise we can get, regardless of the age of the people who provide it.There was a man from Donegal who retired at the age of 60. He went to the shop each day with his dog to buy the newspaper. One day, however, the dog started to take the paper home. The man died the following day. At the gates of Heaven, he asked St. Peter why he had been taken.

I have not yet received the wording of the resolution, but it will be sent to everyone later today. The debate will be as relevant tomorrow – if not more so – as it would have been today.Senator Brian Hayes drew attention to the statement of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service on the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003. He also wondered whether any amendments would be introduced in the House. The Minister is coming before the House later and I know that, as always, he will give a good account of himself. Senator O'Toole joined Senator Hayes in expressing concern about the work of the joint committee. I saw some of last week's hearings, although I did not see yesterday's, and it seems that the committee has done very good work. It is, however, the Minister, the Government and Members of the Houses who have the power to make amendments and not the committees, whose job is to put forward proposals and wait to see whether they are accepted. Although it cannot make amendments, the committee has done terrific work and its members deserve praise.Senator O'Toole asked the Government to indicate the proposed changes and I hope that will happen. He cited 18 April as a deadline for passage of the Bill but, in fact, the Dáil will go into recess on Thursday, 10 April. He also mentioned the PSV officer who did his job to ensure the safety of school buses and asked for the Minister for Education and Science to come into the House to discuss the issue, a debate that would be worthwhile.Senator Ryan asked about the batch of letters that arrived in Leinster House. I received one of them, although I do not know how. Some got one while others did not. I remember it because it was long and detailed. We will endeavour to find out what happened, how they were taken away and then used as evidence. The Senator also raised the issue of Rachel Corrie who was killed by a bulldozer in the Gaza Strip. It is always necessary to highlight such events and continue to condemn them in the strongest fashion. The Senator also suggested the ingenious idea that we take the Labour Party's Freedom of Information (Amendment) No. 2 Bill, stripping it to the six year proposal at its core. Senator O'Meara supported his proposal but that will not happen.

He also alleged that consultants were standing idle for reasons beyond their control.Senator Browne, supported by Senator Norris, raised the issue of the St. Patrick's Day parade in New York which is organised by committees over which we have absolutely no control, mainly the Ancient Order of Hibernians, a fine organisation, and took issue with the fact that gays and lesbians were not allowed to march. They are allowed to march here – fair dues to them – and have every right to do so. Senator Ó Murchú wants us to convey our thanks to the AOH for the courtesy and hospitality afforded to those who travel to New York for the parade each year.Senators Norris, Ross, Tuffy, McHugh and Feighan raised the crisis in Iraq, a very important matter on which we are holding a full debate tomorrow when the topic will get a fine airing. Senator Norris said misinformation was pouring out and he is right – every rumour has 40 legs. I hope the Senators will be present for statements tomorrow.Senator McHugh called for the Tánaiste to come before the House to talk about life-long learning but the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera, is in charge of that agenda. I will invite her to discuss the matter in the House.Senator Kitt called for a debate on housing for the elderly and the work of the Western Health Board. I will try to arrange such a debate.

In page 5, to delete lines 5 and 6.This amendment is effectively to amend the Title of the Bill. Senators will recall from Committee Stage that we tabled this amendment because we felt the Bill was misnamed. It is not a freedom of information Bill because it is intended to restrict the availability of information. It consists of no fewer than several dozen amendments to the original Act, not one of which could be said to expand the amount of information available to people who make requests. We felt very strongly that to call it the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill was a serious misnomer.That view has been confirmed by the way in which the Bill has travelled so far through the House and through the Oireachtas generally. We are being asked today to consider a Report Stage which does not include a single Government amendment, despite press reports in the past week that the Government is considering substantial amendments and we know the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, which has a Government majority, is considering recommending amendments to Government. With that in mind, we move the amendment which deletes the Title of the Bill as it stands.

This is what might be called a wrecking amendment. The Bill could not be called anything else given that it is related to previous legislation.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	72	I second the amendment. To a certain extent I agree with Senator Mansergh that there is some wrecking taking place, but it is being done by the Government. For a long time it hid behind the fact that there were little details that needed to be tidied up, then it hid behind the report of the so-called high level group, and then it pretended that it had informally consulted the Information Commissioner and at least knew his views. We were getting close to de Valera at that stage where the views of everyone could be found by looking into the Government's heart and it really did not need to consult the experts on the legislation because it knew more about it.We now discover that an Oireachtas committee, representative of all parties and with a Government majority, believes the legislation needs substantial amendment. I heard the chairman of that committee speak in a debate in the Dáil in which he said he could find no evidence that any disclosure of anything under the Freedom of Information Act had done the least harm to serious Government business, although it may have.I do not believe it is true of the Minister for Finance. He takes a certain delight when evidence emerges that he has been given advice by officials and done something differently, something on which I commend him. As he has often said, advisers are there to advise, Ministers are there to take responsibility.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	88	The fundamental issue that arises is the determination to ensure that some people, other than the Minister who has no inhibitions about it, would be able to express themselves freely without the fear that someone might find out what they are thinking.In the next six weeks I will correct exams and projects in which I will have to make decisions and serious judgments which will affect people's futures. Some of them will arguably be subjective because there will be no objective criteria. All will determine whether a young person receives a pass or honours degree or, God forbid, fails the exam. Once the exam results are issued, every piece of documentation I have used to make a judgment about a young person will be available to him or her under the Freedom of Information Act. That is quite right.How could it be that something that I find difficult but right is so wrong and difficult for Government that it wants to take that same right away when it applies to it? Our amendment is about stating the purpose of the Bill, namely, protecting Government from the type of scrutiny that is good for both Government and society and is no problem for capable Ministers, such as the Minister for Finance who is more than capable of making up his own mind about many matters, although he is usually wrong, and does not need bureaucratic or legal protections to conceal his capacity for making up his mind and differing from others. Therefore, our amendment essentially says that this is not a freedom of information Bill but a suppression of information Bill and should be so called politically speaking.
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I welcome the Minister on his return to the House and remind Senators that he spoke on Second Stage on 4 March and gave an excellent account of himself. I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, for his work on the Bill and the staff who have been excellent in giving tremendous advice. Tabling an amendment to delete the name of the Bill is nonsensical.Before Senator Ryan departs, I would like to confirm that he lived for some time in a castle in my area. He did not continue with the profession with which he was involved at that time, but I am sure he would have made a great success of it. He has had two or three changes in his life.The Labour Party, which has tried to delete the words "freedom of information" from the Title to the Bill, used those words in the name of a Bill it brought forward in the Dáil recently. If the party is to be consistent, it will accept that the Title to the Bill is a proper one. The Minister has received excellent advice on the Bill from senior officials, who have been dealing with the Principal Act for some time, and he has acted very well. It was small-minded of people to allude to the fact that he had other commitments last week. I served as both a Minister and a Minister of State and I brought forward many Bills for different Ministers at various times. A Minister or Minister of State who is present in the Seanad acts on behalf of the Government. The Minister for Finance, who has made a tremendous input into this legislation, acquitted himself well on Second Stage and he will continue to support it as it passes through the House. The amendment proposed by the Labour Party should be rejected.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	90	I cannot accept the amendment, or any of the similarly worded amendments which propose the deletion of all sections of the Bill other than sections 7, 12, 13, 17, 23 and 24. I outlined the purpose of the Bill on Second Stage and the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, spoke about it on Committee Stage. I will not accept the amendments put down by the Labour Party, as they would, in effect, negative the purpose of the Bill.I wish to comment on a point made by Senator Ryan. When Senator McDowell was a Member of the Lower House, he gave me some credit. He said he enjoyed reading the deliberations of the tax strategy group, for example, because he knew that I would not adopt any of the group's proposals in the budget or the Finance Bill. Senators are aware that I do not have any difficulties in accepting or rejecting advice. The purpose of the Bill, which has been well outlined, would be negated by the Labour Party's first group of amendments, with which I do not agree.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	91	I do not intend to dwell on this matter. The Minister has pointed out that the Labour Party has put down a number of amendments which seek to negative various sections of the Bill. My party does not intend to pursue the earlier amendments at any length, as they were flogged to death on Committee Stage. My party intends to move rapidly through the earlier amendments, with the exception of those which may lead the Minister to make a statement of substance.Senator Leyden alluded to the Cheltenham issue and the Minister mentioned that I shadowed him in the Lower House for five years. I have always been aware that the Minister sought to schedule the Finance Bill at a time that would not inconvenience his trip to Cheltenham. I have never had a problem with that or sought to make an issue of it. I do not mind if the Minister, or anyone else, goes to Cheltenham. I was concerned, however, that no capable Minister was willing to be present for Committee Stage of this manifestly controversial Bill. Such a Minister should have been present to consider accepting amendments and to respond on behalf of the sponsoring Department in a competent way.I do not intend to criticise the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, but it is in the nature of these matters that a Minister of State from another Department, dealing with a Bill such as that before us, cannot have the scope to respond as fully as he might otherwise do. I did not seek to criticise the Minister and I hope he had a profitable week in Cheltenham.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	92	As amendments Nos. 2 and 6 are related, they may be discussed together, by agreement of the House.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	93	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 5, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:"1.–The long title of the Principal Act is amended by substituting "PERSONS". for "MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC".I welcome the Minister for Finance. I made remarks similar to those of Senator McDowell, in relation to the Minister's trip to Cheltenham, on a previous occasion. I have many differences with the Minister, but I can confirm that I have had many meetings with him before 8 a.m. and after midnight. His trip to Cheltenham, which he was perfectly entitled to make, should not be seen as a reflection on his work rate. The time off he took was no more than time in lieu of his efforts and was never an issue for me. I defend the Minister in that regard. Last week's debate was diminished by the references to Cheltenham. As I said to the Minister privately, however, he needed to be in this House for Committee Stage of the Bill, just as one ensures that one's important business is conducted when one is available. My belief that the Minister should have been here last week to deal with the Bill is separate to the Cheltenham issue.I recall making a reference on the Order of Business to freedom of information before the Bill was published. The fact that an amending Bill was to be published was being widely leaked at that time, but its details were not known. I made clear on the Order of Business that I would support a new Bill, although I informed colleagues on the Labour Party benches that I had changed by mind after it was published. I assumed that the legislation would not be controversial and that we would be able to deal with it in an open manner. I said, as far back as 1998, that the five-year period was far too short – I have always felt that it should be increased – so I did not have any difficulties with the new ten-year provision. Similarly, I do not disagree with the idea of charging under certain circumstances. Ordinary citizens seeking information should have it provided to them for free, but those who make ten, 20 or 100 requests each year should not be allowed to clog up the apparatus of the State. I do not have a difficulty with the idea of building a cost into the Bill. I thought these two problems would be addressed in the new Bill, but it deals with other matters.Although the Bill has been considered in the Seanad and the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service for four or five long days in recent weeks, I do not feel that progress is being made. I ask the Minister to respond to the unanimous assertion of the joint committee, which is chaired by Deputy Fleming, that the Bill needs "further significant amendment". I hoped that the committee's statement would be reflected in the Government's amendments today. The Minister has always made clear his views on legislation, while stressing that he is prepared to listen to the opinions of others. He is always willing to take issues on board, argue about details and, if necessary, concede certain points.The Government has to govern, which involves making decisions, but I am not happy with the process it has used in relation to this Bill. There has been a lack of consultation with the users of the Freedom of Information Act. I thought that a certain number of views would be taken into account. I made clear at a meeting of the joint committee that the top level group did precisely what it was asked to do and that the Government was entitled to include the group in the process. The Government was entitled to ask four senior Secretaries General for their views on the Act and to seek advice about aspects of the review. The clear opinions of the civil servants have been published and are available. The focus on the group in some of the commentary on this matter was incorrect.There should have been further consultation, however, after the Department of Finance, which is the sponsoring Department, received the group's report. The Department might have come to the same conclusion as a result of further consideration of the matter, but one would have thought that the users' group would have been consulted. I certainly thought there would have been a requirement to consult the Office of the Information Commissioner. These issues were matters of concern.The joint committee has dealt with aspects of the legislation and I have spent many hours considering the extension of the Bill. Senator McDowell may also have been involved as a Deputy in discussions of the operation of the legislation in each Department and the subsequent report to Government. The user group, the Office of the Information Commissioner and the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service should reasonably have been invited to contribute, but they were not asked for their views. That is what caused the problems last week. What was considered to be an anodyne and simple Bill did not go through in one day as we thought it would.I have gone through the recommendations sent to the Department of Finance by the Information Commissioner. If they were sent after the Bill was published, it may have been too late to take them into consideration, which is why I have tried to reflect the recommendations in my amendments. In order to remove any confusion as to whether the right of access is confined to natural persons, it is suggested that the reference to "members of the public" be changed to "persons". That seems reasonable to the person who has experience in this area and it does not appear to be a great change. It is a technical amendment to tidy up the legislation rather than a matter of principle or a question of policy. Amendment No. 6 is related and seeks to provide that a person shall be construed as importing a body corporate, whether a corporation aggregate or a corporation sole, and an unincorporated body of persons as well as an individual. If I were put to the pin of my collar to argue in favour of the amendments beyond what I have just said, I could not, but they reflect the recommendations of the Information Commissioner. I would appreciate consideration of them by the Minister, given that they do not represent serious changes.The Minister for Finance will receive a report from the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service which will include a summary of what the different groups said to us, as well as the observations I have quoted. I do not doubt the Minister will take on board the comments made. As Senator Ryan said, he will deal with advice as he sees fit in the context of the requirement to make a political decision. On that basis, the Minister will make Report Stage amendments in the Dáil.I am a pragmatist and I recognise the time constraints which mean the Bill must be passed by 18 April. The best way to approach the matter would have been to defer today's business to ensure that the Minister had time to consider his proposed amendments, which could be brought to this House next week before the Bill goes to the Dáil. I have looked at the timetable and, as a member of the joint committee, considered what needs to be done. The Bill will not have been fully considered by the Dáil until 9 April and I realise that a delay here might cause difficulties in that regard. The difficulties are practical, but it would be helpful if the Minister were to confirm that he will consider the information provided by the joint committee and make adjustments in the Dáil. Unless he accepts Opposition amendments today, no adjustments will be made to the legislation here. My only objective is to ensure that effective legislation is produced by the Oireachtas and if the Minister confirms that these matters, which cannot be dealt with today for practical reasons, will be addressed in the Dáil, I will accept his word. It would be useful to be told what the Minister is thinking.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	94	I second the amendment. I endorse the comments of the two previous speakers regarding the amendments under discussion. We broke last week after a long Committee Stage debate under the clear impression that sanity was prevailing at last and that the amendments we put after consultation with interested parties would be taken on board by the Government. We provided the Government with the breathing space to consider the proposals.We have attended the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service where an excellent consultation process has taken place. Representations were made by the National Union of Journalists and the Information Commissioner last week and yesterday by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, the Wheel – a network group for the voluntary and community sector – and the One in Four group. None of these bodies can be regarded as frivolous or vexatious, rather they are serious organisations with legitimate complaints in terms of the thrust and content of this Bill. They worry about the way the amended legislation will affect the fundamental rights established in the 1997 Act.The Government is intent on pushing the Bill through the House today without amendment. I have read in the newspapers that the Taoiseach said he was open to suggested amendments and the Minister for Finance has been quoted as saying he is amenable to sensible suggestions and amendments. However, this House is considering Report and Final Stages of this Bill without making any changes to it.The Bill is circumscribed in terms of the 18 April deadline the Government insists must be met to protect the records which fall to be released after the five-year period set out in the 1997 Act. It would have been logical for the Government to use the seven days provided by this House to bring forward sensible amendments, rather than wait to introduce them on Committee Stage in the Dáil. As has been said by Senator O'Toole, these amendments have to be considered by this House later. We are involved in a legislative process which resembles a game of ping-pong, as the Bill goes from this House to the Dáil before coming back again. It would have made far more sense to streamline the process by bringing in amendments today.As things stand, this debate is a farce and a charade which represents a re-run of Committee Stage. Substantial Government amendments should have been formulated in the time provided for further consideration of the legislation. We could have concentrated on those, rather than regurgitate the amendments we tabled on Committee Stage.I subscribe to the proposals of amendments Nos. 2 and 6. The first seeks to amend the Long Title of the Bill to remove any confusion as to whether the right of access is confined to natural persons. The term "members of the public" should be changed to "persons". The Minister could make a gesture of recognition of this House by accepting this sensible technical amendment. Amendment No. 6 represents a sensible suggestion by the Information Commissioner who says a definition of person in line with the Interpretation Act 1937 should be incorporated into this section of the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003 without reference to contrary intention. The word "person" should be construed as importing a body corporate, whether a corporation aggregate or a corporation sole, and an unincorporated body of persons as well as an individual.In view of the fact that the commissioner feels slighted by the failure to consult him with regard to the proposed legislation, the amendment should be made as a gesture of courtesy. The commissioner made an excellent presentation to the joint committee and provided an insightful commentary on Bill and its weaknesses as well as on the deficiencies of the 1997 Act. The Minister might deign to take the amendments on board.

A specific point arose on Committee Stage last week when the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, conceded that there could be confusion during the course of the process of a request as to who had made the request or the ownership of any information that might come about as a result of the request. The possibility was raised that a newspaper such as the Irish Independent or The Sunday Tribune might make a particular request but because they are corporations, they do not appear to have any status in regard to the Act as it currently stands. In order to remove any confusion that might arise, the commissioner suggested that corporations be included in the definition of persons in the legislation. This is the normal practice in regard to legislation, specifically in regard to the Interpretation Act.

Senator O'Toole appears to want to consult everyone: the user's groups; the commissioner; and everyone else. However, the last entity he wants to consult is the Government. As far as I am concerned, it is the Government and the Minister who decided on the Bill that is before the House.

Senator McDowell referred to the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern. He acquitted himself very well, as did his staff, and I wish to make that quite clear. Each Opposition amendment was considered and responded to in a detailed manner. It was clear that they were informed about the Bill and they defended it well.The Minister is in the House now and he will take into consideration all the points that have been made. There is no reason he should not do so. In due course, and in consultation with his officials, he may decide to make some amendments. That is his right and that is in order.

While it was good to be able to deal with a senior official who could respond in the appropriate manner, I still fundamentally disagree with him making comments in regard to a Bill that is before the Oireachtas. His job was to comment on the Act and its workings and not on legislation that is being considered by the House. That is a fact. While it may not be possible to sack him, he is not above criticism. As far as I can see there is nothing in the Act that could threaten his position. He is acquitting himself well.

#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	113	I regret that we got off to such a bad start with Report Stage. I fully expected to come in this morning and find that the Government had put down amendments to the Bill. The Minister was not in a position to hear the views of the high-level review group or the commissioner who addressed the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, although I am sure he has read what they said. I assure him that they were extremely impressive.It is unfortunate that we are not trying to make some progress with the Bill by accepting, for example, the amendment before us – tabled by me, Senator O'Toole and others – particularly in view of the fact that it only suggests that it would be better if we kept in line with the Interpretation Act 1937, regarding a definition, rather than proposing something novel. I regret that these amendments do not seem to find favour.One good thing which has come out of the debate is that more people know about the Office of the Information Commissioner. One group of people who had problems with what they felt were repeated and sometimes vexatious requests had sought legal advice in the past, whereas they could have just referred these requests to the office of the commissioner who performs a very valuable service for all of us.The question in regard to persons is only a matter of clarification. Perhaps I am being pessimistic in thinking the Minister will not accept the amendments.

It would help the debate, once the preliminaries are over, if we concentrate on the merits or otherwise of each of the amendments rather than going around the houses on every particular issue. I intend to approach this debate in a rational and reasonable manner. These amendments appear to be quite reasonable technical amendments, but the Minister may have a more informed view of the matter.I do not share the view of my colleague, Senator Leyden, in regard to the Information Commissioner. He has done a service by giving us his views, which is not to say that I find all the points he makes of equal cogency. We should respect independent officers of the State, who are very important to our democracy, and be slow to criticise them. Our interest is to get the best possible legislation and reasonable inputs from any source are to be welcomed.The merit of having the Minister present is that he can listen to the debate and then make his decision, which may be now or later. We should have a reasoned debate and not reject amendments simply because they have been made by the Information Commissioner. He is a fine public servant and I suspect that at least some of his suggestions have merit. I hope the Minister will suppress any annoyance he may have about the intervention in the debate and take each of these suggestions on its merits because the interest that we should all share is to have the best possible legislation.
#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	115	I am honoured and delighted to be a member of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service. As a new Senator, I feel I am getting the opportunity to fully participate in good Government.I agree with what Senator Mansergh said about the Office of the Information Commissioner. During his attendance at the committee last week, Mr. Murphy educated Members from all parties. Before we heard him, many people were not really clear about what the Bill contained. There are other groups that are making a major contribution as well. However, representatives of groups such as One in Four and the NUJ who appeared before the committee used Mr. Murphy's document and their contributions have been extrapolated from it.Mr. Murphy attended an earlier committee meeting in his capacity as Ombudsman when he took on the Revenue Commissioners in regard to the taxation allowances of widows' pensions. There would not have been any redress for them but for his defence of this more vulnerable group in society. I am a member of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service and while I am not defending his apparent challenge to the Bill, Mr. Murphy's contribution was relevant and helpful. We are privileged to have a man of his calibre holding these positions. He told us he had been a public servant for over 40 years. I believe in the public service and know that public servants have to be visionary and entrepreneurial, just as business people must be. I could see that Kevin Murphy had the courage to speak out.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I will not accept these amendments. The Interpretation Act 1937 provides that in the absence of contrary intention, "person" includes the body corporate. The advice of the Attorney General is that the long title of the Freedom of Information Act which refers to members of the public contains such a contrary intention. The Act provides a right of access to records for natural persons, namely, individuals. In practice, this has not given rise to any substantial difficulties. While bodies corporate are not natural persons, it is nevertheless open to any individual within a body corporate to make a FOI request for any information in an individual capacity.These linked amendments would provide for the words "MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC" to be replaced by the word "PERSONS" in the long title of the principal Act while the definition of the word "person" in section 2 would be changed to state, in effect, that "person" means a body corporate, an unincorporated body of persons and an individual. With due respect, enshrining in law the definition of the word "person" in terms of three different, yet apparently equal categories would carry the risk of creating confusion. For this reason we have been advised by the Office of the Attorney General not to proceed with the amendments.The example was given in a previous debate of a journalist who makes a request while working for a newspaper and then leaves to work freelance, or with another newspaper, before a final decision is made on the request. When the public body comes to release the information, the journalist may claim he or she made the request in a personal capacity, while his or her former employer may claim it made the request. We must bear in mind that the period between the making of a request and the final decision can be substantial, particularly if it involves a subsequent review by the Information Commissioner. The public body has no way of knowing whether the journalist was requested to make the request by an editor or if it was made in a personal capacity, nor would it be possible or appropriate for the body to ascertain what went on between an editor and a journalist in an effort to establish which of them made the request.By taking the view, based on legal advice, that the Act confers a right of access on natural persons, there is clarity as to the ownership of the information. Our advice is that the amendments could create legal confusion that would give rise to practical difficulties for public bodies.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	117	The example offered by the Minister was discussed at some length last week and I do not agree with it. The person whose name is on the application is the one to whom we are relating. I do, however, see the point the Minister raised in the earlier part of the argument. I can see that having a triple interpretation of the word "person" could cause confusion which was not my intention. I do not fully understand the legal implications beyond this. I was aware of the 1937 Act and of the view the amendment supported what was contained in it. What the Minister has said has created confusion about this interpretation. He has clearly stated this is the Attorney General's position against whom I will not pit myself on legal issues. I reluctantly accept there is a significant intellectual legal argument against accepting the amendment and that I will have to consider my position on it.I must say everything three times before Senator Leyden gets the message. Consultation is not about decision-making or being co-governed. There is only one Government which seeks, takes and listens to advice. I said the Government was entitled to seek the view of the Secretaries General which it received following which the Department of Finance should have consulted the users group, the Information Commissioner and the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service. I then said that having dealt with this, the Government should have made up its mind. This is the way it should and has to be. This is the nature of consultation. I am often on the other side of the fence. Someone has to make a decision. While there can be a great team, a leader must take a decision. Having listened to what the Minister said, I will not press the amendments.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	118	I move amendment No. 4:
In page 5, to delete lines 10 to 28.There is a definition section in the Bill where the only part of concern to us is the definition of the words "factual information". We had a lengthy debate last week as to what was comprehended by the definition and specifically discussed the tax strategy group papers referred to by the Minister. In my experience of dealing with the Department of Finance, I have found it has benefited hugely from the implementation of the Act. Most of its officials are quite happy to have their advice revealed to the public and discussed in an open fashion.The tax strategy group papers are as good an example as one can get. The Minister has given an exemplary lead to some of his colleagues in his willingness to admit that he disagrees with some of the advice given to him. He quite properly points to the division of responsibilities between him as the deciding individual, on behalf of the Government, and those who give him advice. This is healthy and has been good for the Department. It does not reflect badly on its officials or the Minister and is something we all have an interest in seeing pursued.Last week I sought an assurance from the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, that tax strategy group papers would be released in future. He did not feel able to give this assurance. Will the Minister assure the House that the new definition of the words "factual information" will include the tax strategy papers?
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	119	I second the amendment.

There is no reason the tax strategy group papers will not be released.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	121	I take this as being the assurance for which I was looking. On the face of it, the papers could easily be covered by the amendments to section 19 and others that deal with the deliberative process. For example, some Departments insist the Estimates process never ends. They forever go to the Department of Finance and will not accept an issue has been finally dealt with, or the deliberative process is over, for a long time. I was anxious to ensure the tax strategy group papers would not be part of this, caught by virtue of the deliberations of Government, or the amendments made by later sections, particularly section 12.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	122	As the Senator knows, even in the tax strategy group papers, anything that relates to an ongoing process is deleted before the documents are released. While I cannot remember what the latest tax strategy group papers included or excluded, I am sure they contained sections that were blanked out. The tax strategy group papers were never released in total if they referred to on-going deliberations. That continues to be the situation.

In page 5 between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:"(d) in the definition of ‘request to which section 29 applies,' by substituting ‘28(5)(a)' for ‘28(5)'.”.I must refer to my new best friend, the Information Commissioner, for this recommendation.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I second the amendment. As Senator Henry pointed out, the Information Commissioner made this recommendation. It is specifically intended to take any reference to 28(5)(b) out of the Act in so far as there is no reference to public interest therein. It is intended primarily as a cleaning up exercise.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	128	This amendment, which has been suggested by the Information Commissioner, is not being accepted. It would mean, in effect, that a public body would not be obliged to consult with a person prior to making a final decision to release the personal information of that person to some other person, where a public body has decided it would benefit the individual to release the information concerned. It is not clear why a public body should not be obliged to consult in such circumstances. We are, after all, talking about the release of someone's personal information, albeit in circumstances where the public body has decided the release would benefit the individual concerned. The principal Act clearly envisaged that it is appropriate to consult in such circumstances and I have not seen any convincing argument from the Information Commissioner or otherwise why this should not continue to be the case.

This would allow the Minister, by regulation, to add further Acts of the Oireachtas which are automatically overridden and therefore extend the benefits of the original Act.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	132	I will not accept this amendment which would empower the Minister for Finance to allow for provisions in other enactments that authorise or require the non-disclosure of records in the Third Schedule to the Freedom of Information Act. The effect of including the provision in the Third Schedule is that the FOI Act overrides provisions where requests are made under that Act.My opposition to this amendment is based on legal advice. I would prefer not to refer to the detail of that advice, but it is safe to say the regulations which effectively seek to modify the original enactment must be used with caution. I am also conscious of a mechanism within the FOI Act for reviewing the operation of secrecy provisions and other enactments and this mechanism is devolved to the Houses of the Oireachtas. Subsection (2) of section 32 of the principal Act conveys specific functions to the joint committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas to review the operational provisions in enactments and authorise or require the non-disclosure of records with a view to recommending their amendment or repeal, or their inclusion in the Third Schedule to the FOI Act.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	133	Anybody listening to these deliberations would be at pains to understand what we are talking about.When the Act was being drawn up in 1997, there were concerns about various detailed provisions in other Acts which limit the availability of information. The purpose in drawing up a Third Schedule to the Act at that stage was to draw up a list of enactments which effectively were automatically overridden by the Act.The Minister is reluctant to reveal the legal advice which underpins his rejection of the amendment. That puts me in some considerable difficulty but there is no apparent reason why we should not look to update and extend that list of enactments as it seems appropriate to Ministers.The Minister rightly points out that the power to review is vested in the Oireachtas, which is fair enough. However, he was also quick to point out last week that the ultimate power of decision-making was his, so it seems there is a contradiction. Therefore, it seems appropriate that the Minister should exercise his discretion and make his judgment to broaden the basis of the original Act by adding to the enactments in the Third Schedule.

#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	137	This seeks to delete section 3 of the Bill, which relates to the head of a particular Department delegating to an official lower down in the hierarchy of the Civil Service the power to make a decision. My understanding is that, in most Departments, this is delegated to principal officers in charge of particular sections.The requirement of the current Act is that this must be printed in Iris Oifigiúil and we all accepted last week during a lengthy debate that it is not practical to ask a Secretary General to do that on every occasion. We also felt it important that people understand who is making a decision and is responsible in a particular section or Department for making a decision. We also felt that, if one makes an application, one individual will deal with it, that there will be no change of horses in mid-stream and that one will not end up with another individual making a decision at the end of the process. All of that requires that the public, when making requests, should know who will make a decision. There should be a list of individuals who are dealing with requests and the sections for which they are responsible. This need not necessarily be in Iris Oifigiúil but should be available to the public in some form. As far as I recall, the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, suggested that he would be willing to place some obligation on Secretaries General to ensure that there was such a list available to the public when they are making a request.
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	138	We discussed this matter in great detail on Committee Stage. Iris Oifigiúil seems to be a redundant publication as far as I can see. No one in the House has a copy of it or knows where to obtain it. It used to be circulated some years ago but it is now the last place someone who wanted to find an information officer would look. The simplest way to do so is through the telephone directories. I looked up some of the county councils and health boards and some of them listed their FOI officer, which is a good way of getting information across. If one wants to find out, one rings the organisation in question and asks who the information officer is.When I was chairman of the Western Health Board, it took the FOI legislation seriously. A senior programme manager was assigned to the area of freedom of information who reported each year to the local authority on the progress and developments of the activities of the Act as it applied to the health board. The same applies to most local authorities. The Bill is adequate in this regard. Therefore, the amendment should not be pressed. Nearly every organisation has a website and lists its FOI officer. The information is therefore easiest to obtain from the organisations themselves. The information needs to be listed in an active medium such as websites or telephone directories rather than in Iris Oifigiúil, which people do not know where to find.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	139	I fully agree on Iris Oifigiúil as a document not in widespread circulation. I have never set eyes on it. However, it is looked upon as a kind of bible – beautiful in terms of knowledge of what is happening, what decisions have been taken and who is responsible for what. Are we to abandon it? I take the point that nowadays we have websites and telephones and that one can look at a local authority handbook or find out at health board level who is responsible for something. However, from the point of view of the original intention of the 1997 Act, what is wrong with publication in Iris Oifigiúil? People may not have ready access to it but what would be lost by doing this? While I mentioned that as a Member of this House I have never seen a copy, I cannot see any reason for not doing this.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	140	I hear all the explanations about looking up the freedom of information officer in the telephone book but that is not necessarily the person who correlated the information. In a big organisation some of this work will have to be farmed out to others. I cannot understand the reason the Minister cannot accept this for the sake of transparency and accountability. The head of any public body found to have ignored the subsection should be accountable to the commissioner. That is the reason Senator O'Toole and I brought forward this amendment.

As I said last week, freedom of information requests are dealt with by the sections to which they relate. I cannot see the value of what is being proposed. I am saying this as somebody who, when I was a civil servant, was on the circulation list of Iris Oifigiúil, which normally consisted of one person – me.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	142	I will not accept an amendment to retain the requirement for notice of a delegation under section 4(5) of the principal Act to be published in Iris Oifigiúil. Details of the delegations made by the heads of bodies that come under the Freedom of Information Act are published in the annual report of the Minister as detailed under section 15 of the principal Act. Also, as set out under section 15 of the Act, each public body is required to publish details of the arrangements made by it enabling a person to obtain access to records held by it and exercise his or her other rights under the Act. Such details include the names and designations of persons or staff responsible for carrying out such arrangements. The Department of Finance also has on its website a regularly updated list of FOI officers in all public bodies, plus contact details, which is made available in hard copy to anyone who requests it. Individual public bodies may also publish contact details on the Internet or make such details available on request.In this context, it is clear that the requirement for public notice of a delegation made by the head of a public body in Iris Oifigiúil is of questionable value. I understand the purpose of substitute amendment No. 9 to which Senator Henry refers is to hold the head of a public body to account to the Information Commissioner for failing to comply with the requirement of public notice as set out under section 4(5) of the principal Act. While I have explained the reason it is proposed to remove the requirement to publish such a notice, I am not sure that it is necessary to single out a particular provision of the Act in this way. The principal Act contains provisions to ensure the effective monitoring of compliance with the Act generally or any particular provision or provisions, for example, the powers of the Information Commissioner as set out under section 36 whereby he or she can carry out an investigation at any time into the practices and procedures adopted by a public body or public bodies generally for the purpose of compliance with the Act generally or any of its provisions.Senator Henry will be pleased to know that section 3 which removes the requirement for the head of a body to cause notice of a delegation to be published in Iris Oifigiúil was recommended by the Information Commissioner, Mr. Murphy, in his submission in February.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	143	I move amendment No. 10:
In page 5, to delete lines 31 to 33 and in page 6, to delete lines 1 to 10.This, the first substantive amendment we have reached, proposes to delete section 4 of the Bill which redefines what constitutes personal information. The Minister will doubtless be aware that this is causing considerable concern. I am particularly concerned about the comments of the leader of the One in Four group who said that much of the information on files held by health boards relating to people who had suffered abuse in the past would not be available under the new Bill.It is also very unclear from where the demand for this change has come. Reading the records of the committee's meeting last week, I noticed that it did not really deliberate on this section, nor did it see it as something with which it wanted to interfere. It is also clear, recalling the comments of the Taoiseach in the Lower House the week before last, that he did not know that the Bill contained a substantial redefinition of what amounted to personal information. There is no doubt that if we accept the redefinition of personal information, much information previously available to individuals and that concerns them personally will simply not be available in the future. The files must now contain personal information rather than relate to a person. There is no doubt that a huge amount of information will now be precluded from release in a way that was not the case heretofore. This amendment is a substantive one and I ask the Minister to give it some consideration.

I am not convinced there is an enormous difference between them or any difference at all. Both require some interpretation in individual instances. I find it difficult to agree that a substantial change is being proposed.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	145	I second Senator McDowell's amendment. This is an important matter. Like Senator McDowell, I read what the Taoiseach said about this Bill not affecting individuals. I am sure the Minister has heard from those who were victims of abuse within various institutions. As we spoke at great length about this on Committee Stage, I will not delay the House but there is a huge difference between files that contain information and those that relate to a person. As I said on Committee Stage, the Government is trying to make it more difficult for individuals to obtain information on themselves which may be extraordinarily important. One of the good things about the Freedom of Information Act was that people were able to obtain information that related to themselves. Others are also extremely anxious because they believe they will not be able to get hold of files that may contain mistakes in personal information. I support Senator McDowell's amendment.
#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	146	On a point of procedure, last week a meeting of the Seanad took place while the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill was being debated at the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service. It would have been more appropriate, from a procedural point of view, if the Seanad had not met and we had discussed FOI in the committee because I could not be in two places at once. It did not make sense.I listened yesterday to Mr. Colm O'Gorman, the director of One In Four. He feels passionately about abuse, saying that 27% of Irish people have been sexually abused. I do not know if that figure is correct – it would mean 1 million people had been abused on the island.It is important that we clarify the terminology used, particularly in light of Mr. Murphy's comment that it is clear that records which relate to personal information, as currently provided for, encompass a broader category than those which contain personal information. It is important to reassure One In Four that all people who have been abused have access to this information. If the word "contains" covers every application by a young person trying to delve into records, that is fine. However, a satisfactory answer to Mr. O'Gorman's questions was not put forward at yesterday's meeting.The Government taking responsibility for the claims of abused children was one of its greatest achievements because the institutions operated under the State. I do not agree with the Opposition's questioning of that position. This is an emotional issue for people to discuss and we should reassure the group that the proposal before us will not affect them. If that is the case, we can leave it but I do not believe it is satisfactory. No one at yesterday's meeting could say if it would have this effect.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	147	I attended yesterday's meeting and I was impressed with the case put forward by One In Four. Presumably, as a very well organised group, it has legal advice and knows exactly what it is saying. This group has acquitted itself in a responsible manner and, as head of the group, Mr. O'Gorman has won admiration for the non-confrontational manner in which he has dealt with this issue. He made the following point yesterday:Such an amendment will certainly result in people seeking to validate the truth of traumatic experiences as children being unable to get access to records and files currently available under the 1997 Act. It is an essential part of the healing process for people abused in childhood to be able to reclaim their stories, to name what was done to them. Often health and social care or educational flies will contain information essential to that process. Such files may not be specific to the person concerned but may refer to the institution, professional or authority involved or responsible for the abuse.He proceeded to say:Whilst the impact of the proposed amendment is perhaps most evident in relation to those of our citizens abused in industrial schools and institutions, it will, in our opinion, have similar effects on people abused in other settings. Let us take, for example, a case involving a woman sexually abused at the age of seven by a health care professional. In her 40s this woman began to feel a need to address what had happened to her. However, given her age at the time of the abuse and the nature of what happened, it was difficult for her to put words to her experiences. She found herself questioning her memories and indeed her sanity, she became depressed and suicidal. Finally, she heard that others had reported similar abuse perpetrated by the same alleged offender; she also discovered that health board files existed that might contain information relevant to her case. She made a complaint to the gardaí but following a DPP decision there is to be no prosecution in her case. She is now left feeling dismissed and disbelieved and is again depressed and suicidal.Under the current legislation she might well be able to get access to health board files that will validate her memories and experiences. Then, with appropriate therapeutic support, she can move through this experience and work towards her recovery.If the amendment is adopted this woman will not be allowed access to such files as they will not name her directly but they clearly may contain information relevant to her. We believe this woman has a right to such information and such cases powerfully demonstrate why a robust freedom of information process is essential.The group has put forward this opinion on the basis of strong legal advice because it is a responsible organisation and has genuine and well-founded concerns in relation to the consequences of the amendment.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	148	The purpose of this provision is not to restrict information, but to achieve clarity. The meaning of the term "relate to" in section 6(5)(b) of the principal Act has already been the subject of an appeal under the Freedom of Information Act to the High Court in the case of E. H. v. the Information Commissioner. My officials have summarised a copy of the High Court judgment, but Senator McDowell is a lawyer who makes a good fist of tax matters and legal judgments in the House. If the Senator and his good legal friend who advises him can come to a clear position on what Mr. Justice O'Neill meant and if he can provide me with a clear synopsis of the judgment and of how it is to be interpreted, I will recommend the Department of Finance pays him a fee.The relevant official from my Department has done a great job summing up what he thinks the judgment means and I hope Senator McDowell arrives at the same interpretation. The purpose of this section is to clarify the situation. In his submission to the committee, Mr. O'Gorman was not too clear either. In his statement he said he could not get the information under the existing process. This new section is designed to bring a degree of clarity as a result of the High Court decision.According to my summary, in the view of the High Court the test to be applied to determine if a record relates to personal information is whether there is a sufficiently substantial link between the requester's personal information, as defined in the Act, and the record in question. My officials have decided that the determining factors identified by the court were the circumstances in which the record was created, the purposes behind the creation of the record – particularly if it was created with the affairs of the individual in question in mind, notwithstanding the fact that the record may not specifically mention or refer to that individual – and what was in the mind of the author at the time of creation of the record, particularly if the requester was in the mind of the author.Senator Mansergh has paid attention to what was said – he may even have read the judgment – and he is not too clear about it either. I have worked closely with Senator Mansergh for a number of years, and there is no clearer mind in deciphering decisions of courts and experts. I have often preferred to obtain the opinion of Senator Mansergh than many of the legal experts to whom I have paid large fees. This is the best we can make of that particular judgment.It was clearly provided in the Freedom of Information Act 1997 that people could seek personal details and records dating as far back as they wished. In other areas, information could only be sought from the date of the implementation of the Act. A difficulty arose from this particular court case, however, and nobody is too clear now as to the current situation. The section I am seeking to introduce is designed bring about some degree of clarity and certainty to the situation regarding personal information. Suppose, for example, a file related to events 40 years ago. How can anybody determine what was in the mind of the author at the time that record was created? That is the type of difficulty raised in the High Court judgment.When dealing with requests for personal records, many of which can be years or even decades old, it is obviously extremely difficult for decision makers to determine, among other things, what was in the mind of the author at the time of the creation of the record. Such a lack of clarity carries the potential for confusion and inconsistent application. When dealing with requests for personal information, it is very important that decision makers and members of the public have a clear understanding as to what information is available.Section 2 of the 1997 Act contains a definition of personal information, and the Bill in no way alters this very comprehensive definition. It provides that personal information means information about an identifiable individual that, in the ordinary course of events, would only be known to the individual or family and friends of the individual; or information that is held by a public body on the understanding that it would be treated as confidential. Without prejudice to the generality of these two conditions, the definition then goes on to list comprehensive categories of information that are to be considered personal information. These include information relating to the educational history of the individual. By replacing "relate to" with "contain", a decision maker would examine this definition of personal information and satisfy himself or herself that a record meets the definition, rather than having to decide whether a record relates to personal information. The latter exercise entails extremely difficult, if not impossible, mental gymnastics. The phrase "relate to" is considered too vague a formulation when dealing with decisions relating to personal information on individuals.This is a desperately complicated area. The purpose of section 4 of the amendment Bill is to achieve greater clarity. In seeking clarity, we seem to have created greater confusion. The situation in this area is incomprehensible at present, and as Mr. Colm O'Gorman pointed out yesterday, some information cannot be obtained at present anyway. As a result of the High Court decision, public bodies are left to interpret the law every which way, which is very unsatisfactory.

We are replacing a situation where discretion must be used with a situation which, I accept, has greater clarity. Whether or not it is the Minister's intention, however, the effect of this will be to restrict the availability of some records. Mr. O'Gorman simply pointed to the types of records which he felt could—

That has to be a broader category of information than records that simply contain personal information. It leaves an extra bit of discretion to decision makers.

#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	153	This is not unusual in the Bill. It is full of subjective tests. The Bill requires decision makers to make decisions all the time as to what is in the public interest, for example. That is not clearly defined, so there is discretion. Decision makers must exercise discretion all the time. The area of personal information is one in which decision makers should be encouraged to exercise their discretion fairly liberally and to err on the side of releasing information. The thrust of the whole 1997 Act, after all, is to encourage the release and sharing of information. Section 4 of the new Bill would restrict information.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	154	I move amendment No. 12:
In page 6, to delete lines 20 to 47.We had a lengthy discussion on this provision on Committee Stage. This is the "neither confirm nor deny" provision which is extended to several sections of the Bill. I move the amendment simply to allow the Minister an opportunity to give us the benefit of his speaking note. In conversation with his officials they explained to me very specific provisions which they intended to catch. It would be useful to have it outlined that that is the intention.The problem is not what the officials told me but what the Bill does. For example, it allows for all measure of information that might be in the consideration of the person making the decision commercially sensitive to be withheld. There is a problem in so far as it appears to allow the decision maker a broad definition in neither confirming nor denying that there is a particular record. How far does the Minister see this extending?

That provision is already contained in the existing Act but this section would extend the areas where the refusal to confirm or deny that there is a record would apply, to the three new areas of commercially sensitive information, personal information and matters dealing with legal affairs.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	159	The purpose of the section is to ensure that where there is a refusal to confirm or deny the existence or non-existence of a record, the provisions of section 19, 20 or 21 of the Bill are invoked. Public bodies are not obliged to disclose the existence or non-existence of such a record in a notification to a requester. The amendment is consequential on amendments proposed to sections 19, 20 and 21. The Senator proposes to delete section 6.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	160	My concern – I appreciate the Minister's forbearance in hearing it – is that this allows decision makers a huge breadth of discretion in neither confirming nor denying that there is a particular record. While I know the section is intended to cover particular cases, I would like the Minister to outline what he considers those cases to be, rather than allow a section to stand without explanation as to what it is intended to do. As I have applied my mind to framing an amendment in a way which would restrict discretion, I know it is difficult. However, it is important to outline what the section is intended to do.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	161	The existing Act provides for four exclusions and it is now proposed to add a further three – personal records, commercially sensitive information and confidential information. The problem is one of definition. How does one define what comes within these additional categories? Why were they not included in the original legislation in 1997? What has happened in the meantime to bring about a sea change in Government thinking in order that these three areas are being added as further exclusions to the original four?
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	162	The ordinary running of the Act is what has happened in the meantime. It was agreed in 1997 that it would be reviewed after a number of years. Problems have arisen with various sections. The Senator has referred to the difficulty of deciding such matters. Senator McDowell, for example, asked who decided in the public interest. All of these matters are subjective to some extent.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	163	I move amendment No. 13:
In page 7, paragraph (c), line 10, after “requester” to insert “made within the previous 24 months”.This also arises from a discussion on Committee Stage. The Bill, as formulated, allows a decision maker to take into account the fact that a requester has not paid a fee in the past and on this basis not to respond to a request. On Committee Stage we sought to constrain that period to 12 months and are now extending it to 24 months. The amendment proposes that failure to pay a fee within the previous 24 months should be taken into account. However, there should be a cut-off point in order that a failure to pay a fee many years previously would not be taken into account.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	164	I second the amendment.

I am not convinced there are grounds for restricting the period of time, to 12, 24 or some other period, for which a public body can invoke the provision whereby failure to pay a fee properly charged under freedom of information can constitute grounds for the refusal of a request. This would serve unduly to restrict a public body in taking unreasonable behaviour into account. The payment of fees is a requirement under the Freedom of Information Act and it is only correct that a failure or previous failure to pay a fee should constitute grounds for the refusal of a request, regardless of when that failure occurred.The amendment concerns section 10 of the principal Act which contains a "may refuse" rather than a "shall refuse" exemption. The head of a public body will continue to be able to exercise discretion before deciding to refuse a request because a previous fee owed to the body had not been paid by the requester.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	166	The question of the payment of fees arose yesterday during a presentation to the joint committee by Wheel which represents several voluntary organisations. The imposition of a flat fee would cause considerable difficulties for voluntary and philanthropic organisations on which it would impose a considerable cost. What would be the level of the fee?

I suggest that fees be waived for unemployed persons, pensioners, students doing research and those who have been abused. The NUJ in its submission to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service objected to the charging of fees. I do not object to people who work in the media being obliged to pay fees because newspapers or other media companies can pay them. I have also considered the position of freelance journalists who can include fees paid in their record of expenses.The provision of a waiver for the four groups mentioned is a serious issue. The NUJ made a strong case that it should not have to pay fees but I do not agree with its argument.

When the State imposes fees, there is usually provision for them to be waived or reduced for those in various categories not in a position to afford them. I would also include students of journalism among those categories. I agree with the Senator. I see no reason whatsoever mainstream journalistic organisations should not pay such fees. They are normally well able to do so.

Regarding the general question of fees, they will be reasonable fees and will be regulated. I take on board what Senators have said about various categories. However, it is my experience in all areas of public life that when something is free, it is abused. Senator Higgins comes from a part of the country I know well and he will agree with me on this point. There are various categories of services available from the State that are absolutely free. If there was a minimal charge—
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	172	Nominal.

I am strongly of that principle – Senator McDowell is not, as I know from the Dáil. Services that are free in the public service tend to be abused. That is my overriding raison d'être in all these areas. Anything that is free will be simply abused, not just in Ireland but throughout the world.

In page 7, between lines 31 and 32 to insert the following8.–Section 12 of the Principal Act is amended in subsection (2)(b)(ii) by the insertion after “concerned” of “which, in the opinion of the head, would be likely to result in significant impairment of the rights of the copyright holder”.This is a technical amendment that arises out of the Information Commissioner's report at page 76. Section 12 of the original FOI Act sets out the way in which copies can be provided to requesters, normally by photocopy. The commissioner points out that, technically, copyright could be infringed in many of theses cases. There is a lot of information technically covered by copyright. The commissioner suggested an amendment of the original Act to oblige the decision-maker to refuse only in circumstances where the copyright holder would be in some way financially endangered. I imagine that would be in a small number of cases. This is a technical amendment which I hope the Minister will accept.

I note it suggests a similar amendment with a view to limiting the ability of a public body to refuse access to records, in a particular form or manner, where doing so would involve an infringement of copyright. This amendment raises an important legal issue as to whether or not a public body can effectively infringe copyright in certain circumstances. It is not clear that any substantial difficulties have arisen in relation to this area.What we are discussing here is the form in which access to the records is given, not whether access to the record should be given. The Government is reluctant to put public bodies in the position of having to decide whether an actual breach of copyright involves a financial loss to or might represent an impairment of the right to a third party. Such issues are not easy for public bodies to decide and there is an obvious need for caution here, given the potential for litigation.

I assume the experience is that copyright has been technically infringed by public bodies in circumstances where nobody objected. He is simply looking to provide cover to the public bodies in circumstances like that by requiring that copyright be infringed in such a way that causes loss. I would ask the Minister to look at this again on the other Stages in the Dáil.

In page 8, between lines 38 and 39 to insert the following:12.–Section 17 of the Principal Act is amended in subsection (5) by the deletion of "under this Act".This refers to the Information Commissioner's report and deals with section 17 of the original Act. It allows requesters to require the amendment of records in circumstances where records become available outside of the FOI Act. The commissioner points out in his report that some records become available because of requests made under section 7 of the Act. There is a provision that allows requesters to require the amendment of personal information held about them by public bodies. In circumstances where they might obtain information outside the specific provisions of this Act, there is no such provision available to them and they cannot require the amendment of those records. The commissioner suggests that we should amend the Act to allow for that to happen. This is the purpose of this amendment.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	183	I second the amendment.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	184	I understand that this amendment is related to the Information Commissioner's comments on pages 76 and 77. Accepting this amendment would provide a right under FOI to have a record containing personal information amended where release of the record concerned is provided for outside the scope of the Act. The FOI Act does not apply to records that are already available through other means. This principle is enshrined in section 46(2) which provides that the Act does not apply to records that are already available through other channels. Such records can be made available on an administrative or statutory basis, completely separate from the FOI Act. This amendment has the potential to interfere with and complicate the mechanisms that exist for the supply and, where relevant, the amendment of personal information outside the terms of the FOI Act.The Land Registry has raised concerns over this proposal. It holds 3 million public records, particularly folios and maps, to which section 46(2) applies. It operates under two pieces of legislation – the Registration of Title Act 1964 and Land Registration Rules 1972, both of which provide a mechanism for the correction of errors and consequent amendment of the register on production of the necessary proofs.If this amendment were to be implemented the Land Registry would require an exemption for the registers maintained under the Registration of Title Act 1964, thereby ensuring requests for amendment of the register be dealt with under the Registration of Title Act as heretofore rather than the FOI Act. In summary, this amendment would complicate the principle whereby requests for records and amendments of records are dealt with under FOI where appropriate or under legislation or mechanisms and extend the Act into areas where it was not intended.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	185	I accept the thrust of the Minister's argument. It leaves the anomalous position whereby an individual who comes across personal information acquired under the terms of this Act would be enabled to require an amendment to that information, but if it is acquired outside the terms of the FOI Act, he or she could not. I do accept that if it is extended in an uncontrolled way, it may end up causing more problems.

In page 8, to delete lines 39 to 43 in page 9, to delete lines 1 to 46 and in page 10, to delete lines 1 to 46.This is a substantial amendment because it deals with two of the most controversial sections of the Bill. Section 12 deals with section 19 of the original FOI Act.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	187	We had just started our discussion of amendment No. 20 which, in effect, seeks to delete section 12, one of the two most important sections of the Bill and which provided the pretext for the review which the Government carried out in the first instance. Like others on this side of the House, I am not particularly exercised about when Cabinet papers should be released as I accept the principle that the Government should have space for a full and frank debate which as far as possible should be unconstrained by the risk that something said or written might be revealed immediately or during the decision making process. What we do not accept, however, is the extension of the provision into a range of other areas.This section, for example, provides for a mandatory refusal to disclose records of Government within the ten year period. Section 19 of the original Act allowed the Secretary General or the person making the decision some discretion as to whether a memo to Government or Government papers should be released. As I understand it, this discretion was little used in that memos to Government were rarely, if ever, released but, at least, the principle was provided for that if it was considered to be in the public interest, such information could be released. By making it mandatory the Government is seeking to close off any possibility that information of that kind will be made available during the decision making process.There are several other provisions in the section which we also find offensive, some of which have drawn the wrath and comment of the Information Commissioner. One deals with the definition of "Government". The high level review group which tabled its report before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service last week made clear that "Government" should be defined as tightly as possible, and that the Bill should protect only those communications, whether correspondence or memos between Ministers, which led directly to Cabinet debate and were related directly to Cabinet decisions. Clearly, however, the Government has gone much further in drawing up its provisions. It has redefined "Government" to include debate between civil servants, between civil servants and policy advisers, people outside and committees of people outside. The Bill puts all of these groups on an equal footing with the Cabinet. This extends the principle of collective responsibility far beyond the intentions of those who drew up the document in the first instance, something we simply cannot accept.The Minister has wide experience of this matter, most of it positive. I compliment him on the way he deals with such issues in his Department because it has recently become clear that he has rejected advice from officials or acted in a way which officials did not intend, yet he has dealt robustly with those who have sought to drive a wedge between him and his officials. It is right and proper that that should be the case.The great value in making this kind of documentation publicly available is that we can see, as we are entitled to do, the advice given and representations made to Ministers and the pressures exerted on them before decisions were taken. The process of ensuring Government accountability will be greatly weakened if, by passing this section, the supply of information and public debate are closed off.One other provision of the section that we wish to delete is the definition of the information that it covers, that is, the reference to information produced solely and primarily for the purposes of Cabinet. This provision was very deliberately worded in 1997. It restricted the amount of information that could be protected in order to ensure only information produced entirely for the purposes of Cabinet discussions would be protected from immediate release. The Minister is now, in effect, extending this provision well beyond its original terms to cover information held at a very low level within a Department which might conceivably at some stage in the future come before Cabinet. We consider that this goes far beyond what is reasonable in the circumstances and beyond the reasons the Government and the high level review group offered for proposing the section.In summary, this section is an attempt by the Government to close off information, accountability and transparency in the decision making process. As such, it is a retrograde step.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	188	I second the amendment which I agree with and support my colleague's comments. It is one of many which get to the heart not only of the legislation but also what appears to be the ambition of the Administration to change the operation of the Freedom of Information Act 1997 and narrow and cut back severely on the level of information available publicly, specifically on Government decisions. We know that this was an important issue in the debates on the 1997 legislation and one of the core issues of the legislation when being drafted to establish strongly the principle of open government. The 1997 legislation worked hard to create the necessary balance between the need for Government to have a level of confidentiality and secrecy around its decision making process and the need to avoid clouding the operation of government in a blanket of secrecy, which would be the effect of the amending legislation. Our amendment is designed to ensure the principle of openness in the original legislation is maintained to the best possible degree. The balance contained in the principal Act is the right one.I asked the Minister on Second and Committee Stages to point to one example where the provisions of the 1997 legislation had caused a problem, not just political embarrassment. Where has the framework of the Act governing the openness surrounding Cabinet decisions or information to Cabinet that informs its decisions generated a problem? If the Bill is designed to close off the possibility of political embarrassment, we will know the ambition of the Government. I would like to hear the motivation for the provisions in the amending legislation in this respect.I listened to the Minister's replies to earlier amendments. In the light of the comments of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service following its deliberations on the proposals and the report of the Information Commissioner, will the Minister inform the House if he intends to take on board the committee's deliberations? It is important to know if the Government intends to table amendments in the Dáil. The Minister's negative responses so far to Report Stage amendments in this House indicate that his thinking has not changed and that he is not prepared to change his mind on the Bill, as published. What is his thinking? Will he bring amendments forward in the Dáil?
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	189	In defence of the Minister, he indicated in response to points Senator White and I made that he was willing to consider, perhaps by regulation rather than by amendment, reduced charges for certain categories. He has taken account of the debate in this regard.I agree that this section is at the heart of the Bill. It involves reconciling the freedom of the deliberative process in government with freedom of information. There has been a huge advance compared with five years ago. Whereas then this information was only available after 30 years, even under the amending legislation it will be available after ten. That keeps us on the liberal side of information regimes elsewhere, especially that which obtains across the water.Senator McDowell queried the mandatory nature of the section. The concern is consistency of decision-making where use of the word "may" creates doubt and could result in inconsistent decisions. It is probably better for administrative efficiency to have one class to which the same rules attach.The presentation which was well made by the group of high level civil servants answers the problem raised by Senator O'Meara and makes the case for the change. It boils down to freedom of the deliberative process. If there is an insistence on advice, committee proceedings and such matters being made public immediately, it will alter the nature of the advice in documentation. If we want good government, we need civil servants and advisers to present their cases in writing. It is not good enough to conduct everything verbally because verbal advice cannot as easily be taken home to be looked over to consider if it is right or wrong. There needs to be a system of minute keeping and making committee reports. They are good and such a system will be seriously stymied if there is an insistence on their being available immediately. The core of the case made by the high level group and in the Bill is a good one.The group – we are talking about senior civil servants of high calibre and integrity – was not motivated by avoidance of political embarrassment but by a genuine concern that the process of government was in danger of suffering under the existing system which had an element of experimentation to it. It had had five years and was perhaps time to adjust it. It is not a question of drawing back completely on the 1997 Act because all this information will be available after ten years as opposed to the 30 which applied previously. There is a good case for this provision.I do not have a problem with, for example, using the term "primarily" as in documents prepared primarily for the purposes of transaction. There are difficult problems sometimes in government which are delegated to committees, be they comprised of a Minister and officials or just officials or whatever, to try to find a solution. It is not a blanket exemption for any committee on any subject. I remember Senator McDowell's main concern last week was the proceedings of the tax strategy group and I said that my understanding was that they would be continued to be released subject to the Minister's caveat about what would still be part of the deliberative process. It was clear to me that the group was not covered. The Senator should be reassured that such an advisory group is not covered by the legislation.I am not happy with one section of the Bill that is covered by this amendment. I do not have a difficulty with the definition of Government, as it is necessary for certain purposes. If the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach, for example, is leading partnership talks in the absence of Ministers, he is the Government for that purpose. An ambassador representing this country abroad can, for all practical purposes, be the Government. I do not have a problem with the fact that the definition of Government is not narrow. The word "officials", however, is defined in section 12 as including not only a senior official who represents the Government, but also "a person who is a member of such other (if any) classes of person as may be prescribed". This section is too loosely drawn.The Information Commissioner told the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service that an Act can legally, for its purposes, define black as white and the definition of the term "officials" in the Bill comes quite close to doing something similar. It is difficult to see how an official, for the purposes of the Bill, can be someone other than a civil servant or an adviser. Perhaps such a blanket definition should be re-examined.

I am not saying that I support the amendment, but I feel that the definition of officials should be considered by the Minister.It seems that the Sunday newspapers will no longer include details of correspondence between the Minister for Finance and other Ministers. Such correspondence has reassured me in all cases, as it has shown that the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, is doing his job, which is to challenge spending programmes and plans. Those of us who have been involved in Government know that Departments sometimes ask for astronomical increases in funding.I will abuse this opportunity by mentioning one such issue. Some of the plans for Dublin's transport infrastructure seem to be absolutely astronomical. Why should we spend billions of euro on a new tunnel to connect Heuston Station and Connolly Station, given that a tunnel between the stations already exists? We should examine how projects can be pursued economically, rather than choosing the most deluxe and imaginative project which costs the most astronomical sum of money. This matter has been discussed by the infrastructure sub-committee on many occasions.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	192	I agree with the comments of Senators McDowell and O'Meara. Although other sections will have quite considerable consequences, section 12 is the heart of the legislation because it contains its central goals. It is obvious that this section is a response to the Government's panic, which results from the fact that 18 April – which is D-day in terms of the release of documentation that the Government is anxious to protect – is approaching.I wish to make four or five brief comments on this section. I concur with the remarks that were made in relation to the substitution of the word "shall" for the term "may". It rarely happened that Secretaries General used their discretion in relation to the release of records, but at least they had an option. The insertion of the word "shall" in this section, however, will make it absolutely imperative and will completely bring down the shutters. It shows a huge lack of faith in the senior officials who are in charge of Departments.It has been pointed out that the additional restrictions relate not only to notes of advice or suggestion sent between Ministers, between Ministers and officials, or between officials and other officials, but also to more elementary matters such as oral and written parliamentary questions. I do not understand why a briefing note prepared for a Minister who is replying to a parliamentary question should be so sacrosanct that it needs to be protected by such a draconian measure.I share the views of the Information Commissioner and the Opposition Members of this House in relation to the extension of the definition of Government. It is tightly defined in Article 28 of the Constitution and the Interpretation Act 1937. The extension of the definition of Government, to the range and extent that is proposed in this section, will, as the Information Commissioner stated, make it constitutionally unrecognisable. Section 12 also defines an official as "a person holding a position in the Civil Service of the Government or the Civil Service of the State", "a special advisor within the meaning of section 19 of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995", or "a person who is a member of such other (if any) classes of person as may be prescribed". The final phrase of the provision, which relates to people who will be recognised officially in this legislation as being in the Government, is too loosely phrased.The extension from five to ten years of the restriction on Government records is the fundamental reason that the Bill has been brought forward. The Labour Party's suggestion – that a Government which runs for a full five-year term should be given an additional year – was sensible. The extra year would have provided breathing space for a Government and would have given it time to create a distance between the end of an old Administration and the start of a new one. The idea seemed to offer the Government the latitude and leeway it needs, but it was turned down.Senator Mansergh said that people should be able to express their views freely – not necessarily orally, but on paper – in a good Government. The public perception that the Government is operating behind closed doors has militated against participation in the democratic process. The fact that the political system is shrouded in secrecy is one of the reasons that less than 40% of people vote in referendums in certain constituencies.A great deal of lip service has been paid to the principles of openness, transparency and accountability, but we have not delivered on such ideals. I cannot see many valid reasons that rudimentary exchanges between Ministers and officials, which show that they have different views, cannot be made public. The decision-making process should be opened up and placed in the public domain if we are to invest in the system the faith that people have lost. Public participation in the democratic process has declined as a consequence of the fact that people no longer feel they are stakeholders in the democratic process. A vote will be called on this measure because it is wrong, draconian, excessive and repulsive.
#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	193	The Government's central function is to make decisions for the good of citizens. Ministers will not express their opinions in a frank manner if they fear that Cabinet memorandums will be placed in the public arena too soon. I would not like my honest opinion, which might be based on vision and which might emerge from a brainstorming session, to be used as a scare story by the media. The Cabinet has to be efficient and smart if it is to perform its functions in an practical manner. If there is a requirement to disclose what passes between Ministers, they will conduct their business exclusively at Cabinet meetings which enjoy full protection. Such meetings would then become unwieldy. I accept that the protections extended to inter-ministerial communications regarding Cabinet matters should go further and be extended to cover other matters.With respect, the remarks of Senator Higgins regarding public distrust of this process are exaggerated. I realise that he takes this subject very seriously and my comments are not meant to be personally critical, but this has been blown out of all proportion. The public realises that private discussions between Ministers before they get to Cabinet cannot be put into the arena. Any common sense person realises that we cannot disclose everything.At the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service people worried about what constituted an "adviser" and asked if those advisers who are not civil servants would be covered by the legislation. That is the provocative matter, which is why clarification as to whom the legislation refers is required. I have complete faith in public sector officials and if they feel that confidentiality should be extended to ten years, we should concur. Clarification is required with regard to who is entitled to what information.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	194	Section 12 of the Bill, which this amendment seeks to delete, is the most important element of the Government's proposals. I cannot, therefore, accept the amendment. For the benefit of the House, I will restate the Government's position as I set it out on Second Stage.All organisations have the right to decide how to organise their business and the Government is no different. Our work is complex and in reaching decisions on important economic and social issues we must look at alternative approaches which we debate freely before reaching a joint decision on behalf of the community. The framers of the original Act recognised this when they enshrined in it key protections for Government records which would last five years. It has become increasingly clear that five years is not an adequate period for the purpose of protecting these records.As the high level group established by the Government explained, experience gained in the operation of the Freedom of Information Act 1997 makes it evident that the five-year moratorium on the release of Cabinet records is too short. It does not give Ministers the reassurance they require to commit views freely to the record if those views are to be divulged in such a short space of time. A ten-year limit leaves Ireland with a liberal regime. In other jurisdictions such limits range from ten to 30 years, with Canada, for example, operating a blanket restriction of 20 years on a wide range of records which come under the heading "Cabinet confidences".Another change to the exemption of records of the Government proposed by the Bill relates to inter-ministerial communications where such communications deal with matters already on the Government agenda, on which a submission to Government is proposed or which relate to issues delegated by Government for resolution between Ministers. The need to extend protection to such communications was recognised by the high level group in order to support the exercise of collective responsibility. Measures are also being introduced to provide for the exemption of records of a committee of officials established specifically to assist Cabinet deliberations and to report directly to it. In order to ensure that such protections fall within the categories mentioned, the Bill provides that the Secretary General of the Government must certify that the committee concerned meets the relevant requirements.Regarding Senator Mansergh's point, there is no hidden agenda. The subsection to section 12 provides the flexibility required to cover circumstances in which an independent expert, health board member or local authority official was required to attend a particular committee. If this issue does not arise, the regulations will not be made regarding these additional categories of persons. There is a great deal of confusion about this section and what is meant by Government. Some people may be misinterpreting the language in the Bill. Senator Mansergh gave the example of the Taoiseach representing the Government at the partnership talks, in which case he is the Government for that purpose. The Senator gave the further example of an ambassador who may also be the Government in his particular circumstances.Section 12(e) provides that a Government includes a committee of the Government and a committee of officials in order to extend the definition of Government for the purposes of record keeping. The section defines an official as a person holding a position in the Civil Service of the Government or the Civil Service of the State, a special adviser within the meaning of section 19 of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 and a person who is a member of such other, if any, classes of person as may be prescribed. An expert who assists a particular group must be construed as an official as defined in order to protect the group's records.

I agree that the way the section is set out may be confusing, but Members should be careful in their reading of the indented subsections. Senator Mansergh and I discussed many years ago the simplification of the drafting of Bills, which is something Senator McDowell also proposed. Senator McDowell is probably aware that this process was attempted in the United Kingdom, but fell on its face. I engaged in deliberations to establish a pilot project, but the UK experience was off-putting. Efforts in Australia have been somewhat more successful, but they have not succeeded here.The section in question goes to the kernel of the Bill and I am not in a position to accept the amendment. Senator O'Meara asked if amendments would be accepted, to which I respond by saying that there will be no substantial changes to the Bill. That is not to say there will be no tweaking in the context of contributions by Members on Committee and Report Stages. If people put forward reasonable suggestions, I am willing to consider them, but the substance of the Bill will not be changed.

He said at the outset that the Government is entitled to order its business just like anybody else. In his Cheltenham comments of last week, he pointed out that the Opposition had lost the election and that it was up to the Government to decide what to do. I do not accept that. I accept that the Government makes the ultimate call.

The Minister is not entitled to say that the Government has no duty to explain or to say that he need not justify the changes he is making. After all, the Government acts on behalf of and in the name of the people and it has a responsibility to take that into account when ordering its business and making its decisions. The mechanisms whereby its decisions are made should be based on consensus rather than on an assertion by the Minister that the Government has won the election and will speak to us in five years.The Minister referred to the report of the high level group and the supposed raison d'être of the Bill, namely the extension of the five-year term to ten years. I have already said, as have other Opposition Senators, that while we do not agree with that we are not hugely exercised by it. He does not acknowledge that the Bill goes a good deal further – even in this section – because it redefines in a very broad way the records disclosure of which can be prevented and the people whose deliberations are also prevented from release by redefining the whole nature of Government. He has gone well beyond what was recommended by the high level group and well beyond what he gives as being the raison d'être for the Bill. That is the reason I am pressing this amendment.

In page 11, line 13, to delete "a Department of State" and substitute "the Department of State concerned".This amendment refers to section 13 which deals with the deliberative process. There is a process of certification by the Secretary General set out in this section, whereby the Secretary General can say that a deliberative process is ongoing. If he or she does this, there is no appeal mechanism and it is the end of the argument. This amendment would mean that the Secretary General of the Department concerned would have to issue the certificate relating to information contained within the Department and a Secretary General from another Department would not be entitled to make a certificate of this kind.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	218	I second the amendment. Amendment No. 25 relates to section 20 of the principal Act. As Senator McDowell said, it deals with a specific point that has been made by the Information Commissioner and was referred to in the deliberations of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service.I thank the Minister for his clear response to my earlier question and for having injected an even greater sense of realism in this debate. We are wasting our time and the points we are making are being made to the air. The Minister has said he will not accept any substantive amendments to the Bill. I thank him for the honesty and openness of his approach. Having clarified this, we now know to be untrue the suggestion that the Government was reconsidering its view on this legislation in light of the response of the public and the Opposition. There is clearly no intention of rolling back this amending Bill.The Information Commissioner has pointed out that amending section 20 of the principal Act will lead to circumstances where a Secretary General from one Department will be able to bind the decision of a Secretary General in another Department. This creates an extraordinary situation. This amendment seeks to have a situation where the Secretary General's decisions should apply only to his or her Department and cannot bind the hands of another. Despite his earlier remarks, I ask the Minister to view this amendment as reasonable and sensible, and one which does not undermine his stated intention in relation to the principle of the legislation, but rather clarifies a particular point within it.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	219	I second the amendment. The beautifully constructed phrase and neat contrivance "deliberative process" is the same as asking how long is a piece of string. Deliberative process is an ingenious creation which acts a blocking device when civil servants decide they do not want to release the information on the basis of a deliberative process which can continue indefinitely.I agree with Senator O'Meara's point about the ludicrous power of one Secretary General to tie the hands of another. In 2000, I tabled a question to the then Minister for Public Enterprise on a tender which was submitted by ESB International for the acquisition of several power plants near Gdansk in Poland. I sought information under FOI because I felt the Taoiseach had been less than forthcoming and truthful in relation to utterances he was making inside the Dáil and outside it and there had been a great deal of controversy about the matter. The tender had been well prepared and it is well-known that it was the best presented tender the Polish authorities received and had the best prospect of getting the nod. The Irish ambassador to Poland lobbied hard on its behalf and at the last minute, on the instruction of the Minister's Department, the plug was pulled on it because it was felt that the ESB was over-stretching itself.I sought and received the file from the Department of Public Enterprise which was extensive and enlightening. By virtue of the fact that the Irish ambassador to Poland was involved in the lobbying process, I sought the file from the Department of Foreign Affairs but was refused on the basis that it would damage international relations. This was despite the fact that I already had an extensive file from the Department of Public Enterprise. If this legislation is passed, as sure as night follows day, the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs could tie the hands of the Secretary General of the Department of Public Enterprise and nothing would be released as a consequence.

It is important to go through these sections on Report Stage, especially as some of the amendments were not tabled on Committee Stage because of the Information Commissioner's report. The deliberations have helped clarify sections of the Bill, put real fears at rest and will inform any final tweaking of the legislation.I reject the argument made by Senator Higgins. Any clause in any legislation can be abused and – beyond a certain point – one cannot legislate for that. However, senior officials such as a Secretaries General wish to maintain their integrity and reputation, present and future, and will not deliberately abuse their powers to conceal something from the public which they should not. I do not accept Senator Higgins's premise.Senator O' Meara has chosen a bad amendment to say that this process is a waste of time because the amendment is entirely redundant and unnecessary. The notion, in practical terms, that the Secretary General of one Department will proscribe something exclusively and entirely belonging to another Department is unreal. One would have interdepartmental war if that were the case. It seems perfectly clearly drafted that the provision relates to matters brought forward in one Secretary General's jurisdiction.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	221	The rate of exchange of information between Departments of the State and the deliberative process of central Government can result in records relating to that process being held by a number of Departments. Some such Departments might have had only an indirect involvement or relationship to the process concerned. It is possible, therefore, for an FOI request to be made to the Department of State for records it holds but which relate to the deliberative process of another Department. The arrangement whereby a Secretary General can certify records that directly relate to the deliberative process of a Department of State rather than the Department of State concerned affects this possibility. I expect the certification by a Secretary General of a record relating to the deliberative process of another Department would only take place in exceptional cases and following proper consultation.I draw attention in this regard to comments made by the high level group which noted the absence of requirements to consult or inform another Department, in a case of a proposal to release information which relates to the activity of that Department. In order to address this, the group recommended the initiation of a system of formal consultation between Departments on material to be released. It is in the context of full consideration and consultation between the relevant Secretaries General that we envisage certification by a Secretary General of records relating to a deliberative process in another Department may have been prepared.Senator Higgins referred to the case involving ESB International. I am sure the Senator followed up on that project and where it is now. Did he consider whether the Department of Finance and I were correct and that he and others were wrong about the matter?

Senator Mansergh pointed out that the idea that Secretaries General try to cosy up to Ministers is daft. Anyone who knows any Secretaries General will know that politicians will come and go but the Civil Service goes on forever. If one has been a Minister for as long as I have, one will appreciate this. Senator Mansergh has also been a civil servant and an adviser to the Government in a political capacity and he knows that well too.In 1992, the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government had fallen out. We had a general election and it looked like we were going to be out of power. Seán Duignan reflected in his book that there was a little drawing back, until it became clear Fianna Fáil was going back into Government with Senator McDowell's party. I have noted this scenario in dealing with civil servants.

He and Senator Mansergh make the case well for those of us proposing the amendment by saying that, while the Bill is drafted in a way that allows a Secretary General to do a particular thing, they would never do it. However, that begs the question of why one would draft the legislation in such a way that would allow a Secretary General to close down information from another Department, if, as the Minister says, he does not expect this to happen.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	227	I move amendment No. 26:
In page 11, line 17, after "State" to insert "and in the opinion of the Secretary General the public interest would, on balance, be better served by refusing to grant than by granting the request".This amendment is similar to amendment No. 25 in that it relates to the same section dealing with the deliberative process of public bodies and Government. I suggest that the amendment is perfectly reasonable. We are attempting to have inserted an additional number of words that, in respect of the deliberative process, would give the Secretary General of a Department an element of discretion in refusing requests for information or exempting entire swathes of information from being available under FOI. The way the section is drafted has the effect of creating a blanket refusal around large amounts of information currently available to the public under FOI. The amendment has the effect of reversing this to some degree. Under it, a Secretary General will be given some discretion in refusing to grant a request for reasons of public interest.The Information Commissioner's comments on the deliberative process are notable in the context of the amendment. On pages 49 and 50 of his report, he refers to the amendments proposed in section 13 of the Bill and provides the example of a case brought by the person primarily responsible for drafting the original legislation, the former Minister of State, Ms Eithne Fitzgerald. The latter made a request for information relating to the interdepartmental strategy group on employment and unemployment. I will not enter into details of the case, but an appeal was brought before the Information Commissioner. In the summary of the resulting judgment, it is quite rightly pointed out that there are some policy areas, such as those relating to employment, that do not have a specific timeframe – they cannot be said to have a beginning and an end – and are relevant to a number of Departments. They also form part of the deliberative process of a number of Government decisions.Background papers dealing with these areas will be found to be before Government from time to time. What harm is generated by having these papers in the public domain? I have asked this question on numerous occasions and have never received a satisfactory reply. I do not believe such a reply exists. What is wrong with having, for example, background papers dealing with strategies on employment available to the public? Where is the harm in people being able to read such papers and judge for themselves how decisions are made and formed? We know that the Minister for Finance is not averse to taking a different view from that which was advised. What is wrong with the public knowing that? It has not done this Minister any harm. Why is it necessary to cast such an extensive blanket over the deliberative process of Government and, in doing so, undermine the entire principle of the original legislation?
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	228	I second the amendment.The existing provision effectively says that the Secretaries General must justify a decision to refuse. The presumption in the section is in favour of the release of information, so a Secretary General must show that releasing the information would damage the public interest. The section, as amended by the Bill, would effectively reverse that onus, so that the Secretary General will have to state that the public interest would be served by releasing the information. It makes it much easier for a Secretary General to satisfy himself or herself on a public interest test and close down the process by issuing a certificate. In this amendment, we are seeking to qualify the issue of the certificate by saying that the Secretary General must be satisfied that, on balance, the public interest would be better served by refusing to grant the request. We are trying to reverse the onus once more from its position in the amending Bill.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	229	I am against this amendment for the same reason I am against the change as a whole. As I said earlier, I approve of parts of the Bill that seek to secure Cabinet deliberations and papers. What I find difficult is that the fence is so wide. Matters would be much easier if it were narrower. If the exceptions were more clearly drawn and, as Senator O'Meara said, the background papers that help people to come to a decision were available, people would be able to consider the quality of a decision and the real reasons behind it.I also find it difficult to accept the proposition that every Secretary General deserves to be beatified. We are extremely lucky in terms of the calibre of people employed in the public service. It is somewhat unfair to ask whether I do not trust person A, B or C. Of course I trust them – some of them are very good friends of mine and I have enormous respect for them – but I do not know who will be in their positions ten or 20 years from now. It is wrong to put a Secretary General in the position of having to decide what is in the public interest. I would be happier if a Minister made this decision because he or she must come before the Dáil or Seanad and justify the position, whereas a Secretary General is not obliged to do so.I speak from having been in this position for a number of years. I worked under the British Official Secrets Act, which I treated with a certain degree of levity. Of all the papers that came across my desk, particularly those dealing with issues such as health, which were classified or confidential, the number that were really capable of damaging the national interest was extremely small. Most of them could have been published in the Belfast Telegraph. In fact, one did read most of them in the Belfast Telegraph, but that is another story. It is too easy to throw up a blanket of public interest immunity and it is unfair not only to give that function to Secretaries General but, as Senator McDowell said, to make it into a duty. There is, in the context of the Act, a tendency to change the burden of proof – to change a presumption of release into a presumption of retention. On the narrow point of making a Secretary General the arbiter of the national interest, I have no difficulty at all with the people currently in those positions. However, I feel it is unfair to give them this function.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	230	I do not know what was Senator O'Meara's experience as a special adviser but when it comes to an issue such as unemployment, there are any number of expert group reports published. The real difficulty is getting to read them all. In the economic and social area, particularly because of the social partnership process, there is no shortage of advisory group reports. To be fair, the Government publishes most of these, unless they relate to consultancy or have a substantial commercial content. However, one must have some regard to simplicity of administration.It is fairly clear what is involved in the deliberative process. The Secretaries General explained what is involved. They have an enormous amount to do and it will place on them an extra burden if they have to decide in each case if something has passed the deliberative process and if it is in the public interest to release it. There is much to be said for simple, straightforward lines rather than making everything endlessly complicated. The Government can publish anything that is an input into a deliberative process and often does so as part of its business of informing public debate and decisions. Senator Maurice Hayes has experience as a Secretary General and I share his view that it is not a good idea to place this extra imposition on them.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	231	The provisions in section 13 will achieve a high degree of confidence that records related to ongoing deliberations, particularly those within Departments of State, will be protected. While such deliberations are ongoing, but only to that extent, the Government is satisfied that the public interest favours protection. Once deliberations have concluded, the directives related to those deliberations would fall to be released.There are other amendments to this section on Secretaries General and certification. The question of whether the deliberative process is ended can be difficult. The Government has decided that more certainty is needed in this area in order that records relating to ongoing deliberations of Departments will not be released into the public domain prematurely in such a way as to undermine the process of Government.Under the provisions of the Bill, the Secretary General of a Department will decide whether the deliberative process is still underway or has concluded. Where he or she decides the deliberative process is ongoing, the secretary general will issue a certificate and the relevant records will not be released. At the end of the deliberative process, the Secretary General will revoke the certificate and the records will be released. This provision only applies to Government Departments – which comprise 17 public bodies out of a total of 370 covered by the FOI Act.In issuing certificates, the Secretaries General will need to be fully satisfied that the deliberative process is clearly ongoing. Secretaries General are in charge of complex organisations and we can rely on them to discharge this function in a responsible manner. In addition, the FOI central policy users in my Department will be given detailed, practical advice as to what procedure should be put in place. In the past, in respect of matters not related to the Department of Finance, deciding officers in some Departments occasionally issued documentation when other Departments did not because they regarded the deliberative process as ongoing.There is nothing sinister in giving the power to a Secretary General to decide when the deliberative process is finally concluded. It can be a matter of interpretation as to when it is concluded, but to suggest that Secretaries General will start issuing certificates willy-nilly, stating that the deliberative process is not concluded and keep it going for years, is ridiculous. Such behaviour would not befit any Secretary General I have ever known. That will not happen. It is reasonable for a Secretary General to decide the matter.I am not given to listening to hypocrisy. Some Opposition Members applaud me for the independent stance I have taken against official advice when members of their parties have made it their modus vivendi to pillory me at all times for working that way. It is somewhat hard to take. Notwithstanding the fact that my bank account was considerably enlarged by my presence at Cheltenham last week and that I returned in good humour, if I have to listen to much more of this from the left I will not be able to take it.There may have been other Ministers for Finance and other Ministers who have gone against the advice of their officials over the years who are not readily known to people, Members of the Opposition of both Houses are delighted to come to see me in groups or individually to ask me to do things on their behalf which the officials of my Department have advised against or turned down and which were also turned down by my predecessor. They are always pleased when I overturn that advice. I have done that for Members of both Houses and given advantages to political parties, groups and individuals that other Ministers have turned down. They like it when I take such action, but they are not too pleased on other occasions. Members can refrain from applauding me for doing things that way because I cannot take much more.

I do not accept, however, that this amending legislation is about simplicity of administration.The Minister has pointed out that there can be a difference of opinion from one Department or Secretary General to another on when deliberations have concluded. When can we say the deliberative process on unemployment has concluded? It is a policy issue that is constantly brought to Government.Speaking from my experience as a journalist, this amending legislation will distort information going to Government. If a person uses freedom of information at present to ask what documents are going to Government, he or she gets all of them. Information is available to journalists in its entirety. Before the Freedom of Information Act – the same position will apply when this legislation is passed – a single document could come into the public domain through leaking or by accident so a journalist might create a distorted image of how the Government is making a decision. That is the great beauty of the Freedom of Information Act. The situation does not exist whereby a Department, Minister or spin doctor could use his or her power of selective leaking to distort information that will end up in the public arena.I worked both as a journalist and a ministerial adviser in the days before freedom of information legislation was introduced. A person with access to documents considered secret has a lot of power when dealing with journalists and the media. Journalists are always on the lookout for documents that are secret and not in the public in domain. Getting their hands on such documents provides them with exclusives that will get them on to the front page or raise their profile. This gives the PR person, spin doctor, ministerial adviser or whoever the power to use the selective leaking of documents to generate a particular response. This power is used in the wrong manner which I have seen happen.

We all know that there is selective leaking. As I have said to former colleagues, all one has to do to make a document desirable to journalists is to mark it "secret". Even if the information is not particularly interesting, they will want it and want to run with it. That is an incorrect exercise of power. One of the effects of freedom of information legislation was to undermine that cloak of secrecy. Unfortunately, this whole atmosphere will probably return once this amending legislation is enacted.

It is not an option to certify a record after an application is received. That is clear.

This amendment is based on the provisions of section 25 of the 1997 Act relating to highly sensitive records in the areas of security, defence, law enforcement and international affairs. However, the two mechanisms are not the same. In section 25 of the 1997 Act the Minister has responsibility for certifying such records, whereas, under the provisions of the Bill relating to deliberative processes, it will be the function of Secretaries General. There is nothing unusual in this. The Public Service Management Act 1997 gave significant new powers to Secretaries General which previously had been those of the Minister. This is an extension of that principle.A framework for modern government recognises that Secretaries General have a distinctive role in their own right. One can argue that this may give rise to clashes between a Minister and a Secretary General but the same could be said of the Public Service Management Act 1997. I am sure disputes between Secretaries General and Ministers were not unknown before the introduction of that Act either.

We are seeking to delete the provision in the Bill which cuts off the line of appeal. Section 13(1A)(c) states that an application for a review or an appeal to the commissioner shall not lie in the event of certification by a Secretary General. This gives a Secretary General untrammelled discretion to determine that a deliberative process is ongoing. The granting of such a significant power to a Secretary General must, at the very least, be subject to review, which is what we seek to achieve by deleting this provision.The Minister spoke about hypocrisy from the left. I have never criticised him exclusively on the basis of not taking advice from officials. While I have sought to use the advise of officials as a weapon to attack him when he makes bad decisions – decisions with which I disagree – I have never criticised him exclusively on the grounds of not following the advice of officials, nor would I.

I also understand and appreciate the dilemma faced by public bodies in relation to this sensitive and complex issue but there is no simple solution. This issue is receiving careful consideration at official level.

What we are trying to do in this amendment is to row back on the class exemption the Minister is seeking to give certain matters. The 1997 Act effectively provides, in matters of international affairs, matters relating to Northern Ireland, matters relating to security of the State and so on, that if harm would be done to the State's interests in those issues then the head is obliged to refuse. However, the amending Bill creates a class exemption so that effectively everything covered by several Departments of State – the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Defence, Foreign Affairs – has a class exemption and is exempt from any disclosure. This is far too broad.The Minister will be aware that in 1997 when this issue was discussed those Departments were anxious to get an exemption for everything they do. The view was taken that there should still be a requirement on them to show that some harm would be done, that perfunctory information relating to international affairs or Northern Ireland should be open to release in circumstances where it was clear no harm would be done by releasing them. It is regressive that the Minister and the Government have chosen to stamp whole areas of Government activity with the top secret "not to be disclosed under any circumstances" stamp. We are seeking to have that rowed back a little by requiring that only confidential information held on Northern Ireland, the security of the State and so on is protected and not perfunctory everyday information. While I do not expect the Minister to accept the amendment today, it is one of those issues where the sponsoring Departments have not made the case that they should be given the exemption which nobody else enjoys and to which the Minister might reasonably give consideration between now and dealing with it in the other House.

One could make the case that the release of an individual report from, for example, our ambassador to Rome, or the Italian ambassador here, about a banal conversation would not harm the interests of the State. The problem is whether one's international relations as a whole would be covered in confidence. If a judgment has to be made on each particular case, there would not be consistency and, therefore, there would not be a mutual reliance in diplomatic relations with other countries that particular things said or communicated would not be released. There is a strong case for a class exemption.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	258	I wondered whether in relation to this the Minister would think about the problems of complementarity. I take the point Senator Mansergh made. If it was a Northern Ireland issue which was manifestly not of huge importance, it might be odd if access were refused in Dublin when access had already been granted in Belfast or in London.Equally, in regard to international relations, it is worth thinking of the effect of Freedom of Information Acts in other jurisdictions. I remember one famous case where a Swedish ombudsman was hugely embarrassed because some thoughtful Swede had made use of the Freedom of Information Act in Portugal to get information there. Would it be a good idea to try to ensure parity of esteem for official secrets in all jurisdictions?

#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	260	Absolutely.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	261	I oppose this amendment. International case law supports a high degree of protection for communications and negotiations of a diplomatic nature involving Ministers and the Government. This was recognised by the Oireachtas in the original Act when ministerial and Government communications were not qualified in the manner proposed by this amendment. In drafting the Freedom of Information Act there was an understanding that records relating to defence, security and international relations and Northern Ireland would be provided a high degree of protection. However, difficulties have arisen over the interpretation of what "could reasonably be expected to cause harm". This has led to uncertainty and to the release of information which the Government would have judged had better been held in confidence.The main difficulty relates to the uncertainty as to what might be released. It is not possible at present to provide any guarantee to interlocutors the information given in confidence can be secure. Without such a guarantee such information will be withheld. This has already been made clear to us by representatives of other states. The Government has to take account, therefore, of the fact that this uncertainty regarding the interpretation will result in a loss of confidence in dealings with the Government and that important and sensitive information may not be made available. Such a situation would have serious consequences for the security and well being of the State. The Government has a responsibility to ensure this does not arise.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	262	I do not disagree with what the Minister has said. If information is important to the security of the State, if it is important and sensitive – to use the Minister's words – and its release will do harm, under the Act, as it stands, it will not be released. Both the Minister and Senator Mansergh spoke about clarity. Of course one can get clarity if one simply closes the door. In effect, they say that since nothing will be released there is total clarity in regard to what can be released. We are one step on the road to saying we do not require a Freedom of Information Act. I do not accept that whole swathes of Government activity should be totally immune from inspection. We all accept there is a particular sensitivity in relation to these areas and, therefore, that different provisions should apply to them than apply in other areas.

Only three said directives have been the subject of certification under section 25(1) in the five year period to date since the FOI Act commenced. In view of this the requirement for the Taoiseach or the Minister to consider such requests every six months, or at a minimum, every 12 months, is excessive, particularly when the issues pursuant to section 25(1) have a time limit of two years. Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.

I cannot help but remark that the Minister is giving the Information Commissioner short shrift today. We thought we would give him one more opportunity to accept some of the amendments the commissioner suggested to his Department a few months ago. This amendment strikes me as being technical and one which the Minister may wish to consider seriously.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	270	I oppose amendment No. 37. The purpose of section 19 is to clarify that the protection available to information obtained in confidence applies across public bodies. It will also permit a head to refuse to confirm or deny the existence of a record if the record is covered by the exemptions in section 26(1) (a), that is, information obtained in confidence under the principal Act where the mere acknowledgement of the existence or non-existence of the record could undermine or reveal the sensitive information contained in the record. It is essential that such a prudent provision should be included in relation to the text of information obtained in confidence. I will not accept the amendment.I am not accepting amendment No. 38 which I know has been suggested by the Information Commissioner to prevent agreements being entered into for the purpose of the avoidance of release of information under the Freedom of Information Act. I am not aware of any such instances. I also understand that confidentiality agreements are invoked in the context of the Freedom of Information Act only very rarely.In framing the original Act, the Oireachtas recognised the importance of protecting, to the maximum extent, the legally binding duties of confidence arising from agreements or enactments not specified in the Third Schedule to the Act. Such agreements and enactments are not subject to an explicit public interest test. I am satisfied that this should continue to be the case. The insertion of an explicit public interest test in the Act could create uncertainty in relation to the protection of information subject to a legally binding duty of confidence. While international case law supports a high degree of protection for a duty of confidence arising from a confidentiality agreement, the courts have tended to apply this protection only to agreements considered to have been validly made. Agreements found to have been entered into for the purpose of the avoidance of release of information under the Freedom of Information Act are not likely to be considered valid. This view has been supported by the advice of the Attorney General and this advice has, in turn, been conveyed to the public bodies by the freedom of information central policy unit. This view could also be stressed in the context of training development on the Act. Therefore, I do not share the concern expressed by the Information Commissioner that public bodies may be using such agreements for the purpose of avoiding the release of information. If they are, such agreements run the risk of being struck down.

Under the existing provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, a public body must be satisfied as to the identity of a requester prior to releasing information that relates to the requester or to the release of which the requester has consented. It is sensible that similar checks should be made prior to the release of commercially sensitive information. Section 20 will also permit a head to refuse to confirm or deny the existence of a record containing commercially sensitive information where the mere aknowledgement of the existence or non-existence of the record concerned could undermine or reveal the sensitive information contained in the record. This is a reasonable provision. I cannot accept the amendment.

The issue is being examined by me.Section 3 of the principal Act contains a provision which allows the Minister for Finance to make regulations for the purpose of giving full effect to the Freedom of Information Act in order that the further legal clarification that appears in this provision may permit regulations to be made or to provide that section 17 or 18 can be invoked by parents, guardians or the next-of-kin of persons unable to direct the exercise of their rights under this section. Such mechanisms operate at present in relation to the right of access to records under section 6 of the Act.The issues are being examined and, if necessary, I will bring forward an appropriate amendment on Committee Stage in the Dáil. The power to do what is required may already be available under the regulations.I am glad to see that Senator Ryan has returned to the House at the appropriate time.

I am not sure if my absence caused him delight or my return caused him even greater delight.I came back for the purpose of saying that his is one of the most disappointing performances I have seen from a Minister in the 22 years since I was elected to this House.

This section provides for a period of four weeks from the initiation of third party consultation in burdensome cases. It is believed that in cases involving significant amounts of records or a large number of third parties who need to be consulted under section 29 of the principal Act, two weeks gives an insufficient amount of time for decision makers to be able to properly locate, examine and identify records appropriate to form a consultation, consider the various public interest arguments involved and locate and contact all third parties. A period of four weeks is considered more appropriate for compliance and two weeks not reasonably possible. I am satisfied that this provision is reasonable. Therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendment.

I gather its purpose is to provide for formal third party consultation in accordance with the procedure under section 29 of the principal Act at the internal review stage of making decisions. This issue received considerable attention in the course of the preparation of the Bill. Unfortunately, it did not prove possible to achieve a satisfactory or workable legal mechanism but the issue is still under active consideration.

The first of these is the issue of costing proposals made by political parties. I do not doubt that the Minister had me in mind when drafting this section and wanted to offer some protection. I will politely decline that protection. I am not living in trepidation about anything that may be disclosed in the coming weeks and months regarding information that I or the Labour Party may have requested from his Department prior to last year's election.The second issue is more substantial. It concerns the practice that has grown among Opposition parties of requiring the disclosure of back-up information relating to parliamentary questions. It is a pity that the Minister is putting this section into the Bill. I have found it interesting and educational to obtain such back-up information. We all know that Departments will only prepare back-up information for questions that are likely to be reached. It is nonetheless useful when a particular question is not reached and the full range of available information can be obtained. This places a good deal more information into the public arena that might otherwise be the case.I cannot recall an example where information of this sort has been used to the disadvantage or embarrassment of a Minister. It is argued that civil servants would be constrained in what they put on paper in follow-up questions. What the Information Commissioner, and the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach, Mr. Dermot McCarthy, told the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service is interesting. Both stated that they believe there had been no degradation of records and that the quality of advice put on paper by civil servants had not diminished as a result of the provisions of the Act.I appreciate that the Minister is anxious to leave for Brussels.

The Opposition – any Deputy for that matter – can seek information from a Minister and probe for further information. When that process is complete, an FOI request can be promptly made.

However, there is something bizarre, in parliamentary terms, in making an FOI request at the end of Question Time.On a historical point, before FOI was introduced, during the fall of the Reynolds Government, there was a back-up reply to a question, a note on what the Attorney General did about a particular—

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	308	I do not propose to accept the amendment. The purpose of section 25 is to exclude from the FOI Act records relating to the costing by a public body of proposals by a political party. This is a long-standing agreement between political parties. The section also restricts the principal Act in relation to parliamentary briefing records, including those treated as a brief for parliamentary questions, whether written or oral.Ministers have direct responsibility to the Oireachtas through the various committees. In order to be properly briefed when appearing before either House, Ministers require a full range of views, expressed in a candid manner, from their officials and advisers on the various complex issues involved. It does not serve the public interest if Ministers do not to receive such advice. The same argument applies to briefing materials used in parliamentary questions. Accordingly, the Bill provides for full protection of such records.Prior to the most recent general election, my Department pointed out to the leaders of the various political parties that everything concerning party costings would be above aboard. I assure Members – I am sure this also applied to my predecessors – that any advice sought by political parties is not brought to the attention of the Minister for Finance of the day. My Department went to considerable lengths to ensure that everything was done properly. Due to doubts concerning FOI procedure, I prepared a memorandum for the Government encouraging it to make a decision to ensure that FOI would not impinge on the normal procedures that have been in place for a number of years regarding the costings of the political parties.I wish to make a point about last year's general election which does not relate to freedom of information but rather to how costings by the Finance enter the public domain. I did not make this point during the election campaign and it has not been made by my officials since then. Given that it will be some years until the next election is held, something will have to be done about dealing with – not with the procedures, which are fine – the costings for political parties.All political parties tend to claim that elements of their manifestos were costed by the Department of Finance. Neither I, as Minister for Finance, not my Department commented on this matter either during or since the election. If one writes to the Department of Finance and inquires about the cost of keeping six ganders on the Hill of Howth for four years, the Department will, to the best of its ability, provide such a costing. However, the Department did not, in any instance, consider a document supplied by a political party and state that the figures it contained added up. A number of parties stated that their proposals had been costed by the Department. Individual proposals were costed, but the Department of Finance has never put a document together for any of the parties or tried to make the figures add up for them. It was stated at many press conferences during the election campaign that the Department of Finance had costed various proposals. Neither I nor my officials commented on the matter, but I know the latter were highly embarrassed by such claims.The position will have to be changed. I am not referring to Senator McDowell's party in this instance, I am referring to all parties. In order to avoid confusion on the part of the electorate in the future, this procedure should be altered. Given that we are between elections, perhaps the time has come to do so.

In page 16, lines 36 to 50 and in page 17, to delete lines 1 to 6.This is an important amendment which relates to fees and the charging thereof. The section to which it relates is contentious. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment as it is an important principle of the Act.I draw to his attention the fact that the Information Commissioner also commented on this matter in his report. On page 74 of his report the commissioner says, in relation to the proposed amendment, that an application for review shall be refused and deemed for the purposes of the Act not to have been made where the prescribed fee has not been paid. He says he foresees that this may cause procedural and administrative difficulties. In that regard, I ask that the amendment be accepted and that the Minister's proposal be withdrawn in the interim.

It would be useful if the Minister took this opportunity to say what regime he intends to put in place. This is an enabling section, allowing the Minister to make regulations providing for fees. It would facilitate debate here and in the other House if the Minister could let us know what regime he envisages.

This is an enabling section, giving the Minister authority to introduce fees by regulation or some other means but it is too punitive. I ask him, as did the proposer and seconder, Senators O'Meara and McDowell, to look benignly at this section. It will cause hardship and limit the amount of information which may be obtained in various situations. I strongly urge the Minister to indicate what his thoughts are on this matter.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	313	We debated this issue earlier. The purpose of the relevant provision is to permit the Minister for Finance to prescribe a fee, in regulations, to be charged by a public body in respect of requests for access to a non-personal record under section 7 of the principal Act. There was also a provision for a fee to be prescribed in respect of an application for internal review under section 14, or in respect of an application for information under section 34. Such a fee will not apply to a request for personal information. I have said this on several occasions and I will not go into it again. It does not apply either in the old Act or this Bill.In the debate this morning I also indicated my willingness to look at an appropriate reduction in the level of fees for certain categories of requester. Furthermore, when responding to Senator Higgins, I made it clear that every citizen should make some small contribution, however minimal or nominal, for services delivered by the State. That applies in all areas of public life. It leads to an appreciation of the service. Where it is absent, the service is abused. While the fee will be set at a reasonable level, it will depend on the category of the requester. I do not intend to allow large media organisations the same level of fee as Mary Smith from Boyle aged 82 years.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	315	This Bill is fundamentally wrong. I have followed the debate in the House or on the monitor in recent weeks and nothing that I have seen on television or read in the newspapers offers evidence of a threat of any kind to the workings of government. I would not wish to be involved in anything that would seriously hinder the efficient work of government. However, the Minister seems to have forgotten that the Government acts on behalf of the people, the phrase is not government of the people but government for the people.On many occasions the Minister has talked as if this Bill is regulating a local licensed vintners association. He is spending other people's money and is very good at telling us this. Now he tells us that the Bill will make it easier for him and his colleagues in the Government to spend other people's money and to do things on their behalf by not letting them know what is going on. There is no logic to this.The idea that politicians are afraid to express their opinions is a myth. I do not know whether it is the Catholic Church or what has infected people's thinking but the idea that intelligent dissent in any way weakens an organisation is manifest nonsense. Intelligent dissent revitalises and energises an organisation and embarrassment will arise only from the recording of differing views when those views are not intelligent. Most of the people whom I have met who are connected with government are intelligent. I am certain that all civil servants in senior positions are intelligent. Thus the issue of unintelligent dissent does not arise and the argument for carrying the Bill forward is palpable nonsense.The argument is really about convenience and control. The convenience is that the Government would rather not have to think about individual matters. More fundamentally, the final say does not rest with it but, in most cases, with the Information Commissioner. This involves the withdrawal of that small but vital degree of independent evaluation of whether the Government is acting in the way that it claims to be acting.The Bill is a short-term remedy because when the Government loses the next general election, as I am certain it will, one of the first things that will happen is that the provisions of the Bill will be revised.

My party drove this legislation through an unwilling Oireachtas when the previous partner in government which conceded everything resolutely refused to concede on freedom of information.

There was no commitment in the programme for Government in 1992 to introduce a freedom of information Act because Fianna Fáil refused to do it. The Government has had five years of living with the Act and the first chance it got after the general election it walked away because Fianna Fáil did not want it. That is what the Bill is about. In spite of the line the Government is feeding to journalists and anybody who will listen, the Bill will be reversed when there is a change of Government. Whatever it is trying to conceal will become a matter of public record. That is the reason it is so wrong. If the Freedom of Information Act needed to be revised, this could have been achieved by consensus and agreement, with a proper process of consultation based on a spirit of openness, accountability and transparency, the goddess before whom the Minister does not worship, or so he tells us from time to time.

I have my god, the Minister has his and perhaps goddesses are nicer.I have outlined what is wrong with this legislation and that is why my party will continue to oppose it when it is debated by the Dáil. I hope that, after a nice break in Brussels, the Minister will realise, to a degree, that there is another point of view on this and that he is not threatened by the idea that the public might know a little more about his thinking.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	330	We will not support the proposal that the Bill pass its Final Stage and be sent to the Lower House. Colleagues on both sides have attempted to give it a fair hearing. It is interesting that Senator Mansergh has, under the leash of the Minister, withdrawn many of his constructive comments. The Minister stated unequivocally – he ought to have it as his epitaph – that he was not prepared to accept amendments. We have made no progress on Report Stage.When the original Bill was presented in 1997, two Governments and five parties had been involved in the deliberations and there was a degree of cross-party consensus as to how to proceed. The problem now is that the same consensus has been lost because the issue has been politicised by the Government's decision to make these severe amendments to the Act. I regret that fact, which is the reason we will continue to oppose the Bill.It was the former Deputy, Albert Reynolds, who received the note from the Attorney General's office which stated "If questioned on this, keep repeating the above". We know what transpired from that. There is not, unfortunately, the same commitment to such openness and transparency now. Given the problems to which Opposition colleagues have referred in respect of the definition of Government, particularly in respect of the problem with the deliberative process and the lack of consensus on both sides of the House on this issue, we believe the Bill should not go forward to the Lower House.I remind the Minister that his colleague and friend, Deputy Fleming, along with his other Fianna Fáil colleagues on the committee he chairs, is of the view that substantial amendments need to be made to the Bill. We look forward to these because, as it stands, the Bill does not meet the criteria established in 1997 and that is regretted on all sides of the House.

I do not see this as a highly political Bill, although it has been politicised. What led to it's introduction was the report of the high level group. The senior civil servants involved in that group were concerned about good Government and not about saving a particular Government from political embarrassment. That is not the issue. What they said should be taken seriously because it is the basis of the Bill. We have had a constructive discussion today and there are five or six issues the Minister has promised to examine.

I look forward to the Bill being returned from the Lower House when whatever changes on which the Minister decides have been made.In the course of a long and, at times, difficult debate, during a spat with our good colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, the impression may have been given that the Minister's advisers were lacking in some way in what they were doing. I wish to state for the record that both Niamh Campbell and Michael Hyland have been superb, on top of their brief and were the essence of efficient and effective civil servants of whom we can be proud. They were extraordinarily good.

I hope the Minister gives it some thought and that, when he returns with it to the Seanad, it will be improved so that I will be in a position to support it, which I would like to do. I thank the Minister for giving his time to deal with what has been a superb debate. It is a pity the legislation does not match it.

It is bad law and a bad day for our democracy. I do not accept it has been caused by the report of the high level group. The group reported, but the Government brought forward the legislation without a mandate. There is no mandate for undermining the freedom of information legislation. The Bill is a dilution of important principles enshrined by both Houses of the Oireachtas in 1997. It is unnecessary and wrong and we will continue to oppose it.
#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	342	As a member of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, I was delighted to be present to receive clarity on two issues about which I felt strongly, namely, section 6 and the confusion about the terms "relate to" and "contain".I am pleased that the Minister will attend a meeting of the committee, which, to my knowledge, will take place on 3 and 4 April. When he speaks to the cross-party groups, and especially to the spokesperson for the One in Four group, Colm O'Gorman, and explains to them so that they understand that no person who wishes to access their records will be denied that access, I will be happy. It was a serious issue which was raised by the committee.I felt strongly that there should be a waiver of fees for the most vulnerable in society and I am happy that this will be the case.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	343	I thank the Minister for attending the debate and for his attention to it. I wish him well in his important discussions in Brussels and have no wish to delay his departure.I found I was unable to accept the Bill on Second Stage, although I was strongly in favour of parts of it. I strongly favour protecting the integrity of Government discussions. It is a sensible measure to extend the secrecy period from five to ten years. I am still concerned about the width of the definition. It should be possible to obtain a narrower definition of what constitutes Government business. I also thought that there appeared to be a tendency to move the Information Commissioner out of the Act and give him a lesser role than he currently holds.I am also concerned about the method of consultation. While I have enormous regard and respect for the Secretaries General, they were all looking at the issue through the same lenses. I hope that, as the Bill proceeds in the Lower House, it may be possible to develop more consultation, particularly with the commissioner. When I was in a similar position, people let me see the drafts of Bills with which they were dealing. The commissioner is a statutory officer dealing with these issues and probably knows as much about where the shoe pinches as anyone else.The final group with which it might be possible and desirable to consult is the professional organisation of journalists. I cannot imagine that substantial changes would be made to a health Act without consultation with the Irish Medical Organisation, for example.The Bill has not changed sufficiently during this process for me to continue to support it but I hope it will be in a form that I can wholeheartedly endorse when it returns to the House. I commend the purpose of protecting the public interest but people are also interested in information. I impute no motives to anybody and do not subscribe to theories of conspiracy and cover-up. The Bill would be much better if the definition of Government papers and background documents was much tighter.

It is rare that a senior Minister stays in the House for a full day but the Minister did so today and I appreciate it. I thank the Minister's officials, Niamh, Michael and Ronan, who were present for all 27 hours of the debate. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, who, as I said last week, demonstrated courtesy, competence and good humour during the Committee Stage debate. It is important that we conclude our consideration of Bills in a courteous manner – it would be wrong to end with a snarl. I thank the Minister again for his attention and consideration. He has suggested that he will pick up on certain issues raised during the Report Stage debate.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	361	I pay a well deserved tribute to the deputy head usher, Mr. Tony O'Reilly. I realise the name has other connotations, but for those of us who know Tony it means 32 years of service to Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas. He has been deputy head usher since 1991 and is essentially a very courteous and kind man who possesses the highest qualities. I know I speak for everyone when I say there have been many difficult occasions when his warmth and politeness have meant a great deal. All Members greatly appreciate the care and attention we receive from those employed in the Oireachtas, though we may seem to take them for granted. We may not seem to hold their service in high regard but we do. Tony's familiar face and care in good times and bad have been welcome markers of his calibre of service to both Houses as deputy head usher. I am particularly pleased that the Seanad is paying tribute to him.Tony is in service until tomorrow but today is his last day in the uniform which has represented his formal mien. I always felt he was very proud of his job and the manner in which he did it. He showed endless regard and solicitude to all Members. I send the best wishes of the House to his wife and seven children for whom he will now have more time. He will return often to the Oireachtas in mufti and we will always be pleased to see him. It is with a united voice that the House thanks him sincerely for all he has done for us and wishes him great happiness in the many years which lie ahead.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	362	The Fine Gael group would like to be associated with the remarks of the Leader on the occasion of Tony's retirement. When I first came here seven years ago, I received good advice from an older Senator who said: "If you ever want to know anything about what goes on here or if you are ever looking for solid advice, Tony is your man." Throughout his time in the Houses of the Oireachtas, he has been a most courteous and agreeable person – someone one could always trust. He has an understanding of the dignity of the Oireachtas, which is important.I think Tony lives near Ballyfermot and I recall meeting him there on one occasion when canvassing in a by-election in the constituency of Dublin Central. As happens in by-elections, representatives of the various political parties were stationed outside a church on a Sunday morning. On his way into the church Tony shook hands with each of the Deputies and Senators present. It was impossible to know which way he was inclined. He said to me: "It is very nice to see you in Ballyfermot, Senator." I was able to return the greeting.Those of us who arrive here early each day are aware of the great morning lockout. Tony is also here very early and sometimes I managed to sit in his car if it was raining or snowing. He provided us with great shelter at various times. I wish him a long and successful retirement with his wife and seven children. He will be sorely missed in the House. The dignity he has shown to the House, and to its Members on countless occasions, is appreciated and valued by us. I know his retirement will be a flourishing one. I look forward to seeing him back shortly in the precincts of the House.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	363	It gives me great pleasure to add a few words to what has been said. When I was first elected in 1987, Tony was the first person who greeted me with "Hello, Senator." I looked around to see to whom he was talking. From that time he has always been helpful, supportive and, as the Leader has said, unfailingly courteous – sometimes to the point of deference. He has always been utterly reliable. He personifies a great sense of the dignity of the Houses of Parliament and their culture and he has upheld their proud tradition, which is crucially important.The vital contribution of the staff to the Houses of the Oireachtas is very often forgotten. We are often the ones who break the rules around here and in his polite way Tony has been able, on many occasions, to point out to people that this is not quite the way things are done. He has played his part in maintaining the culture and values which are important in the Houses. It is crucial that this culture continues through the generations. We thank Tony for that dependability and reliability.It is a byword that he is completely helpful, supportive and advisory to new people in the Houses, which is so important to people when they arrive and wonder where to go or what to do. Tony is one of those people who have always been able to have a quiet word with newly elected Deputies and Senators and the dignified manner in which he has done so is much appreciated.More than anything else, through the calibre of his work, Tony has maintained the high level of the image of the Houses of Parliament and we appreciate that. I know that everybody in the House would like to affirm the points I am making. Senator Norris, in particular, wishes to say a word, if that is possible. We appreciate Tony's 32 years of committed, loyal and diligent service and we affirm that what he has done has been in our best interests. We thank him very much indeed.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	368	—and secretly terrified at the same time. In many cases, one really has no idea of what is in store, particularly if one arrives, as I did, from an independent background without a tradition of political involvement. It is people like Tony who begin to give one a sense that one has actually come somewhere that has an important role. He has an ability to be there and at the same time to be almost invisible. He is there to give support, assistance and advice without giving the impression that he is anything other than at one's disposal. He helped people to sort out the complications of their expenses, a trivial issue but one that very often matters to Members.His sense of the dignity of the place is notable. We are all reluctant to talk about it, although we make noise about it occasionally. It cannot have been easy dealing for 32 years with the most paranoid group of people one could possibly meet, who all have a side of themselves where they are convinced that somebody is out to get them.

It has been a blessing to have somebody as calm, trustworthy, reliable and as easy to get on with as Tony, who at the same time never did anything but uphold the dignity of the House. It is, was and will continue to be a privilege for all of us to have somebody of that quality working with us. I wish him every happiness, long life and good health in his retirement.
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	371	On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I join previous speakers in congratulating Tony O'Reilly on the tremendous achievement of 32 years service. I am sure there are many in the House would wish that they could say the same. Perhaps they will have to wear a uniform to ensure that.I agree with the sentiments expressed by previous speakers that the role of an usher in the Houses of the Oireachtas is important in upkeeping the standards and dignity in which we operate. I was struck by the manner in which I have seen Tony carry out his duties with visiting groups and members of the public. My parents were with me on my first day here and I was impressed by the caring manner in which he dealt with my elderly father and gave him a tour of both Houses. I am sure this was indicative of how he behaves with all of the groups that come here and for that I wish to sincerely thank him.Previous speakers referred to the importance of the dignity of this House. At times we rely totally on the ushers to uphold those standards. We sometimes have to be checked ourselves, which is done in the most courteous of manners. It is important that those standards are maintained. It would be interesting if he were to tell us of the people he coached, tamed and trained. There would be some interesting stories there. We are thankful for those with whom he succeeded and do not blame him for those with whom he failed.On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I congratulate him on his service and wish him and his family every success in a long and enjoyable period of retirement.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	372	It is unusual for somebody who is not a leader to be allowed to speak and I am grateful for the opportunity. I usually deprecate these tributes, often to a long-lost Member of the House, as I have always felt that we waste an enormous amount of time in clichés and platitudes and that there is a level of insincerity and unreality about it. Today, however, we are not in the presence of the dead, thank God, we are in the presence of the living, that of somebody who has really enriched our lives. On this unusual occasion I can speak with a full heart and sincerity when I say it came as a surprise that Tony O'Reilly was retiring – he is much too young to go. While the Leader referred to another person of the same name, there is only one Tony O'Reilly as far as I am concerned.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	373	Hear, hear.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	374	One used to hear mention of the "real Taoiseach", this is the real Tony O'Reilly as far as I am concerned. The House will not be the same without him. He makes the clichés real. While we often hear tributes such as "Ní fheicfimid a leithéid ann arís," it is true on this occasion – I do not believe we will see his like again. While I am sure we will see someone excellent take his position, it will be a different kind of excellence as Tony O'Reilly is unique. He is always in good humour, courteous, helpful and immaculately turned out. He has a very special talent of making it appear that one is important when one has a guest in the House and impresses the blazes out of him or her. That is a great talent. He has mastered the art of being deferential without any loss of his dignity and worth.In this House I am a kind of gadfly and sometimes feel like Bertie Wooster, who many of us are to some extent. If we are Bertie Wooster, then Tony O'Reilly played a most excellent, sophisticated and wise Jeeves. I am sorry and saddened that he is going. He will certainly be missed and I am glad to think he will be back among us. I have retired once already and found it to be a most exhilarating experience. I hope Tony feels the same. I wish him many happy years with his family and friends.

I, too, have encountered the friendly face, warm smile and helpful hand to every visitor. While Senator Norris referred to the company of the living, the appropriate proverb should be, "Saol fada chugat, a Tony."

I have always known him as Tony – I did not know he was an O'Reilly until today. I have been a Member of the House for 25 years and always found him most helpful in guiding me. It was appreciated, not alone by me but by all Members also. It is great to see him in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery to hear the many fine and genuine tributes being paid to him. He is deserving of them all. He looks young to be retiring. I wish him a happy retirement with his wife and family.An Cathaoirleach: When is it proposed to sit again?Ms O'Rourke: At 10.30 a.m. tomorrow.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	377	I welcome the Minister of State on this very appropriate day. As he probably knows, the budget for the Conservatory of Music and Drama on Chatham Street may or may not be approved by the Minister who has the capacity to vary it. I have received many letters from parents concerned about the continuing musical education of their children. This is a real problem.While I do not mean to be divisive, part of the origins of the problems lies with the Dublin Institute of Technology Act 1992, under which the Conservatory of Music and Drama was brought under the wing of the Dublin Institute of Technology which, I know, has the ultimate intention of being recognised as a university. Only a small element of the work undertaken by the Conservatory of Music and Drama is relevant to the Dublin Institute of Technology as far as it is concerned. It is interested in third level education; it is not really interested in the ethos of this school – the provision of education in music to the widest possible variety of children. It would be a dreadful mistake if we were to allow elitism and exclusion to enter this area that is so enriching to the lives of young people who do not all have to be Yehudi Menuhin, their lives can be enormously enriched by learning how to play instruments and appreciate music.This was the intention of those who established in 1890 the Municipal School of Music which was dedicated to the purposes of musical instruction at moderate charges. Maud Davin, in an address to the Dublin Rotary Club in 1931, said:Their ambitions for the City School were as high as any other nation's, and they wished first to impress on all that the Municipal School of Music belonged to the people of Dublin of every class and creed, and that no child in the city possessed of talent need be deprived of that training which might help him or her to be placed among the great singers or the greatest composers of the world.That is what is happening. Fees are being raised, places restricted and people rejected. In a report on the Municipal School of Music in 1934, Joseph O'Brien said "One of the main aims of the school is to make it possible for the children of the people to take up the study of music in its various phases, and to develop the talent of each student to its fullest extent."I received a letter from a neighbour who is a parent of two children. It reads:This is about the young dedicated children from the age of four to seventeen who are currently . but only currently . students of the college of music. No less than a cultural rape and bludgeoning to death of their enthusiasm and musical talents is about to be carried out on these young people under the guise of . wait for it, cutbacks.Senator, I have two children in the college; they have such knots in their stomachs that you can almost feel them physically! They need me to do what I can to save their places and protect their future.A statement from the parents group contains a number of points that must be borne in mind:A number of academic areas are under review, which include the Conservatory of Music and Drama and the provision of additional apprenticeship places; a possible further cut of 150 out of a total of 300 teaching hours per week across the part-time area (mainly instrumental tuition) effective from September 2003; the intention of cancelling both the pre-instrumental and junior workshop classes which could affect up to 100 children; duration of musicianship classes to be reduced from one hour to forty five minutes; significant increases in student fees; auditions to assess every part-time student with a view to reducing the number of students.The Dublin Institute of Technology Act incorporated the college of music in its entirety into the Dublin Institute of Technology without any division of educational areas into first, second and third levels. The college of music had offered, since 1987, degree level qualifications in association with Trinity College. It is worth noting that the Department of Education and Science continued to give the same proportion of overall budget to the Dublin Institute of Technology towards music education as it did to the City of Dublin Vocational Educational Committee when the college of music was an independent college.The first sign of trouble came in 1994. From then on, the college of music's prospectus was permanently withdrawn from publication so parents had no knowledge of the courses on offer. The result was that the general public is no longer informed of the part-time classes in instrumental music, which have been the traditional work of the municipal school of music since 1890. The college is no longer allowed to canvass for students.When the Dublin Institute of Technology structures were drafted, the following phrase came from the statement of Dr. Goldsmith "It is recommended that Dublin Institute of Technology should retain first and second level only until an alternative arrangement is put in place that the Dublin Institute of Technology should seek to provide a junior school for the very talented 1%, who might be expected to pursue a career in music performance." That is elitism and goes against the fundamental ethos under which, in apparently more liberal days, this college was established.When the faculty structures were introduced in 1996, the college of music lost its status as a college with four schools and was reduced to a school within a faculty with four departments. In 1997, there were major fee increases and students were not allowed to take up places. In the spring of 1997, parents were informed that the fees were being increased for £165 to £250. They were also told they had to pay the fees in June, whereas previously they had paid them in September. In September, new students who were willing to pay fees were not allowed to enrol. Heads of departments were instructed that they could only fill 50 places. In September 1997, students were refused places and part-time students reduced from 2,000 to 1,400. On 23 January 2003, at an emergency meeting of staff of the Dublin Institute of Technology Conservatory of Music and Drama, the director of the conservatory announced to staff that all students were to be reassessed and re-auditioned in March, tuition fees were to be increased and parents would be instructed to pay fees for the new academic year by April. This is a disastrous situation which militates against other things.They are told, with regard to September enrolments, that they must pay fees by 1 August, which means that it affects people from Trinity College Dublin, Mater Dei, St. Patrick's College and UCD who traditionally received instrumental tuition in the college of music. They will not know, until after the CAO confirms the university places, whether or not they will be in Dublin, so how can they possibly pay their fees by 1 August? This is complete nonsense.It is worth quoting a letter from Dr. Goldsmith. I do not blame him because I know his intention is to create a great university institution, but must the primary element be shed like a jettisoned rocket and allowed to career back to earth? It would be a real pity. The letter, dated 5 March 2003, is addressed to Ms M. Keane, Ms M. Sheridan and Mr. M. Stanley of the parents groups and states "I have indicated I am not yet in a position to confirm how many students we will be able to accept next year for part-time music tuition." It says nothing about response to talent or need, but merely mentions numbers. The letter continues "The institute has always maintained that it is not possible for Dublin Institute of Technology to provide music education at primary and secondary level on a scale appropriate to needs in Dublin and surrounding areas."It is lamentable that the very man charged with responsibility has to admit he is not capable of delivering it. The reason is because of the forced and inappropriate union of these various institutions. The penultimate paragraph of the letter states:Following the Government's decision not to proceed with plans for the proposed Irish Academy for the Performing Arts, we believe there is an opportunity to once again open the debate on how music education can be truly advanced in Ireland, both for the elite performers in our society and for those for whom it is a hobby and a most rewarding aspect of personal development.That was the intention of the founders of this great Dublin institution, which has been violated and prevented from fulfilling the ambitions and wishes of its original founders by the current situation. I look to the Government to ensure that the conservatory is permitted to continue to perform its marvellous function because it benefits the young people of Ireland as its pupils are drawn from a wide range of people across the country.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	378	I listened to the Senator's eloquent and moving appeal with great interest. I have also entertained many such representations and I share the Senator's concern that musical knowledge as a dimension of our human existence should be diffused as much as possible through the community, irrespective of class origins or ability in performance. I am making this reply on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who wishes to clarify his position in relation to the issue raised by the Senator.The Dublin Institute of Technology is a statutory body established under the Dublin Institute of Technology Act 1992. The principal function of the institute under the 1992 Act is to provide vocational and technical education and training for the economic, technological, scientific, commercial, industrial, social and cultural development of the State. Under the Act, the governing body is required to submit annually an operational programme and budget through the City of Dublin VEC to the Department for approval by the Minister. An annual budget for the institute is allocated on the basis of pay and non-pay requirements following consideration of the programmes and budget submission and having regard to the available funding and to the Government's commitments and priorities.The implementation of the programmes and budget and the management of resources of the institute are matters for which the governing body and management of the institute are responsible. This includes decisions regarding the operation and management of the Dublin Institute of Technology Conservatory of Music and Drama. As is the case with all of the institutes of technology, the final decisions regarding programmes to be provided are matters for the management authorities of individual institutes, within the context of the available funding. The Department of Education and Science's recurrent allocation to the Dublin Institute of Technology for 2003 is €106.7 million. This includes the grant from the Department in respect of free fees.This funding provision for the Dublin Institute of Technology was decided having regard to available resources and to current commitments and priorities. The Minister for Education and Science is anxious to see that problems arising in bodies coming under the aegis of the Department of Education and Science are addressed. However, it would be inappropriate for the Minister to become involved in matters that are properly the function of the governing body and management of the institute.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-20 00:00:00	Prelude	379	I thank the Minister of State for his helpful reply and, in particular, for the remarks he made before reading the prepared script. I would be grateful if he would refer the record of this debate to the Minister for Education and Science with the reminder that, under the 1992 legislation, he is empowered to vary the budget and that he can direct the VEC. We have a large and increasing number of children caught in this pincer and they will be deprived of education otherwise. No amount of nice, warm Civil Service language will get away from the heartbreak of these children who will be deprived of the very qualities the Minister of State so sensitively evoked at the beginning of his contribution.
