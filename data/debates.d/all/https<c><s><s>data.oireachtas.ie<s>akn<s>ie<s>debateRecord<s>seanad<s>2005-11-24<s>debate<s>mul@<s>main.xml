        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_6">Last night in my area of Dublin south west I attended a service of remembrance for those young people who have lost their lives to the scourge of drugs in that area over the past 20 years. It is harrowing to hear of the numbers of people who have lost their lives and families destroyed as a result of the peddling of drugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">Yesterday was a very significant day for the Irish criminal justice system. The Supreme Court handed down what I regard as the most significant judgment in a generation concerning organised crime. The court deserves credit for that judgment and it is right that the House reflects upon it. I refer to the case of Gilligan <i>v</i>. Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_8">It is very important that Irish society and people outside the country know the following - that the laws of this land will come down heavily on those who peddle and traffic drugs into this country; that the laws of this land will protect witnesses who go into the witness protection programme as a means of bringing evidence against such criminals; that those drugs barons who peddle drugs into the country will serve significant periods of time behind bars for their crime; and that the assets accrued as a result of their criminality will be stripped from them and hopefully directed back to the communities upon which they have inflicted such misery for the past 20 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">It is a great day for Irish justice and for this House which passed laws to ensure that this action could be taken against these individuals. These are the same individuals who do not recognise Irish law and who laugh at it but yesterday justice ruled against them. The message has gone out that they will be tackled and taken down.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">Yesterday was also a good day for the Irish justice system in the case of Sr. Bríd Smith, a brave woman who took on the arrogance of some elements of the service and catering sector in the form of a ridiculous publican who some years ago refused to allow a person who was visually impaired into his premises. I congratulate her on her stand and the equality legislation passed in this House.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_12">It is important the House recognises and acknowledges the point raised by Senator Brian Hayes. It is the second issue of its kind in a week. A week ago Ryanair finally conceded that blind people travelling with carers on aeroplanes did not have to make any special arrangements and now the case yesterday has been won.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">I also note a matter with which I would ask the Leader to take issue. Yesterday, I wrote to the Minister for Finance on another issue regarding blind people, namely, that such people, obviously by the nature of their disability, are not able to drive does not mean that they cannot own or need cars. There is a need for recognition in the budget and tax laws for blind persons' carers, who may be their drivers. Such carers need to be recognised in a tax efficient manner in order to give a break to blind persons who need cars and who must buy them. They should receive support in this manner. It is not difficult to do and it is easy to police.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">Not that many people are involved but the issue is as important as a blind person being able to take his or her guide dog onto a premises. I would ask, in other words, that a blind person who owns a car, which is driven by a carer, would be able to claim back tax in the normal way for people with a disability. Blind people are not included in the relevant driving scheme for people with disabilities because, obviously, years ago somebody thought blind people would never drive. Of course they cannot drive but they have drivers, own cars and require our support in that area.</p>

          <from>An Cathaoirleach</from>
          <p eId="para_18">Senator O'Toole, we are not discussing an official.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_10">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_19">I grew up in an environment where to me the essence of a great civil servant was one whose Minister did not know what his or her politics were. I am not referring to this case. I am a member of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, as is Senator Mansergh. The Senator will confirm that the commission regularly comes across situations where issues need to be explained to the parties and the best people to do so might be staff of the House. We dare not send staff of the Houses to address political groups because it would be crossing a line. Similarly, it is important that we as politicians recognise and understand that there are strict rules which people who work closely with Ministers, the Leader and such like must observe. This is not about the Minister of State, Deputy Callely. He is just the person in the middle of it on this occasion. Who is surprised? I am talking about the civil servant.</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_21">I accept that, a Chathaoirligh. I promise I will put the question, not to you or to the House, but to the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, when I see him.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">The issue is that we protect the division between ourselves and the Legislature, as we regularly do in this House. There is also a division between ourselves and the Civil Service. The Civil Service has a job to do. It serves our needs and the needs of the people in a particularly special way. Civil servants are in the middle and they need to stay in the middle. We need to respect that and ensure we endorse the position that the civil servant concerned has taken on this occasion. I will not have a go at the Minister of State until I see him in person.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_23">I am happy to agree with Senator Brian Hayes on the issue of the brave lady who perhaps sorted out, once and for all, the position of people with guide dogs.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">However, as somebody who lives a long way from Dublin I am particularly disturbed by the proposal that seems to have emanated from Dublin City Council that the sort of identification for drivers with disabilities which the rest of the country recognises will not be recognised in Dublin.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_14">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_25">Hear, hear.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_15">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_26">It is unfair to drivers in Dublin. It will make it impossible for drivers with disabilities outside Dublin to come into the city. They will have to pay €100, if these bureaucrats get their way, for the privilege of a separate recognition.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">The council has decided that the standard blue permit is being abused. I heard no evidence of this. The person I heard on the radio stated that all an individual needs to do is get his or her GP to confirm the matter. What does one expect somebody with a disability to do? The council was going to look for independent medical evaluation of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">This approach flies in the face of everything this House, the other House and the political system have learned about people with disabilities. I do not know why Dublin City Council did this. If it was exclusively affecting Dublin, I would leave it to Dublin. However, it is an issue that will impinge particularly on drivers with disabilities from outside Dublin. It needs to be stopped now. It needs Government action to make clear that identifying which drivers have a disability is a matter for primary legislation, not for some daft by-law introduced by Dublin City Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">I ask for a debate on the report of the National Competitiveness Council because what people missed in it was the fact that there were two dissenters, both of whom were trade union representatives. The fundamental dissent was that what was meant to be objective advice to the Government was, in my view, a collection of the ideologies of the individuals.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">The real question is how other small countries in Europe are so much more successful, in terms of competitiveness, than Ireland. There are six small countries within the European Union which are reckoned to be more competitive, with Finland being the most competitive in the world. A real national competitiveness council would be telling us why Finland is better than us, not producing daft, politically unsustainable proposals about property taxes, etc. That is what we want to know. If the National Competitiveness Council cannot do better than that report, then the Government should consider getting rid of it completely because it serves no purpose and is probably very expensive.</p>

Where gardaí are placed at various points, they are often prevented from taking action unless suspicious that a person is under the influence of drink. I would ask for action to be taken on this issue. If it requires a constitutional amendment, the Government should get on with proposing it. Let us not wait a long time to implement this proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">I support what my colleague, Senator Brian Hayes, stated on yesterday's judgment which has important implications nationally. It has important implications for the Limerick area. The Garda was correctly praised for the way it has taken on the drugs trade in Limerick.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">A person was jailed recently for murdering Mr. Brian Fitzgerald for taking on a drugs gang in the night club in which he was involved. He is prepared to participate in the witness protection programme. In that context, he is prepared to reveal who was involved in this situation. In order to get to grips with crime, the witness protection programme is extremely important. Yesterday's decision has wide-ranging implications.</p>

          <p eId="para_76">Yesterday we had an important and balanced debate on the war in Iraq, extraordinary rendition and torture. Will the Leader help the Seanad by pursuing this matter, first, by continuing to monitor the situation, as we did previously, by having rolling debates and, second, by sending the report of yesterday's debate to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern? While the Minister was ably represented in the debate by two Ministers of State, he was not present in the House. It is important that he have a copy of the debate because the House was told he would raise the matter with Condoleezza Rice. A copy of the debate would be a valuable instrument at that meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">I would also like a copy of the debate to be sent to the US ambassador. Following yesterday's debate, a television programme on Channel 4 interviewed a victim in this case. An aeroplane which lands regularly at Shannon Airport, of which viewers were shown photographs, was implicated. A Swiss Member of Parliament is establishing a committee to investigate this situation. Denmark has banned the aeroplane, Austrian fighter jets intercepted it and escorted it out of Austrian airspace and Hungary has searched it. We have, as yet, done nothing. There is now a Council of Europe investigation into a particular flight. The registration details of this aeroplane, about which we have complained, its itinerary and the dates of the flights are listed, and Shannon Airport is included in that naming process.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">For the first time, this aeroplane, about which we have done nothing, is clearly identified. If the Minister for Foreign Affairs is to raise the matter, it would be important for him to know of the strong feeling on all sides of the House in this regard. The aeroplane is known as the "Guantanamo express". It is a shame that we allow the "Guantanamo express" to pass through our airspace.</p>

The Department of Finance has a major role in allowing increased flexibility, in particular with regard to disabled passengers. As Senator O'Toole stated, blind people are not included for the purposes of these benefits. We should have a debate to try to achieve changes to the regulations which would, hopefully, be announced by the Minister for Finance in the budget. If the debate was held soon we might get movement from the Department of Finance on this issue.</p>

There is a strong view, with which I concur, that it is neither manageable nor practical in its current format. If we are serious about the pig and poultry industry, on which the nitrates directive would have a devastating impact, we should be seriously negotiating a derogation. There is a strong feeling that the Department of Agriculture and Food is taking a laid back approach to the matter. Will the Leader ensure that proper interest is immediately taken by the Department?

I hope that this will be the case but the tentative feedback I have received from different quarters is that only 40% of farmers will be paid before Christmas. I hope this figure is wrong. I ask that inquiries be made through the Leader to the Department of Agriculture and Food to discover the stage at which payments are at present because we must ensure farmers and their families are paid before Christmas.</p>
          <p eId="para_85">If the figure of 40% is in some way accurate, we need an emergency debate on the issue because we are dealing with farmers' livelihoods and income for Christmas. Irish farmers bought into the single farm payment. It is an important issue and if the figure of 40% is accurate it should be debated as a matter of priority within the next week.</p>

          <p eId="para_91">Will the Leader arrange for a debate on the future of An Bord Pleanála? I ask this in the context of a decision taken by the board last week on the new M9 road between Waterford and Dublin. The inspector of the board made five clear recommendations that the section of road between Gowran and Stoneyford in County Kilkenny should not be built, for a variety or reasons. However, the board backed the building of the road on that route. Such anomalies cannot be allowed to exist. The Leader should arrange a debate on the issue as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_92">Senator Brian Hayes, the Leader of the Opposition, told us he attended a poignant service for those who lost their lives to drugs. He welcomed yesterday's judgment of the Supreme Court. We are always quick to decry court judgments but we would all welcome this judgment, although one should not comment on any judgment of the courts. Nonetheless, the lessons from the judgment were very strong and should impact heavily on those who engage in that type of trade.</p>
          <p eId="para_93">Senator Hayes was also full of admiration for Sr. Bríd Smith, who took her equality case. It was wonderful, because I am sure it was difficult for her to say that she had gone to a pub, even with her dog. When I saw it on the television I was startled momentarily until I realised she had gone there for coffee. Even if she had gone for something else, what harm? She was great to take the case. I was pleased that the new pub owners said they were not going to engage in further infringements of the Equality Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_94">Senator O'Toole, who has had to leave the Chamber, welcomed the decision referred to by Senator Hayes and the fact that the scales had fallen from the eyes of Ryanair as regards people travelling who are visually impaired. I agree with that. He raised an interesting point as regards cars for the disabled. If someone is blind, he or she cannot be licensed to drive a car, but somebody will be driving on his or her behalf. In such cases the driver should be entitled to the disabled driver's allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">Senator O'Toole also raised the matter of the particularly brave civil servant, which I do not want to go into as it is right we do not identify such people by name. I fully agree with the demarcation. I have always adhered to this convention in the various Departments in which I have worked throughout my public life and I have never met anyone who wanted it changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">Senator Ryan raised the fact that Dublin City Council will not recognise the blue form which disabled people put on their cars to enable them to have particular parking spaces.

          <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
          <p eId="para_131">I welcome this opportunity to address Seanad Éireann on the Government's pre-budget Estimates for 2006. Before I proceed to outline the Government's spending plans for next year, I would like to review the economic and budgetary outlook and the background to the 2006 Estimates. In framing the Estimates, the Government has continued its policy of prudent management of the economy and public finances. We will comfortably achieve our budget targets for 2005. With tax revenues for 2005 running strongly ahead of projections we will have a higher current budget surplus than was forecast at budget time last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">As a result of these policies, we have achieved sustained economic and social progress over the past decade. Our economic growth rate of 7% has been more than twice the EU average since 1997. At the end of this year, our debt to GDP ratio, at about 29%, will be one of the lowest in Europe. We are effectively a full employment economy. There are now around 500,000 more people at work compared with 1997. Over 720,000 income earners are likely to be out of the tax net this year compared with 380,000 in 1997, when we took office.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">The pursuit of prudent fiscal policies has also generated the resources to enable the Government to make real improvements in day-to-day services and to target priority social needs. On a pre-budget basis, gross current expenditure in 2006 at €42.2 billion will have increased by two and a half times the 1997 level. These increased resources have financed real improvements in public services and made a real difference to the quality of people's lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">We have provided for significant increases in social welfare payment rates. The rate of payment of the old age contributory pension has been increased from €99 per week in 1997 to €179.30 in 2005. This is a nominal increase of 81% at a time when cost of living increases were just under 40%.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">The rate of payment of child benefit for a first and second child in 1997 was €38 and this has now risen to a rate of payment of €141.60 in 2005, an increase of 185% in real terms. We have reduced the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level from 22.3:1 in 1996-97 to 17:1 in 2003-04 and at second level from 16:1 to 13.6:1 in the same period.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">The Government has increased frontline staff in the health service from 76% of total staff in 1997 to 80%. These include 2,000 additional medical and dental personnel, almost 7,000 additional nurses, 620 additional consultant posts, bringing the total to 1,947, as well as nearly 7,000 other health professionals such as speech and language therapists, physiotherapists and social workers. Patient discharges from hospitals in 2004, in-patient and day cases, increased by 4.4% over 2003. In line with international best practice, the emphasis is on day work and these discharges increased by 8% in the same period.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">Investment is critical to supporting sustainable economic growth and national competitiveness. The Government has more than trebled Exchequer capital investment from €2 billion in 1997 to almost €6.6 billion, including capital carryover, in 2006. More than 70 national roads projects totalling over 500 km. have been completed since 1997, including 280 km to motorway or dual carriageway standard. Service enhancements include the doubling of the capacity on the DART and the Luas now carries an average of over 65,000 passengers a day. Over 45,000 social housing units have been built, while €8.5 billion will have been invested in our schools, hospitals and other facilities in the health and education areas since we came into office.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">Gross public expenditure is expected to be around €45.5 billion in 2005. It is expected that there will be a small underspend on current expenditure of around €75 million. Exchequer capital spending this year will be almost €6 billion, including carryover of €237 million from 2004, an increase of 15%. The multi-annual system for managing capital with its 10% carryover arrangement facilitates better management of capital programmes and projects. It ensures that significant amounts of money are not lost to the capital budget and, as a result, €286 million of capital not spent in 2005 will be available to Departments for spending in 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">The 2006 pre-budget Estimates provide for gross expenditure of around €48.5 billion. Of this figure, €42.2 billion is current and €6.3 billion is capital. It represents an increase of almost €3 billion over 2005 or around 6.6%. Some €2.7 billion of the overall additional spending provision of €3 billion in 2006 is allocated to day-to-day public services, bringing the total gross provision to €42.2 billion for the year. This is a 6.9% increase on the 2005 forecast outturn. Nearly €1.9 billion, or 70%, of the additional €2.7 billion is provided for three priority areas, namely, the social welfare allocation for 2006 is €12.4 billion on a pre-budget basis; the Department of Health and Children allocation will be over €12 billion, an increase of €750 million or about 9% on an underlying basis when account is taken of a number of exceptional one-off expenses this year in respect of the establishment of the HSE; and the Department of Education and Science allocation in 2006 will increase by €530 million, or about 8%, to €7.2 billion. I will make additional provision for social welfare payment rates on budget day to build on the substantial improvements in welfare provision already made by this Government since 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">In addition to this €750 million increase on health spending, a provisional allocation of €400 million is being made in 2006 towards the cost of repaying charges for long-stay care in former health board funded institutions. Some €250 million is included in the allocation for service improvements including, among other things, disability and mental health services, the commissioning of new units, primary care services, and medical education and training. The increases in disability services are over and above the package announced in the budget last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">The €530 million increase in current funding for education will allow for service improvements in key areas such as a one point reduction in the staffing schedule for primary schools with effect from September 2006, as well as a further one point reduction in 2007, creating about 200 additional posts in primary schools in both 2006 and 2007. We are also providing for the full year cost of 590 additional resource teachers for pupils with special needs appointed in September 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">One in five teachers in our primary schools is dealing specifically with special needs. The cost of 270 new posts is also being provided under the programme for delivering equality of opportunity. The "three for two" arrangement on school buses is being phased out by December 2006. There will be an increase of 10.8% in funding for capitation grants for the maintenance and upkeep of our schools, while there is also an increased provision for third level research and development, in line with strategic needs of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">In the justice area, the provision for current spending on the Garda Vote is being increased by €105 million, or 9%, to €1.3 billion. This will facilitate the implementation of the Government's commitment to expand the force by 2,000 to a new complement of 14,000. The 2006 provision will allow for the employment of 12,920 gardaí, an increase of 700 on 2004, or 2,000 on 1997 levels. Expenditure on child care in the Estimates has increased from €500 million in 1997 to €1.3 billion before the budget. I will make further provision for child care on budget day. The 2006 allocation for the equal opportunities child care programme is more than €100 million. Some €55 million in current spending will be provided for staffing grants to community child care facilities and supports to city and county child care committees, and an additional €47 million will be provided for capital spending. We envisage the creation of 15,000 extra places during this period. The 2006 pre-budget capital allocation will bring the number of extra child care places funded under the programme from none in 1997 to approximately 30,000 by the end of 2006. That child care programme began in the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">Expenditure on the provision of services for people with disabilities will come to approximately €3 billion this year, which constitutes an increase of more than €400 million over the 2004 figures. The 2006 Estimates provide for spending of almost €3.3 billion for disability specific services. This is an increase of €300 million or 10% and, as I have stated, includes €135 million under the special disability package announced in my last budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">As for overseas development aid, the Government has committed itself to reaching a target of 0.7% of GNP by 2012 as well as an interim target of 0.5% of GNP by 2007. This will involve increasing the present provision of €500 million to €1.5 billion during that time. Next year's Estimates provide for a total commitment of €675 million, or 0.47%, of GNP for overseas development aid in 2006. This represents an increase of €129 million, or 24%, on the allocation this year, which came to €546 million. Ireland's contribution rate at 0.47% of GNP compares favourably with current indicative figures of 0.19% in the United States, an average of 0.3% in the OECD and an average of 0.43% in the EU for 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">With regard to capital spending, I will announce a new five year capital envelope from 2006 to 2010 on budget day. This will be consistent with the Government's overall priority commitment to capital investment. It will also incorporate the increased investment on transport within the Transport 21 framework. The total cash spend on investment on a pre-budget basis in 2006 will come to almost €6.6 billion, including the €186 million carryover from 2005 to 2006. This is an increase of almost €600 million, or 10%, over 2005, before any budget day additions.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">The Government is committed to achieving value for money from public expenditure for the taxpayer. We have introduced a number of reforms in recent years such as the five year multi-annual capital envelopes, revised capital appraisal guidelines and planned improvements in construction and construction related contracts. Already, we see evidence of significant improvement in the management of capital projects. Of the 23 major roads projects under way under the aegis of the National Roads Authority this year, a total of 19 are either on or below budget and will be delivered on or ahead of schedule. While total project costs for all 23 projects this year was taken to be €1.18 billion, the outturn cost is expected to be €1.17 billion. Hence, that simple statistic gives the lie to the idea that the Government is incapable of managing major projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">Building on recent reforms, we announced two new initiatives to further improve the approach to securing value for money, namely, an initiative on management of information and communications technology projects and consultancies as well as additional general measures on value for money, which I announced on 20 October this year. Departments have been asked to give effect to the measures which can be implemented immediately and work is under way with regard to updating the necessary guidelines and other required steps to implement all these measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">With regard to public service pay and numbers, the gross provision for 2006 to fund public service pay and pensions is €16.4 billion, an increase of €1.1 billion, or 7%. It makes full provision for the final phase of Sustaining Progress and includes some €430 million for service improvements and extra numbers. The extra numbers are primarily employed in a front line capacity in health, education and the Garda. The percentage of total Government expenditure in respect of pay and pensions remains under 40%, which was also the position when the Government came to office in 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">The suggestion that pay has become a bigger component of total expenditure is not statistically correct. Despite the contrary perception created in some quarters, there has not been an increase in the share of overall current expenditure attributable to pay and pensions. In 1997, this came to approximately 40% of gross current spending and next year, on a pre-budget basis, it will come to almost 39%.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">While the Government remains committed to controlling public sector numbers as part of its approach to managing public expenditure and securing better value for money, the policy is not implemented indiscriminately. Where necessary, the Government has been prepared to increase numbers to meet priority requirements in front line and essential services. The total number employed in the public service in 2005 comes to just over 290,000. We have held numbers in the Civil Service, the local authorities, defence and the non-commercial semi-State sectors below their 2002 levels. However, as I already mentioned and given the service improvements I have outlined, we have allowed increases in front line staff in the key areas of health, education and the Garda. The Opposition calls for more services while simultaneously criticising the Government for employing people to implement and provide such services. I have yet to work out its formula, whereby services will be provided in health and education without the employment of human beings.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">We will provide some €3 billion in additional resources, bringing the total 2006 provision for public service spending on a pre-budget basis to €48.5 billion. The Government's fiscal and economic policies have transformed the economy and have led to significant economic and social progress. Naturally, challenges remain which we must meet. We will see further progress when I make additional provision on budget day for social welfare, child care, care of the elderly and capital investment. I commend the Government's pre-budget 2006 Estimates to the Seanad as figures for which any of my colleague in Europe would give his or her eye or teeth.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_155">I wondered whether the Minister might have been referring to his predecessor.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">I welcome the Minister to the House and am glad of the opportunity to have a discussion on the publication of the Book of Estimates. Contrary to the Minister's statements, his Estimates do not reveal any genuine reform of the process in its entirety. Given that this has been his first full year in this office, I had thought we might witness a new departure from him, as well as genuine visible signs of the Government's new-found commitment to receiving value for money. The Minister mentioned 19 road projects under way at present which are on time and under budget and claimed that this gives the lie to the proposition that the Government cannot produce value for money for taxpayers. The Minister should repeat this claim on their completion. Only then would he be able to give the lie to the widely and correctly held view that the Government wastes scandalous amounts of public money on infrastructural projects and other general spending issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">During the last number of months, there have been a number of different disclosures, particularly relating to the Department of Health and Children. The Minister is at great pains to emphasise, here and elsewhere, the increases in expenditure within the Department of Health and Children authorised by the Government since 1997. In the intervening period, contrary to the picture which the Government would like to paint, it is clear that the service provided has become worse. A threefold increase in expenditure coinciding with delivery of a worse service clearly indicates an abject failure on the part of the Government, of successive Ministers for Health and Children, including the current Minister for Finance, and his predecessor. In this regard the Minister has nothing to crow about in this House or any other venue.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">During the past couple of years, the Government has proclaimed a number of key priorities with respect to the finance portfolio. The Minister referred to the numbers employed in the public service. A guideline was issued to the effect that numbers would be reduced by approximately 5,000. The cumulative increase in the last couple of years is over 14,000. Nobody argues with the need for increased front line staff. I support the Minister's additional funding to increase the number of primary teachers and his call for increased numbers of frontline healthcare workers. However, I cannot stand over further inflating the numbers of non-frontline staff in the public service and I cannot see how the Minister can stand over it. In certain parts of the public service those numbers continue to increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">While the Government has committed to keeping current expenditure increases in line with nominal GNP, this has not happened over the last couple of years or in this Book of Estimates. On budget day the Minister will announce additional increases and other measures. I take issue with a number of categories of funding. The Minister reaffirmed the Government's broken promise about the 2,000 extra gardaí and contradicted himself. Given the figures that have been announced, the 2,000 gardaí cannot and will not be provided.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnPaulPhelan" eId="spk_106">
          <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_164">There is a clear difference between the figures in the Estimates and the commitment made by the Government after the 2002 general election, and no amount of verbiage by the Ministers for Finance or Justice, Equality and Law Reform can change that fact. The figures speak for themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">Contrary to the pronouncements by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, we have seen a 23% increase in expenditure on overtime and wages for prison officers in the past couple of years. We had a number of debates in the House on that issue and while the Minister has spoken strongly on that point, as on others, his actions are weaker than his words. The Estimates announce an incredible 92% decrease in funding for courthouses although many of these facilities are dilapidated. In Thomastown the District Court will not continue in its current building because those who work there refuse to use it.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">Many people who have spoken on the announcement of the Estimates have referred to local authority funding. The Government proposes a 4% or 5% increase in local authority funding. Given wage and other inflation, this is a backward step and will oblige local authorities to increase local charges. Many members on both sides of the House have expressed frustration as we all deal with local authorities daily. We have seen a derisory 1% increase in the disabled persons grant and in other categories of housing assistance. Given the existing backlog in those schemes, a 1% increase is a slap in the face to the people who are in need of those supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">The Estimates propose an 8% decrease in the amount of funding for the water and sewerage service programme. This runs contrary to comments on the need to increase spending on water and sewage treatment facilities throughout the country. It beggars belief that the Government could announce a €35 million decrease. I am baffled at the proposed decrease in funding for the food safety budget when we hear daily about threats from such issues as avian 'flu and beef imports from South America. It is incredible.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">The Minister is at pains to point out the increases he has announced for the Department of Education and Science. I welcome the fact that extra teachers will be provided but to paraphrase the Minister's Cabinet colleague, Deputy Noel Dempsey, it is just a drop in the ocean. Some 73,000 primary school students are in classes of over 30 and 5,000 in classes of over 35. The Minister's 500 extra teachers will not address that backlog, never mind the Government's commitment to bring the ratio of pupils to teachers to the low 20s. While it is a small step in the right direction it goes nowhere near the Government's commitments and I see no reason for the Government to crow about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">The Estimates allocate €2,000 extra for the National Educational Psychological Service across the country. The Leas-Chathaoirleach is probably sick of hearing me raise this issue, as I do so at every possible opportunity. Only 51% of children in primary education have access to the service and the Government has given them a slap in the face with this announcement, which constitutes a net cut in funding. Less than 50% of primary school students will have access to educational psychological services. That is a disgrace. In my own County Kilkenny, only 17% of primary schools have access to the service. If the Minister is to make extra announcements on budget day and wishes to do something in the area of education, this is one area where he could, with a relatively small amount of money, have a significant impact on the lives of young children and nip in the bud problems that could develop into greater issues in later life.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">Contrary to the Minister's announcement on Transport 21, there is relatively no increase in funding for transport proposed in the Book of Estimates as opposed to what was announced for this year. To some extent that gives the lie to the grandiose proposals announced under Transport 21, which constitute a rehash of promises that were broken over the last five or six years.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">Another scandalous situation this Government has allowed to develop relates to the hospital service, in particular to accident and emergency services. The Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, announced her proposals just after she assumed the position, yet the accident and emergency crisis is deteriorating rather than improving. During the lifetime of this Government since 2002, accident and emergency and inpatient bed charges will have doubled if the proposals in the Book of Estimates are approved. That cannot improve access to or provision of health services for those who most need it. The Book of Estimates contains no reference to increased funding for acute hospital beds but I hope this will be announced on budget day.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">Contrary to the Minister's remarks on the increase in funding for the health services, it has been clear over the past years that the rate of health inflation is far higher than the average rate throughout the economy, and any increases he has announced in the Estimates will be more than swallowed up by the increases in health costs over the next two years. I am very disappointed at what the Minister has announced. While this is only part one of a two-part process, I hope he will learn some lessons and act on vital areas before the budget is announced.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">I briefly wish to mention domestic violence, an issue which was recently debated in the House. The debate produced no agreement but contrary to all the platitudes from the Government, the increase in funding to address violence against women is a paltry 3%. After inflation, that is a decrease in real terms. Given that a relatively small sum would be involved, this might be usefully corrected before the budget.</p>

          <p eId="para_174">I warmly welcome the Minister and his officials. It may well be the case that Germany and France need new economic departures. What is required in Ireland is a steady hand on the tiller, which the Minister is providing, allowing us to continue the country's fantastic progress in recent years. The debt to GDP ratio continues to decline. The Minister mentioned employment having increased since 1997 by 500,000, but I believe that by 2007 employment will have increased by 1 million, double the 1987 level. That will also be an enormous achievement. In that context the fact that according to the Estimates, €42 billion will be able to be spent on services, which does not provide the full picture since the budget is to follow, is very impressive by any standards. There is no sign or talk of cutbacks.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">Of course, the Minister must operate within a safety margin, and it is very important that he do so. Without such a margin, if there were a sudden deterioration in circumstances, one could find oneself surprisingly quickly knocking up against the 3% EMU limit. Many other EU economies have got into difficulty on that account. One can open one's newspaper any day of the week and see that we are under constant competitive pressures from various sources. Perhaps I might mention two or three that have arisen recently. Our sugar industry is under pressure in Brussels. There is the problem of the Irish Ferries dispute and the displacement of employment. The US is also scrutinising transfer pricing by US multinationals. The net point is that we must stay on our toes.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">I warmly welcome the extra spending on education and the details given by the Minister on extra teachers. If he has any spare room in his budget, school buildings are a particularly worthy form of investment. I attended the opening of a Gaelscoil in Tipperary earlier this week, and the quality was fantastic. There is money in the Estimates for infrastructure, and I imagine that there will be some more in the budget itself. That underpins the Transport 21 plan. To provide some perspective from outside the jurisdiction, I will quote from the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i>. An article on the business pages of 21 November by Carlton Baxter complains that there is no real debate on the Northern budget and about the dominance of the public service sector. He writes:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_177">That can't be a healthy situation at a time when our neighbours in the Republic are investing heavily in everything under the sun, especially their infrastructure. Their economy just keeps on growing.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_178">How ironic that at a time when the Dáil is investing in motorways we have a draft budget that cuts the amount of money needed to repair and maintain our roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">Every year that passes, new projects come on stream. Criticism is made of the fact that a quick expansion in the late 1990s caused some inflationary problems. It was a new problem for us to cope with. However, no planning whatsoever was carried out by the rainbow coalition on infrastructure. One searches their election documents in vain for any serious reference.</p>

          <p eId="para_192">Exactly. Another point made is that people can see there is a great deal of extra spending but that the money is being wasted or not producing any results. Health is always picked on as an example. I do not know whether Senators listened to what I thought was a very interesting contribution by the vice-president of the IMO the day after the Estimates. I admit that she was highly critical of the Government that the increase had not been even greater than the percentage allowed for in the Book of Estimates. However, she very forcibly made the point that the extra money that had been provided in recent years was not going to waste but being spent on improved procedures and throughput.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">I wish the Opposition would stop constantly knocking our health services and suggesting that it is all a waste of money. They should talk to people in the medical profession. Regarding hospitals, the Estimates have allowed for the vacant wards in Clonmel, County Tipperary, to be staffed and used. A complementary phase in Cashel will also get under way.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">Many references were made to underpin criticism of Government spending in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report. He was around in 1995, 1996 and 1997, and he will still be here in ten years, regardless of what Government is in power. Does anyone seriously believe that, one day, if the right sort of Government comes along, we will close down his office? Of course we will not do so. He is doing his job, which is to scrutinise and criticise Government expenditure over a vast area. The fact is that he found things to criticise last year and the previous one, as he will next year and thereafter. Obviously, people will have to take the lessons on board. However, let us not imagine that, when the Opposition was in Government, the Comptroller and Auditor General did not make highly critical comments on projects evidencing overspending, lax controls and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">While there is much political criticism of the Estimates, we are hearing from the Opposition in private that it is a great time to be in Government. Much of the criticism involves spokespersons going through the motions. Bringing forward the introduction of draft Estimates to September would not serve any useful purpose because one would have a less clear idea of the outturn for the current year. I share the traditional attitude of Charles Haughey, expressed when he was in Opposition, to the respective roles of the Opposition and Government, namely, it is the role of the Government to govern and make decisions and the role of the Opposition to scrutinise and criticise rather than act as a co-decision maker. The same applies to Government backbenchers, which, for this purpose, we are also. Our job is to make——</p>

          <p eId="para_198">The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has a point on strengthening the labour inspectorate but I imagine this will be addressed in social partnership negotiations. I am glad the Fine Gael spokesperson did not overemphasise the issue of public service numbers because gardaí, teachers and health workers are all needed. Recruitment restrictions were introduced in 2002 or 2003, when it appeared that we might be facing difficulties, but the economic outlook has brightened considerably in the meantime. Of course one must have regard to sustainability in the longer term but, in general, the number of public servants is not excessive. For example, the number of public servants employed in Northern Ireland is approximately 10% higher than it is here and therefore it is not correct to argue our public service is overburdened.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">The Fine Gael spokesperson in the Dáil referred to the need for much greater prioritisation, thus strongly implying that initiatives should be dropped or put on the backburner. In this regard I presume he meant rather more than electronic voting. I would like him to become much more specific before the next general election in regard to the Government programmes he would like to see dropped or cut back, no doubt to make room for others. In the approach to elections, the public listens to the promises of various parties but is not told what will be displaced to fulfil those promises. They are not told the unstated plans to drop certain initiatives. Perhaps decentralisation——</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#DerekMcDowell" eId="spk_129">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_207">During the almost five years in which I had the pleasure of shadowing the former Minister for Finance, Charles McCreevy, I developed a real hatred of the word "prudence", which is most beloved of our friends in Merrion Street. Rarely did Mr. McCreevy make a speech that was not littered with references to "prudence" and "prudent". One develops an understanding fairly quickly as to what "prudence" means in finance-speak. It essentially means one does as little as possible with the taxation and welfare systems. One provides enough money for increasing public sector pay and, if one has a few euro left over, one provides for some capital infrastructure improvements. Ideally, one does nothing else. "Prudence" is basically a code for saying one will not spend the few bob one can afford to spend to improve public services, and for congratulating oneself on not doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">When Mr. McCreevy made his speeches, littered as they were with the word "prudent", he never took them to heart. He had no intention of being prudent because he had notions and schemes concerning what he wanted to do within the Department of Finance. In fairness to him, he succeeded in implementing many of them. Many of them were bitterly opposed by my party.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">I suspect the current Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, may actually intend to do as little as possible. He may now be giving us a steady-as-you-go message. The Estimates we are discussing support that notion. The overall spending increase is predicted to be 7%. Given that growth for this year is likely to be in the order of 4.5% and inflation in the order of 2.5% or 3%, the spending increase seems to be part of a steady-as-you-go system under which no more will be spent next year than this year. This is also revealed in the detail of the individual Estimates, some of which my colleagues have mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">The Estimates reveal that the Minister has no notion or vision as to what he wants to do with public services. It is true that the public finances are quite healthy, perhaps healthier than most of us imagined they would be two years ago, yet there is no vision regarding what should be done with them. We knew what Mr. McCreevy wanted to do when he had extra money — he wanted to give it away in tax breaks. He did so all the time. Given that Mr. McCreevy is safely over in Brussels, the Government in its current manifestation says it does not want to go down this road but wants to improve public services. However, there is no alternative vision and we get no sense from the Government of what exactly it wants to do with public services, including the health service. In so far as we do have grand plans, they have no credibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">This is a problem not only for the Government but for all who want to see serious and sustained improvements in public services. I have said this many times in the House. It becomes more difficult for those of us who want to see sustained improvements to argue for them if the general impression of the public is that spending thereon is a waste of money and that it has been misled or lied to consistently over the years. The examples are many and I will not elaborate on them because I and other Senators have done so on previous occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">It is now clear that the 2001 health strategy was entirely bogus and that there was never any serious intent or commitment to delivering it. Senator Mansergh mentioned the comments of the vice president of the Irish Medical Organisation some days ago. He did not mention that she also stated the commitment made in 2001 to bring 3,000 extra beds into the health system within ten years has so far resulted in no extra beds at all. The net number of inpatient beds in our hospitals is now lower than it was in 2001. Given that such an important linchpin of the 2001 strategy has clearly proven to be bogus, it is very difficult to invest any credibility in the plan at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">The same is true of the national spatial strategy. When it was put under any measure of pressure, especially on foot of the decentralisation plans some months after it was published, it was proven not to be worth the paper it was written on. We can hardly be surprised that people have invested no credibility in the Transport 21 plan recently announced by the Government given that virtually all its individual elements had been announced more than once over the past ten years or so. We have a problem in that the Government has no vision for the public services. It will take any alternative Government some time to deal with this.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">Let me consider some of the individual Estimates. I was struck by the headline increase of 10% in health spending, which on the face of it appears to be quite generous. However, the health Estimate is symptomatic of the underlying problems associated with so many of the other Estimates. In the first instance, at least half of the increase will go towards increases in pay or personnel. Only €250 million to €400 million, depending on how one counts it, will actually be spent on improving services.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">I give due credit to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, as much as to the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, for following through on the commitment made in last year's budget to increase the number of residential places for disability and mental health. It is clear that when the Minister for Finance has an interest in and commitment to an area, as he clearly developed during his time as Minister for Health and Children if he did not have it beforehand, there is follow through. That is clear in the health Estimates.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">However, nowhere else is there follow through. On many occasions we have examined the 2002 commitments of this Government with regard to ending waiting lists, providing medical cards and so forth. It has broken those promises. We do not need to go back to 2002. Consider what happened last year when the current Minister, Deputy Harney, took office. The central feature of her health budget last year was the €70 million additional allocation to accident and emergency services. We were told that the problem with accident and emergency services would be solved before the end of March, if memory serves. We were then told it would be solved before Easter and then that it would be early summer. It has not yet been solved.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">Not only has it not been solved, it appears to have been forgotten. There is no specific commitment of money in this year's Estimates for accident and emergency services. We are told that the improvements undertaken last year are continuing. That is another way of saying that most of them have not been delivered, which will not be a surprise to anybody since the problem is as bad now as it was then.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">Last year, the Minister also gave a commitment to provide 30,000 additional normal medical cards and up to 200,000 doctor-only cards. We are aware of the problems that have bedevilled the doctor-only cards. As a result, virtually none has been issued. One would not have thought that the same problems should apply to the 30,000 additional medical cards which were promised last year. However, the additional figure is closer to 2,000 since last year. What has gone wrong? Where is the planning?</p>
          <p eId="para_219">It is no surprise that when people look at the detail of commitments made, even as recently as in last year's budget, they no longer take them seriously. What people get is the Estimates, a fine document that nobody can understand. That is hardly a surprise given that it contains large figures which do not mean anything to anybody. They also get detailed press releases from Departments. They cannot understand the Book of Estimates and they know from experience that the press releases do not have substance within a short time. This is leading to cynicism, which is becoming a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">There is a difficulty with capital funding. Senator Mansergh mentioned the article in the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i> last week. We are spending far less than we can reasonably afford to spend on infrastructure. It is true that in the late 1990s there was a capacity problem in the construction industry. It was difficult to get motorways built at reasonable cost because, frankly, Irish contractors were not up to the job. There were also a limited number of competitors in the market and it was difficult to get tenders at reasonable prices. That is no longer the case. The construction industry has changed dramatically in the past three or four years. There is significant additional capacity in the system and we have more experience. There is no reason not to spend a great deal more money more quickly and still expect to complete the project reasonably, within budget and to get good value for money.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">In that context, the fact that we did not spend €285 million of the capital expenditure provision for this year is remarkable and requires a reasonable explanation. Neither did we spend €236 million of the 2004 allocation for which there was no explanation. It appears that the carryover facility which Departments now enjoy is leading to a system where they carryover their maximum allocation every year. It is becoming institutionalised within the system. It was never intended to be that way or to allow for such significant underspend. One could say that otherwise the Departments would just spend the money on things that had not been worked out properly and the money would be wasted. It has to be welcomed that they are not wasting the funding. Nonetheless, it is remarkable.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">Even in Departments that are regularly crying out for money, such as the Department of Transport and the Department of Health and Children, there is a significant capital underspend. It is approximately €56 million in the Department of Health and Children this year and approximately €100 million in the Department of Transport. We are entitled to a decent explanation for this. For years we were told that things could not be done because we could not afford it. Now, the money has been allocated to the Departments which claim to need it but they cannot spend it. That requires an explanation from the Government and from the Departments concerned but that explanation has not been forthcoming.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">The policy on the Garda is remarkable. This is an extraordinary situation where there is a significant increase in the funding provided by the Department of Finance for the Garda Síochána yet there is no agreement between the two Departments and Ministers as to what it will achieve and how quickly it will achieve it. The Minister is well aware that there is great public sensitivity about the issue of crime. Virtually everybody who examines this issue agrees there is a need for additional gardaí on the streets. The Government has been aware of this for some time and promised to provide 2,000 extra gardaí. We do not yet have them and it is clear they will not be provided by the time of the next election. If Senator Mansergh believes that does not matter, he is in for a rude awakening in a couple of years.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">The least we deserve is clarity on this matter. We need to know that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not trying to pull the wool over our eyes. If it is the case, as is suggested, that he had not factored in the number of gardaí who are retiring, it is difficult to believe that could have been done accidentally. It is clear the Minister is playing games.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">There is also a clear commitment with regard to education. There were few enough commitments in 2002 but one was that most, if not all, children under nine years of age would be in classes of under 20 pupils by the next election. At present, there are 100,000 children in classes of over 30 pupils. Notwithstanding the employment of 200 extra teachers this year and 300 next year, the Government will not come close to meeting its stated target on the pupil-teacher ratio. We must confront the fact that while the overall averages might look good, there are serious blackspots, particularly in Kildare, Meath and parts of west Dublin where a large number of classes have more than 30 children, and in some cases more than 33 or 34. In many cases that is the norm. That is unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">I heard Deputy Andrews from Dún Laoghaire speaking in the Dáil debate last evening. He said it must be terrible for Opposition spokespersons at this time of the year when the Government announces all its grand plans. I have news for the Deputy. It is not terrible because we just do not believe the Government, nor does the public.</p>

          <p eId="para_232">One wonders what state we would be in now if the Labour Party had anything to do with our economy. With regard to the number of gardaí, at the end of 2006 they will number 14,000 between those who are fully attested and those in training.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">It surprises me a little that the Estimates do not get more attention from the media and elsewhere. There are three arms to the financial debate each year — the Estimates, which we are debating today, the budget and the subsequent Finance Bill. Most of the spending is dealt with in the Estimates. The budget is probably the sexy aspect to the debate, as it were, on which everybody seems to focus. However, this debate is important and should get more attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">We were able to spend a great deal of money and develop programmes in so many areas because of prudent management of our finances over the years. In the mid-1970s, the debt to GDP ratio was 130%. In 1997, it was down to 65% and at the end of 2006 it will be down to 29%. That is a remarkable performance and it was achieved despite the fact that large amounts were paid out on the various tribunals, deafness claims, awards to haemophiliacs, claims by those abused as children in our State institutions and the nursing home charges problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">Despite all those payouts, however, we remain in a strong economic position and that is welcome because there is a time-bomb on the horizon regarding future pensions for our elderly population. That is something the Minister's predecessor, former Deputy Charlie McCreevy, recognised some years ago and took steps to try to correct with a view to providing funding for the future. We know people are living longer and there will be more pressure in the future to fund this area. That is why we must keep a rein on expenditure and ensure the economy continues to grow. I believe we must look after the elderly members of our population. The Government has done that successfully in the past few years but I would welcome meaningful increases, as happened in a few previous budgets, in the level of payment to the elderly.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">I would also welcome an increase in the fuel allowance, although there are two sides to that argument. The fuel allowance was introduced initially to cover the cost of a bag of coal but Members will be aware it does not cover that cost. I did not realise until I spoke to the Minister that there are now 240,000 recipients of the fuel allowance. It was initially intended to be a fairly focused scheme but it has continued to develop into other areas and to increase it by even €1 would be horrendously expensive. Is it better to give people on social welfare money through the fuel allowance or by direct payment and allow them decide how to spend it? I do not know but would welcome a meaningful increase in the allowances our elderly are getting.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">The 2006 budget for the Department of Social and Family Affairs is roughly double what it was in 1999, despite the huge decrease in the number of people drawing unemployment assistance or benefit. If we can take that many people out of the social welfare net and still be in a position to double what we were paying them in 1999, it is obvious we are looking after those within the social welfare area. A total of 992,000 currently avail of weekly social welfare payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">Turning to my own area of responsibility in the Seanad, namely, communications, marine and natural resources, a total of €547 million will be provided in 2006 in respect of this Department, which represents an 8% increase over 2005. The allocation provides for a wide range of services including marine safety, the operations of the Irish Coast Guard, sea ports development, coastal protection, marine research, seafood and aquaculture development, energy conservation, inland fisheries, communications and broadcasting. The Department has a wide remit and I am delighted that part of the allocation is €21 million for fishery harbour infrastructure. I expect much of it will be spent in my constituency of Dunmore East, where the final planing permission is due to come today from An Bord Pleanála for a major development in that harbour. I hope work will get under way in 2006 and look forward to having it completed the following year.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">The roll-out of broadband is giving me some cause for concern. Many OECD reports have shown Ireland to be lagging behind in that area, despite the fact that the Government has been putting money into it and will provide another €36 million this year. The commitment to having broadband rolled out to every town with a population of over 1,500 by the year 2997 stands but problems remain. There is a geographical divide and demand is worryingly stagnant. The geographical divide exists because the last 10% of the lines are not being improved by Eircom, which makes it impossible for those people to take up broadband.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">There are concerns about the demand and perhaps we might have to prime that to some extent. Even in those areas where platform and carrier competition exists, and as a result prices have become relatively competitive, the take-up is still depressingly slow. I do not know the reason for that but we must examine the question of driving demand and monitor the reason people are not taking it up. Prices in many areas have come down and it has become much more competitive. Speeds have increased as well. That defines the service and helps to influence demand. Pending local loop unbundling, alternative DSL providers are locked out. Speed competition, therefore, depends on wireless and cable and putting it up to Eircom. That is a far from ideal scenario.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">Turning to the seafood sector, a quality seafood manager is proposed in the Sea Fisheries (Maritime Jurisdiction) Bill 2005, which is being debated in the other House today. I do not intend to go into the Bill because this is not the day for discussion of it. However, it is something about which I have grave reservations and I am sure we will get an opportunity to ventilate our views in the next few weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">A total of €3 million is being provided in 2006 to deal with coastal erosion. I am aware there is a long-term programme in place to deal with it but it is not going far enough to deal with the existing problems. We could spend €3 million in my constituency of Waterford and it would not tackle all the problems. This area has not been given sufficient priority and it is a problem that is affecting many people in coastal areas. I would like to see it being examined further.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">There is nothing provided in the Estimates, nor did I expect it, for a new university for the south east located in Waterford, on which there is total agreement in the south-east region and for which an application is about to be lodged with the Minister for Education and Science. That is an issue we will come back to on a regular basis. The south east is suffering because of the lack of that type of facility. It is a cause of concern in terms of future development of the area. Many people believe it is an affluent part of the country but we are suffering because of the lack of such a facility. I will return to that issue again.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">I would have liked to raise many other issues but unfortunately my time is limited. I congratulate the Minister on the way he is managing our finances.</p>

          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_245">I welcome the Minister and his contribution, which gives us confidence for the future and a great deal of pride in the success of the past ten to 15 years. I am fearful of being regarded as a Jonah if I express any criticism or concerns about the future. I am not. I travelled throughout the world this year and found myself being highly regarded as a citizen of a country that has set standards the rest of the world is admiring.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">Rather than get immersed in the details of individual spending in the Estimates I want to use this opportunity to address some general issues I believe are of importance. My first point is that in the run-up to a general election, all Government pronouncements on the economy should be accompanied by what I call a health warning, similar to that on cigarette packets. Since the Government is unlikely to provide that warning, all its pre-election pronouncements must be taken with a pinch of salt.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">I remember clearly what happened in the run-up to the last general election in 2002. For almost two years beforehand, it was clear to all disinterested observers that our economy had encountered severe problems. A decade of world prosperity had come to a sharp end. This was signalled most dramatically by the bursting of the dotcom bubble which had a knock-on effect in the collapse of the valuation of telecommunications companies, not only in Ireland but worldwide. We were suddenly presented with a radical change in the world environment in which we operate as part of the new global economy. This was compounded by the local impact of the foot and mouth disease crisis and the worrying increase in the rate of domestic inflation. The final element in this dangerous cocktail was the global economic slowdown that followed the events of 11 September 2001 in the United States.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">The writing was clearly on the wall in the run-up to the last election. There were plenty of reasons that we should trim our sails to meet the changing wind and many ways in which we needed to prepare our economy for the new challenges ahead. The Government, however, ignored all those warnings in its focus on keeping the electorate satisfied until after voting had taken place. Instead of sounding a prudent warning of caution, the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, advised people to "party on". Instead of trimming its sails, the Government abandoned all restraint. Exchequer spending ballooned in the months before the election, as did employment in the public sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">I say all this not to rehash an old argument but to explain why we should be cautious now. We must look out carefully for warning signals because, on past experience, we cannot rely on the Government to do so. When we seek to forecast how people will behave, usually a good guide is how they behaved in the past. For this reason, I approach with great scepticism any Government assessment of how the economy is currently performing. In the debate on housing in this House yesterday, I drew attention to the misleading effect that statistics of economic growth can have if they are taken at face value without any attempt to look behind the gross figures to divine their deeper meaning.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">The Government claims that while our economic growth is lower than it was in the Celtic tiger years, everything is fine because that growth is still far above the average in the EU as a whole. This simplistic approach, which is driven by electoral considerations, masks a different underlying reality, one that we must acknowledge and tackle. The figures show that growth today is radically different in nature to the growth fuelled during the Celtic tiger years. In the late 1990s, our growth was driven by the output of our manufacturing and services industries, and this was reflected in a corresponding growth in exports. This was healthy and sustainable growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">In stark contrast, the growth we have now is far less healthy and sustainable. It is driven by two main factors, consumer spending and activity in the construction industry. Consumer spending is a bad horse to bet on unless it is underpinned by real added value. If we spend what we earn in the world economy, that is fine. However, if we go on spending while the amount we earn from the world economy is not growing at the same rate we will soon find we are driving very fast up a cul-de-sac. I referred to it yesterday as making one's living by taking in the washing from one's own home. The warnings in this area are the almost total absence of growth in the manufacturing sector and the virtual stagnancy of our exports. We ignore these warnings at our peril. The latest publication from the National Competitiveness Council bears out what I said yesterday in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">Similarly, the part of our growth based on construction is unhealthy and unsustainable. We must build houses and infrastructure, but we also need the activities in the world economy that will pay for what we spend in those areas. Unless that balance is there, growth in construction is unhealthy. It is certainly unsustainable. Nobody believes we can go on building houses and ramping up our infrastructure at the present rate forever.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">These are some of the warning signs but they are not the entire picture. In recent weeks, we have had disturbing indications about the fragile nature of some of the international activities so vital to our future prosperity. I refer to the practice, which has apparently grown up in the past several years, of using this country as a tax haven for royalties on intellectual property. Last week, there was a hostile editorial in <i>The New York Times</i>, drawing attention to this practice by some of the largest United States companies, including Microsoft and Google. These companies have put in place legal structures that take advantage of the fact that income from royalties on intellectual property developed in Ireland is totally free from taxation in this country. I am fully in favour of this idea. By funnelling most of their world royalty income through an Irish company, however, these multinationals completely avoid tax. This is an advantage that can add billions of dollars to their bottom line.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">Understandably, the United States taxation authorities are not in favour of this. In the coming months and years, we can expect them to exert increasing energy in trying to stop this practice. They will, in particular, look closely at the argument that the intellectual property protected in this way was developed here. It is fine from their point of view if that is the case. The more closely they look, however, they will realise that in many cases this claim is largely a sham.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">I have always been a great supporter of the IDA. In particular, I have supported its shift into internationally traded services. I have also supported its efforts to get multinationals to develop research and development facilities here. In the knowledge economy, that is the way to go. However, we must build our progress in this area on a sound foundation, not on the shifting sands of being regarded as a tax haven. We must set up genuine research and development facilities that will carry out real research, not ones that act as a cover for tax avoidance.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">Our prosperity has been built on our low rates of corporate tax. Let us not be in any doubt that they have always been an important driver of our foreign direct investment. We must acknowledge that there will be changes in this regard in the future. We are already facing pressure on this issue from Europe. This comes, on the one hand, from member states that want to harmonise tax rates upwards. I congratulate the Minister on avoiding such a change thus far. On the other hand, there is pressure from new member states that are prepared to undercut our rates to attract mobile investment. It is not widely known that Cyprus, for example, already offers a 10% corporate tax rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">As the economies of the new member states develop, it is highly unlikely that this country will end up with the lowest tax rate. These trends present us with major challenges we have not yet acknowledged, let alone developed a strategy with which to tackle them, other than a policy of denial and a refusal to even discuss the issue of harmonising corporate tax. Our traditional position is unsustainable in the long term. We must acknowledge this and face up to the consequences as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">Meanwhile, in the other direction, a new threat has arrived on the scene from the direction of the United States. In how the United States authorities react to the loyalty schemes in operation here lies the risk that Ireland will become branded as an offshore tax haven. We have worked hard to avoid this branding in the past 30 years and the IDA and everyone else has been successful in doing so. However, by refusing to acknowledge this as a problem, the Government puts at risk all of the progress we have made over the past generation. It would be sad if the imminence of a general election were allowed to mask those looming realities from us. If we allow it to happen we can be sure we will pay for it dearly.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">I am using this opportunity to speak about the Estimates, which others have done well today, in order to spell out and sound a reminder and warning that, unless we are very careful and watch what is happening in our economy, we could be in danger of masking the reality. I do not wish to sound as if I am a Jonah, someone crying wolf or a pessimist. I am an optimist but I am also a realist. I urge the Government to carefully consider the points I raised.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LiamFitzgerald" eId="spk_137">
          <from>Mr. Fitzgerald</from>
          <p eId="para_260">Given his track record, it is surprising to hear Senator Quinn sounding many negative notes, on which I will comment in a few minutes. I welcome the fact that the Minister for Finance was here today and introduced these statements on the Estimates. I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera. It was remiss of me during a previous Adjournment debate when I was in a hurry not to refer to the Minister of State's significant political decision and I will take this opportunity to do so. This is all part and parcel of the way Cabinets and Governments do their business in terms of personnel.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">I hope I am not embarrassing the Minister of State but I could not let the occasion go without referring to her decision. I hope it is not final but, as it appears to be, I wish to take this opportunity to pay her the warmest possible tribute I can for her contributions to previous Books of Estimates and budgets as an essential, innovative and creative part of Government and her contributions to the policy behind those finances. I wish her the very best for the future. Whatever decision she makes will be a wise one and I hope it gives her the same fulfilment politics did. I have used part of my speaking time and will move on.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">One of Senator McDowell's fundamental points was that while the Government, as reflected in budgets and Estimates from 1997 to 2004, had a vision, and the finances of the country are by and large in order, a significant weakness is that the Government does not now seem to have a vision. I could not disagree more. As times change, matters evolve and circumstances develop, visions can and should be refined. They can sometimes divert for various reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">With the deepest respect to the Senator, the central vision of the Government is to use the resources, strengths and fruits of successful management of the economy for the benefit of the most vulnerable in our society. In these times, if one were to examine all caring Departments, one of the most fundamental targeted areas reflecting a coherent and consistent vision is that of the most disadvantaged and vulnerable. The latter covers a multitude, those who cannot stand up for themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">I thank Senator Quinn. The issues he referred to are extremely sensitive and I believe his pessimism about the short-term to long-term potential of the Irish economy in terms of its transition from manufacturing to services and construction is unfounded or not fully justified. The economy has a strong base which it did not have in the past. The type of vagaries and peaks and troughs that the construction industry was subject to in the past will not apply in future. I am not the font of wisdom in respect of supply and demand in the construction sector and building boom. We all accept that there has been an ongoing subliminal possibility of negative equity in the industry but we have the ingredients for a soft landing.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">I understand what the Senator is saying in terms of intellectual capital and loopholes. We should proceed cautiously as, despite the write-off of multinationals by others, we have gained substantially from them, not alone in terms of the jobs they created directly but the spin-off indigenous industries that feed on them. Multinationals provide a good base from which we can work.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">A political leader who is not a Member of the Oireachtas recently said that one of the biggest objectives is to home in on indigenous industries but no one is doing so. I reject this completely. Whether directly or indirectly, by promoting multinationals we enabled, facilitated and promoted the creation of homegrown industries. We did so through enabling local initiatives to feed on the multinationals and establish their own structures. The basis of this remains. I accept that, as the global economy takes over and multinationals leave our shores for lower cost bases, such as the Far East, we are at risk of indigenous industries contemporaneously dying. Nevertheless, the basis of a renewal of homegrown industries exists and, with all due deference to his managerial and entrepreneurial experience, I would not be as pessimistic as Senator Quinn.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">I never have a chance to speak about education. The value of the fruits of any good Government's economic policies is its ability to transfer those fruits. Just as it is transferring them on an ongoing basis to develop the economy, it is transferring them to increase the capacity and potential of the economy to perform better in successive years.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">The second core fundamental is the Government's ability to target those resources as they increasingly become available, not only to public services in terms of quantity, quality and infrastructure, but to ensure that the voiceless among us receive the loudest and strongest response.</p>

        <speech by="#LiamFitzgerald" eId="spk_139">

        <speech by="#MichaelFinucane" eId="spk_140">
          <from>Mr. Finucane</from>
          <p eId="para_271">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, and compliment Senator Quinn on his thoughtful contribution. Unlike many of us and the party in power on the other side, which might focus on particular aspects, he would examine this matter much more objectively. Everyone recognises that the economy is going well but people are seriously questioning its management. If the Government was to be criticised, it would be on its management of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">This issue has often been raised in respect of excessive overruns in the cost of certain projects. People are tired of hearing about electronic voting, the €50 million spent on it and €2.5 million per year spent on retaining the machines. The PPARS project cost in excess of €160 million before people said "Stop".</p>
          <p eId="para_273">The digital hub project of 2000 was one of the Taoiseach's favoured projects. We shouted "Stop" in 2005 because the Massachusetts Institute of Technology seemed to renege on the financial aspect of the project. I could mention other excesses. The fundamental flaw is that many of these projects are publically funded. The difference between private sector industry and Government circles is that if something is not viable or is losing money, the private sector will make a decision to cut at that stage. In many cases due to a lack of overseeing ability, projects in the public service limp on and haemorrhage money over time before somebody decides to take action.</p>

        <speech by="#RoryKiely" as="#Cathaoirleach" eId="spk_141">
          <from>An Cathaoirleach</from>
          <p eId="para_274">Senator White, I would prefer if you would not read what is on your phone. I apologise to Senator Finucane for the interruption.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelFinucane" eId="spk_142">
          <from>Mr. Finucane</from>
          <p eId="para_275">Much thought was given to consultants' advice regarding these projects. The Government said it was taking action to ensure that in future this aspect was covered. It is surprising to note that €60 million is to be spent next year on consultants, which is an increase of €1.5 million and this is on top of €50 million expended in recent times on a health board project which was signed for at the end of last April. I often wonder why Departments do not expend sufficient energy in producing reports rather than hiring outside consultants. I will repeat what I said many years ago that it is the easiest thing in the world to employ a consultant but in many cases the expertise exists within the Civil Service. I am sure the Department of Finance has many professional staff who could undertake that work.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">Senator Quinn's remarks are quite valid. The building industry accounts for 40% of the total jobs available in this country. A total of 30,000 jobs have been lost in industry over the past three years. A significant number of extra jobs have been created in the services, including the hospitality, education and health sectors. The building industry can be a fickle business and in many cases it is supported by capital mechanisms from Government in order to sustain it. However, it may not be sustainable in the future and the loss of manufacturing jobs is damaging to the economy. The last overseas industry I remember coming to west Limerick was a manufacturer of bicycle helmets who came in 1991 and is now gone. This situation has parallels all over the country. Ireland is not attracting overseas industries and this may be a question of our competitiveness. This, plus the fickle nature of the construction industry could be a recipe for financial difficulties in the future and a lack of buoyancy in jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">The Minister of State will be familiar with the situation regarding local authorities, which is very wrong. In 1983, 63% of all local government funding came from the central Exchequer and this has dropped to a current figure of approximately 42%. The local authorities have expanded considerably in the intervening period. They have taken on many extra duties. Ratepayers will always be the soft touch when it comes to the preparation of estimates by local authorities. A total of 25% of the financing of local authorities comes from the rate payers who find it very tiresome that when the local authorities come to balancing the books, due cognisance is not taken of the consumer price index. It is a question of by what percentage can the rates be increased. There has been a significant increase in the rates over time.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">The actions of the local authorities can often reduce the amount of revenue received from rate payers. For instance, if a decision is made to paint double yellow lines outside business premises in Abbeyfeale and Newcastlewest, this reduces the income of those businesses. The business community is tiring of this policy. Not alone must they pay commercial rates but they must also pay water charges. The chambers of commerce published a document recently in which the increases in water charges and rates between 2000 and 2004 were analysed. The results were frightening with regard to the scale of the overall charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">My party has referred to stealth taxes on many occasions and people are tired of such taxes. Electricity charges have increased by 40% over the past few years and there have been increases in gas and other charges. This is straining people's pockets.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">One of the central planks of Government policy in 2002 was a promise that 80% of those on the higher tax rate of 42% would be paying tax at the lower rate by 2007. So far, 67% of those people are paying the lower tax rate. It may be the Government's objective to achieve those targets over the next two budgets.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">In 2002, the then Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, promised there would be 5,000 fewer people employed in the public service. I do not know whether Departments do some crystal ball gazing to see what numbers of staff they will need in the future in health, education and other areas such as the Garda Síochána. It is very difficult to reconcile this with the news that the public service currently has 14,000 extra staff. Those projections are not valid. They were used as a comfort zone in 2002 by the Government but it will not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">People are no longer prepared to be conned and duped. Many people have said to me recently that this Government has wasted a lot of money and they are right. The Celtic tiger has caused a quadrupling of revenue in four years. The Government has frittered it away over the past eight years and we are not getting a better public service. The Government stands indicted on this issue.</p>

There is much truth in what he said about the growth in employment. There is effectively no unemployment in Ireland at present. Seeing all the cranes in the skyline every day, the realisation that there has been a significant increase in jobs in the construction sector is a no-brainer. That is good for the moment but it will not help to sustain the economy in the long run.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">The scare about the multinationals is perennial with governments. Each United States Administration always threatens pulling back and not allowing industry invest overseas, but it always seems to pass away. I hope the article in <i>The New York Times</i> last week will also fade away.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">As I have stated previously, there is an urgent need for a debate on employment in the Seanad. Urgent measures are needed. We have spoken about the decline in certain industries around the country and the black spots. In fact, 30,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost over the past four years. It is Government's job, not to run the individual factories or micro-manage, but to ensure the overall infrastructure is correct. One of the areas is a major reinvestment programme.</p>

          <p eId="para_302">A Chathaoirligh, thank you for selecting this matter under Standing Order 30. It is a matter of genuine concern, involving the report published yesterday by a high-level group within the Department of Education and Science and many of the partners in education which shows that 18% of teachers at primary level are male, compared with 30% less than 15 years ago. I have asked for the matter to be debated today because we need to consider it.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">Men who are in the teaching profession have always played a significantly important role, along with their female colleagues. If we are serious about encouraging more sport and recreation and PE within it is logical that we need more male teachers. The need for positive male role models in many communities, where there are single parent families and where there is not a large number of men, is another reason we need men in schools. I would have thought the positive learning experience that can be obtained from male teachers is an issue we need to explore also.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">There are two issues I wish to raise. First, at present to obtain a place in a college of education to study primary school teaching one needs an honour in Irish in the leaving certificate. When it comes to encouraging more men into the profession, we need to look at this because at present twice as many females as males take honours Irish at leaving certificate.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryMWhite" eId="spk_164">
          <from>Ms White</from>
          <p eId="para_311">There is a need for a debate in the Seanad on employment, even though there is virtually no unemployment, because we must look to the future. A business will not survive unless it is constantly innovating, day and night. We cannot presume that the current level of unemployment, at 4%, will remain.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">On the total pre-budget Estimates figure of €48 billion, I would plead with the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, to convey to the Minister that with the small sum of €18 million the Government could roll out a national cervical screening programme. There are 1 million women who are not able to participate in this programme, whereas there is a special scheme in the mid-west in which 70,000 women can participate. This is a black and white test. If the national screening programme is carried out, women can be saved from dying of cervical cancer. The €18 million needed is a modest sum in the context of the total budget spend.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">My colleague, Senator Kenneally, spoke of broadband. Ireland's level of broadband roll-out is one of the lowest among OECD countries. This is part and parcel of industry keeping up to date and innovating. There is a need for a more widespread roll-out.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">For the past 18 months I have been on a mission in the Seanad in trying to get child care dealt with. Child care should be part of the essential infrastructure in the country. It should be decoupled as soon as possible from children's allowance. Children's allowance is for clothing and food for children. It is crazy to have coupled it with child care expenses. While I hope the Government will substantially increase children's allowance for the stay at home parents, the facts are that practically 57% of women in the working age cohort with children under five years of age are working. These people need child care expenses. It should have nothing to do with children's allowance. There should be tax reliefs, vouchers or whatever.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">We need a bold comprehensive plan for child care. We cannot be worrying about every group being equally treated. If the Government party of which I am a member does not get child care correct, it will pay the price. The number of women who are in the workforce today has contributed to the Celtic tiger. There would have been no Celtic tiger without the women and, generally speaking, the women are carrying the can for looking after the care and protection of children. I am looking for 60,000 extra child care places over the next five years to meet the demand. There are waiting lists, etc., and I need not engage in repetition.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">The other point close to my heart is that Ireland should be an idyllic place for older people to live. Just as this is not a child friendly society, it is not an elderly friendly society. By the end of January I intend to bring before the House a document on a new approach to aging and ageism, similar in vein to my child care document. I am calling for the Government to hasten on the matter of pensions so that a person who retires has a decent standard of living. Why should people who have given their life's work for their country accept that their standard of living will drop when they retire? The idea is cracked.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">My main concern is about child care. The Minister did not explain in detail in the Estimates what he will do in regard to child care. I hope the strategy for child care will be one with vision. If it is not, I can do no more about it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulBradford" eId="spk_165">
          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_318">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the Estimates. The discussion is worthwhile although it is a pity we do not have longer to explore in detail the possible options facing the Government. I listened with interest to the previous speaker, in particular her comments on her twin areas of concern, child care and care of the elderly. I congratulate Senator White on her work in these important policy fields, on which I hope the budget will deliver progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">Most of the political debate in recent months has been on the child care front whereas care of the elderly has been sadly neglected from a policy perspective. The only occasion it was discussed in the House or elsewhere in the past 12 to 18 months was in regard to the nursing home repayments issue — a valid issue but not the entire equation. We need an urgent policy debate on the issue. The Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, who is a former chairperson of the Southern Health Board, will be aware of the major difficulties we face due to the lack of proper funding and services for the elderly.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">Senator White referred to vision. The former US President, George Bush Snr., was deemed to be inadequate in regard to what was called "the vision thing". If one charge could be laid against the Government, it is that despite the huge resources and spending capacity available to it, it has not had a vision. I take on board the Minister's point about prudent management of the economy, which is important. However, that management must be linked to a purpose. On the areas that really matter, namely, health, education, welfare spending, transport and housing, we have had management but we have not had vision. There have been strategy statements and consultants' reports but drive, energy and enthusiasm have been sadly lacking.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">The current body politic, not just the Government, does not appear to have the same depth of vision innovation as was evident among the political leadership which existed when the country was in its infancy, when politicians across the political spectrum founded the State, established the ESB, built up industry, developed agriculture and put together a health service. We are so busy with the management of the economy that we do not appear able to plan with any degree of innovation or vision. I doubt the upcoming budget will represent a departure in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">All politics is said to have local impact. In discussing the Estimates and the financial direction the Government is taking, I will consider my area of north Cork, which the Minister of State knows well and which could represent any area. I will focus on the north east of the county whereas the Minister of State would concentrate on the north west. The town of Mallow was deemed not only suitable as a location for a Government office under the decentralisation programme but was also given hub status under the spatial strategy. That strategy was quite laudable but has not been made a reality. Mallow today is quite similar to the town of five or six years ago, when it had not been granted hub status. We need to consider these issues and ask how we will deliver on hub status.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">The decentralisation programme is becoming an Irish joke. The Fáilte Ireland office was to decentralise to Mallow. The chairperson of that organisation attended a breakfast meeting in the town some weeks ago. In a comment to the local press following the meeting, she indicated it might be ten years before the office would move to Mallow, which is bitterly disappointing. Mitchelstown was where the decentralisation programme was seen as a total fiasco. The community was told that Bus Éireann would decentralise one of its head offices to Mitchelstown, where 200 jobs would be created. It was then discovered that only 90 staff were working in the Dublin office concerned, which was a disappointing joke.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">What will the Estimates do for Mallow General Hospital, which was recently deemed the cleanest hospital in the national hygiene audit? It needs significant investment. As it caters for many of the people in the Minister of State's new constituency, I hope he would have a personal interest in liaising with the Ministers for Health and Children and Finance to ensure the investment needed to keep hospitals such as Mallow General Hospital working at full capacity will be put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">Further investment is required in schools. Given that the national envelope of resources totals almost €50 billion, parents and children in communities throughout the country find it difficult to understand why educational facilities are not being provided at the required rate. I hope the Minister of State will attend next week's meeting of Members with representatives from the Buttevant area, where a new school is sought. The Estimates of some €48 billion and the Celtic tiger will mean little if we cannot respond to such requests.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">I regret I must make another parochial point but it dovetails with the issue of the new transport strategy, Transport 21, and the €30 billion-plus involved. In recent times the Minister of State has regularly toured the north Cork area, from where one can hear his radio dispatches. The House will be glad to know the Minister of State is a great man to report on where ale prices are cheapest.</p>

Alas, in the most recent publication of the Minister for Transport's plans for major road infrastructure improvements, the two roads stood out like sore thumbs as they were not designated for any specific investment.

        <speech by="#TerryLeyden" eId="spk_171">
          <from>Mr. Leyden</from>
          <p eId="para_332">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank the other Ministers who contributed to the debate, including the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen. The Book of Estimates published by the Minister is impressive and is published in advance of the 7 December budget. We look forward to a progressive budget, similar to those delivered by the Fianna Fáil-PD Government in recent years. There is an opportunity for Members to make a contribution and put suggestions, ideas and thoughts to the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">As regards the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Vote 23 has provided the sum of €41 million for the Land Registry for 2006. This represents a 3% increase on the 2005 Estimates. It is important that the decentralisation programme is expedited because this has implications for the Land Registry. Some 230 jobs are planned for Roscommon town and it is important that they are provided for in the Estimates under the decentralisation programme. I wonder whether that will be a separate issue in the budget on 7 December where the Minister for Finance will outline and elaborate on the progress made in this regard. We want to see that project up and running as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">The present decentralisation of the registry of births, deaths and marriages has brought around 50 civil servants to Roscommon town and has been an outstanding success. The new facility at Convent Road houses the Department of Agriculture and Food, the General Register Office, the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Social and Family Affairs, which are all very welcome. We want to see continued progress in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">As regards the Vote for the Department of Social and Family Affairs, I have spoken with the Minister and raised this matter in the House as well. The Minister, Deputy Brennan, has contributed greatly to the supports for the most disadvantaged in our society. However, as regards the free fuel scheme, I have asked the Ministers for Social and Family Affairs and Finance to reconsider the situation whereby roughly €9 per week is granted to the 280,000 beneficiaries. That is a 29-week period from September to mid-April. Kerosene has increased in price and is now €660 per kilolitre. The same is true of diesel fuel. That is an enormous amount of money. Filling the tank once a year will not suffice for the average home and two or three refills may be required.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">The cost of a bale of briquettes is €2.85 and coal costs €6.50 a bag, so the €9 is absolutely useless.</p>

          <from>Mr. Leyden</from>
          <p eId="para_338">There should be a clear statement of the Government's support in this area. The cost of fuel has risen dramatically and there has been an increase in the revenue accruing to the Department of Finance as a result. It is very hard to repay or give a price cut to diesel and petrol consumers at filling stations. If the Government reduces excise duty by 10 cent a litre it will rise accordingly on the other side. People take advantage of such initiatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">The extra revenue, however, could be directed back to the more needy in society through the free fuel scheme because there is extra revenue available. It should be a year-round scheme. As a result of the inclement weather most people light fires during the winter, particularly the elderly. Those who need it most should have heat in their homes. The sum of €9 per week for just 29 weeks is absolutely useless.</p>

          <from>Mr. Leyden</from>
          <p eId="para_341">I have made my case in this regard to the Ministers for Social and Family Affairs and Finance. Although the Minister for Finance gives a particular package to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, he has an input in this regard, as has the Government as a whole. I know there will be massive increases in social welfare, old age pensions, child welfare allowances, etc. As Senator White has said, child care will be a major issue in the budget. However, the 280,000 people who are affected by the free fuel scheme should also be given special consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">Under the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Estimate for the planning and development tribunal is at least €16.343 million this year. Added to the overall cost of the tribunal, this is an enormous burden on the State. I have no involvement, hand, act or part in the tribunals, but I must express concern. The tribunal is doing a job and the list of witnesses coming before it is enormous. It looks as if it will be running for years. It was reconstituted when Mr. Justice Fergus Flood retired from the tribunal.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. B. O’Keeffe)</from>
          <p eId="para_360">A number of Senators have referred to the difficulty in understanding the Estimates and the lack of supporting information about what is being achieved for the expenditure involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">In last year's budget the Minister for Finance stated he was open to considering how improvements could be made in the Estimates and the budgetary process in the context of the current situation in which we publish three-year economic and fiscal programmes in the EU stability programme updates included in the budget booklet; we have moved to multi-annual budgets which allow us to focus more clearly on the reasons we are investing and what we expect from such investment; and each Department publishes a strategy statement setting out what it is seeking to achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">On foot of his budget 2005 announcements, the Minister for Finance has been examining proposals for reform of the Estimates and budgetary process in conjunction with his Government colleagues. The recent report of the Committee of Public Accounts is a useful contribution to the general consideration of this matter. While retaining the right and duty of the Government to direct and manage the budgetary process, the Minister has been considering options which would facilitate more informed Dáil scrutiny of both the global tax and expenditure budgetary aggregates and of the individual Estimates for each Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">In so doing, however, care must always be taken to ensure that the annual budget is based on the most up-to-date information available and that timely decision making by Government is not impacted upon adversely. The Minister intends to return to this matter on budget day.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">As regards the local government fund, which provides the principal Exchequer contribution towards the day-to-day funding of local government services, this will be €30 million higher in 2006, bringing the total provision to €519 million. This is a 6% increase, similar to 2005, and will allow service improvements to be put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">I wish to emphasise that the decline in the provision for water and sewerage programmes reflects the significant progress made in recent years in completing major schemes in cities and towns. As regards claims that there is no increase in provision for Transport 21, courthouses and other areas, the 2006 pre-budget Estimates are the figures set out in the 2005-09 capital envelope. The Minister for Finance will announce a new capital envelope for 2006-10 on budget day. This will reflect increased investment in the Transport 21 framework and other areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">Contrary to the impression given by Senator McDowell, the capital carryover arrangement under the capital envelope is working extremely well. It is certainly leading to better management of programmes, a more even flow of projects and with the revised capital appraisal guidelines to move projects coming in on time and within budget, it is proving to be very satisfactory. If the carryover is examined in the two years of its operation to date, it is just over 4%. This is money which would otherwise have been lost to the very programmes that are being questioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">We are also seeing real improvements in services from the substantial increases in expenditure provided by the Government. Anyone waiting for more than three months for a routine surgical procedure will now be facilitated by the National Treatment Purchase Fund. Up to 31 October 2005, over 36,300 patients have had treatment arranged for them by that fund. The fund has also made significant progress in reducing waiting times for patients. Data for the seven hospitals currently included on the new patients treatment register showed that, on average, patients are waiting between two and four months for their operations for 17 out of the 20 most common surgical procedures.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">The pupil-teacher ratio at primary school level has fallen from 22.3:1 in 1997 to 17:1 in 2004. At second level, that ratio has fallen from 16:1 to 13.6:1 in the same period. This has been achieved at primary level despite a steady increase in the number of pupils from under 440,000 in 2001 to 446,000 in 2004. Hospital inpatient and day case patient discharges increased in 2004 by 4.4% over 2003. In line with international best practice, the emphasis is on day work. Day work discharges increased by 8% the same period.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">The Minister for Finance will be making additional provision on budget day for social welfare, child care, and care of the elderly, as well as the capital investment programme. The Government's sound fiscal and economic policies have led to increased prosperity and have improved the quality of life for all our citizens. It has enabled us to fund real improvements in public services and to target priority social needs. Priority is also being given to spending on health, education and social welfare in the 2006 Estimates. The Estimates provide for gross expenditure of around €48.5 billion, of which €42.2 billion is current and €6.3 billion is capital. It represents an increase of almost €3 billion over the 2005 budget, or an increase of 6.6%. Therefore, I am very pleased to commend the 2006 Estimates to Seanad Éireann.</p>

        <speech by="#TonyKilleen" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_194">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Killeen)</from>
          <p eId="para_370">I welcome this opportunity to advise the House of certain recent and impending developments in the area of employment rights, to give Senators some idea of the types of issue being encountered and to suggest how the changing working environment gives rise to new challenges in the area of employment rights enforcement. I also want to set out how my Department is addressing these issues and what are our priorities as the new year approaches.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">First, I suggest to Members that, as in so many other areas of public life, the availability of objective and comprehensive information is vital to an informed exchange of views. In the area of employment rights enforcement, objective assessments of what is at issue and of what is happening are set aside too frequently in favour of expressions of high profile indignation, based on partial information or second or third hand reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">Members will agree that Departments should base their responses to complaints on solid evidence and factual information. In tackling abuses of employment rights of employees, be they Irish or from overseas, I suggest that a calm, rational approach, coupled with a determination to get to the heart of the matter is likely to be more effective than the well-meaning, but ill-informed statements which are sometimes made in the absence of hard information. Indeed, some claims made in the media turn out to have no substance when pursued by the relevant authorities and can cause resources to be diverted from real and pressing problems. I will now deal with a number of issues that were mentioned in recent exchanges in this House on the subject of employment rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">Virtually everyone will be aware of the recent controversy regarding the group of Latvian periwinkle pickers who were taken from Colt Island, off the coast of north County Dublin by the Skerries lifeboat. This incident was well publicised and was the occasion of much public comment, both from the media and from groups who concern themselves with employment rights, with particular reference to the working conditions of workers who have come to this State from overseas.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">I understand the facts are as follows. On Saturday, 5 November, the Skerries lifeboat was launched to investigate a report from a member of the public and found 13 people on Colt Island off the Skerries coast. After assessing the situation, the Skerries lifeboat brought the 13 individuals back to Skerries. The marine co-ordination centre, MRCC, in Dublin advised Skerries gardaí of the situation and requested that they meet the lifeboat on its return to Skerries, which was done. The lifeboat reported to the MRCC at 10.15 p.m. that they were back in Skerries and that all the people were now safely ashore.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">The marine survey office of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has been investigating the private craft used earlier in the day to transport the workers to and from the island in question. Any vessel carrying more than 13 passengers requires a passenger ship safety certificate, according to the Merchant Shipping Act 1992. If the vessel is used to make several trips carrying less than 12 people on each occasion to or from their place of work, it is then required to hold a passenger boat licence. If such a vessel does not hold a certificate or licence, its owner and master are deemed to be guilty of an offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has also initiated an investigation from the perspective of seafood production. A person who places live periwinkles on the market for human consumption must ensure that the periwinkles comply with specific standards laid down in EU Directive 91/492/EEC, which relate to the microbiological standards of the product and its general fitness for human consumption.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">A Garda investigation into the incident has also been undertaken. The labour inspectorate of my Department has been in contact with relevant colleagues in the Garda Síochána, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Health and Safety Authority. An inspector has interviewed the boat owner and two of the Latvian people who were gathering the shellfish. It has not been possible to establish any detail of an employment relationship and the Latvian interviewees made no complaint.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">The Latvian Embassy has been contacted in the matter to ascertain whether it had received any complaints in connection with the incident. It appears that no complaints have been received. The embassy was assured that any complaints will be investigated and advised that in the event an employment relationship is established, the inspectorate will undertake a full inspection of relevant employment records and will pursue any non-compliance with legislation within its remit.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">The Health and Safety Authority, which is responsible for the enforcement of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and other relevant worker protection legislation, has also liaised with the Garda on this matter and has investigated every possible avenue. However, concrete information has proved hard to obtain and it is difficult to make progress, especially when the main parties concerned are not contactable and have not submitted complaints.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">I am aware there have been subsequent newspaper reports of an interview reportedly given to a Latvian newspaper by one of the group picked up by the lifeboat, who is said to have stated that the group in question were never in danger and never requested help. While investigations in this matter are not yet complete and further information may yet come to light, I invite Members to consider how the information now available compares with the serious and sweeping allegations made by various parties at the time. We should all be wary of being dogmatic in the absence of relevant information.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">As for employment agencies, I understand that Members expressed concerns about the alleged activities of some employment agencies or recruitment companies. I can advise that section 20 of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 provides that all employee protection legislation, including the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, applies to workers from overseas just as it applies to Irish workers. If Members have any specific information that workers from overseas are being paid less than the statutory minimum wage, or are being charged by employers for seeking employment for them, a practice which is unlawful under the Employment Agency Act 1971, they should pass this information to my Department, which will investigate the matter. This is also the most effective course of action if Members believe that specific employees have had moneys illegally withheld or otherwise deducted from their pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">When dealing with the issue of employment agencies, it should be noted that the Employment Agency Act 1971 is under review. This is not surprising, given the length of time since its enactment and the significant changes in the economy over that period. In June 2005, my Department issued a policy paper as part of this review and invited submissions to be made by 15 July. A total of nine submissions was received. At present, my Department is examining the various matters raised by the respondents. It is my intention that, following further consultations with various interests and completion of the deliberative process, the heads of a Bill will be prepared and Government approval will be sought to have a Bill drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government. It is my intention that a Bill should be published in the first half of 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">As for employment rights compliance, the Government is acutely aware that the evolving labour market has brought new demands and challenges for those engaged in delivering employment rights information and the administration and enforcement of employment rights generally. The Government is also aware of certain abuses encountered in recent years and appreciates that there is public concern that some employers have been engaging in behaviour which, while not in itself illegal, would be considered exploitative by reasonable people. Therefore, it is opportune to outline to the Seanad a number of initiatives which are being undertaken at present and which focus specifically on the improvement of our employment rights framework, both in the short and medium term.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">The employment rights compliance group consists of representatives of the social partners and several Departments. It is engaged in the consideration of some 40 proposals contained in the report on the mandate and resourcing of the labour inspectorate and seeks to establish the degree of consensus which exists in respect of those proposals as well as a couple of others made by the social partners. This group is working towards the formulation of a thoroughly revised model of employment rights enforcement that will see redress mechanisms streamlined and a level competitive environment for those employers who are fully compliant with employment rights legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">An independent review of the joint labour committees was completed recently. Arising from this review and following bilateral consultations with social partners and stakeholders, my Department is now preparing a paper that will be used as the basis for implementation of the review in further consultation with the social partners and stakeholders. Moreover, the expert group on bullying reported during the summer and its principal proposal was that legislation should be enacted. Consequently, I have sought the views of the social partners in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">The employment rights review group comprises representatives of several Departments, the employment rights bodies and the social partners. It pursues the Government mandate to guide and drive the implementation of Government decisions on the role and functions of the employment rights bodies and to ensure the complexity of employment rights legislation does not impede understanding and compliance. The objectives of the exercise are to ensure streamlining of the roles of the employment rights bodies and simplification and consolidation of the corpus of employment rights legislation. It is to be expected that the work under way will feature in any forthcoming social partnership negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">A major investment in education, particularly of migrant workers, and in the general dissemination of employment rights information is planned. This will consist of the strategic targeting of information at those who need it most. The delivery mechanisms and content will be formulated in consultation with social partners and others.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">Employment rights compliance will be a feature in what may be the next round of social partnership and discussions with the social partners are well advanced, both in respect of the development of the legislative framework and the approach to adopt with regard to ensuring compliance. I am confident that an effective and more user-friendly structure will be achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">As Senators will note, the State is active in the area of employment rights protection and compliance. Much of what is being done is effectively the review and modernisation of the already large corpus of legislation which has been in place for some years. Irish legislation in this area mirrors the broader EU social protection framework. Critics sometimes speak as if there were no protection in place and as if employees in Ireland had no statutory rights and were at the mercy of a winner takes all economic system. This is not the case and the work of the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the rights commissioners, the Equality Tribunal and the civil courts will testify to this. I pay tribute to the people who work in these bodies for the constructive contribution they have made in their roles. The information and consultation legislation, which adds a new dimension to the rights of workers, recently came before the Seanad. I should mention the high-profile Gama case, in which a large amount of work was undertaken by the Department. Matters have been subsequently challenged in the courts and are awaiting determination at Supreme Court level.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">The number of labour inspectors has recently been increased from 17 to 31. This will add significantly to the capacity of the Labour Inspectorate to ensure compliance with the law and to investigate complaints. We cannot expect to have an inspector at every street corner any more than we can expect to have a Garda presence on every rural road at 3 a.m. If the inspectorate is to deliver the kind of service demanded by society it needs the active support of that society. This means those in possession of information on breaches and denial of employment rights must share it with the inspectorate to enable an investigation and, where appropriate, a prosecution. A civil society alert to its responsibilities can make a significant contribution to the work of bodies, such as the Labour Inspectorate, and can help to improve the already high level of compliance with employer obligations.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">I trust the developments I have outlined will help to inform Senators of the Government's approach in this area and will indicate improvements expected over the coming year. I will listen with interest to their contributions to this discussion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulCoghlan" eId="spk_195">
          <from>Mr. Coghlan</from>
          <p eId="para_392">I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his outline of the developments. While I am glad to have the opportunity to make a statement on this matter I would prefer to see us debate Bills that would pass into law and make a real difference to workers rather than talk generally in the manner in which we are today. I wish to address two relevant Bills, one of which we have recently dealt with in this House, namely, the Employment Permits Bill and the Employees (Provision of Information and Consultation) Bill. It has always made good business sense, as the Minister of State has said, to keep employees informed about what is going on. Any manager knows that to keep morale and productivity high he or she must make everyone feel like a stakeholder, a fully paid up member of the team.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">I believe in the worker shareholding agenda. In a civilised society we cannot view a firm's labour force as anything other than an integral part of the decision making process. Workers are not just a resource to be turned on and off but a vital component in any management team and the provision of information to them is a vital component in any management strategy. Under the Bill, employers will have to provide information and consultation on issues such as the probable development of a firm's activities, the structure and future of employment in the business and any decisions likely to lead to major changes in work organisation or contracts.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">The Bill also obliges employers to provide enough information to enable worker representatives to make adequate preparations for consultation. Employers must begin negotiations to set up information and consultation procedures once 10% of employees make such a request. The Labour Court will be able to investigate disputes about the operation of agreements. Employers could face fines of up to €30,000 for breaches of the proposed legislation. This Bill is part of a suite of workers rights' legislation that has been brought to us from Europe. It is because of legislation like this that Fine Gael is passionately pro-European. It is worth reminding the country that those on the far left who oppose the European project are being deceitful when they say the EU is anything but a social project. It has been a leading force in better working conditions for Irish employees.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">Deputy Perry, among others, raised the following issue in the Dáil recently. The Bill excludes companies employing fewer than 50 employees. The Minister of State outlined sound reasons for this when I dealt with the Bill here and we concurred. Small firms in particular must be protected from over-regulation. Due to their competitive disadvantage, and because they tend to be indigenous, the Government must protect them at all costs but we must ensure that those who work in small firms are not treated as inferior to those who work in large companies. I know the Minister of State does not intend to permit that.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">The fact that an employer has only 45 workers on his or her books does not mean that he or she should be treated with anything less than the respect and dignity of those who work for the Microsofts and Coca-Colas of this world. I have heard the Minister of State's views on how we can ensure that the provision of information can be extended to everyone and he struck the right balance on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">On publication of the Employment Permits Bill the Minister stated: "In relation to work permits the legislation will enable the Minister, every two years, to set the maximum number of employment permits to be issued both in total and by sector, to identify the skills and qualifications required for the grant of a permit, and to identify the categories of employment that may or may not be the subject of granting employment permits." That provision is correct and Fine Gael welcomes it. However, the Minister added that while the Bill allows for the creation of a green card type system, "the practice of the employer applying for the permit will continue".</p>
          <p eId="para_398">The Minister may or may not be familiar with one of the world's biggest websites, the online encyclopedia Wikipedia. It defines "green card" as "an identity document issued by a country's authorities affording non-citizens of that country some of the rights its citizens enjoy, sometimes with the prospect of naturalisation". An example is the United States permanent resident card. Since the publication of the Bill, the Minister has referred to green cards in an effort to suggest his Department has come up with a comprehensive and compassionate answer to the problems faced by the migrant workers who are keeping this economy going. While Irish citizens have the right to quit a job and look for another, this Bill does not give immigrants the same freedom because it does not give the employee rights over his or her employment status. The new Bill makes it easier for migrant labour to move job but I do not know why the Minister did not go all the way and grant the green card to the employee and not the employer.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">This year we have already witnessed flagrant breaches of existing laws designed to protect Irish and non-Irish workers. At Gama's luxury offices in Santry, north Dublin, ingenious schemes were cooked up to pay those unfortunate workers half nothing while they helped build the country. Some action may have been taken against the company but we await the outcome. Nobody has been punished for the disgraceful treatment of one lady who had to go to the Labour Court to get her thoroughly deserved €25,000 compensation from Irish Ferries, whose status as the pariah of Irish industrial relations solidifies every day.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">The Minister of State comes to us with more legislation but tells us little of how it will be enforced. What extra resources will be made available to the labour inspectorate and other bodies that will enforce the legislation? How does the Department intend to communicate those new rights to migrant workers? How does the Minister intend to co-operate with foreign embassies to ensure that those rights are translated into meaningful improvements for migrant workers upon entry to this country?</p>
          <p eId="para_401">Unfortunately, the Government does not have a good track record when it comes to cross-cutting initiatives. If it did, the Employment Permits Bill would have been announced as part of a package of measures promoted jointly by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Foreign Affairs. Needless to say, one arm of Government very often still does not know what the other is doing. It would be good if the Minister of State could at least answer the questions that I have put to him to assure us that the Bill is worth the paper on which it is written.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">This debate comes against the backdrop of the Irish Ferries dispute and the latest sinister twist in the story, with management flatly refusing to recognise the legitimacy of the Labour Court or implement its decisions. Regarding the largely very good industrial relations machinery that we have, the court itself, the Labour Relations Commission, and the Employment Appeals Tribunal, I often wonder whether there might be some way of making their decisions legally enforceable. We would like to have a voluntary court, and it is supposedly there, but as we know, on occasion one or other party rejects its findings. Perhaps the Minister might examine that to see if some positive improvement might be made in that regard. Now that it seems clear that Irish Ferries are operating within the law in reflagging the <i>MV Normandy</i> as Bahamian, I urge the Minister to lead the way in convincing our European partners to change EU law in the area to protect all workers, whether Irish or eastern European, from exploitation.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">I noted with interest the Minister of State's comments on the Employment Agency Act 1971, which is currently being reviewed, and the National Recruitment Federation. In some instances, they have been unfairly treated in comments. I am assured and accept that temporary workers are automatically covered for the following wherever they operate or are placed by them: unfair dismissals; redundancy pay; holiday pay; rest breaks; health and safety; discrimination; the minimum wage; and <i>force majeure</i> leave. I accept their bona fides in that regard. Bar one or two cowboys, perhaps, who were not affiliated to them, they are doing a good job. I totally accept the Minister of State’s comments in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">I welcome the chance to say these few words but urge the Government to act as well as talk. The country and its workers deserve nothing less.</p>

          <from>Mr. Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_407">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and commend him and the Department on their work. It is unusual that we should speak about employment rights at a time when labour shortages are evident, we have full employment and all the hallmarks of an advanced economy working within social partnership. Nevertheless, there are those who would flout the rules and try to retreat from their spirit or circumvent them entirely. I am thinking here of Gama, which will be before the courts. I also believe that the management of An Post has left behind the spirit of social partnership. Irish Ferries wishes to de-register and make many employees redundant, and that would of course be unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">I commend the Minister on his work in the Department and on the Employment Permits Bill 2005, which has been brought before the House. The Bill had two objectives. First, it puts in place a statutory framework that will implement an active, managed economic migration policy. The three pillars of this employment permit policy were to be green cards, an intracompany transfer scheme, and a revised work permits scheme. Second, it provides several new important protections for migrant workers in Ireland. The Minister has also brought before the House the Employees (Provision of Information and Consultation) Bill 2005, which transposed the EC directive on informing and consulting employees, which resulted from extensive negotiations at the European Council and Parliament. The directive sets out clear principles, while leaving much of the detail of implementation to national governments. Its aim is to establish minimum requirements regarding informing and consulting employees across the Union. For the first time, employers are obliged to establish arrangements for the provision of information and consultation to their employees.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">The directive is an important EU intervention in national industrial relations systems. Much of the existing EU-inspired employment legislation relates to individual rights such as equal pay, health or safety. When it has had an impact on collective rights, EU law has done so in limited circumstances. The rationale behind the directive was based on the need to address perceived gaps in the existing legal framework for information and consultation.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">We have also recently received clarification from the Department regarding the legal employment rights of construction workers. In that regard, it pointed out to those inquiring about the employment rights situation pertaining in the construction industry that only statutory minimum rates were enforceable in law. The officers of the labour inspectorate can only seek to ensure that relevant employees receive at least those specified rates and conditions. Accordingly, the highest rates of pay that could be enforced in respect of construction operatives under the terms of the register employment agreement were €7.36 per hour.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">I am conscious of the fact that we have a minimum wage and excellent terms of employment for many workers. However, we must continue in that vein and ensure that employment rights are upheld. I commend the Minister and Department on their work.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MargaretCox" eId="spk_199">
          <from>Ms Cox</from>
          <p eId="para_412">I declare an interest, since I am the owner-manager of a recruitment agency operating in Galway. That was also detailed in my declaration laid before this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">I welcome the Minister of State and thank both him and the Leader for arranging this debate, which comes at a time when recruitment agency legislation is under review. I intend to speak specifically to that today and leave my colleagues to deal with some of the other issues, such as employment rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">The Employment Agency Act came into force in 1971, when such agencies were just beginning to operate in the State. The Government at that time identified the need to bring some regulation to the area, and that regulation has remained unchanged since. It probably indicates the success of the recruitment agency area that there has been no need to introduce additional legislation, most recruitment agencies being operated very well and tending to regulate themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">The recruitment agency field is self-regulated through membership of the National Recruitment Federation, which was formerly the Irish Federation of Personnel Services. That federation has over 100 licensed recruitment agency members. They have their own code of conduct to which anyone joining the federation signs up and agrees to keep. That is self-regulating and ensures that we have a very good industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">Speaking in general about the industry, a recent survey, the 2005 National Recruitment Federation annual survey, estimated the size of the Irish industry at €1.3 billion. The Minister of State and his Department will know that there are over 450 licensed employment agencies in Ireland. Not all will be operating as such, since many licences are held by small organisations such as accountants, who would recruit on behalf of some of their clients. If they do so, they must have a licence to operate. There are just under 10,000 people employed in permanent jobs in the industry, making it significant by any standards. Many are in small, owner-managed organisations with one or two people, but there are also several international groups working in Ireland. A significant number of people, amounting to approximately 10,000, are employed in the industry on a full-time basis. It is estimated in the National Recruitment Federation survey that 85,000 people obtained permanent jobs using employment agencies in 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">Employers approach recruitment agencies and tell them they have vacancies, after which the vacancies are advertised by the agencies. Alternatively, suitable candidates are found on the agencies' databases. The agencies create a match between the qualifications of the applicants and those desired by the employer. This service is useful to the candidate because it gives him an opportunity to find out exactly what he is getting involved in. He can find out information on the company through an intermediary working on his behalf. The agencies are also working on behalf of the employer and therefore they always have two clients. This ensures that a fair and honest service is provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">We are having this debate because reference was made in the House to people who have been exploited by recruitment agencies. It is fair to say, and the Minister of State will accept, that any exploitation that has occurred is unacceptable and that it has not been engaged in by Irish recruitment agencies. The very well-publicised case of the female employee on Irish Ferries had nothing to do with an Irish recruitment agency — a foreign agency was involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">I understand very few complaints about recruitment agencies have been made to the Department. The complaints are generally not about an agency employee doing something wrong, rather it is a matter of understanding exactly what is involved, particularly given that an increasing number of people from other European countries are obtaining jobs in Ireland through recruitment agencies in their countries of origin. Issues arise regarding these agencies' understanding of how people work in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">The issue of temporary workers and how they are charged was discussed. An example was given of a person being paid less than the minimum wage while the charge to the company was perhaps €12 or €13. It is important to clarify for everybody, including agency employees, that the rate a client pays to the recruitment agency for the provision of a temporary worker consists of a number of elements, including the gross pay paid to the worker. On top of this, a charge of 8% is levied for holiday pay, and 4.5% is levied in respect of public holidays. There is also a need to provide employers liability insurance, which can amount to 1% or 2%. Redundancies also need to be provided for, and this involves a provision of 4%. Employer's PRSI amounting to 10.75%, needs to be provided for, and a VAT charge is also imposed. These costs arise before an agency's margin is determined. From this margin, the agency must pay its own staff and pay for its premises. This explains the considerable difference in charges. The rate is all-inclusive and automatically covers all the rights mentioned by Senator Coghlan in respect of temporary workers. These concern unfair dismissal, redundancy, holiday pay, health and safety, discrimination, the minimum wage and <i>force majeure</i> leave.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">An issue arises regarding the services directive. It is important to place on the record that Ireland is continually trying to export its services. We very much support Commissioner Charlie McCreevy in respect of his trying to extend the provisions of the services directive to allow recruitment agencies operate throughout the European Union. We would like to see the barriers removed. I am not sure of the view of the Minister of State and the Department in this regard. The recruitment industry has adopted a very positive view on Mr. McCreevy's position.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">I thank the Minister of State for attending and for all his dealings with us on this issue. I look forward to having some discussions in the House on the review of the Employment Agencies Act.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FergalQuinn" eId="spk_200">
          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_423">I welcome the Minister of State, of whom we have seen a lot lately. He is a good listener, as we have learned during the passage of recent legislation. I am also a good listener but was unaware of the story the Minister of State told regarding the Latvian workers on Colt Island, off Skerries. I grew up in that part of the world. In light of the Latvian workers' experience, I understand why there are calls for legislation. However, I am a great believer that the less legislation we introduce, the better. The Minister of State is probably of the same opinion.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">If it is possible to find a solution to a problem that does not involve enforcement legislation, it is all the better. People, particularly employers, do things because they are good for business. About ten years ago, a man called John approached me and said he had been employed in my company for nine years and was approaching his 65th birthday, which was to fall on 31 December in the year in question. He said he enjoyed his work and that he would be retiring on 31 December, but he died six days before this, on Christmas Day. His wife died a few days later and the two funerals were held within a few days of each other.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">While attending the funerals in the church, I remembered his having told me that he looked forward to going to work when he woke up in the mornings and that he had looked at his watch on many occasions while at work in the belief that it was 4 p.m. only to discover it was 6 p.m. I said to myself that it would be marvellous if my company and employers in general could set a standard such that all employees would hold such views. The man's words have stayed in my mind ever since.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">I am reluctantly saying there is a need for legislation to secure employment rights, but it is a pity this is so. It would be desirable to find a way to make employers recognise the enthusiasm, commitment and goodwill of employees such that they could reap the benefits. There will always be those who break the rules but, ideally, those who do not should be the ones who succeed in business and reap the benefits to be gained from their employees.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">When I considered the various employment Acts — I wish I had done a better job in this regard — I realised that even where legislators have the best will in the world, legislation that affects employment can have the opposite effect to that which is desired. Consider an example from France. The French decided to solve their unemployment problem by introducing a maximum working week of 35 hours. It was believed that many more jobs would be created if those who were working 40 or 50 hours were only allowed work for 35 but the very opposite happened. In spite of the goodwill and good intentions of the then French Government, far fewer jobs were created because employers could not afford to employ people for 35 hours at the same rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">I make this point because we are now very much in a global economy. If we are to attract investment into Ireland, we must ensure all our standards make the country attractive. I am not only talking about employment legislation but also about other types. In spite of legislators having the best intentions in the world, they often create circumstances in which Ireland becomes more regulated and restricted.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">Foreign direct investors are wondering whether the best place to invest is Europe or elsewhere. If they decide on Europe, they wonder whether to invest in Ireland or some other European country. Each legislative measure or regulation might have the best intentions but might result in the same situation that was seen in France, where the end result was the opposite to what was intended.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">The legislation referred to by the Minister of State has good intentions which are difficult to criticise. However, it is another little step along the road to making Ireland a little less attractive. It is not enough to claim that there is a EU directive pushing us in this direction because that might well make Europe less attractive. Europe is in the global economy and will also have to attract attention and investment from elsewhere. My thoughts on this area are from the perspective of ensuring we are competitive.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">Another point worth making relates to the complexity of the legislation. One of the growth areas in Ireland is foreign direct investment by large companies such as Hewlett Packard, Microsoft and Intel. However, the growth we really need is in indigenous industry and among indigenous traders. These are the people who start businesses. They do not have the big support structure. If they wish to take on one new employee, the complexity of what they must do and be aware of makes it difficult to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">I remember travelling on an aeroplane some years ago with the chief executive of a large company in Ireland. He was also on the board of the company in the United States. He told me that one of the managers had come to the board meeting in the United States the previous week with an idea. The manager urged the board to start a new enterprise. When the board asked what would be involved, the manager said he would take on 37 people. He believed there was a good chance he would make a success of the venture. The board gave him the go ahead. However, the Irish man asked what would happen if it did not work. The reply was that the 37 people would be let go. The Irish man told me: "We could not do that in Ireland." We make it so difficult and so restrictive that if somebody took a chance to take on 37 or even two people and had to let them go again, the difficulties that would be created are such that it is quite likely the company would not take that first step.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">This is the difference between what was happening in the United States and what was happening in Ireland at that time and even now. Each legislative measure we pass makes it a little less attractive to take on an employee. Can we make it more attractive to take on people, even if five or nine out of ten of those enterprises fail? Where one blossoms and grows, we have succeeded. It worries me that each step we take lessens the opportunity to do that. I have a concern about the complexity of the legislation, particularly for smaller employers. In this regard it is acknowledged that the legislation has become increasingly complex over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">Some of the EROs and the REAs should be either updated or even abolished. Taken in conjunction with the introduction of the national minimum wage and the transposition of protective legislation from the EU, it could be argued that the requirement for these industry specific measures is redundant. The Minister might consider that. The case has been made that the growth in the body of employment legislation since 1990, only 15 years ago, when 18 separate labour laws or regulations have been enacted, has overtaken the need for much of the focus on those industry regulatory instruments.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">Another big point that is hard to make relates to the minimum wage. There are some jobs that do not exist at a certain price. It is very hard to argue against increasing the minimum wage because nobody wants to see people working for a rate that is less than one can live on. However, some jobs cannot exist for that wage. The example I offered some days ago when discussing this is that ten years ago when one bought petrol, the garage employed somebody to put the petrol into the tank. There were many jobs that were extremely menial and which did not yield a great deal of money. Some of them were probably part-time jobs. However, they were jobs people were willing to do. The introduction of the minimum wage made it impossible to make those jobs pay for themselves. The jobs, therefore, ceased to exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">There are many other such jobs. It is when I go to other countries that I see people willing to work for rates of pay that are lower than the minimum wage. The job might be a second or surplus job. I am not arguing against a minimum wage but we should remember that its existence means that certain jobs can no longer exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">There is an unemployment problem in Ireland. The problem is that the same people are being left at the bottom of the pile all the time. When jobs become available these people do not get onto the first rung of the ladder by getting that first job. I do not know the answer to this. It is not to reduce the minimum wage to half its rate to employ these people. In Ballymun recently there was a large amount of construction but when the people in the area who would, perhaps, not be the first choice of an employer went looking for the jobs, they found they were already filled because the construction companies brought their own people with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">The same people are being left at the bottom of the pile. I am not sure what the solution is but perhaps it might be possible to subsidise employers in some way so the minimum wage can be paid. I can see the difficulties this would cause but it might be a way to achieve something in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">The proposal for a standardised record keeping format is a practical and beneficial measure for employers and employees. It removes the ambiguity that might exist. However, we should be careful that any standardisation of records does not impose an undue administrative burden on employers, particularly the small and medium sized enterprises. We should be creating opportunities for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">I wish to refer to the increase in the penalties. The fines prescribed in various statutes might not have the deterrent effect they once had but it is important to ensure that due process is maintained for all parties. That does not always happen. The same applies to the imposition of on-the-spot fines. All these act in some way or other as a deterrent to taking on a new employee. With regard to the annual declaration of compliance, the complexity and ongoing evolution of employment rights legislation make a system of self policing problematic. I am not sure how the declarations should work.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">If there is one message I wish to give to the Minister it is my concern that each extra regulation we introduce, with the best intentions, is a deterrent in some small way to creating more jobs.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TerryLeyden" eId="spk_201">
          <from>Mr. Leyden</from>
          <p eId="para_442">I welcome the opportunity to discuss proposed legislation relating to employment rights. It is good to have these debates in a calm way rather than in the middle of a crisis or when an issue arises. I listened carefully to the contributions of Members. I am aware from my experience of being in Senator Quinn's Superquinn stores that they are excellent places for workers. I was delighted to hear the Senator's views on the treatment of workers and how he had treated his workers over the years. It is a win-win situation where both the employees and the employer have succeeded. That is a credit to Senator Quinn.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">I first encountered Senator Quinn when he was the first chairman of An Post. He contributed a great deal to the early development of that company. I am sure he is relieved that the pending strike has been settled. A good settlement has been reached on the payment of Sustaining Progress increases. The other issues will be resolved in the new year. It is vital that there is no danger of disruption of postal services prior to Christmas and into the new year because, as Senator Quinn is aware, it is the most profitable time for An Post. To put that in danger would be detrimental to the future of An Post, the workers and the entire structure.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">The liberalisation of the market in 2008-09 will put enormous pressure on An Post. The largest and most profitable areas are the major cities and towns. It is extremely difficult to maintain the five days a week service in rural areas. I live in a rural area and I get post at 9 o'clock every morning, delivered by a top-class member of An Post, Micheál Meeley, who arrives bright and early and is co-operative and efficient. One could not pay for that excellent service provided every day but An Post will be under major pressure when the market is liberalised. I am delighted the Communications Workers Union members have recognised that the system must be rationalised to ensure a viable system when the market is liberalised in 2008-09.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">I am also concerned about the future of the post office structure. There are approximately 1,350 sub-post offices and some of them are not viable. There will be a rationalisation even though these sub-post offices are at the heart of communities but they have been under major pressure over the past few years.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">I commend Senator Cox on her contribution during which she declared her interest. The Senator runs a very successful agency in Galway providing an excellent service in the west. I had discussions with the National Recruitment Federation on this issue. In the Gama controversy there was no reference to the fact that no Irish recruitment agency was involved in recruiting the Gama workers. A similar situation applies in the case of Irish Ferries. It should be clearly stated that neither of those issues was dealt with by Irish recruitment agencies. Some agencies were involved but they were not Irish, not that that would exonerate them in any way. I am aware the Minister of State's Department is dealing with this issue very effectively, and also the periwinkle issue on which his Department is very proactive. That is the advantage of having a dedicated Minister for labour who is proactive on the implementation of legislation and bringing forward new legislation, which he so ably outlined to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">It is interesting that the recruitment industry here is worth €1.3 billion. There are approximately 450 licensed employment agencies in Ireland and 85,000 people obtained permanent jobs in 2004 through employment agencies. There are under 10,000 employed in the industry, which is an impressive number many people would not appreciate, as I did not until I was briefed on it earlier. A total of 250,000 temporary assignments were filled through employment agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">Employment agencies are regulated under the Employment Agency Act 1971. That Act is under review and I am aware will require amending legislation next year. The Act is 34 years in place and it is proper to review legislation on a regular basis, bearing in mind the new era in which we now live.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">The activities of employment agencies can be broken down into two main areas, first, permanent placements, involving finding somebody a permanent job, and, second, temporary placements, involving finding someone a temporary job. The end employers pay a fee to the agency. It is important to note that the job-seekers do not pay the agency; some people have a different opinion on that. The end users pay the agency, the agency pays the workers and all employment rights are protected in that regard. The industry is well regulated. Its code of conduct is well laid out and the organisations affiliated to the National Recruitment Federation comply with the regulations and carry out an excellent job on behalf of their clients.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">I agree with Senator Quinn that we do not want our employment legislation to be too complex. It must be pro-employee but not anti-employer. It should be easily adhered to. In reviewing legislation the Minister of State has an ideal opportunity, with his senior officials, to review all legislation to ensure it contains pro-employment provisions. I support that.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">I thank the Minster of State for coming to the House for what has been a worthwhile debate. It is important that the Minister's officials accompanied him today.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TonyKilleen" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_202">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Killeen)</from>
          <p eId="para_452">I thank the Members who contributed to the debate and will try to respond to the principal points made. Senator Coghlan referred to the danger of over-regulation and the negative impact it can have on small firms, something we must all bear in mind. It is something we try to do. The Senator made the counter-point that employees in small companies must have their rights vindicated but that sometimes we exclude them, as happened regarding the information and consultation Bill. It is a difficult balance to strike but we did as well as we could have done in that regard.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulCoghlan" eId="spk_203">
          <from>Mr. Coghlan</from>
          <p eId="para_453">I accept the balance the Minister of State struck on that issue.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TonyKilleen" eId="spk_204" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
          <from>Mr. Killeen</from>
          <p eId="para_454">I am interested in the website mentioned by the Senator and the green card issue in that context. I agree also with what he said about Irish Ferries.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">The Senator raised the question of extra resources for the labour inspectorate. That is one part of the whole aspect that needs to be dealt with but in the review I mentioned briefly there are many areas we must examine. For example, for the inspectorate to succeed on an issue it is examining it must establish proof at criminal law level. That is unhelpful. It places a burden on both parties and I would prefer if we could devise a method that enabled us to refer many of these cases to the Labour Court, the Labour Relations Commission or the Employment Appeals Tribunal. That is the appropriate level at which they should be dealt with and the system would be far more successful if we could do that. We are committed to providing extra resources, close to doubling the current number of labour inspectors, and I am sure there will be another increase following the social partnership talks if they get under way and succeed.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">We are also examining the means for communicating information. The biggest difficulty, as the Senator and other Members will be aware, is the language barrier. We are addressing that by providing virtually every piece of legislation in a number of languages. I was looking at one yesterday which is now available in 18 languages. Most legislation is available in seven or eight languages, and others in 12. We are doing that on a gradual basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">In the area of health and safety we have joint initiatives with, for example, the Construction Industry Federation on the provision of pictograms, which is understandable. I never worked on a building site but I am very impressed by the quality of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">The Senator asked about the involvement of embassies. I have been in contact with many of them. Interestingly, in very few cases do they make the initial approach. Sometimes we have made the approaches because we read speculation or stories in the media about embassy concerns in regard to their nationals. We have told them clearly the actions we believe ought to be undertaken by people from their countries who come to Ireland. People tend not to recognise that this country is not cheap to live in or get accommodation. A great many of them come here assuming they can get a job immediately but that is not always the case. We have been encouraging the embassies to transmit useful information to their own people who may be thinking about coming here.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">The Employment Permits Bill will be introduced in the House by the Minister, Deputy Martin. The Senator will be pleased to hear that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is on board in regard to these proposals. We have had fruitful meetings with the Department and in regard to the education element. The practice heretofore regarding employment law has been that FÁS undertakes that work and it is doing it successfully. It is an area that is relatively new to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">Senator Hanafin mentioned the large number of employment rights in place and the peculiarity that we should have such difficulties in an era when we are close to full employment. In that regard we should remember that we created 93,000 jobs in the first year post-accession, many of which have gone to people outside the country. We ought not be surprised that we have teething problems which we are trying to address as effectively as possible. What we need from people who experience difficulties is, first, the information and, second, that they be supportive in terms of helping the Labour Inspectorate to meet the burden of proof. Sometimes that is not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">Senator Cox spoke in the main about the Recruitment Agency Federation and related issues, and the fact that the Act is from the early 1970s and is now dealing with a very different situation. Senators Cox and Leyden made the point that, as far as we are aware, all the difficulties, including the most high-profile cases, have arisen in situations where no Irish recruitment agency was involved. Nevertheless, this does not absolve the State from responsibility. Regardless of what agency is involved or where it is from, we must try to ensure the rights of workers are vindicated.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">Senator Cox made the point strongly that exploitation is not facilitated by Irish recruitment agencies. Such reassurance is welcome. She also set out a list of costs, of which many of us were unaware, associated with recruitment. I accept her point on the services directive. It is something we will examine and our position will be made clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">I strongly agree with Senator Quinn's point that legislation should only be in place when it is needed. There have been occasions, of which he gave an example, when the most well intentioned legislation had the opposite effect to that envisaged by its champions. Senator Quinn has frequently made the point that we are well advised to be aware of the climate in which foreign direct investment companies wish to operate and that we must try to facilitate them in this regard. We endeavour to do so to the greatest extent possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">I was initially surprised to encounter many compliant employers who argue they are at a disadvantage unless all employers in their sector are similarly compliant. This did not seem so surprising when I had time to consider it. It is clear that in many areas there are companies that behave in a cavalier, sometimes entirely illegal fashion, and undercut their competitors, especially for Government contracts, in the construction sector in particular and across a range of areas. We must ensure that compliant companies are not placed at a disadvantage. This is a major challenge, far greater than it was five or ten years ago. It is one of the reasons the legislation we are discussing is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">Senator Quinn made the important point that we must ensure directives and legislation introduced at EU level do not make Europe less competitive. If I had time, I could tell the Senator some stories about a Council of Ministers meeting at which this issue should have been given more urgent attention. In the reviewed Lisbon Agenda, however, there is a welcome acknowledgement by European governments that this is a real concern. The revised agreement comes much closer to reflecting the needs of a global economy than was the case in the original text.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">A major debate is ongoing about the national minimum wage. I take the view that the debate was conducted in 2000, primary legislation was enacted and it is my job to implement it. I recognise, however, that there are jobs which are not tenable at the minimum wage level, including perhaps the example to which Senator Quinn referred.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">In the context of the employment rights group, I hope to achieve two aims. One of these is to streamline the bodies themselves. Equally important, I hope to introduce a corpus of consolidated legislation that will be easier to understand. It will not be possible to do this in one go, however. Some type of miscellaneous provisions Bill will be required that draws together various strands and eliminates the contradictory provisions in different legislation. It will be a major job, which will probably take some 18 months, but I have made the first step in securing Government approval for it. It can only proceed, however, in the context of a much clearer delineation between the Labour Relations Commission, Labour Court and Employment Appeals Tribunal. It is a worthwhile endeavour and will be greatly advantageous to employers and employees alike.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">Senator Leyden made the important point that it is far better to conduct this type of debate in a cool climate rather than in a crisis. I mentioned earlier that in a crisis situation, much of the material that appears in public tends to be considerably at variance with the truth. This is what happened in the case of the periwinkle pickers. Senator Leyden also referred to recruitment agencies and progress in regard to the situation in An Post. In particular, he mentioned the type of situation that will pertain in regard to An Post in a liberalised market.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">I have already dealt with the Employment Permits Bill 2005. We must take account of the types of resource pressures that some of the employment rights legislation places on industry and employers, as well as on Departments. This is an issue of considerable concern to me in regard to the long-term employed and the thankfully very small coterie of individuals who have difficulty accessing the workplace. Some of them may be disadvantaged to some extent in the context of the minimum wage in regard to the jobs mentioned by Senator Quinn. The best approach is to focus on training and retraining. In regard to disabled people, for example, we recently provided the wage supplement. It will be interesting to see how that plays out. We are in the business of helping people in terms of training and support and incentivising employers to recruit them. It is something to which we must direct considerably more energy than we have done heretofore.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">In regard to employment agencies, we must acknowledge that there will be particular difficulties in trying to address the problems that arise with non-national employment agencies, particularly those that recruit people in countries outside the EU. In such circumstances, the agency effectively controls how those workers are employed in Ireland and has often already put them in debt prior to arrival. It is difficult to put in place a system and resources to enable us to get to the bottom of this type of situation. It is an area that will be difficult to deal with at national and even EU level.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">Several Members referred to the displacement of workers that is happening in the context of globalisation. We must try to strike a balance in this regard. In the Irish Ferries case, we are grappling with a situation governed by international maritime law rather than Irish labour law. It is a case for which it will be difficult to devise a satisfactory resolution but we will continue to endeavour to do so. I very much regret that the company seems unprepared to recognise the Labour Court in any meaningful way.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">That is an important issue but it is far more important that we address the issues within our own competence. We have a job of work to do in this regard. I welcome the input of Senators. They come from a variety of backgrounds and bring much common sense to debates such as this.</p>
