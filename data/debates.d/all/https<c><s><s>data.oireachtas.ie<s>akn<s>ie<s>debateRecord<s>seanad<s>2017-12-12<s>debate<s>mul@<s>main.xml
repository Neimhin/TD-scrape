            <p eId="para_20">I thank the Cathaoirleach for selecting this topic and thank the Minister of State for attending to reply to my queries. All of us in the west know that the campus of GMIT has played a huge role in the economic, educational and social life of Castlebar, Mayo and the surrounding regions over the many years since it was founded in, I believe, the 1980s. Issues have arisen in recent times in regard to underinvestment and lack of upgrading of facilities, as well as the range of course development. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, visited the campus earlier this year, met the president and the staff and set up a working group.</p>
            <p eId="para_21"> To be fair to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, he gave a commitment that GMIT Castlebar would have a sustainable future on the Mayo campus. My understanding now is that the report has been completed but has not yet been signed off on or published. I raise this query because I believe that should happen at the earliest opportunity in order to provide certainty for staff and the current students, but, more importantly, for the students who will be filling out CAO forms in the early weeks in January. We need to provide that certainty immediately in order to maximise the potential of the Castlebar complex.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor)<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T13:05:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_22">I thank Senator John O'Mahony for raising this issue. I also want to thank Senators Paddy Burke and Michelle Mulherin for raising this issue with me and the Minister, Deputy Bruton, on numerous occasions.</p>
            <p eId="para_23"> At the outset, I would like to state that the Department and the HEA are fully committed to implementing a viable development plan for the future of the Castlebar campus of GMIT.</p>
            <p eId="para_24">Following the categorisation by the HEA of GMIT as a financially vulnerable institution in 2016 a number of actions were identified in order to address the financial position of the institute. In line with the HEA's policy for dealing with such institutes, it has agreed a three year financial plan with GMIT to reach a balanced budget. GMIT has also identified a number of areas to address its financial position. A particular area for concern was the Mayo campus in Castlebar which had demonstrated significant budget deficits in respect of its operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> As a result of these concerns a working group was established in March 2017 to formulate a plan to develop a sustainable future for the Mayo campus. The GMIT working group was chaired by the HEA and comprised representatives of GMIT, the Department, Mayo County Council and other local stakeholders. The brief of the working group was to formulate a plan for a sustainable future and growth options for GMIT Mayo campus Castlebar. The working group engaged extensively with the local community, business interests, staff and students of GMIT, the executive and the board of GMIT, local public representatives, and other stakeholders. This included a number of meetings and open fora. </p>
            <p eId="para_26"> To inform the work of the group, a base of information was gathered, including an analysis of labour market needs in the region, student supply and demand, the role of the further education sector and the impact of the campus on the local and regional economy. The views of external stakeholders were sought in relation to these matters and 23 submissions were received. These views and submissions were considered by the working group and have fed into all deliberations resulting in the compilation of the final report.</p>
            <p eId="para_27"> The report of the GMIT working group has now been submitted to my Department. The report is intended to provide a roadmap towards a sustainable and vibrant Castlebar campus of GMIT. That is what we all want and it is in all our interests to ensure that the recommendations in the report are implemented. I will consider the findings and recommendations in conjunction with officials in my Department. I confirm that the report will be published before the end of 2017.</p>
            <p eId="para_28"> After a period without any significant investment in higher education, this Government has now started the process of reinvesting in higher education. There will be an additional €100 million in funding provided to higher education in 2018 compared to 2016. This additional funding will help to address the funding challenge facing the higher education sector and will support institutions such as GMIT in returning to financial sustainability.</p>
            <p eId="para_29"> This reinvestment will be supported by a review of the financial allocation model for higher education and a new systems performance framework that sets out the key strategic objectives for the first years. I intend to publish the review before the end of 2017 and the new framework early in 2018. They will provide the overall strategic context and funding allocation model to complement and support the future sustainability of the Castlebar campus of GMIT.</p>
            <p eId="para_30"> I thank Senator John O'Mahony for affording me the opportunity to respond to the House on this matter. Senators Paddy Burke and Michelle Mulherin have also raised this issue with me and the Minister, Deputy Bruton, on numerous occasions.</p>

            <p eId="para_31">I thank the Minister of State for her reply. I presume I can take it from her response that the report will be published in the next few days. Can I also take it that the suggestion is there will be a pathway announced early in 2018 and there will be investment in the Castlebar campus?</p>

            <from>Senator Máire Devine<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T13:15:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_39">I welcome the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, to the Chamber. She has been here on several occasions at my request for which I thank her. I would like to extend a welcome to the survivors who are seated in the Visitors' Gallery today and I believe the others are watching online.</p>
            <p eId="para_40"> Last week, a somewhat surprise third interim report was published by the commission. Based on the recommendation of the report, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs subsequently granted an extension of one year to the commission to complete its work. I echo the sentiments of many of the survivors who welcome this difficult decision in that it affords more attention to detail and a greater depth of research to be conducted.</p>
            <p eId="para_41"> However, as the Minister will know, it is a very difficult decision as many survivors have a very legitimate concern that the delay will mean many of the elderly survivors will not reach closure on this matter, and a closure that they need, because they may not have that length of life. Furthermore, as I know she is aware, many of the survivors still suffer daily due to the trauma that they suffered. The delay will mean they will have to wait even longer for the answers they desperately seek.</p>
            <p eId="para_42"> I am glad that the Minister is here today to outline the practical supports that will be available to survivors in the meantime. For example, can they access scanned records before the final report? Many of the survivors are older and might need IT assistance as well as emotional and psychological supports. It is not ideal but the fact is the report has been delayed. If survivors could at least access records it might offer them some closure in the meantime. </p>
            <p eId="para_43"> The interim report also says that the additional timeframe will not incur additional costs. Can the Minister clarify the matter because the deadline has been extended by a year? </p>
            <p eId="para_44"> In the Minister's December update on this issue she stated that her officials were working on a number of measures to respond to the issues that arose from the facilitated meetings that have been held to date. She now plans to bring a number of proposals in this regard to the Government in the coming weeks. How will the newly announced collaborative forum's recommendations tie in with this work? Can she confirm whether the process will run parallel? Can she give a commitment of a clear timeframe for when she will bring the proposals to Cabinet and outline what they will consist of?</p>
            <p eId="para_45"> I recognise the amount of work that the Minister has put into listening to the survivors. I have thoroughly read the facilitation reports and there are some excellent suggestions therein that have come directly from the survivors. Can she give a commitment that the recommendations will not be dependent on the collaborative forum? </p>
            <p eId="para_46"> There is an elephant in the room. I refer to the leaked technical report into the Tuam site that has just been published and cannot be ignored. I have read the Minister's statement and know that she regrets the leak. I need to look into the details of this newly-published report. Will the Cabinet finish its considerations today? Has the Minister's Department a contingency plan on how to support those who will be deeply affected by the recommendations of such a report, especially if the reporting that we have thus far is to be believed?</p>

            <p eId="para_47">I welcome the opportunity to provide an update on the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes. The commission submitted a third interim report which I published last week, to which Senator Devine has just referred. The report, which is available on my Department's website, outlined the practical challenges the commission faced in meeting its initial deadline of 17 February 2018 for the completion of its reports. In its report the commission requested that the deadline be extended by one year and as the House will be aware, the Government has agreed to extend the timeframe for submission. The commission is now required to submit its three final reports by 17 February 2019.</p>
            <p eId="para_48"> The commission advised that the confidential committee has to date met with 346 former residents or others with connections to the institutions under investigation. The commission stated that it would not be possible for the confidential committee to meet the almost 200 additional persons who have already applied to provide accounts of their experience and to complete its report by February 2018. The commission noted that its wide terms of reference has necessitated the collection and analysis of a vast range of documentary material relating to the institutions under investigation and that the analysis of all relevant records would not be completed until the middle of 2018. Although the commission has heard evidence from 140 individuals, the process in respect of the authorities who ran these institutions cannot be completed until all of the documentary evidence has been analysed.</p>
            <p eId="para_49"> In reaching the decision to grant the commission's extension request, the Government accepted that additional time is required to facilitate the comprehensive statutory investigation into the matters of significant public concern referred to the commission. The Government considers that the public interest is best served by allowing additional time for the commission to conclude all relevant lines of inquiry. Facilitating former residents to provide accounts of their experience was one of the main reasons for establishing the commission. I know the commission will effectively use the additional time to ensure that many more witnesses have such an opportunity. The additional time will ensure that crucial questions can be fully addressed to provide the answers to which the former residents are entitled. </p>
            <p eId="para_50"> I want to thank the commission for this update on its important work. When I recently met the commission I was again reassured by its members' absolute commitment to establishing the full facts of what happened to women and children in these institutions. I have, however, asked the commission to make every effort to deliver its reports as soon as practicable. I understand that this extension of time delays the day which many former residents have been eagerly anticipating. I understand that fully and I know that many have expressed disappointment and frustration at this development. I acknowledge those who are with us in the House this afternoon. Equally, it is important to state that a number of advocates have acknowledged that the extension is a pragmatic response to the challenges faced by the commission. </p>
            <p eId="para_51"> In the interim, I am proceeding with a number of measures to support former residents. Following on from facilitated consultations held over 2017 with former residents, their families and supporters, I am making arrangements to establish a collaborative forum to support former residents in developing issues and solutions that are of concern to them. The collaborative forum is a progressive response to the theme of "nothing about us without us" which has emerged from the facilitated consultations. I am currently working with a facilitator on this matter and hope to make further announcements in the coming weeks. In addition, in recognition of Ireland's absolute commitment to human rights, the Government has decided to invite the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence, Mr. Pablo de Greiff, to visit Ireland. I will work with my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, to arrange this invitation. It is important to say that these developments have been welcomed by a number of advocates who recognise the progressive nature of the Government's approach. </p>
            <p eId="para_52"> This morning, as Senator Devine pointed out, the Government has agreed to publish the expert technical report on the Tuam site. I will be making a more detailed statement on that report later this afternoon and the report will be available on my Department's website soon. I want to thank the members of the expert technical group for their work on such a complex and sensitive issue. The group's report will help everyone to understand the nature of the options that are now open to us so we can make some well-informed decisions. The report is a detailed technical document running to over 250 pages and it will, understandably, take some time to absorb and fully process what it tells us. I want to take this opportunity to assure all interested parties that there will be public consultations with stakeholders before any decisions are made. My primary concern is to ensure that whatever action is taken respects the memory and dignity of the deceased children who lived their short lives in that institution.</p>

            <p eId="para_54">I welcome the Government's invitation to the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence, Mr. Pablo de Greiff, to guide us on the years, if not centuries, of mistreatment of our very vulnerable citizens. This is a prudent and very important step. I welcome most of what the Minister, Deputy Zappone, said but I wish to clarify one point. Will the survivors be able to have access to their scanned records before the final report, and will they be given IT, emotional and psychological support during that time? It would be great if the Minister could answer that question.</p>

            <p eId="para_55">I am aware that both of those questions that are live. What I have indicated is that as a result of the initial facilitation process, out of which some of the issues Senator Devine has identified have been expressed again, we have decided that it would be really important to establish this collaborative forum which will report in six months. One of the areas it will be looking at will be to identify the practical supports already identified in the earlier facilitation.</p>
            <p eId="para_56"> The membership of the collaborative forum will be representative. We have quite a detailed way of trying to ensure the people who will be on the forum will be representative of the different voices in respect of supports people want so that when it makes recommendations to me, I can be confident that is representative and then I can make decisions on the basis of that information. We have asked the collaborative forum to report within six months. If it wishes to report sooner, that is okay with me. I will wait for it to come forward before answering those questions explicitly.</p>

            <p eId="para_59">I wish to raise the issue of approval for housing projects in Cork. My understanding is that the projects were identified, the appropriate planning process were gone through, estimates were prepared, there was an invitation to submit tenders and that the tenders received were in excess of the initial estimates. Cork City Council corresponded with the Department and made it aware of this in early September. I understand the matter may have moved on since I tabled this Commencement matter. I know the Department was working on the issue. However, the city council and I, as a public representative in Cork North Central, where we have a large number of people on the housing waiting list, are anxious that any project identified by the local authority is progressed in the fastest possible time so that the project can start, the houses can be built and people can be accommodated. That is the context in which I raise this Commencement matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_60">I thank Senator Colm Burke for raising this matter. Under Rebuilding Ireland, a total of 50,000 social housing homes will be delivered out to 2021 for those individuals and families who need them the most. Cork City Council's housing programme is a key component of the Rebuilding Ireland plan. Only recently, I spent a day in Cork with the city and county councils discussing and exploring how we can continue to work together to accelerate and increase social housing delivery in Cork.</p>
            <p eId="para_61"> The projects to which Senator Colm Burke refers are projects where Cork City Council sought the delivery of social housing solutions through a competitive dialogue process or procedure. The aim of this procedure is to provide a mechanism through which the city council could engage with interested parties to deliver a significant quantum of newly constructed social housing units in addition to other housing provision methods. This involved looking at the delivery process from an assessment of suitable sites through design and planning right up to the construction and completion of homes ready for occupation by residents. My Department supports initiatives at local authority level such as this procedure entered into by Cork City Council to provide streamlined and effective solutions for social housing delivery. The council's assessment of responses resulted in a number of schemes which are short-listed to progress to dialogue phase.</p>
            <p eId="para_62">In total, 11 schemes were short-listed, with the combined potential to deliver 215 units of social housing at various locations in Cork city. Of the 11 projects chosen through this process, four were previously approved and have already begun construction, delivering 85 homes at a cost of just under €22 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_63"> I am pleased to be able to advise the House that, for further assessment by my Department of the budget request for the remaining seven projects, I have been able to provide the council with the necessary approval. I thank the Senator for continuing to raise this matter with me since early September. These seven projects will deliver a further 134 badly-needed social housing homes for families on the Cork city housing list. The first of these homes will be completed in the third quarter of next year, with the remainder following in 2019. The budget approved for these seven projects is just under €39 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_64"> The delivery of these projects will deliver an important development for Cork city, particularly the South Parish area. The objective of the Cork city regeneration project is to help create neighbourhoods with a distinct character and better permeability and coherency and offer significant opportunities for an improved social mix, with the potential for the inclusion of private housing development within the area. The projects will deliver on these objectives, enhancing the physical character of the local areas involved and contributing to the wider social regeneration. When I next visit Cork, I look forward to seeing the progress in this regard and on the wider portfolio of projects that the city council is advancing.</p>

            <p eId="para_68"> Both councils in Cork have housing action plans and their committees are doing excellent work. I had the chance to engage with them in Cork recently.

          <p eId="para_72">The Ombudsman, Peter Tyndall, has published a report on the administration of the Magdalen laundries redress scheme by the Department of Justice and Equality. The report vindicates what survivors and campaigners have been saying about inadequacies and failures in the delivery of the scheme. It seems from the report that women were denied access to the redress scheme as a result of serious irregularities within the Department of Justice and Equality. Over the course of a year, the Ombudsman investigated 27 complaints relating to the administration of the scheme. He published his report last week after a year of work.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">The terms of reference of the scheme have been interpreted particularly narrowly, with the result that applicants have been barred from accessing the scheme. The report also highlighted examples of evidence not being followed up and a lack of consistency in applying the criteria for access to the scheme. Alarmingly, it found a blanket refusal to include in the scheme persons who were in any of the institutions listed under the remit of the Residential Institutions Redress Board. The Ombudsman found this refusal manifestly unfair.</p>
          <p eId="para_74"> The report also showed that the Department of Justice and Equality relied heavily on word of mouth statements from the various orders. The Ombudsman also noted serious delays in making payments to successful applicants to the scheme. He recommended an immediate review of the scheme, particularly the blanket bar from accessing the scheme applied to those who were resident in the institutions listed in the Residential Institutions Redress Board scheme. When wrong is done in any part of society, whether by a politician, Department or hospital, rather than facing up to and remedying our failures, we seem to double down which causes much more hurt to individuals who have been treated unfairly. I call on the Minister to address the House as part of a debate on the report in the new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_75"> I also raise the tragic shooting in Blanchardstown yesterday. I convey my sympathies and those of the Fianna Fáil Party group to the victims and their families. We learned yesterday that a baby was shot in the leg in this highly concerning incident. I pray that the feud will not continue and there will not be any escalation or retaliation in respect of these matters. Our thoughts are with those who were injured and are in hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_76"> I call on the Minister for Justice and Equality to attend the House to discuss how he intends to improve outcomes on the serving of summonses. We learned with shock in a "Prime Time Investigates" programme broadcast last night that one in four summonses is not served correctly.</p>

          <p eId="para_77">We are led to believe that progress has been made in the Brexit negotiations since the House last met. I acknowledge the work done on this issue by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney. It is important that we recap to clearly understand what has been agreed. In that regard, I will be interested to hear if anyone has a different understanding from me on what occurred.</p>
          <p eId="para_78"> It is my understanding that, as a result of the protracted negotiations between the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and others in the United Kingdom and European Union, it is clearer that the Good Friday Agreement will be protected and everyone born in Northern Ireland will continue to have the right to Irish and, therefore, European Union citizenship. Moreover, the common travel area allowing unimpeded travel between the UK and Ireland will continue, and UK and Irish citizens will continue to enjoy freedom to work and study and access to housing, health care, pensions and welfare in both countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_79"> The UK has committed to ensuring that, in the North, there will be no diminution of human rights safeguards and equality of opportunity, as set out in European law. These are simple and important achievements. Given the complexity of the debate on Brexit, it is incumbent on politicians that we demystify the intrigue and language surrounding this issue and try to explain in simple terms and concepts what the negotiations are about. I have highlighted only some of the key issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_80"> I ask the Government to maintain pressure in fighting for the interests of the people of the island of Ireland. It is nice to see this much used term being used more often in political dialogue, debate and discussion. The key message is that we must protect the interests of the people of the island of Ireland in terms of prosperity and peace. I ask the Government to maintain focus and not to apologise for fighting for and seeking the best deal for the island of Ireland and its people, North, South, east and west. </p>
          <p eId="para_81"> I call on the Leader to ask the Minister for Education and Skills to come to the House early in the new year for a comprehensive debate on Caranua, an organisation established under the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Act 2012 to manage €110 million pledged by the religious congregations to survivors of abuse. In simple terms, Caranua has failed to meet the complex needs and requirements of many of the survivors of abuse. </p>
          <p eId="para_82">We need to examine this. There is a lot of money that was meant to address issues such as health care, housing, physical and mental health, emotional well-being and, possibly, education and training but these areas have not been fully addressed. They are complex issues and there are complex difficulties associated with many people who have suffered and survived institutional abuse. We need to consider this again. We need to engage with the victims of abuse and the organisations and put together a review. I would like to have a review but it is important that the Minister would attend the House first to explain the background to it and outline his intentions and plans.</p>

          <p eId="para_83">I want to bring to the attention of the Seanad a letter published in yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Post</i> that was signed by more than 200 members of civic nationalism. The letter expresses the frustration and abandonment felt by the nationalist community at the repeated failure by the British Government to implement all aspects of previous agreements. It is deeply worrying for the nationalist community that, as aspects of Brexit are negotiated in Brussels and elsewhere, much of the content and detail of the agreement relies on the British Government implementing it because the British Government does not have good form in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_84"> The letter was signed by citizens from the worlds of sport, law, academia, community, business, education and the media. The reality is that nationalists in Ireland no longer look to Westminster for leadership or direction on the issues concerning them. They are increasingly looking to the Dublin Government to provide leadership. The result of the two elections this year made that abundantly clear when Sinn Féin was given an increased mandate for its explicit abstinence policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_85"> Many of these people see the impact of the failure to implement previous agreements in their professional lives. Lawyers have witnessed the impact that delayed inquests and inquiries have on the relatives of those killed and injured in the conflict. The letter states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_86">This is most recently instanced in the British Government's refusal to move on the legacy inquest rights. The Conservative Party's political pact with the DUP has now become a grave threat to political progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">This letter should be viewed as an indication that nationalists and republicans want to see the institutions restored and working.</p>
          <p eId="para_88"> In terms of some of the simple and nonsensical debate around why the institutions do not just get up and running, the institutions are no use to anyone unless they are underpinned by equality and parity of esteem and this must be part of a rights-based society. There is no point in restoring the institutions if they fail to provide the rights of citizens that are available across these islands. The Irish Government needs to be proactive on the issue. The current crisis has come about due to the actions of the DUP and the Tory Party. By convening the intergovernmental conference immediately, pressure can be directly placed on the British not to capitulate to regressive elements and to deliver the rights and protections for citizens that could see the institutions restored again.</p>
          <p eId="para_89"> The Taoiseach spoke last week of the Irish Government never again abandoning Northern nationalists. They have stated clearly what is now needed and the Taoiseach must heed it and act. Notwithstanding having learned today that the Taoiseach will be coming into the Chamber in February, I ask that he attend in the new year to discuss how he intends to put these welcome words of never again abandoning Northern nationalists into action. It is important that the Taoiseach attend the House. However, this is a substantive issue in itself and I would welcome the Taoiseach attending to discuss that element purely with us and how he will implement what he said.</p>

          <p eId="para_90">Ireland's opting into the EU reception directive should be broadly welcomed for two reasons. The first is that the directive addresses the right to work for asylum seekers, which the recent Supreme Court judgment stated clearly the State must do. Second, it explicitly requires the State to ensure that the best interests of children are considered in all decisions relating to their asylum application as well as their general well-being and development, as is now the case in much other Irish law. However, direct provision remains an anarchic system of institutionalisation and marginalisation of asylum seekers that should be completely abolished.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">I have a strong understanding of this through working with people with disabilities. We are struggling very hard to make sure people with disabilities do not go into institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_92"> Listening to "Morning Ireland" earlier today, I heard an Irish family member speak of the devastation Huntington's disease has brought to her family over the past 25 years through its effect on her husband through the slow and heartbreaking loss of his ability to walk, to talk and to think. One of her children is positive for the condition as well, and she has the same fate ahead of her. This does not just affect the individual. It is hereditary. They and all of the other 750 families affected are desperate for a therapy to stop this disease from taking hold. They are looking for the straw of hope for the first time. Yesterday, the success of the first human trial of a Huntington's-lowering drug was announced. Ionis-HTTRx lowers the harmful huntingtin protein in the nervous system. This trial will move into the next phase, available to a much larger group of patients. The question is how Irish folk who have or will have this condition can access this opportunity, which is an opportunity of hope. The Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland is calling for vital Huntington's disease specialist services to be available here in Ireland in order that patients devastated by what I can only describe as the cruellest of cruel illnesses can be part of this potentially life-saving clinical trial.</p>
          <p eId="para_93"> We are all aware of the need for improved resourcing and development of neurological services in general. There is actually not one nurse specialist here in Ireland to deal with this cohort or to give them some support. To put that in perspective, in Northern Ireland there are two to fill that post, and we wish them well with that. I am asking the Leader to make his best efforts, as I am sure he will, to request that the Minister for Health would do everything possible to make sure that along with people from North America and across Europe, people here in Ireland have access to these trials. I cannot overemphasise the fact that this is the first moment that these people will have some hope of avoiding 20 to 25 years of a devastating condition.</p>

          <from>Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T14:15:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_94">I want to raise two issues this afternoon. I wish to ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to attend the House to address an issue which I think most Members would agree is a major problem in Irish society. It is not a new problem, but in the last number of weeks, as has been alluded to already, it has become prominent. I refer to the area of gun crime. Very close to where I live, there was an interception of a gang apparently on the way to commit a murder. Intercepting that person was great work by the Garda. A garda was shot in the line of duty only days ago, and then, shockingly, this week we have heard reports of a baby being caught in the crossfire. Too often in society, when there is a gun crime or a shooting, it is dismissed as gangland. Sometimes people will even say that as long as gangs are doing it to each other, it does not affect them. We cannot really live in a society that would stand over such comments as that. This week it is quite clear that gardaí are putting their bodies on the line and even infants often get caught in the crossfire.</p>
          <p eId="para_95"> It is time to have a national debate on gun crime, how it is affecting our society and how children are being desensitised to it. It is particularly disturbing, I would suggest, that any child would grow up anywhere in Ireland and hear that there has been a murder overnight in their area. It is not good enough, it is not normal, it is not right, and we should never ever consider it to be normal. It would befit this House to have such a debate with the Minister for Justice and Equality and allow him to outline his attempts to tackle this very serious issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">Unfortunately, there is a certain amount of empowerment that comes with handling a firearm and young people are often attracted to that way of life. We need to understand the reasons behind that and tackle them.</p>
          <p eId="para_97"> Related to that, I would like to have another debate with the Minister for Education and Skills on the wide-ranging issue of educational disadvantage. We had some positive statistics last week on the rate of literacy among children in Ireland. Much credit has to go to successive Ministers in that regard. For our part in the Labour Party, in the previous Government we placed a huge emphasis on literacy and it is good to see the Government is continuing that good work. All those efforts are to be commended, but there are many overlapping reasons educational disadvantage is still an issue. We still have one child in three leaving the DEIS primary schools with basic reading problems. We have a 17.9% functional illiteracy rate among adults in the country. It is an issue of power that we need to address.</p>
          <p eId="para_98"> There are many facets to this issue of educational disadvantage. It needs to be tackled from pregnancy to infancy, to early school years and beyond. It is something that should be addressed, if possible, in a wide-ranging debate. If the Leader could facilitate that debate, it would be of great benefit to see how we can empower all citizens to seek a life for themselves in mainstream society through education and not to turn to other areas of empowerment which, unfortunately, we have seen cause such devastation to families and to members of the Garda Síochána this week.</p>

          <p eId="para_99">I want to raise an issue with regard to the funding for maintenance for national and regional roads. Obviously, the recent news that the budget for capital investment in the road infrastructure is to increase and the budget for regional and local roads is to increase was welcome. However, one of yesterday's newspapers reported that the maintenance grant for 2018 was to be reduced from €26 million to €22 million. After the weekend we have had, particularly in the areas seriously affected by snow, there is something that does not add up here. Perhaps it is merely a matter of clarification. It is something on which I have submitted a Commencement matter as well. Will the Leader seek clarity from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport on this issue? While I am at it, I compliment all the local authority workers who worked around the clock on a couple of days, particularly Saturday night and Sunday night last, in freeing up and gritting the roads.</p>

          <p eId="para_101">Following on from the remarks by Senator Ó Ríordáin, this has been a very bad year publicity-wise for An Garda Síochána with the whistleblower saga, the tribunals, the penalty points, etc. It is important at the end of the year that we, as legislators, declare again our full support and admiration for the work being done by An Garda Síochána to keep us and the citizens of this country safe. This is an issue which has been raised by the Leader and by many other Senators, particularly on my side of the House by Senators Leyden and Gallagher.</p>
          <p eId="para_102"> We had a pleasant ceremony at the weekend where a number of gardaí were singled out for the special award of the Scott medal for bravery. I am sure Senators followed it in the newspaper. Indeed, the Cathaoirleach must be proud that a close relation of his was a recipient of one of the Scott medals for bravery. There was an interview with a garda who had the trauma of having a gun pointed at her head after facing down armed gunmen already and she stated significantly that she realised that the Garda uniform is not a shield. Of course, it is not. Gardaí are unarmed, but their shield is the support and respect that they enjoy from the ordinary people. We are all aware of heroism and bravery by the ordinary garda on the street.</p>
          <p eId="para_103">Anyone who has been in these Houses for any length of time, and living in Dublin, will have seen it for themselves. I have often witnessed gardaí facing down groups of violent young men on the streets, merely through their presence, calmness and coolness. We know they are now faced with gun crime on the widest scale seen since the Provisional IRA decided it was in the wrong. Only for this the Garda would face a double attack, but the attack now is organised as opposed to political crime. I want to reaffirm our support for the Garda, many members of whom have paid the ultimate sacrifice, including my neighbour, the late Jerry McCabe. We know what happened to him. It is timely to restate our support when the Garda is under pressure from the media morning, noon and night.</p>

          <p eId="para_104">I raise the issue of section 39 workers again. Over the course of this week and next, thousands of these workers in our hospices, community hospitals and the intellectual disability sector are being balloted for all-out strike action. It is hard to comprehend that they have been forced into this action. Even the Taoiseach acknowledged some weeks ago in the Dáil that the link between section 39 workers and the rest of the public service should have been maintained. The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath, says he supports their case for equality, yet with the Departments of Finance and Health passing the buck from one to the other, thousands of workers are now being balloted for all-out strike action as they face into Christmas. Frankly, their case is unanswerable, as even the Workplace Relations Commission has stated they are in the right. The absence of responsibility from the Government to date is frankly inexcusable. I call for a debate on the matter as soon as practicable. The Government parties must shoulder some responsibility in this regard. It is not good enough to say they agree with section 39 workers such as colleagues and friends of mine in the Daughters of Charity and Brothers of Charity in Limerick. They say they agree there is an injustice but decide to do absolutely nothing about it. Let us have a debate on the issue but, more important, in the interim, while these workers are being balloted, let us show the common sense that is required. In other words, the Government must engage in a process whereby these workers can get back the money they so justly deserve. That is all they are looking for. They are simply seeking a process to be initiated to give them back the money they so richly deserve. The irony is everyone in this Chamber will agree with me but no one on the Government benches seems prepared to do a damn thing about it.</p>

          <p eId="para_105">I raise the issue of the gritting of secondary roads. We had bad frosty weather over the past few nights but secondary roads in my area near Athboy, Kildalkey, Enfield and Oldcastle are not being gritted. Some of them are on main bus routes. A few weeks ago, a bus went into the ditch in Kildalkey because there was no grit on the road and it could not get any traction on a bad corner. Yesterday, when I was dropping a friend home, we came across a lady with a young child who was after going into a ditch but, thankfully, nobody was hurt. Secondary roads all over Ireland are not being gritted. However, in Scotland, farmers are given a gratuity every year. They store grit, salt, gravel in a bank on their properties and when the bad weather hits, they grit 5 km or 6 km each in their communities. Everything moves in Scotland whereas in Ireland everything falls down because the local authorities do not have enough staff. We have to look at the Scottish way.</p>

          <p eId="para_107">I thank the Senator. It is a good idea. Two or three years ago, farmers in Kerry went to the gravel yards in order that they could grit the roads. When farmers went to do that in counties Laois and Offaly, they were told they could not because there was no insurance to cover them. We have to consider providing insurance for them as well but the Scottish way works.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">They are paying their property tax and everything else yet, because they are on secondary roads, they cannot come out of their homes. They are afraid to go on the roads because they might not get back home.</p>
          <p eId="para_109"> Can we have the Minister in to speak about the Scottish way? Let us debate it and move forward. There is no reason rural Ireland has to close down due to bad roads.</p>

          <p eId="para_110">I want to highlight the issue I raised last week. I was on Molesworth Street a few minutes ago at the peaceful protest by the "My Name Is" campaign around the homelessness situation, at which there was a huge crowd. We really need to look at this issue because people are starting to get tired of the fact they do not see any change. We have to address the issue around homelessness. People are dying on the streets. I know I am repeating myself when I say that over 3,500 children are going to be homeless this Christmas. It is freezing out there, so enough is enough. We have to prioritise this. A national emergency has to be called on the homelessness issue. People are homeless all over the country, not just in Dublin, although I know the numbers are higher in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_111"> Will the Leader invite in the Minister to give us some kind of progress report on what is going on? People want to know what is being done. I ask that the Minister would come in to give us a progress report because we need to know if this is a priority and if an emergency is being called, given I believe it is a crisis. People are not happy and are constantly contacting me, as are the media. I should not be the one they are contacting because they are asking me what is going on and I do not know. I ask the Leader to bring in the Minister to give us an update on what is going on in regard to the homelessness crisis in this country.</p>

          <p eId="para_112">Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá faoi uaigneas. I mo thuairim, tá an fhadhb seo níos measa anois ná riamh. Is fadhb í do dhochtúirí agus an tseirbhís sláinte ar fad mar tá uaigneas olc do shláinte daoine. Is brónach é seo, ach tá sé fíor. Tá an teicneolaíocht tábhachtach ach tá teagmháil phearsanta níos fearr.</p>
          <p eId="para_113"> Personal contact and interaction with others is much better for us than technology alone. Scientific, medical and, indeed, public policy research on the issue of loneliness all outline the devastating impact that loneliness can have. It is perhaps prophetic that today is the anniversary of the day in 1901 when the Italian physicist and radio pioneer Marconi sent the first radio transmission 2,000 miles across the Atlantic. Marconi transformed communication as we know it. Last week was the 25th anniversary of the first text message. Now, of course, we are awash with communication options - Facebook, FaceTime, Skype and Snapchat, to mention just a few - but, despite all these communication models, people are lonelier than ever. The human interaction is often missing, the knowledge that somebody cared enough to drop in to see that someone was doing okay. The one thing I have come to know is that loneliness never discriminates between young and old, rich and poor or urban and rural. It is now at epidemic levels. We all need to play a role in this battle. The Government has an important role to play also and it needs to immediately establish a loneliness task force or commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_114"> On a second issue, I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that No. 15, Courts Service (Amendment) Bill 2017, be taken before No. 1. It is a simple Bill that will bring an end to the farce whereby the Courts Service invests millions of euro in the tobacco industry.</p>

          <p eId="para_117">I would like to raise an issue I raised previously, as have others. That is the fodder crisis facing farmers. It is a very serious issue, particularly in the Border counties and the west. Teagasc recently conducted a survey in those affected areas. It claimed that 60% to 70% of farmers surveyed were of the opinion that they were going to be short of fodder now and for the remainder of the year. I echo calls made by the ICMSA and the IFA for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, to get a grip on this situation before it is too late. They have highlighted a number of issues that could potentially assist farmers in a difficult situation. Fodder has been sourced in the south of the country but there are large costs associated with transporting it. The ICMSA and the IFA are looking for a transport subsidy to assist farmers get the fodder to their farms. They are also proposing that a livestock meal voucher system is introduced for farmers that are most acutely affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_118"> Farmers are under severe pressure. It is stressful because they do not know how their animals are going to be fed at the end of this year. I ask that the Minister, Deputy Creed, come into the House to address what measures he intends to introduce so that farmers will be compensated, in some shape or form, for the fodder that they are going to have to purchase to keep their cattle alive.</p>

          <p eId="para_119">I refer first to President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. It is a highly dangerous and provocative move. There is very little that we can do in this country. However, this House has passed a motion calling on the Government to recognise the state of Palestine. That is something that we can do. I ask the Leader to raise this issue with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, and see if the Government will recognise the state of Palestine.</p>
          <p eId="para_120"> Today, I came here on the new cross-city Luas. It was a very convenient and efficient service. I congratulate those responsible on bringing it in on time and marginally under budget. This is unusual for a piece of transport infrastructure like this. However, yesterday all my predictions about the dangers of this system were brought to bear. We had complete traffic chaos in the centre of the city. I remember the late Garret FitzGerald, who drew the mathematics about the Luas, demonstrated that even at that time in those conditions of population it was impossible for the Luas to move sufficient numbers of passengers to meet the traffic situation in Dublin. </p>
          <p eId="para_121"> This is all part of a grand policy to force the private car out of the city. This is totally wrong. We also see this policy in the attitude of the planning authorities in Dublin. They have deliberatively restricted parking facilities in all new developments. Where are people going to park their cars? What about people who actually live in the inner city? Do we not have the right to have a car? I imagine there is a constitutional implication for people who want to have cars in the city. I do not suppose there is time now, but early in the new year can we have a discussion on the whole future of transport for the city of Dublin? With the Luas we have, again as I predicted, a confetti of insulation, wires and all the rest of it creating a very ugly blockage to the viewing of the historical architecture of Dublin.</p>

Prevention is better than the cure and habits formed early in life are the ones that stay with us.</p>
          <p eId="para_123"> I welcome the new HIQA Bill that was passed by the Cabinet today. I hope that it will have a speedy passage through both Houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">As things stand, HIQA has a major role to play in regard to our health services in the public sector but none in the private sector. This Bill was being developed when I was the Minister for Health. It has taken a huge amount of work to get the legislation to this point and I congratulate the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, on getting it through Cabinet today. This is very important from a patient safety perspective. There are lots of clinics, about which we have all heard, that are literally fly-by-night operations. Clinics are being set up and operations are being carried out by people who describe themselves as cosmetic surgeons but who are in fact general practitioners or qualified in some other specialty entirely. I know of one instance where a woman had a procedure carried out which went quite badly wrong. She sought redress and won her court case but the individual involved was not insured. We need HIQA in our private hospitals to ensure standards. Indeed, many public consultants complain about having to deal with the consequences of botched operations in some private hospitals. This is not an attack on private hospitals. The aim is to protect the reputation of those hospitals that do operate to a very high standard but whose reputation is being damaged by private operators that are not meeting basic standards at all. I truly welcome this Bill and hope that when it is passed, HIQA will ensure that we have competent and properly qualified staff operating in clinics that are inspected regularly and held to the same standards as those prevailing in our public hospitals and some of our better private hospitals.</p>

          <p eId="para_125">I join Senator Robbie Gallagher in expressing concern about the fodder crisis. I welcome the proposal by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, to establish a fodder action group comprising the IFA, the Department, Teagasc, the co-operatives and the marts. A meeting took place last Monday which was attended by the president of the IFA, Mr. Joe Healy, and several IFA county chairpersons, including Mr. John Hanley from Creggs in County Roscommon. Over 90% of farmers in the Boyle area of north Roscommon are affected by the fodder crisis due to bad weather in the autumn. They are in dire straits. It is a real crisis and I would urge the Minister to come up with a speedy response. I am confident that he will do so and he will receive the support of this House because all Senators from rural Ireland understand the seriousness of the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_126"> On the current weather crisis, I join Senator John O'Mahony in commending the county councils who are doing their utmost in the face of very difficult conditions. They are managing to clear the national primary, secondary and regional roads but the back roads are still in pretty grim condition. However, some State agencies need to do more. Roscommon railway station, for instance, was chaotic today. There was one staff member on duty who was trying to direct traffic. No grit had been spread on roads that are the property of Iarnród Éireann. The company should be prepared for adverse weather conditions and take appropriate action from a health and safety point of view. While I commend the fact that trains are still running on time, the management of Iarnród Éireann and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, should be more involved. An action plan should be in place and when weather conditions deteriorate to a certain level, the company must ensure that railway stations and platforms are kept clear and are safe for passengers to use. As I said, there were chaotic scenes in Roscommon earlier. I wish to commend the courageous young staff member who was running the ticket office while also trying to direct traffic and prevent cars from crashing into one another. It was pretty difficult and I hope that Iarnród Éireann will take note of what has been said in Seanad Éireann today.</p>

          <p eId="para_127">I wish to raise the issue of Brexit again. The recent statement by the British Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, Mr. David Davis, to the effect that the phase 1 agreement was not legally enforceable was very unhelpful. I believe he has since qualified his remarks and has said that it is legally enforceable under the withdrawal arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">We were all a little excited two weeks ago. At the time I stated I was very disappointed with the British edition of <i>The Sun </i>newspaper for effectively telling the Taoiseach to shut his gob as I believed it was both unnecessary to do so and unwarranted. In the past few days we learned that a British parliamentarian did not know the difference between Deputy Enda Kenny and Bertie Ahern and various things. That is unacceptable, but sometimes we need to take a step back. Mr. Adam Boulton, as a presenter, has a right to take on and ask politicians difficult questions and, in turn, the Tánaiste, Deputy Simon Coveney, answered extremely well. Mr. Boulton then became involved in a media spat and said, "You Irish need to get over yourselves," but perhaps he has a point because sometimes people can be very precious. There have been instances when I have used social media to challenge something that has been said and various groups have responded and sought an apology. Perhaps Mr. Boulton was right when he said, "You Irish need to get over yourselves," just like the Scottish nationalists, the English nationalists and the far left must. Sometimes we over-emphasise things. We fight our corner and are well able to do so, but sometimes we believe the English have said something and should apologise for it. As I said, Mr. Boulton may be right; we have fought a tough battle on Brexit. I do not know Mr. Boulton, but I do know that he did not deserve the media onslaught following the making of his statement. As every politician here knows, after we articulate our points, various groups will attack us. Therefore, I think Mr. Boulton was right.</p>

          <p eId="para_129">I, too, wish to refer to the imminent fodder crisis. I welcomed the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine's formation of a fodder crisis action group. I recall the statement made at the time of its formation that it would intervene if it felt there was a need to do so. It has met. As quoted here previously and as a result of that meeting with Teagasc, farmers were surveyed. Some 85% of the farmers surveyed had less than half the amount of fodder they required. However, there is a problem because the bureaucrats will take it that if farmers have 50% of the fodder they require, the crisis will not kick in until the second half of the feeding season. As we know, some of the farmers surveyed may be at a figure of 100%, while others may be well below 50%. Unfortunately, the crisis is hitting the country, which brings the old adage of live horse and get grass to a new level. Cattle are hungry and the inclement weather over the weekend did not help in some cases. Ironically, there is fodder available in the southern half of the country. However, there may not be enough available by the end of the feeding season because we never know when it will ends, as it depends on weather conditions in the spring and early summer. Action must be taken immediately. There have been meetings and meetings about meetings on the crisis. Pushing the inevitable down the line has caused farmers untold grief and mental anguish and many animals face starvation, especially in the west and the north west. There is a need for a subsidy to transport fodder from the south to where it is needed. There is also a need to provide meal vouchers in certain instances. Will the Leader immediately invite the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to come to the House to debate the matter? The debate will probably take place in the new year, but if that happens, it will only push the problem further down the line. We need the Minister in the House now and he needs to address the problem immediately. Waiting for the second half of the feeding season to arrive is not good enough for the many farmers who are in crisis.</p>

          <p eId="para_133">Ba mhaith liom tacaíocht a thabhairt don mhéid atá ráite go dtí seo maidir le cúrsaí tithíochta i gcomhthéacs na hagóide atá ar súil taobh amuigh de Theach Laighean inniu. Tá an géarchéim tithíochta ag dul ó smacht ar fad. I concur with the thoughts expressed by Senators on the issue of housing. I commend those who organised the protest that is taking place outside Leinster House today. The nature of that protest is also commendable. Those involved are raising the issue in a positive way rather than doing so in another manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_134"> I am very concerned about reports in the media today about leaks of confidential information relating to the mother and baby home in Tuam. It is disgraceful and appalling that information about DNA sampling of human remains was leaked to newspapers and other media before the Minister, Deputy Zappone, had an opportunity to discuss it with survivors. I note that the Minister has apologised for this and has called on the Taoiseach to sanction an investigation into it. While I agree that there is an absolute need for an investigation, I do not think it should be allowed to drag on. I know from my contacts with survivors of these institutions that they are very frustrated about the slow pace at which the investigation is moving. We now have a delay of another year in the investigation. Many of these people are elderly or are not in the greatest of health. We have called on a number of occasions for a debate on this issue with the Minister. I think it is more important than ever for such a debate to be arranged. When she comes to the House early in the new year, she might bring with her the Department of the Taoiseach report on who leaked this information. How did it come to be leaked in such an insensitive way?</p>
          <p eId="para_135"> It is appalling that the survivors have had to hear about things like this through the media. We need a debate on this matter because it needs to be kept at the top of the agenda. I am aware that, correctly or incorrectly, there is a sense among survivors of similar scandals, such as the symphysiotomy scandal, that these matters tend to be kicked to touch. We do not want to see the can being kicked down the road while people get older and pass on. Justice must be seen to be done in the case of the mother and baby homes. A debate on this issue is important in the interests of getting clarity on it. Perhaps the Leader could give us an update from the Minister tomorrow. Is this investigation going to happen through the Department of the Taoiseach? Who is going to do it? Has any further information come to light regarding the circumstances in which this sensitive information came to be leaked in such an appalling manner?</p>

          <p eId="para_136">I agree with previous speakers. We all support people who need houses. We do not want people to be homeless. We are all fighting to make sure no one is homeless. There should not be anyone in such a position. Everyone deserves a home. I say "well done" to those who are protesting outside Leinster House today.</p>
          <p eId="para_137"> The Minister for Justice and Equality came to this House last week to discuss an issue with Garda overtime which has since been addressed and sorted. During the debate he said he has recruited 800 gardaí so far this year, but he did not give the names of the Garda stations to which they have been deployed. This is an important aspect of the matter, given that elderly people in my home county of Carlow are nervous because the evenings are dark. It is important to have a Garda presence in cities and rural towns and villages. The presence of gardaí inside and outside our towns makes people feel safe. Can we have clarification on the Garda stations to which the 800 recruits were deployed? The Government previously committed to the reopening of Leighlinbridge Garda station in County Carlow. We need to get clarification on that in the context of the cutbacks that are still having an effect. I will ask the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, to address these issues when he comes to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_139">Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCathaoirelach as ucht an fháilte a chuir sé roimh na teaghlaigh atá linn. Is pribhléid í go bhfuil siad i láthair inniu. Tá súil agam go mbeidh Seanadóirí in ann freastal ar chraoladh an scannáin sa seomra AV ag a 7 a chlog. I thank the Cathaoirleach for welcoming the families of those who were killed at Loughinisland in 1994. They are here for a dedicated screening for Members of the Oireachtas of the groundbreaking documentary film, "No Stone Unturned", which will be shown in the AV room at 7 p.m. this evening. I encourage all available Members to come along, not just to watch the film and see the sheer and frightening scale of the cover-up and collusion involved in the murders at Loughinisland but also to hear directly from the families of those who were murdered and the survivors of that tragic night who are here for the screening.</p>
          <p eId="para_140"> I will follow on from the remarks made by Senator Conway-Walsh on yesterday's open letter to the Taoiseach from more than 200 figures representing a broad range of civic nationalism, including individuals from academia, sport, the legal profession, the community and voluntary sector and the Irish language sector. The signatories made a public, open and direct plea to the Taoiseach to remain steadfast and become an active voice in defence of rights and citizenship. Those of us who are Irish citizens but happen to be resident in the Six Counties of the north east want to be able to access the same rights and entitlements as our fellow citizens in the rest of the country and many people across the water who have access to these same rights, whether marriage equality or language rights. In light of my opening remarks, the right to access inquests is particularly pertinent given the sourness that prevails around the issue of legacy and unresolved cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_141"> I was heartened by the Taoiseach's words that the Government will never again abandon citizens - nationalists and all others for that matter - in the North. However, if we do not become champions of the rights and entitlements I have outlined, the families of the victims of Loughinisland and many other families across the board will continue not only to feel abandoned but to be abandoned. For this reason, I welcome and commend the Taoiseach on his heartening and encouraging remarks. I echo Senator Conway-Walsh's call to have the Taoiseach address the House early in the new year on these specific and important issues. </p>

          <p eId="para_146"> Senator Ardagh raised the important issue of the redress scheme, specifically in respect of the Magdalen women. The views of the Department of Justice and Equality and the Ombudsman diverge on this issue. I have read the Ombudsman's report and the commentary on it. Redress is needed, regardless of who is involved. A previous speaker referred to forgetting our past and doubling down. Neither this Government nor its predecessor can be accused of not opening a door on some of the awful tragedies and events in our nation's history. It is important to recognise that some of the institutions in question are included in the Residential Institutions Redress Board scheme. However, everyone concerned should be able to obtain redress and we should work collectively to ensure this occurs. </p>
          <p eId="para_147"> Senator Ardagh also referred to the "Prime Time Investigates" programme broadcast last night on the issuing of summonses. While I did not see the programme, if one in four summonses is issued incorrectly, the matter must be addressed as a matter of urgency. I presume the Garda Síochána, which issues the summonses, has a role to play in fixing the shortcoming in the system. </p>
          <p eId="para_148"> Senator Boyhan raised the issue of Brexit and spoke of the island of Ireland. I wish to delve into that issue for a moment. I join the Senator in commending the Government, specifically the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, on their sterling defence of our position as a nation last week.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">Senator Boyhan is also correct in his observations that this is about the island of Ireland and the people on it, north, south, east and west. It is important that this continues to be to the forefront of our Brexit deliberations and discussions. Therefore, last week the Government took a determined line in its remarks and stance to represent the island of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_150"> I am happy to have the Minister for Education and Skills come to the House to address the Caranua matter raised by Senator Boyhan. If the Senator were to raise it as a Commencement matter, he might get a more timely response. However, I will endeavour to have the Minister attend the House in the new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_151"> Senators Conway-Walsh and Ó Donnghaile referred to the signed letter. It is important that we all stand together, as the voices of republicanism and the voices of unionism, and accept the democratic mandate given to people. It is also important that we accept the institutions of state must work to better people's lives. However, there is a responsibility on all sides to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrew's Agreement are implemented. The Senators referred to the remarks of the Taoiseach. The Taoiseach, since he has taken office, and the Tánaiste, Deputy Simon Coveney, have been clear on how they would like to see our Government work with the Government across the water to ensure that we have the institutions of state up and running and that there is an assembly with a Government in the North. Given the mandate about which the Senators spoke, there is an obligation and a duty on all sides, whether the DUP, Sinn Féin, the SDLP or the UUP, to get around the table again to work towards ensuring that we can have a power-sharing executive back up and running.</p>
          <p eId="para_152"> My views on direct provision are well known and I share Senator Dolan's comments that it is a blight on our State and one that we need to eradicate as a matter of urgency. I often commended Senator Ó Ríordáin on his work in the Department when he was a Minister of State and I now often commend the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton. I believe the Minister of State is genuine in his approach and is working to ensure that the issue is resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_153"> What Senator Dolan said about Huntington's disease is awful. As former Chairman of the committee on health, this has touched a number of families whom I personally know. It is an awful imposition on people. I hope that, under the Sláintecare report, we will see the supports about which the Senator spoke put in place to deal with rare diseases. This is about people's lives and it is an awful life sentence, if one likes, to be hanging over a person. I share the Senator's views on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_154"> I seem to be in a good mood today because I agree completely with Senator Ó Ríordáin on the issue of gun crime and its normalisation. None of us can allow it to happen in our culture, society and communities. We have a duty to work together to ensure that it does not become part of the daily lives of so many people, whether in Dublin city, Cork or elsewhere. I welcome any opportunity to have that debate. Senator Ardagh also sympathised with the family of the victims in Blanchardstown and I join with her in that regard. Gun crime has no place in our society. There are certain protocols to be followed to own a gun but we need to have a debate on the issue of illegal guns and gun ownership.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> I concur with Senator Ó Ríordáin on the issue of educational disadvantage. It is important that we work to combat deprivation and that we break the cycle of disadvantage in our education system. To paraphrase the Senator, the last Government was a coalition Government of two parties which willingly signed up to the policies of the Department of Education and Skills, whether introduced by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, the former Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, or the former Minister and Deputy Ruairí Quinn. It is important that we remove the barriers to educational disadvantage. Senator Ó Ríordáin noted that our literacy rates are improving as are our retention rates and completion rates. However, this is about ensuring equality of opportunity in our education system is open to all pupils. Like the Senator, as a teacher I would be strongly of the opinion that we need to have a system that is student-led in breaking that cycle of disadvantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">That can be done. We have seen the success on literacy. We have seen how we can be innovative and creative, but equally, it is about ensuring that an alternative to the leaving certificate is provided, because not every student can do the leaving certificate. It is also about ensuring that there is access to education. I have a very one-dimensional view on this. If we need to change the model, then let us look at how we can do that. It is not about the type of school that we were perhaps all used to or put through. It is about doing things differently as well. I would very much be of the view that we can have that debate in the new year with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> Senator O'Mahony raised the issue of roads and the increased budget for capital investment. Like him, Senators Leyden and Butler commended and complimented the members of the local authority staff who were working on the roads in cold and hazardous conditions. I join all the Members in paying tribute to the workers who were out gritting the roads. There is merit in what Senator Butler said about the Scottish model. Farmers and people living in rural Ireland went to depots, took salt and gravel and did the work themselves. In some cases they were told not to. It is important that we pay tribute to the work that has been done over recent days. We should also thank the members of staff of Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann who got to their place of work to ensure there was a service provided to people.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> Senator Ned O'Sullivan also praised the Garda in his remarks. We all acknowledge and pay tribute to the men and women of an Garda Síochána, who perform heroic duty every day, whether it is the simplicity of the job they do and the danger they put themselves in, but also the fact that we know that we are safe and secure in having a very good Garda force, notwithstanding the troubles that may exist in some parts of the Garda, which are being rectified. I commend and thank members of An Garda Síochána for their work.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> Senator Gavan raised the issue of workers in section 39 companies. It is a very contentious one. It is about ensuring that there is parity of pay and esteem. There are some workers who have fallen through the cracks between State employment and working for a private organisation or institution. That needs to be rectified. I have said that on the record in the past. The Minister of State will be in the House later to speak on a different Bill. Perhaps Senator Gavan can comment in regard to this issue. It is one that we need to see addressed. Forthcoming legislation in the area of financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, will restore public sector pay when enacted, but there is an anomaly whereby section 39 workers are penalised and victimised. That should be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> I join Senator Black in sympathising with the homeless people who have passed away during recent days. I wish to reassure the Senator and the House that the Government is very much committed to tackling the issue of homelessness. It is a Government priority. Additional resources and funds have allocated and additional beds have been made available. The facts speak for themselves. Public moneys are being allocated through the Rebuilding Ireland plan. Additional beds are being provided for those sleeping rough in Dublin and in Cork.</p>
          <p eId="para_161"> The Housing First programme supports homeless people. Members may have different viewpoints on how it is being done but that is a different question. We often hear complaints in this House that the Government is doing nothing. The Government is prioritising housing. If we declare it a national crisis, what does that actually mean in real terms? Nothing. It is a headline in a newspaper. The fact is that all of us are committed to ensuring that there are no people living homeless on any street.</p>
          <p eId="para_162"> People are homeless for a variety of reasons. One of the things that we need to do is tackle the issue of building houses. We need developers to do that. We require social housing units to be provided, acquired and built by local authorities, and we also need to look at why people are homeless. For example, in the budget of this year, €116 million is being allocated to homelessness. That is an increase of €18 million from the previous year. Listening to some people, one would think no money is being allocated. I agree with Senator Murnane O'Connor that this issue must not become a political football. There needs to be a political and a collective will from all sides. That is why the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, commissioned a summit to meet managers of local authorities. It is important that we have a continuing debate in this House, and I would be happy to have it.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> Ba mhaith liom cur leis an méid atá ráite ag an Seanadóir Swanick. Is fadhb mhór do mhuintir na tíre an t-uaigneas, go mórmhór faoin am seo den bhliain, mí na Nollag. Tá a lán daoine ina n-aonar ag an am seo. It is important that we are, as the Senator said, friendly and reach out the hand of friendship. That requires voluntarism. It requires State help, which is being given, but also a change of mindset. Senator Swanick is correct. The issue of loneliness is an important one that needs to be tackled in the context of society. There are people who today may see nobody other than the postman, and that in some cases may be a frequent visit. It is at times like this that one admires people, such as Paddy O'Brien in Cork, who do Trojan work for the elderly, the organisation ALONE in Dublin which was set up by Willie Bermingham and other organisations across the country. It is important to have that debate and I would be happy to have it in the new year. I would be happy to accept the Senator's amendment to the Order of Business in regard to the motion he has spoken about.</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> I join Senators Byrne and Reilly who referred to the issue of education and the fact PE will now be part of the leaving certificate programme. This is to be welcomed. Senator Reilly, when he was Minister for Health, was strong on Healthy Ireland, the strategy by which we will tackle obesity. It is something we will certainly see the benefit from in time.</p>
          <p eId="para_165"> Senators Gallagher, Paul Daly and Leyden made reference to the fodder crisis. The Minister, Deputy Creed, was scheduled to be here this week but, unfortunately, as the Senators will be aware, he is away on European duty. Both he and the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, are conscious that there are issues around fodder that need to be addressed. That is why the Minister set up with the working group. The Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, met the president of the IFA, Mr. Joe Healy. As Senator Paul Daly, who I commend on his role, will be aware, the task force is working with Teagasc and different stakeholders on the provision of information on fodder supply and shortage. Its first meeting was last week in Sligo. It is important that it is not only monitoring but activity in the fodder crisis by the Department. The Minister has been in touch with the European Union seeking the advance of the basic payment for 2017. It is a matter that Senators need to keep on the agenda. I certainly share Senator Paul Daly's view that this will happen, given that at this time of year the weather will deteriorate. I hope the Department will be proactive, as it has been. If Senator Paul Daly has any information he can share, it would be very welcome given his experience. It is a matter in which the IFA and the Department are involved but we must keep on top of.</p>
          <p eId="para_166"> Senator Norris raised the decision of President Trump on the US Embassy in Jerusalem and made reference to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney. The Minister, in his remarks last week, addressed the issue stating that the move was premature and ill-advised. Like many in the House, I feel it is about ensuring that a resolution is reached in the Middle East peace process. The decision by President Trump last week was very unhelpful in the efforts to bring peace. We all want to see a negotiated resolution in the Middle East peace process and that means recognising that Palestine and Israel must work together, as we have seen in other parts of the world.</p>

I am happy to schedule the debate he seeks in the new year. I agree with him that the survivors, and their families and friends, should not have to read information in a newspaper or discover it on television or radio. My mind boggles as to how information such as that can come out. It should not be leaked. This issue concerns the lives of people who have been severely traumatised, and their integrity.

          <p eId="para_212">This recommendation is simple. It proposes that the promised report on a vacant and derelict property tax be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and not just Dáil Éireann. As a matter of good practice when reports like this are produced they should be presented to all Members of the Oireachtas. </p>
          <p eId="para_213"> Senators may remember that in February last I seconded the Derelict and Vacant Sites Bill as proposed by my Civil Engagement group and Green Party colleague, Senator Grace O'Sullivan. That Bill sought to bring forward such a measure. It is well recognised and well rehearsed that we are in the midst of a catastrophic housing crisis. Nationwide there are families living in bed and breakfast accommodation and in hubs, and young people sofa surfing. There are men and women who have spent all of their adult lives in homeless hostels or emergency shelters and these have become the only homes that such women and men know. At the end of October 2017, there were 8,374 men, women and children in emergency accommodation across the country. Rough sleeping in Cork increased ninefold in the four years from 2011 to 2015, from 38 to 345 people. </p>
          <p eId="para_214"> This extraordinary housing crisis requires an extraordinary response and it is good to see that we are getting a report on a tax on vacant property and I hope that such a measure is introduced. It is sensible policy interventions like this that will change how land owners view and treat vacant property. The 2016 census revealed that we have 198,358 vacant housing units, excluding holiday homes and derelict buildings. I live very close to the city centre in Cork and the only use of vacant and derelict sites that I see is of doorways where people bed down in desperation on wet and windy nights, such as those we have had in the past week. It is not good enough that we have homes, houses and offices empty when people are dying outside. Last Thursday a woman died at the back of a hotel in Cork city. She was 42 years old. I went to her funeral on Saturday. It was a tragic, pitiful and preventable affair. The Government needs to take this seriously, not just for Christmas or because we have people singing outside. That woman's aunt died on the streets a number of years ago and her cousin, whom I met and know, a woman who is the same age as my own daughter, is in a pitiful state. </p>
          <p eId="para_215"> We need to get every action we can possibly think of under way and the Vacant and Derelict Sites Bill, which we proposed in February, is a contribution to that. I would very much like to see the report on the effectiveness of the Government's tax proposal that is due to be laid before the Dáil being laid before Seanad Éireann too. The town I grew up in, Macroom in County Cork, has 210 vacant properties according to the 2016 census. That is a huge number of properties in such a small town. It would reinvigorate a small town like Macroom to have people living over the shops like I did when I was growing up. These 210 houses could be homes for people waiting on the social housing waiting list. Given the work and the concern in Seanad Éireann around this issue, it is important that this recommendation is passed and that the report on a tax on vacant residential property is debated in this House.</p>

          <p eId="para_216">The Minister's report on a vacant home tax should be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and I do not see why it would not be. This morning, along with members of the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs, I visited a recently established family hub in Crumlin.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">I cannot help but wonder how many fewer hubs we would need if a vacant home tax was implemented? While the hubs are an improvement on bed and breakfast accommodation, they are not homes. It is bizarre that, having rejected an amendment tabled by Sinn Féin on Committee Stage in the Dáil, the Minister tabled a replica amendment on Report Stage. Presenting a report is to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> A vacant home tax could be part of the solution, if implemented correctly. Deputy Eoin Ó Broin has produced a strategy which looks at this issue and makes many proposals. In summary, to maximise the return of vacant units, incentives are required by those who need assistance to return their properties to active use, as well as penalties for those who willfully leave properties empty. We should introduce a second home property tax exemption for owners who bring their homes back to active use. Local authorities should receive a new homes bonus equivalent to the annual second home property tax yield after the first two years, if houses are returned to active use. The funding could be added to local authorities's discretionary spend and it would cost the Exchequer an average of €6 million, making a total of €36 million during a seven year period. This cost could be offset against the current expenditure budget allocations to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and thus be revenue neutral. One could introduce a vacant home tax which would be applicable to properties which have been vacant for more than six months, as determined by the local authorities based on the high level of vacancies and housing need in their areas. Obviously, there would be exemptions. The issue is why are we only looking at the presentation of a report instead of implementing a tax this year, as a year will be wasted. I hope next year we will see results, not reports.</p>

          <p eId="para_220">Section 85 is intended to provide for a detailed exploration of the key issues in the implementation of a vacant property tax to be reported on within nine months of the passing of the Finance Bill. This period should allow sufficient time to collect and analyse the relevant information. Importantly, the report should be completed in time for consideration in advance of budget 2019. The aim of the section is to provide that a report on vacant home taxation will be published and publicly available within nine months of the enactment of the Finance Bill. Laying it before the Dáil will achieve that purpose. On that basis, I do not propose to support the recommendation. There is no intention on my part to be disrespectful to the Seanad. As I indicated, the objective of the text of the section is to provide for publication of the report within the nine months. Section 1 of the Finance Act 2010 provides a precedent in that regard, as it called on the Minister for Finance to lay before Dáil Éireann a report on tax expenditures. The objective of the report will be to report on the analysis made, but some have to understand that if the analysis states it is a good idea, we will be trying to influence people to make a vacant property available for either letting or sale. What a vacant home tax is not going to do is to put such a hideous price on it that people will be forced to do it because that would neither be reasonable nor fair. It would also not stand up to scrutiny.</p>

          <p eId="para_221">On the section, it is important, when the report is presented to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government who will forward it to the Minister for Finance, that it be complete. It is extremely important that there be some review of the resources available to the local authorities to combine vacant site lists.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">It is not a straightforward procedure. Senator Kelleher referred to the census, which is a kind of marker document. We need to get down to detail. The ultimate objective here is to find a mechanism whereby we ensure sites can be identified and taken up for primary residential purposes. There is a view that some of the more appropriate sites have not been identified. Some sites are not suitable. It is important for us to be certain that the local authorities have the necessary resources and skill sets to be able to compile a register.</p>

          <p eId="para_223">I am disappointed by the lack of urgency I am hearing from the Minister of State. At a time when people are perishing on the streets because they do not have access to houses, we are talking about a report on a tax, rather than something that will bring properties into use. I am disappointed that the Minister of State does not seem to consider it important to bring the report in question to the Seanad. We have an absolute knowledge of and interest in this issue. We have been a source of pressure and knowledge with respect to housing. I am asking the Minister of State, as a small gesture on his part, to recognise the work we do on this matter by agreeing to bring the report back to this House as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_229">This recommendation relates to the potential for ensuring budget 2019 is gender-proofed, equality-proofed and accompanied by an equality statement. I recognise that progress has been made in this area. I am making this proposal again now because we did not have an opportunity to debate it fully on Committee Stage. I am disappointed that budget 2018 does not deliver on the Government's commitment, as set out in the programme for Government, to gender-proofing, equality-proofing and accompanying equality statements. I hope the Minister of State will assure me that we will have equality-proofing and gender-proofing of budget 2019.</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> I have read a document that was produced on 10 December last in Scotland. This intensive and detailed analysis makes the most of equality and human rights levers and looks at the draft budget for 2018-2019. On the same day that the budget is published there, an equality statement is produced that indicates how equality issues have been considered in the budgetary decisions on how the State's finances are to be directed and gathered in the year ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_231"> I welcome the publication of the Minister's policy paper, Equality Budgeting: Proposed Next Steps in Ireland. It is a very constructive document. I acknowledge that officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have worked and are working on this area. I think the policy paper is positive. I hope the Minister of State will give us an indication of how he envisages that the policy paper and its recommendations will be put into practice over the year ahead as we consider and evaluate budget 2018 and prepare for budget 2019. I believe the potential exists for a focused approach to equality budgeting in the 2019 budgetary cycle.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> A couple of issues were highlighted in the Department's own policy paper or staff working paper.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">The first is the importance of having data disaggregated by gender available to Departments. I have asked the Minister to explain how he intends to ensure these data gaps are addressed. A second issue highlighted in the paper was the need for Departments to set specific and measurable objectives on how they can achieve equality in their respective areas and link this to the tracking of the budget and proposals for budget 2019.</p>
          <p eId="para_234"> I urge the Minister to ensure the gender and equality pilot programme is advanced across as many Departments as possible. I ask the Minister of State to indicate the number of Departments in which the pilot project will be advanced in the coming year. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform must provide sufficient resources and capacity to Departments to drive forward the process of gender budgeting. </p>
          <p eId="para_235"> My final appeal relates to a highly constructive approach that does not yet feature in the staff working paper. In Scotland, the equality budget advisory group, or EBAG as it is known, is a key pillar in the budgetary process. It means that an advisory group with expert advisers, including representatives of women's organisations, equality bodies and key academics, works alongside the relevant committee and the Department and its officials. Is the Minister considering the introduction of a similar advisory group as part of the equality budgeting process?</p>

          <p eId="para_236">I am disappointed that the recommendation on tax relief for trade union subscriptions has been ruled out of order. The ruling is unfortunate as trade unions are the only bodies which defend workers' rights across the globe.</p>
          <p eId="para_237"> I support the recommendation on gender and equality proofing and recognise that significant progress has been made on this front. I note the equality budgeting campaign has been wound up and is happy to hand over the reins of equality budgeting to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, which is tasked in the programme for Government with implementing equality budgeting. Sinn Féin first placed this issue on the agenda in a Private Members' motion tabled in 2013 and unfortunately rejected at the time. I echo the call made by Senator Alice-Mary Higgins to replicate the Scottish model of good practice for equality budgeting. We could learn from some of the ideas and policies being pursued in Scotland. We cannot rest on our laurels. I support the recommendation.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelWDArcy" eId="spk_98" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Michael D'Arcy<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_238">A Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to develop the process of budget and policy proofing as a means of advancing equality, reducing poverty and strengthening economic and social rights. It also includes a commitment to ensure the institutional arrangements are in place to support equality and gender proofing in key Departments and the independent fiscal and budget office. I am pleased to advise that several initiatives have been undertaken for this year's budget to progress this commitment, including a range of analysis that has been published as part of this year's budget documentation.</p>
          <p eId="para_239"> Annex A of the budget book presents information illustrating the effect of the budget measures on different examples of income earners and household types across a range of income levels. It also contains tables showing the development over time of the average effective tax rate for different household types across a range of incomes from a variety of sources.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> Annex B of the budget book, Income Tax and Progressivity Issues, analyses the role the income tax system plays in the distribution of income, an important factor in assessing the fairness of budgetary policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_241"> As is customary following each budget, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection will shortly publish a social impact assessment of the budget. This will use the SWITCH model to consider the impact of budget 2018 on households across the income distribution and present its overall distributional impact by income group and family type. It will also examine the impact of the budget on the "at risk of poverty" rate and work incentives. The social impact assessment is being completed in consultation with the Department in respect of the income tax elements of the budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_242"> The social impact assessment framework developed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to facilitate a more comprehensive assessment of budgetary policies on household living standards is described in the paper, Equality Budgeting: Proposed Next Steps in Ireland, which is also published on the budget website. This framework will complement the established social impact assessment carried out by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">The framework focuses on policy areas that cannot be incorporated easily into the existing SWITCH model, specifically the impacts of public expenditure on recipient households. It also outlines the pilot approach taken to gender budgeting adopted for this budgetary cycle. I acknowledge that budget and policy proofing is an important means of advocating for and advancing equality, reducing poverty and strengthening economic rights, but I am also cognisant of policies and strategies being developed across the Civil Service, which work informs the policy options advanced. I know, for example, that my Department is represented on the group which is considering the national strategy for women and girls for the period 2017 to 2020 which is underpinned by the societal values of equality, non-discrimination, inclusiveness, generosity, intersectionality, diversity and respect for human rights. I will ask officials in the Department how these issues might best be addressed in the context of next year’s budget. Therefore, I do not plan to accept the recommendation.</p>

          <p eId="para_246"> It is slightly off the issue, but I refer to the tax rebate that will be available to those who buy property for development. The rate of stamp duty is 6%, but they will be entitled to a refund, bringing the rate back down to 2%, if the property is developed within a specified period. Will this apply to individuals who buy a site to build a single dwelling house? Will they be entitled to a refund of stamp duty? I have raised the issue before, but I am still not clear on whether an individual who buys a site and obtains planning permission to build on it will be entitled to the refund of 4%. I would be grateful if the position could be clarified.</p>

          <p eId="para_249">I welcome the recognition of the SWITCH model which has been used to date. While it captures the distributive effects, it misses many other social impacts, as we have been flagging. I know that it has been flagged by the community and voluntary pillar to a significant extent. We need to look beyond the distributive effects and consider the social impacts. In terms of their assessment, has consideration been given to the micro-simulation model? For example, it took a long time to have a micro-simulation carried out on austerity measures introduced in Ireland. We were of the view that certain issues were not being captured in social impact assessments or under the SWITCH model. The micro-simulation process revealed certain measures had a disproportionate impact on women. For example, women who were part of a couple suffered a loss of 14% in their income, as against a figure of 9% loss by men during the period of the austerity measures. The process also provided an opportunity to dive into some of the causes and consider how they might be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_250"> I am happy not to press the recommendation. However, I hope that, in addition to introducing the new social impact assessment, the Minister of State will be able to indicate whether his Department is open to Senators engaging on the form the social impact assessment will take as there are many options available in order to make sure it will produce the information and data we need. That is very important because there are gaps in the data. In the end, it will come down to each Department identifying and tackling equality issues. This process has been successful in Scotland and it is interesting that equality budgeting is now considered to be part of the preventative spending process there. It is used to identify how money can be spent better to prevent costs from arising in the future because equality budgeting leads to better outcomes for all in society and more effective use of resources. There is an understanding and an intention in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> I have a minor technical question. How many Departments does the Minister of State expect to pilot this initiative heading into the next budgetary cycle?</p>
          <p eId="para_252">Can the Minister of State confirm that his Department is open to engaging further with the social impact assessment proposals?</p>

          <p eId="para_280">I am asking that within a year of the passing of this Bill, the Minister would prepare and lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas a review of Ireland's trade and tax treaties. This refers to our bilateral tax treaties. I ask that this would include an assessment of the role the tax treaties might be playing with regard to the global achievement of the sustainable development goals, and recommendations as to areas of particular reform. The specific issue that I am touching on is one that we do not focus on much. I know there has been much focus on Apple tax and wider issues, but this concerns Ireland's bilateral tax treaties specifically. I am concerned that in some of the tax treaties which Ireland has with developing countries, there are very low levels of withholding tax. I am concerned about how that may be impacting on the capacity of those countries to achieve sustainable development goals within their own territories, and how we might be effectively contributing to the denial of revenue to those countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_281"> If this review is undertaken, I would hope to ensure that companies which are registered in Ireland are made tax resident in Ireland without exception. There is a concern around companies that are registered in Ireland, but are not Irish tax-resident. That is the other side of the tax treaties, which affects our capacity to generate revenue and ensure that we can fulfil our sustainable development goals. In a new global context in which we have made new global commitments, I am asking what the plan is for reviewing our bilateral tax treaties to ensure that there is policy coherence between them and our other stated international and national goals.</p>

          <p eId="para_282">The 2015 spill-over analysis, looking at how our affairs affect the developing world, is out of date. A new and, frankly, an improved one is needed. The recent Christian Aid report on this issue was very alarming, and it should act as a wake-up call. This is yet another issue damaging our reputation, and yet again we have a Government in denial about it. If history is any judge, the Government will get around to supporting this report, but not for a few years yet. That head-in-the-sand attitude must change. More generally, I hope that the report might look at why we insist on using the OECD model for tax treaties, when the UN model is considered fairer for developing countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">I hope the Minister can accept the need for this report, including that issue.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael D'Arcy<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T16:05:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_284">The sustainable development goals were adopted in 2015 by 193 UN members, including Ireland, and consist of 17 high-level goals and 196 targets. While not legally binding, both developed and developing countries are expected to take ownership and establish national frameworks for achieving the goals by 2030. A senior officials group led by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has been set up to oversee Ireland's implementation of the goals.</p>
          <p eId="para_285"> Double taxation agreements are widely regarded as critical pieces of fiscal infrastructure for developing substantial bilateral trading and investment opportunities by reducing tax impediments that might otherwise deter cross-border activity. In order to ensure that Irish business remains competitive and that Ireland remains an attractive destination for foreign direct investment, we have been expanding our double taxation agreement network. The agreement with Kazakhstan will bring to 73 the number of double taxation agreements that Ireland will have ratified once this Bill is enacted.</p>
          <p eId="para_286"> Double taxation agreements are bilateral in nature. No country is obliged or required to enter into such an agreement. They are agreements willingly entered into with a view to facilitating greater trade and investment between two countries by the elimination of double taxation on such cross-border trade and investment. The BEPS multilateral instrument will amend Ireland's tax treaties to add anti-avoidance clauses to ensure that treaties cannot be used for aggressive tax planning. This Bill begins the process of implementing this instrument and I hope to complete ratification during 2018. In negotiations for tax treaties with developing countries, Ireland use provisions from both the OECD and UN models. Negotiations for tax treaties are always held on an equal footing between both countries. A key objective during treaty negotiations is to end up with a treaty that both parties are satisfied with.</p>
          <p eId="para_287"> We are one of only two countries to commission an independent and comprehensive spillover analysis of the impacts of our tax system and tax treaties on developing countries. This report, published two years ago, shows that there is very little likelihood of spillovers from the Irish tax system negatively impacting developing countries. Where two treaties dating from the 1970s were found to be restrictive, these have been renegotiated and amended.</p>
          <p eId="para_288"> Taking these factors into account, and in view of the oversight role held by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment in regard to the sustainable development goals, I cannot accept the Senator's recommendation.</p>

          <p eId="para_289">I am aware of the spillover analysis that was done. I welcome it and the renegotiation of the treaties.</p>
          <p eId="para_290"> I was trying to highlight that the context has since changed. Since that analysis two years ago, we have had both, as the Minister of State mentioned correctly, the Paris targets which have been set and also our commitments under the sustainable development goals. Would it not have been possible for those issues, those commitments and those global targets to have been considered at the time of the previous analysis? It may be that next year is not the time, but I believe that we will need to look to revise that analysis in the medium term. That is something I hope we can revisit.</p>
          <p eId="para_291"> I note what Senator Devine said. It is important to mention that the OECD BEPS standards are not necessarily the gold standard because the UN has put forward standards also. Many advocacy groups which have worked in this area, including Christian Aid, Trócaire and Oxfam, have highlighted that the UN standards are perhaps more rigorous in terms of ensuring fair deals for developing countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_292"> I will not press the recommendation at this point. I merely note that while that spillover analysis was a positive measure, the time may be approaching when it may need to be done again if we are to ensure that we protect our international reputation and hold ourselves to the highest standards. The question of what are the highest standards is something we must keep under review.</p>

          <p eId="para_299">This is the most crucial recommendation and, therefore, I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could indicate how he intends to tackle this issue. There has been extensive media coverage of the deep structural inequities within our contributory pension system, which ensure that those who have taken time to care for someone or to contribute to society in different ways have been penalised through the averaging system. They are predominantly women. The pension gap is very large and it has increased from 35% to 37% in recent years. There are deep inequities in the way total contributions are calculated, which was acknowledged in the then Government's Green Paper on pensions almost a decade ago. These are only partially addressed by the home-maker's scheme because it only applies from 1994 onwards. The scheme does not extend back to 1973 when women were still being asked to leave the public service when they married. The marriage bar was removed that year but it should have been ensured that there were no disadvantageous measures in the pensions system. That should have been part of a response to Europe's ruling against the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_300"> That is an historical issue but there is also an issue going back to 2012. Extensive reports from Age Action Ireland and others have highlighted that, despite knowing that the method of calculating contributions to the pensions system is unfair, those on lower contributions were further penalised from 2012 onwards. Up to 40,000 people, predominantly women again, have been affected by this issue. The vast majority of those in receipt of the top rate of contributory pension are men, but while that rate remained the same, the lower and reduced rate of pension was cut substantially. When these issues were raised and as the figures were discussed in an effort to address the inequity, we were told the cost would be too high. Even though it is an acknowledged inequity, we were told the Government cannot afford to remedy it. The cost is estimated to be a paltry €70 million to address the 2012 inequity and €10 million every year thereafter but this is beyond our resources as a nation. However, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection informed the House last week that the cost to the Exchequer of private pension tax relief is €2.6 billion per year. Analysis shows that the measure disproportionately benefits the top 21% of taxpayer units, who are higher earners. The tax relief is inequitable because through the marginal rate relief we give more tax relief to those on higher incomes than to the vast majority of the population who are on lower incomes and receive standard rate tax relief or less than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_301"> Private pension tax relief was noted by the troika in its memorandum of understanding with the State as an issue. It is interesting that it is one of the few issues in the memorandum that was not acted on. The troika said the State should move to a standard rating tax relief system either by applying the standard rate of 20% to all private pensions or by introducing a new standard rate of 30%, which would benefit lower earners rather than giving an increased benefit to higher earners. A total of 43% of lower earners who pay the standard rate are only entitled to receive a marginal rate tax relief of 20% on a private pension and very few of them take it up.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">The usage of the private pension tax relief scheme is predominantly by higher earners and a higher earner can have up to €40,000 a year as a write-off in terms of private pension tax relief. How can we justify not addressing this inequality in our tax relief for private pensions when we are being told we cannot afford to fix the inequalities in our contributory pension system? How can we spend €2.6 billion on private pension tax relief, unequally distributed, when we cannot find €70 million to fix the inequity and the insult experienced by women in Ireland represented by the 2012 changes?</p>

          <p eId="para_303">I did not get a chance to speak on the recommendation in regard to gender that Senator Alice-Mary Higgins withdrew. It is something I have a personal interest in and I want to take up the theme. We spoke about women who left the workplace, many of whom are now coming to us. Typically, one must have 520 paid contributions at class A or S and have an average of ten payments. Many of those would have had seven or eight years out of the workplace and they cannot make the average.</p>

          <p eId="para_307">The second issue I want to raise concerns a group in society I feel very strongly about, that is, lone parents, particularly lone-parent women. It is a group we need to look at and study in great depth to find ways of dealing with the inequalities, in particular in the context of getting them back into the workplace. We have all had people come to us. Senator Higgins spoke about social proofing and this is one area that, as a society, we need to get to grips with. A lot of work needs to be put into this area. Many lone parents come to me who are phenomenal mothers and who are trying to get on in life. We have to find a way to make the system more friendly in terms of getting them back into the workplace.</p>
          <p eId="para_308"> The theme I am talking about concerns women and the whole sphere of pensions and work. I have perhaps taken a bit of a liberty in how I have brought that into the discussion but I wanted to put it on the record.</p>

          <p eId="para_309">Tax reliefs on pensions are quite controversial and, as Senator Higgins said, the IMF and the troika were always asking questions about them. On the one hand, they encourage the saving of a pension but, on the other, they can seem to subsidise those of us already lucky enough to be able to afford a pension. Certainly, when we consider that 80% of the relief goes to the top 20%, we would have to question the suitability and sustainability of the reliefs over the long run. Looking at Britain, it has moved to taper off all reliefs over a certain income, which is an angle worth exploring, and this is something we have slightly started to do with PRSI. Rather than a blunt standardisation, the combination of reducing the standard fund threshold and the earning limit that applies to the relief seems a cleverer and fairer way of tackling this issue. High earners should not be subsidised while the savings of other workers are not protected. I thank Senator Higgins for tabling this amendment.</p>

          <from>Senator Gerry Horkan<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T16:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_310">At a time when we are asking people to get involved with pensions and when the front page of the <i>Irish Independent</i> is telling us that many people do not have pensions, we should not be putting up more barriers preventing people from doing so. There is merit in parts of the Senator's argument. We keep encouraging people to fend for themselves and to save where they can. However, the pension levy was the greatest smash and grab ever imposed on people who had put away their own money. People had been told by successive Governments to look after themselves and not be entirely reliant on the State pension. They did so but the State came along and said there was a pile of money that people had been saving for their futures out of earned income and that it was going to take a chunk of it, at 0.6% of the pot, for four years in a row. People were hit far more by that than they would have been by water charges or by property tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_311"> I accept it has stopped now but it should never be done again. It is exactly the same as the State going into someone's bank account, saying someone has money there and it wants a chunk of it. It was wrong. This measure could have unintended consequences of discouraging people from setting up private pensions for themselves. They will then be more reliant on the State and, ultimately, a greater cost to the State at a time when we will have changes in dependency ratios, etc. I will not be voting for this recommendation.</p>

          <from>Senator Michael McDowell<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T16:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_312">I want to endorse what Senator Horkan said. We are not talking about the ultra rich when we are talking about people who are paying the marginal rate rather than the standard rate. I agree with Senator Devine that there should probably be minimum effective tax rates for everybody in this country. I would probably go further and say that there should be minimum effective tax rates for every citizen of Ireland who has assets in this country, no matter where he or she decides to live for the time being, subject to double taxation agreements. I do not believe it is a good idea to discourage the provision of pensions by people, many of whom are by no means considered wealthy, yet who are paying at the marginal rate rather than the standard rate. What is being proposed by Senator Higgins to achieve tax equity is too blunt an instrument. I am fully in favour of tax equity but I do not believe this is the right way to do it. I ask everybody to remember that those who are getting public sector pensions are in a very different and much more favourable position than many people in the private sector. Many self-employed people are not wealthy professionals but are people doing market gardening, electrical contracting, timber harvesting and things like that. They have to be looked after as well. I say that as somebody who has forgone a substantial ministerial and Dáil pension to be here. I know the value of that pension and that I could never have got that in the private sector no matter what I had done and no matter what I had contributed to whatever fund. I am not receiving it at the moment and make do on my other earnings. Although I am in that happy position, I know the value of a public sector pension compared with a private sector one. I ask people who level their weapons at private sector pensions not to extrapolate from the figures that the great majority of this relief goes to people on high earnings. Of course, it does because those people are paying a huge amount of tax and they are bound to ask professional advisers what to do to minimise their tax burden. However, there are very significant constraints on the amounts that one can put into pension funds. It is not as simple as it is made out. If one goes over that amount, one hits effective tax rates of 70% and 80%. This is not as easy as it is made out to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">I agree with Senator Horkan and do not agree with this recommendation.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael D'Arcy<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T16:25:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_314">I will just make a few observations before reading the departmental note. The figure that the Senator put out of €70 million cannot be taken in isolation. The old age pension payment is the biggest payment in the State and amounts to €7 billion. It is €7 billion out of the €20 billion social protection pot. It is not just a question of putting €70 million in on top of that. The State pays €7 billion for old age pensions, something with which I fundamentally agree. The next biggest quantity of money is the public sector pension payment which is almost €4 billion. Therefore, the State is providing €11 billion in pension payments. The €4 billion fund for what some like to call "gold plated" pensions is not a pension fund as such. The money comes from current expenditure. There is no pot of money set aside by the State for the purpose of paying the pensions of our public and civil servants.</p>
          <p eId="para_315"> In terms of discussions on pensions, only 50% of people in the State have a private pension. The other 50% will rely solely on the old age pension. To consider doing anything that would negatively impact on the take up of pensions would be huge error. To put that into context, there is not a single pension pot in the country that has as much money as people put into it in the last 25 years. Senator Horkan spoke about the fact that the previous Government extracted 0.6% from the pension industry by way of a levy but that was extracted for a good reason. It enabled the Government to reduce VAT in the hospitality sector from 13.5% to 9%. The pension levy money, despite Department of Finance objections, was ring fenced to pay for that provision. Senators may remember that Fine Gael announced its intention to do that before the 2011 election and when it went into government, it did so.</p>
          <p eId="para_316"> A reduction in the marginal rate of tax relief on pension contributions would represent an effective pay cut for those PAYE employee members of occupational pension schemes across both the public and private sectors liable to the tax at the higher rate, including mainly middle income earners about whom Senator McDowell spoke. There would be an additional impact on public service employees’ pay if the tax relief on the pension-related deduction, PRD, was also reduced. This is due to the way in which such contributions and deductions are currently tax-relieved under the net pay system whereby pension contributions and the PRD for PAYE employees are deducted from gross pay before applying tax. A change to a lower rate of tax relief could therefore lead to claims for compensating pay increases for significant numbers of PAYE workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_317"> I can confirm the Government’s intention to publish and commence the implementation of a five-year pensions reform plan in the near future. The objective of reforms contained within the plan will be to establish a sound and fit for purpose pension system for the coming decades that will shape the retirement landscape benefitting our retirees for generations to come. In delivering on the reform plan, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection will conduct a period of consultation with relevant stakeholders, including interest groups, representative bodies and the Oireachtas. The implementation of the five-year reform plan will involve an examination of the supplementary pension arrangements and in that light I do not intend to support this recommendation.</p>

        <speech by="#AliceMaryHiggins" eId="spk_145">
          <from>Senator Alice-Mary Higgins<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T16:25:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_318">I am aware of the intention to develop a new five-year pension reform plan, as flagged by the Minister of State's Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty. Her Department is considering an auto-enrolment pension system. That will be given due consideration in these Houses, particularly by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection. My concern is, in the context of proposals to develop a new five-year pension reform plan and to consider an auto-enrolment system, that the long promised 2020 reform of the contributory pension system to ensure a total contributions approach which takes caring into consideration may not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">If we are considering one new pension system, I want to know the following. Will the long promised new pension system and reform in terms of total contributions take place? We have always been told it would address the anomalies experienced by women in terms of the inequities in how total contributions are calculated, the averaging system and some of the inequities generated by the 2012 changes. The Government has adopted the approach of we will wait and see but address it by 2020.</p>
          <p eId="para_320"> We are discussing the Finance Bill but there is a new supplementary pension system on the horizon. Will the State allocate resources to address the existing inequalities and inequities? The solution is not simply a matter of moving around the social protection budget. This is a concern for the State and, indeed, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as the Department responsible for equality and gender proofing the budgetary system and budgets. There is a cross-cutting equality and gender issue in respect of the State's contributory pension system and the inequality experienced predominantly by women in that system. The solution is not simply a matter for the Department of social protection. It is a matter for the Cabinet and specifically for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform as his Department takes a lead in equality and gender proofing.</p>
          <p eId="para_321"> I am aware of the long-term plans but I believe the current situation will damage the take up of the scheme. Senators have talked about public sentiment and public confidence in pensions, encouraging people to save for a pension and not wanting to discourage people from doing so. People are greatly discouraged when they see that the current injustice in the pension system is not considered important enough to be addressed. The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Doherty, will be bringing proposals from 2012. I wish to simply point out that this is not a battle for her alone to face and that the financial resources required to address the anomalies may need to come from the Exchequer rather than the social protection budget. </p>
          <p eId="para_322"> In terms of the other issues that have been addressed, I agree that the blunt tool at play is the way tax relief for private pensions is calculated. As the Minister has outlined, it is a blunt tool in terms of how we calculate gross pay. I agree with her that it is a blunt tool. It also does not allow us to ensure we achieve our pension objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_323"> To answer Senator McDowell, I encourage everybody to get a pension despite the very poor returns provided by pension companies. I believe that a standard rate of 30%, a figure that has been proposed for a long time, would encourage many people to get a pension who are currently only offered 20% tax relief. The difference between a 20% and 30% tax relief is enough to persuade people to commence a private pension. I believe it would be enough to encourage a people to divert some of their resources from their day-to-day finances to a pension that provides for their future. I suggest that we could examine the matter if we had this report. I believe there would be a greater uptake of private pensions if there was a 30% tax relief. I do not believe that many people will automatically decide to leave their private pension systems because their tax relief has been reduced from 40% down to 30%. I query the question of the rate acting as an incentive or a disincentive. </p>
          <p eId="para_324"> The Minister of State has made it clear that he cannot accept the recommendation. However, we need to shine a light on the pension issue. We need to ask whether the current measures serve the goals set out in the programme for Government, which we want to fulfil. The current tool is inappropriate, inequitable and needs to be examined. We have heard different proposals from across the House and I accept that the proposal that I put forward today may not be perfect. I ask that we shine a light on pensions and examine it more robustly. </p>
          <p eId="para_325"> Senator Kieran O'Donnell raised the issue of contributions and specifically referred to gaps in contributions where people have spent eight years, for example, out of the workforce. The Taoiseach was the Minister for Social Protection this time last year. He was kind enough to accept my proposal that would make it easier to make voluntary contributions and extended the period in which voluntary contributions could be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">I may discuss the issue further with the Minister of State. This change was brought in by means of ministerial order in January of this year following the debates in the Seanad this time last year. I applaud and note the then Minister's decision to take on that issue and adjust our social welfare voluntary contribution policy as a result.</p>

          <from>Senator Gerry Horkan<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T16:35:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_327">Over the past week, I have spent a great deal of time in this Chamber during debates on proposed amendments to the Finance Bill 2017, primarily as Acting Chairman but also in my capacity as Fianna Fáil's spokesperson on finance in the Seanad. It is good that the measures in the Bill will go back to the Dáil and consideration of them will be concluded before Christmas.</p>
          <p eId="para_328"> A number of people have made representations to me about the changes to section 135 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. It has been suggested that this section is mainly about aggressive tax planning and anti-avoidance measures. Some people, particularly practitioners acting on behalf of family businesses, are concerned that this legislation will result in family business succession being taxed at 52% rather than 33%, 10% or 0%. Obviously, we are not going to deal with this matter this afternoon. I am putting the Minister of State on notice that I would like the Department to ensure the Revenue guidance clarifies that these particular mechanisms are being set up specifically as anti-avoidance measures and should not affect people who are trying to transfer businesses from one generation to the next. It has been pointed out that while Revenue guidance can be important, it is not appealable in the same way that legislation is appealable. I would like to put the Minister of State on notice that the Department needs to ensure this is dealt with in the appropriate way. If that does not happen, we might have to raise this issue in the House again.</p>
          <p eId="para_329"> I thank all the Members and the absolute army of officials for their work on this legislation. When I went into the ante room last week, there were almost 40 people there. The thickness of the Bill is a reflection of its contents, as set out over a large number of sections. Before Senator Conway-Walsh starts trying to take offence, I should say that I am talking about the thickness of the Bill, as opposed to any of the Members of the House. No offence was intended on this occasion. I never mean to cause offence. A substantial degree of expertise is required to bring through a Bill with so many sections. I congratulate the Minister of State, who was a member of our committee this time last year, on being so well able to deal with the various issues that have arisen. I welcome the return of the Bill to the Dáil and I look forward to it being passed before the end of the week.</p>

          <p eId="para_335">I remind Senator Horkan that just as one should never judge a book by its cover, one should never judge a Bill by its thickness. This has been a lengthy process. I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, on his perseverance and patience. I also compliment the officials, who were here in great numbers, and those who contributed to the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_336"> On Committee Stage I raised the issue of management buyouts, which has just been raised by Senator Horkan. I suspect that the Department and Revenue are seeking to close this anti-avoidance measure. It is extremely important for us to ensure we do not throw out the baby with the bath water.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">Many practitioners are concerned that this measure may have unintended consequences in cases of management buyouts involving family owned businesses and, for example, long-term employees of the business seeking a management buyout to ensure the business and its staff are retained. The Minister gave a commitment on Committee Stage in the Dáil that a statement of practice would be produced. It is extremely important that proper due diligence is done on this issue, on which interaction will be needed with the Irish Tax Institute, Chartered Accountants Ireland, the Law Society of Ireland and others to ensure this measure does not interfere with bona fide management buyouts. </p>
          <p eId="para_338"> We need innovators and small businesses but we also need business longevity. Companies require new blood and management buyouts. I agree with Senator Horkan that advice may be needed on this measure. I ask the Minister to urge the Revenue Commissioners to produce a statement of practice quickly. I do not want to find in three or four months that a statement of practice is nowhere in sight.</p>
          <p eId="para_339"> Management buyouts take place all the time. Speaking to former colleagues in practice, many are nervous about proceeding with management buyouts. Business is about continuity, movement and change. I urge the Revenue Commissioners to produce a statement of practice quickly. Proper interaction must take place with the various representative bodies, including in business, the legal and accountancy professions and so forth, to ensure bona fide management buyouts are not impeded by this anti-avoidance measure. I wish the Minister of State a happy Christmas and new year. </p>

          <p eId="para_340">I thank the Minister of State for wading through the budget on our behalf. This is a missed opportunity. The budget fails to address the inequality and unfairness that prevails across the country, whether in housing, health or other services on which people depend. The absence of a single line addressed to those who have been affected by pyrite and whose houses are crumbling around them is also a missed opportunity. The Bill also fails because it enables the banks to avoid paying tax on vast profits for a further 20 years. The budget could have required them to pay tax and closed some of the tax loopholes that allow many multinational companies to get away with not paying tax. The budget could have addressed these matters and resulted in a more equal distribution of wealth. For this reason, Sinn Féin cannot support the Bill as it stands.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_154">
          <from>Senator Michael McDowell<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T16:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_341">It occurs to me that there is a very strong case to be made for examining the issue of minimum effective tax rates across the taxation system. I know small efforts were made to achieve this in the area of income tax in the past. It is wrong, however, that a person with a secretarial post pays a much greater proportion of her or his salary in tax than some of the wealthiest and most influential people in Ireland who have the greatest amount of business assets in Ireland and also claim to be Irish citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">It occurs to me that, in principle, we should examine the idea of every Irish citizen with an income above a certain threshold, perhaps €100,000 or €200,000, who has business assets in Ireland over a certain threshold being liable, regardless of where they live, to a minimum effective tax rate of, say, 20% or 25% on their worldwide income unless they can show that they paid that amount to another jurisdiction. The idea that there are people who are totally stateless flying around in the atmosphere or in space, earning huge sums of money and contributing nothing but deriving significant income from this State seems to me to be wrong. They can avoid capital gains tax and a whole load of things by simply moving out of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_343"> If citizenship under Article 9 of the Constitution involves not merely loyalty to the State and fidelity to the nation, one would think that Irish citizens should be willing to pay a fraction of their income given that people on the lowest salaries in their businesses in Ireland are obliged to pay a contribution to the Exchequer to fund services. I believe the time has come to examine the possibility and to end what for many people is a big scandal. They see themselves as being heavily taxed on smallish income while those who can break through the sound barrier and the glass ceiling and get out of Ireland in terms of their geographical residence seem to be in a position of having to pay nothing by way of income tax. In a republic that wants to have a degree of solidarity and social cohesion, surely the time has come for us to examine the possibility of a minimum effective tax rate on all Irish citizens.</p>

        <speech by="#AliceMaryHiggins" eId="spk_155">
          <from>Senator Alice-Mary Higgins<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T16:45:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_344">I will be brief. I second Senator McDowell's comments on the effective tax rate and how it can be better. We can look to achieving this and, at this point of the year, we send an arrow towards next year's Finance Bill and the considerations involved in it. There is a question about the effective tax rate and how we can bring it forward but there is also a question about our tax reliefs. We need to have a more robust scrutiny of our tax relief measures. We should not simply say what are the benefits to a particular sector or business. Instead we should look at them with the same level of scrutiny we would give any other area of expenditure. As a whole, we might say that it is positive and there are benefits associated with it, but we should query how it compares to other areas of spending. When we discuss spending areas in this House, we are often told a particular area is a worthy one that could bring about positive benefits but that the Government is not sure we can afford it. In the area of tax reliefs, however, often there is not the same depth of scrutiny. This is not to be against tax reliefs but to ensure they are doing the work we need them to do. If we have an effective tax relief, that is one way to ensure it is not being exploited in an inappropriate way.</p>
          <p eId="para_345"> I have spoken in this House about the knowledge development box. There are questions about ensuring we are doing better at joining up the dots. The knowledge development box may have a positive benefit, but the problem with such a measure is that the tax relief is being made available and we are hoping there will be benefits but we are not tracking them. For example, in terms of the knowledge development box, I simply sought to establish if those who receive the benefit also work with, for example, Enterprise Ireland or IDA Ireland, to what extent they are large or small employers and where is the benefit so that we can track where we, as a State, deploy a tax relief. In the end, this is expenditure. It is money that could be in our Exchequer and routed towards another purpose. However, we have decided to forgo it because we believe there is a benefit to be had elsewhere. We should be more rigorous in our examination of those benefits. We would not forgo the money in any other area of our public expenditure in the same way and hope that a benefit would accrue.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">In many of our tax reliefs, there is a very clear argument of why they matter. I worry that we do not necessarily carry that same robustness through in all areas and I agree that in effect the tax rate is one of the key ways we can ensure we do not create inadvertent consequences of our tax relief and rationalisation measures.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Michael D'Arcy)<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T16:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_347">I have been working on this since 12 October, and we are nearly there. The Minister, Deputy Donohoe and I spent 19.5 hours on this section on Report Stage in the Lower House.</p>
          <p eId="para_348"> This is the first balanced budget in a decade. That is quite an achievement considering the era we have come through, which has been difficult and pretty awful for many. People get going and kept working; they kept trading in the most difficult circumstances and I thank all of those people. We expect there will be more leeway in next year's budget and we may be able to do more. At its lowest point in 2011 or 2012, our income tax take was €11 billion. In budget 2018, the expectation is that we will bring in €21.5 billion. That is the major readjustment. </p>
          <p eId="para_349"> We do not apologise Senator Conway-Walsh for giving people on low or middle income a small amount of money back via USC and the widening of the tax bands. Some €400 millon was given back. We must now bring our tax rates, some of which were emergency rates, back into line with normal practice. Stamp duty is one of the rates we are increasing from the emergency period - what I describe as the war time period - from 2% back to 6%. People say it is a trebling of the rate and it is but 2% was not a normal rate. Stamp duty used to be 6% and had been as high as 9% or 11%. We also examined and considered changing other rates on this occasion but decided against it, such as the VAT rate at 9% potentially going back to 13.5%. The latter is the normal rate and we will return to it at some stage. That is a figure of €491 million tax foregone. We decided it was in the best interests of the State because we hear Senators talking about rural and regional Ireland. That is exactly why we decided to leave those rates as they were.</p>
          <p eId="para_350"> I want to be clear for Senator Higgins. Make no mistake, every measure involving tax foregone is analysed with deep scrutiny. Perhaps I took the Senator up incorrectly but I thought she was a little glib in that we were not really analysing this. Every last red cent is analysed in very deep detail from top to bottom to ensure we are getting the best potential value.</p>
          <p eId="para_351"> If someone chooses to leave the State and become tax resident elsewhere that is a matter for him or her. I want to place on the record that corporation tax will be close to €8 billion. It is our third highest tax head. We are very clearly collecting it all. I have made the point before in the House that people have quoted the Comptroller and Auditor General’s report of a few months ago about, I think, 11 companies which pay zero. That is the correct rate because we have tax arrangements with other jurisdictions and with companies which participate and pay the tax in their country. In the same way Irish companies pay the correct tax rate. They are trading in other jurisdictions and pay the tax rate here.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">In those other countries that they are trading in the correct rate is zero but, because of our double taxation agreements where companies do not pay tax twice on the same activity, they pay the correct rate. Everybody wants to quote the Comptroller and Auditor General's report but they choose to ignore the next page which outlines those facts. One should not do that because it is misleading. It is a misrepresentation of companies which are paying the correct rates of tax in the countries where they choose to operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_353"> I thank all of the Senators. I thank the Members who participated in the Chair. I thank all of the officials in the Department of Finance. We have nearly finished in the Dáil. I believe there is a small period tomorrow night in which we will take the Bill. We finish here now.</p>
          <p eId="para_354"> I never question anybody's bona fides. We have disagreements but I appreciate and accept that everybody is acting in the best interests as he or she sees fit.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Patrick O'Donovan)<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T16:55:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_355">I thank the Members for facilitating the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_356"> This Bill seeks to implement the provisions agreed in the Public Service Stability Agreement, PSSA, 2018-2020, of earlier this year. As such, it continues the pay restoration that began two years ago with the Lansdowne Road agreement and with the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, Act 2015. This Bill provides a roadmap for the full and orderly unwinding and repeal of FEMPI over a number of years.</p>
          <p eId="para_357"> Many Members here will have been in the Seanad for the FEMPI 2015 Act; some of them will even have been here for the first FEMPI Acts, in 2009. Whether a Senator was here or not, he or she will be aware of the enormous impact that this emergency legislation has had, both on individual public servants and on the Exchequer. Nobody will need convincing that it has entailed considerable sacrifices from public servants and their families, from pensioners and from contractors. However, those sacrifices were necessary to secure the fiscal survival of the State at a time of crisis and the contribution made by public servants must be acknowledged and saluted.</p>
          <p eId="para_358"> The FEMPI Acts were an extraordinary suite of measures necessitated by an extraordinary set of circumstances but, remarkably, what they were designed to do has almost been achieved. Therefore, I am pleased to say that we are today in a position to set out how we will exit FEMPI, once and for all.</p>
          <p eId="para_359"> Essentially, there are three interlinked aspects to the Government's strategy in this area. There is the PSSA, which builds on and extends the Croke Park, Haddington Road and Lansdowne Road agreements to the end of 2020. This agreement has been ratified by the public services committee of ICTU. There is the Public Service Pay Commission, the first report of which earlier this year was key to the PSSA, and the second phase of the work of which has now begun. This second phase will examine recruitment and retention issues, where they exist, across the public service. It will conclude by the end of next year, with its first findings, on the health service, due by mid-year. Finally, there is this Bill itself, which I will now discuss in more detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_360"> At this juncture, I am required by Standing Orders to state that this is a money Bill containing measures which have already been provided for in the budget and it provides for the repeal of emergency legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">As such, the Bill, with the full agreement of the Dáil’s Business Committee, has not been the subject of the usual pre-legislative scrutiny. I would also ask the House to note at this point that both the Central Bank and the European Central Bank have been formally consulted in respect of the Bill and that the latter has published its opinion on its website. As a result of those consultations, the Government made some technical amendments on Committee Stage in the Dáil to ensure the independence of the Central Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_362"> This is substantial and complex legislation. The majority of the measures are of a financial nature. It is divided into seven parts. For the benefit of Members, I will now outline its main provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> Part 1 is a general introductory section setting out the basic terms that will be used throughout, including "covered" and "non-covered" public servants. It also provides for the repeal of the 2009 Act, so that the pension-related deduction will cease to apply to public servants as of 1 January 2019, as from that date the additional superannuation contribution shall apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_364"> Part 2 is the most substantive part of the Bill. It provides for pay restoration for all public servants, supplementing the increases under the FEMPI Act 2015. By the end of the process outlined in this part, all of the FEMPI pay cuts will be undone. Chapter 2 provides pay increases for all public servants covered by the Public Service Stability Agreement, as set out in that agreement. There will be a pay increase of 1% on 1 January 2018 and a further 1% on 1 October 2018. Where the person’s salary does not exceed €30,000, there will be 1% increase on 1 January 2019. For all public servants under the Public Service Stability Agreement, there will be a 1.75% increase on 1 September 2019. Finally, where the person’s salary does not exceed €32,000, there will be 0.5% increase on 1 January 2020 and, for all public servants under the Public Service Stability Agreement, there will be a 2% increase on 1 October 2020.</p>
          <p eId="para_365"> In Chapter 2 there is also a new section which was added on Committee Stage in the Dáil. It provides that the Government shall, within three months of the Bill’s enactment, lay a report before both Houses of the Oireachtas on the equalisation of new entrants’ pay. In light of the concerns raised by Deputies, the Government agreed to this measure, although it should also be noted that there is already a process in place to examine this issue as part of the Public Service Stability Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_366"> Chapter 3 provides for the same pay increases for those not covered by the Public Service Stability Agreement, but at a slower rate. Specifically, they will receive every pay increase I have just outlined exactly nine months after their covered counterparts. In addition, as section 21 sets out, they will not receive any incremental increases for the duration of the agreement. It is the Government’s ambition that every public servant will be covered by the Public Service Stability Agreement. The vast majority of public servants have subscribed to the collective approach agreed with their representatives and must be prioritised when it comes to further pay restoration.</p>
          <p eId="para_367"> Chapter 4 outlines how the measures I have just outlined will interact with the pre-existing commitments under the FEMPI Act 2015.</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> Chapter 5 deals with those public servants for whom the pay measures in the Public Service Stability Agreement will not have fully restored pay to pre-FEMPI levels. The vast majority – those earning up to €70,000 and who make up about 90% of the total public service – will have had their pay fully restored by October 2020. However, for the minority I am speaking about here, this chapter will complete that process over a further time period. There are two different cohorts covered by this chapter: those earning between €70,000 and €150,000 and those earning over €150,000. In both cases, the Bill provides that an order must be made by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform specifying a date after 1 October 2020, the date of the last pay increase, by which full restoration is to have taken place. For those earning less than €150,000, this date must be no later than 1 July 2021. For those earning more than that amount, it must be no later than 1 July 2022.</p>
          <p eId="para_369"> I remind Senators of three factors relating to these measures: first, the legal entitlement of these individuals to this restoration; second, the fact that these individuals were proportionally much more severely affected by the pay reductions and are having their salaries restored at a much slower pace than those at lower salary levels; and, third, that while their gross pay will be restored, the additional superannuation contribution, which I will outline in a moment, will act to reduce take home pay on a permanent basis. Finally, in relation to this part, section 20 specifies that all members of the Government will be altogether excluded from this further restoration. Moreover, the Government has decided to waive all of the restoration due under the Public Service Stability Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_370"> Part 3 is shorter and concerns pensions. As well as those currently working, the FEMPI Acts affected many public service pensioners. Just as there is pay restoration and a legal imperative to complete it, there must be further amelioration of the public service pension reduction, PSPR, for those still liable for it. This is done through the phased raising of thresholds, continuing the process which was begun under the FEMPI Act 2015. By the end of 2020, the vast majority of public service pensioners will no longer have any reduction to their payments. For those still liable for the PSPR, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform must make an order by 31 December 2020 specifying when it will cease to apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_371"> Part 4 is also about pensions but in this case it is about how public servants contribute towards their pensions. Since the first FEMPI Act eight years ago, public servants have paid a pension-related deduction, PRD, on all of their earnings. This will continue until the end of next year, as set out in the FEMPI Act 2015. However, the Bill repeals the original FEMPI Act 2009, so that no PRD will be charged after that date. Instead, as provided for under the Public Service Stability Agreement, the majority of public servants will pay an additional superannuation contribution, ASC, from 1 January 2019 onwards. This secures substantial funding towards the cost of public service pensions, amounting to approximately €546 million per annum from 2020 onwards and it will be in addition to some €700 million already contributed on an annual basis. This permanent source of revenue will help to defray the cost of providing pensions for public servants into the future and is necessary to place public service pensions on a more sustainable footing in light of the significant accrued liabilities. Unlike the PRD, the ASC is only chargeable on pensionable pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_372"> The additional superannuation contribution will apply differently depending on whether a public servant is a member of a standard accrual scheme, a fast accrual scheme or the single public service pension scheme. For those who joined fast accrual schemes before 2013, the ASC rates that will apply will be the same as the PRD rates. For those in standard accrual schemes, the ASC rates will be more favourable than the PRD rates as the threshold will be raised in 2019 and again in 2020. For those who are members of the single scheme, namely, all new entrants to any part of the public service after 2012, the ASC rates will be more favourable again. This reflects the fact, as the report of the Public Service Pay Commission found, that this scheme is already on a more sustainable basis than those that preceded it. For those not covered by the agreement, a larger proportion of their salaries will be subject to ASC compared to covered workers until 2021. However, from 2021 onwards the same ASC rates will apply to both covered and non-covered public servants.</p>
          <p eId="para_373"> I am sure Senators will appreciate that this is complex. It is difficult to present in the time available all of the information regarding percentages and thresholds, which is far better conveyed and understood in tabular or in written form. It is enough, however, to say at this juncture that the effect of the ASC becoming a permanent feature of the pay and pensions landscape is that public servants will henceforth pay a fairer contribution for the pension they will eventually enjoy upon retirement. That is what this part of the Bill achieves.</p>
          <p eId="para_374"> Part 5 places certain provisions of the FEMPI legislation on a permanent, non-emergency footing. These provisions relate to the power to vary the fees paid to contractors, mainly health professionals, for services and goods rendered. The exercise of such a power would of course only be possible where a contractual right to vary exists. </p>
          <p eId="para_375"> Parts 6 and 7 deal with transitional arrangements and miscellaneous provisions, including transitional arrangements for the payment of professional fees. As part of these transitional arrangements and in the context of exiting the FEMPI legislative framework, the Minister for Health has announced that he intends, in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to initiate a process of engagement in 2018 with relevant representative bodies on service delivery, contractual reform and associated fees.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">This process will aim to conclude a multi-annual approach to fees, commencing in 2019, in return for service improvement and contractual reform in line with Government priorities for the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_377"> The orderly repeal of the financial emergency legislation is an important milestone in the history of the State, just as the achievement of the medium-term budgetary objective was in the recent budget. Future historians or economists might see this recovery, from their detached perspective, as in many ways a rapid turnaround, relatively speaking. However, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and I are conscious that it may not feel that way to those who have lived through it. In fact, they will not feel that way. After all, by the end of the agreement it will have been almost 12 years since the first FEMPI measures were introduced. Notwithstanding that fact, given the fiscal constraints we operate within and the overriding priority for stability and sustainability in the public finances a careful and gradual unwinding of these reductions is the only sensible way to proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_378"> This approach is about balancing these requirements with our responsibilities to restore pay for the public servants who contributed so much to the economic recovery from which we are currently benefiting. It is on that basis that I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Senator Gerry Horkan<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T17:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_379">I thank the Minister of State for attending the House. I think the last time he was here he was dealing with the mid-term economic review. It is the season of goodwill to all, however, so I am sure we will have a nice, peaceful discussion this afternoon on the Second Stage of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_380"> I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Public Service Pay and Pensions Bill 2017. The Bill will legislate for the provisions in the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 made between the Government and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. The Public Service Pay Commission report was published on 9 May 2017 and was intended to form the basis for the negotiations between the Government and the public sector unions and staff representative associations. The establishment of the Public Service Pay Commission was agreed in the confidence and supply agreement between Fine Gael and my party, Fianna Fáil. It was set up to facilitate agreement on the successor to the Lansdowne Road agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_381"> Fianna Fáil has long called for the unwinding of the FEMPI legislation in a fiscally responsible manner and for an agreement that would see a fair deal for public sector workers, in particular those on lower and middle incomes. As a result of the financial crisis in 2008, FEMPI legislation was enacted in 2009 and again in 2010, 2011 and 2013. As part of the gradual unwinding of the FEMPI legislation, the Haddington Road agreement and the Lansdowne agreement were negotiated. Fianna Fáil was not part of those negotiations. However, we believe it is in the interest of the country that the agreement reached is sustainable and fair, particularly for lower and medium-paid workers. It must also allow for more public services to be provided, particularly in health and education. It is imperative that we have strong, sustainable public services. The public relies on these services and it is of the utmost importance to all of us that they are put on a stable footing.</p>
          <p eId="para_382"> The agreement was ratified by the ICTU, which means that it is agreed across the board. However, individually, the three teacher unions, the ASTI, the TUI, and the INTO, have yet to ratify the agreement. How this will be dealt with is an outstanding issue. As chair of a school board in a school with staff who are members of different unions and none, it is big concern. </p>
          <p eId="para_383"> Fianna Fáil was prevented by Dáil rules in bringing forward amendments that would have represented a charge on the State finances. As we all know, various money messages and so on are necessary. These amendments would have been ruled out of order and would not have been discussed. Instead, on Committee Stage in the Dáil, we put forward an amendment that would require the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to report back to the Oireachtas no later than March 2018 on pay equalisation. The Minister of State referred to it in his contribution. This amendment was passed and we hope that it starts the process towards pay equalisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_384"> The Bill will remove the effect of the FEMPI legislation for the vast majority of public service workers by 2020. The Minister also referred to this in his contribution. However, many issues remain and need to be raised and considered. Neither the agreement nor this Bill addresses pay equalisation. This means that, despite doing the exact same job, workers who joined after 2011 will still be paid less than their colleagues who took on their posts before then. The agreement states that any solution to the issue must not give rise to implications for the fiscal envelope of the agreement. However, this issue is the main reason the agreement was not ratified by the teacher unions. The Bill will postpone pay restoration for those unions that did not agree to the agreement. This is not unprecedented and ICTU has agreed that individual unions need to sign up to the agreement. It is of utmost importance that the issue is not allowed to escalate further and that industrial action is avoided. Fianna Fáil has long been calling for the Government to come up with a plan to tackle the issue. It is also worth remembering that this is only the Second Stage of the Bill. Further detailed discussion will take place on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_385"> We need to acknowledge that pay inequality is causing dissent in the public sector and is putting pressure on new entrants. When we ask two teachers to teach classes, we pay them differently. When we ask two gardaí to walk the streets at night to protect us, we pay them differently even though they face the same level of danger. The three teacher unions, particularly the INTO and the TUI, have concerns about this Bill which are based completely on pay inequality. We need to move towards addressing those concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_386"> Another important issue is staff retention and recruitment, which is affecting many sectors of the public sector yet this agreement fails to deal fully with it. In areas such as nursing and the Defence Forces, numbers have been falling to critical levels. This not only affects the services themselves but also the conditions under which existing employees are working. While the Bill addresses some of the grievances for public sector pensioners, they are not happy with the speed of restoration.</p>
          <p eId="para_387"> While this agreement will cost €880 million over the next three years, or €1.1 billion over four years, the bulk of the cost will be loaded to 2019 and beyond. The cost in 2018 is €180 million. Unwinding the FEMPI measures on a fiscally sustainable basis has always been a core policy objective for Fianna Fáil. During the financial crisis, the legislation was enacted, but we have unwound much if through this agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_388"> Fianna Fáil believes that, in the interests of the country, the agreement reached will be sustainable and fair, particularly for lower and medium-paid workers. It must also allow for more public services to be provided. It is imperative that we make these professions attractive for younger people in order to ensure that we can provide the workforce needed for our growing population. Our public servants are key to providing the services which our population needs and demands. </p>
          <p eId="para_389"> It is a good day that the Bill is going through. I hope that by the end of the week we will have included many people across the public sector who will benefit somewhat from these provisions. The Minister of State referenced the pension related deduction. I remember for a long time being a councillor and paying a pension-related deduction although none of our pay was pensionable. We were paying a pension-related deduction without getting a pension at the end of it. There are many other people in the public sector who felt very aggrieved at the time. However, it is a positive thing that is happening. I have outlined my concerns and my party's concerns but we are supporting the rapid passage of the Bill through the Houses. I think those who will benefit from it would like it to be done sooner rather than later, and before Christmas.</p>

        <speech by="#PaddyBurke" eId="spk_159">
          <from>Senator Paddy Burke<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T17:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_390">I welcome both the Minister of State to the House and this legislation. As we all know, going back to 2009, the FEMPI legislation was brought in for various reasons. Basically, the economy fell asunder and something had to be done. I compliment this Government and the two previous Governments on the enormous work they did to bring the public finances back to a position where we are currently able to pay our way. The economy collapsed and the IMF was brought into the country. Everyone's pay was either reduced or taxed through the universal social charge or otherwise. Many Bills were brought to this House over the years. For instance, judges' pay was reduced, which was unthinkable at one stage. It was said it could not be touched, but it had to be done for the sake of the economy. Every sector of society, including the public service, suffered greatly over a ten-year period. As I said, there were a number of Acts. We enacted FEMPI legislation in 2009, 2010, 2013 and 2015 and now this Bill shows the path towards full restoration of public pay until 2021.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">I am delighted this legislation is being brought in. It contains the final roadmap as to how everything will be restored. Many people made great sacrifices. People working in the public service had acquired large mortgages and cars and had to pay for education for children. When they saw the reductions in their pay on numerous occasions, it was very hard for them to take it. I am delighted that we have a roadmap that will restore pay and pensions in full by 2021.</p>
          <p eId="para_392"> Senator McDowell outlined how good the public service pension is at 50% of a person's wages. However, there have been changes to that as well. Heretofore, many public servants could have received a pension after a certain number of years, whether it was when they reached the age of 50, 60 or 65. In future, the vast majority of people will not get a pension until they are 66, 67, 68 or even 70. There have been many changes to pensions and there will be further changes to come. The public service pensions we saw in the past will not be as generous in future. While people in high office will finish on a certain salary, their pensions will be aggregated over their time in the public service. That is a big change as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_393"> There is also a big change in when politicians get their pensions. Previously, Members of the Oireachtas could get a pension at 50, provided they had the required service and made pension payments. However, Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas will not now qualify for a pension until they are 66, 67, 68 and probably up to 70 in the not too distant future. We all know the vulnerability in regard to politics. Members are in the Oireachtas for an average of 12 years. It is a very vulnerable business for anybody to be getting into. The time spent here is quite short and one might have to wait until one reaches 67, 68 or 70 of age for a pension. One could be a Member of the House for a number of years and then be out on one's ear at 50 or 60 years of age, at which point I do not know what one would do. One would probably be unemployable by the time one leaves Leinster House.</p>
          <p eId="para_394"> I welcome the legislation. There are three parts to it, as the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, said. It provides the roadmap to the full restoration. It refers to the public service stability agreement, PSSA and the Public Service Pay Commission. I warmly welcome this Bill. I commend the people who faced hardship over the past ten years and who can finally see where they are going for the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_398">I welcome the unwinding of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, reductions and adjustments as it makes sense at this stage. Of course, there is another angle at which we have to look, namely, those areas where there is two-tier remuneration, with a view to ensuring it is equalised or got rid of as soon as possible, unless there is a very strong case that the prior level of remuneration was excessive. People doing the same job in the public service should have roughly the same salary.</p>
          <p eId="para_399"> There are two points I want to mention in particular. I have to declare an interest in that I have an accrued public service pension of sorts as a Member of the Oireachtas, as an Attorney General, a Minister and a Tánaiste. However, under changes brought in, I am not in receipt of that pension now because I am a Member of the Oireachtas. I make no complaint about that. It was payable as soon as I left office. Senator Paddy Burke made an important point in that if the pensionable age is to be raised to 70, a Deputy who gave the best of her or his life in 20 years' service from the ages of 30 to 50 is going to have to wait a long time to see the benefit of any accrued pension if 70 becomes the starting point.</p>
          <p eId="para_400"> In law, the Supreme Court has ruled that pensions are deferred remuneration. We have to realise that in our country, we are not the same as say the United Kingdom. Former MPs and former Ministers, in particular, could look very easily to alternative employment having lost their seats at Westminster. That is not the case here. There are few enough former Ministers of my generation and the generation before that who have been endowed with directorships and jobs of that kind on their retirement. On the contrary, it seems that most of the private sector, at any rate, shies away from them. I am not whingeing about myself, just in case anybody thinks I am. However, most of the private sector wants to appear apolitical. Businesses do not want somebody who was, in former times, a Minister and who may or may not have been controversial in his or her time, sitting on their boards. There is not a huge gravy train at the end of public life in Ireland if and when the electorate decides to dispense with one's services. One's memoirs might get a few thousand euro on a good day and a couple of libel suits to boot. One might end up in the red with that enterprise.</p>
          <p eId="para_401"> In terms of one's capacity to end up in the media, I notice the BBC is very generous to former politicians. It allows them to do this, that and the other. In Ireland, we seem to be a little more abstemious in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_402"> If we want to attract people who already have substantial incomes into politics, it will be increasingly difficult unless they have a very generous State or semi-State employer, such as a university, RTÉ, which would give them leave of absence or the teaching profession from which they can get a leave of absence of sorts, or analogous positions to those. To hazard one's entire prosperity and one's family's means of support on the idealism that is required to go into politics, to put one's name on the block and to make the sacrifices that are part of becoming a politician will become increasingly insuperable and the obstacles to participation for those people will become more and more insurmountable.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">We should be very careful about making sacrifices in the hope of appeasing some people in the media when the net result is that the kind of people who go into politics becomes narrowed down to those who have nothing to lose. That is not a good idea.</p>
          <p eId="para_404"> The last point I want to make relates to judicial pensions. Some time after I left office as Minister for Justice and Equality, a Bill was passed in these Houses which increased the number of years that a judge would have to serve, from 15 to 20, before he or she would get a pension. The consequence is that in order to obtain a full pension as a judge, which is half of one's salary from the date of retirement at 70 years of age, one has to have been appointed a judge at the age of 50. One cannot say at the age of 48, for example, that one will be a judge in two year's time. The world does not work that way. To be considered eligible, suitable and desirable as a judge is not something within an individual's own gift. If a top solicitor or barrister who is making decisions in his or her mid-40s about whether to seek promotion to the bench succeeds in that enterprise by the age of 50, that person is probably not at the top of his or her career at the time of becoming a judge. The 15 year rule allowed people to become a judge at the age of 55 and by that stage, they probably should be at the top of their career because they are not going to become much more successful thereafter unless something great happens to them in their declining years. We should restore that particular provision to 15 years to make it more attractive to people at the top of their careers to seek judicial appointment. </p>
          <p eId="para_405"> I would make one more point that I hope is not taken badly by the Minister or the Department. The section which changed the pension criteria from 15 to 20 years was hidden away in a Schedule to a large Act. No reference was made to it in the explanatory memorandum. I checked the Dáil and Seanad debates but no reference whatsoever was made to the fact that it was being done. It was a sleight of hand between two Departments to achieve something in total secrecy. None of the Members of these Houses had their attention drawn to the fact that they were making that change. It was a bad idea that was never debated in either House of the Oireachtas and the sooner it is reversed, the better. It is suitable as an amendment to this legislation. </p>

        <speech by="#RoseConwayWalsh" eId="spk_164">
          <from>Senator Rose Conway-Walsh<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T17:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_406">I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House today. I empathise with Senator Paddy Burke when he refers to political vulnerability, particularly when there are retired Mayo footballers coming onto the political pitch. However, I cannot concur with what was said around pensions and vulnerability in the context of some of our former taoisigh earning in excess of €20,000 for an hour's work delivering after-dinner speeches. The issue of judicial appointments and scrutiny of same will have to keep for another day because we are here today to talk about the pension levy and the Financial Emergency Measrues in the Public Interest Act, or FEMPI.</p>
          <p eId="para_407"> The pension levy was introduced in 2009 by way of FEMPI. Many of our public and civil servants such as nurses, teachers, gardaí and fire fighters did not believe that the Act would happen. They believed that Fianna Fáil would not go to war or attack them as civil servants. The 24/7 alliance that formed in response, based on the belief that once the Government had started with this one measure it would continue and go after those receiving premium pay packets, was impactful due to its collective activism and trade unionism. Sinn Féin has long been calling for a fair and timely bottom-up restructuring of FEMPI, as the current two-tier system has caused pay inequality. Those with the lowest incomes must benefit before those with the higher incomes in order to reduce this pay inequality.</p>
          <p eId="para_408"> The failure of our two-tier system is a major contributor to Irish emigration which has led to difficulties in recruitment and retention in our nursing and hospital services, as well as in our education sector. It has also decimated many rural areas which still have yet to see any improvement or to see people returning in any significant numbers. The longer we fail to address and fix the two-tier system, the more it will cost the Exchequer in the long run in terms of services not being delivered and expensive overtime bills. In addition, we are losing some of the most qualified and brightest individuals that Ireland has produced as the two-tier system has caused many of our graduates to leave the country with no intention of returning. This should be of upmost concern for our Government. This is no more obvious than in the severe staff shortages in the emergency department in Mayo University Hospital. That department is down at least five full-time staff since this time last year and cannot operate properly. At the same time, we will see fully qualified nurses coming home for the Christmas holidays and leaving again. We cannot allow that to continue to happen. </p>
          <p eId="para_409"> Many of our civil and public servants are doing the exact same job as their colleagues but are being paid up to 15% less. This is demoralizing, dehumanizing and fundamentally wrong. Three teachers’ unions and UNITE have all voted against this deal. This Bill will continue payment inequality for civil and public servants who have been recruited since 2011. This is wrong and the Government must acknowledge this very serious and very real concern of our public and civil servants. Sinn Féin has long been fighting and advocating for the right to equal pay for equal work. We are being told that economy is improving, as is the situation of some of our people but the continuance of the two-tier pay system has not allowed our newly qualified teachers and recent nursing graduates to feel this benefit. Industrial action, in particular by the teaching profession, is a very real possibility. Putting into legislation matters that should be the subject of normal industrial relations procedures is quite an aggressive act and will have the effect of angering civil and public servants. It will send a message just like the one from the Taoiseach when he alluded to the possibility of outlawing strikes. </p>
          <p eId="para_410"> We must work hard to talk about these issues and take action to address concerns rather than just recognise that they should be dealt with and then push them to one side. Failing to acknowledge the concerns of the teacher’s unions will only further exacerbate our recruitment and retention crisis. It is important to acknowledge that the public service stability agreement, PSSA, has been accepted by the majority of trade unions. We will be proposing amendments to this legislation as appropriate. We do not oppose the Bill but we will continue to work with teachers, nurses and other civil and public servants to reverse unequal pay.</p>

          <from>Senator Alice-Mary Higgins<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T17:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_411">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I note that this Bill has passed through the Dáil without amendment. I also realise that it is a money Bill and it will continue on its journey. While there are measures in the Bill that have already been talked about and praised which are positive and which will lead to a concrete and meaningful, albeit partial, restoration of pay and conditions for many public servants, there are other aspects of the Bill that are of very serious concern. One is the distinction the Bill makes between covered and non-covered parties. That is set out in section 3 and its impact is felt in a number of other sections, including sections 22 and 34 in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">Effectively, what we see in this Bill are penalties attached to non-covered persons. I recognise most unions have agreed to these proposals. Those who are members of unions, primarily teachers' unions, which have not agreed to these proposals, are being punished by being denied increments, being asked to make a higher superannuation contribution or by having an increment frozen over a period of three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_413"> Why are they being penalised? We must go back to the step before what this Bill purports to do. The Minister of State spoke about the contribution made and the cost to public servants during the period of the recession and austerity. This Bill proposes to restore these conditions. Instead, however, it is a Bill whereby the Government will only reward those who have agreed it has done a good enough job in restoration. If the Minister is seeking to restore public pay and increments, as well as reversing the measures put in place, that is a decision for him to make. He makes that decision based on the current state of the economy, on Exchequer returns and after weighing up the issues. The Minister must make decisions as to what are appropriate and achievable levels of pay, increments and pension contributions. What is not appropriate, however, is unless one agrees with the decisions the Minister has made and states they are positive, one will be effectively penalised.</p>
          <p eId="para_414"> We know it is not a simple and technical measure because the Government made it clear that in three years' time it will get around to unfreezing the pay increments for those who did not agree with these proposals. There has been no suggestion that the non-payment of increments is in any way related, for example, to people not performing their duties or not taking industrial action. This is simply because they have not signed up to the public service stability agreement, PSSA. I do not question the integrity of those unions which have signed up to it. All of them have made their choices. However, in the cases of those who chose not to sign up, their rationale in many cases was that they felt there was not enough urgency in addressing the issue of unequal pay for new entrants and the two-tier pay systems. For many, this decision was made on the basis of a principle of solidarity and equality. Now, we will go from having a two-tier pay system in the public service where new entrants and existing staff are paid differently to having another two-tier system imposed on that. For example, two teachers or two public servants, working alongside each other, doing the same work on delivering the same outcomes with the same level of experience, will now be paid differently based on whether their union signed up to the PSSA. We will now have two layers of a two-tier system. How is this positive for public service morale? How does it indicate we understand the sacrifices made and are keen to reverse them?</p>
          <p eId="para_415"> I will be putting forward amendments in respect of the differential, disadvantageous, unduly punitive and inappropriate treatment of non-covered persons in this Bill. I am concerned there are measures contained in section 3 whereby a person who leaves a union which has not signed up to the PSSA will potentially be rewarded with their pay increments being restored. Again, there is no indication that might happen but there is a concern we are creating a perverse incentive for people to de-unionise. Trade unions have brought us and contributed greatly to social stability in Ireland at times when other countries in Europe would greatly have sought and hoped for such stability. I am concerned at the potentially negative impact of this Bill's measures on trade union membership, which I believe is a public good and is one of the ways we can ensure industrial disputes are managed in an appropriate way, as well as allowing us find constructive ways forward together. Will the Minister measure the impact of the Bill's proposals on trade union membership? I will be putting forward an amendment to ensure positive steps are taken to encourage the restoration of the tax relief for trade union membership to ensure we are actively encouraging it as a core part of our social stability, social cohesion and our shared future.</p>
          <p eId="para_416"> We are all aware that several of those trade unions which have not signed up to this agreement, and whose members are likely to be penalised as a result, represent the teaching profession. We have a serious concern about ensuring we are able to recruit and retain high-quality teachers for our next generation. Our education system is the seedbed for our future development and growth in our economy which will, in turn, sustain society. What are the Minister's plans to address the concerns of those in the teaching profession, in particular, and to ensure we re-engage with those issues for new entrants in nursing, the Defence Forces and across so other many areas of public life?</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Patrick O'Donovan)<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T17:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_417">I welcome the comments of the Senators present. It is worth noting the small number of Senators who showed an interest in this significant Bill. The unwinding of the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation, FEMPI, in such an orderly way affects every parish, community and public servant. I thank the Senators who have stayed for the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_418"> Senator Michael McDowell put a personal matter on the record, and I will too. I was a new entrant teacher in 2008. I went back and qualified as a teacher, as did many of my cohort when the country was banjaxed and fell asunder. Many of us, for one reason or another, had been made redundant. We entered into the public service in the full knowledge that we were entering into a different pay agreement and pay rate. That was difficult but nobody has a monopoly on politics as to what is and is not a fair rate and the commitment to unwind it.</p>
          <p eId="para_419"> The Government has, through the public services agreement, the cornerstone on which this legislation is based, and with the agreement of the unions, an oversight body built into the agreement, which will examine the exact way in which we can make progress on pay parity. This is a matter the Government takes seriously. As a Minister of State I take it seriously when many of my contemporaries are affected by this.</p>
          <p eId="para_420"> In dealing with it, however, we have to be mindful of the amount of fiscal space we have and the cost of ensuring we can do this. We cannot do it in one fell swoop. We want to do it in an orderly way. That is why the majority of unions and public servants have voted for this agreement. That is why this legislation needs to be enacted as soon as possible to ensure we can pay people on 1 January 2018.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> Several amendments were proposed in the other House. One, which was accepted and proposed by Fianna Fáil, provides for the publication of a report by the Minister on achieving parity of pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">There is provision to ensure the report will be produced by the oversight body that will work with the Department and the officials present.</p>
          <p eId="para_423"> Many Senators have alluded to the disparity between high and low salaries. It is fair to say this and the previous Government which was in office until 2016 have restored the salaries of most of the lower paid. We have some work yet to do, but our commitment is clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_424"> Reference was made by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, to the covered and non-covered pay aspects. Anyone who has read the Dáil debates will know that the cornerstone is the public service agreement. Collective bargaining has been the hallmark of industrial relations. I remember as a young fellow in school the Programme for Economic and Social Progress. Senators Paddy Burke and Michael McDowell were probably knocking around at the time. It comes with the territory in having collective bargaining or an agreement. No one wants to go back to the winters of discontent in the 1980s when there was one union after another coming in. We believe in bargaining and negotiating with the unions as a collective. The collective representative organisation is the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and we have no reason to believe we have anything other than full co-operation in how the agreement is will play out. The Government believes everyone is and should be covered by the agreement, rightly so. There will be those who agree and those who do not. Naturally, if people communicate their decision not to agree, there will have to be swings and balances to be struck, as the Minister has pointed that out. Otherwise, what is the point in having an agreement? The agreement is about maintaining industrial peace. In recent years we have come through the worst economic recession since the foundation of the State. It is testament to the public service and three Governments in office, to which Senator Paddy Burke referred, that no strikes were foisted on the people. Schools and offices were kept open and public services continued to be delivered in a winter of tough decisions that had to be taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_425"> It is important to point out that we have an agreement that is orderly. We know that we want to try to achieve an orderly unwinding of the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation which no one wants to have on the Statute Book, but we have to work within the amount of money available. It has been pointed out what will be available to us in 2018, 2019 and 2020. We have been very honest and upfront with the trade union leadership. As a former member of the Irish National Teachers Organisation, I understand from where members are coming. However, I know from speaking to individuals on a case by case basis that they are acutely aware of where the State is. We do not want to go back to where we came from. We are working with the oversight body and union representatives to ensure that, ultimately, everyone will be on the same pathway.</p>
          <p eId="para_426"> I want to go back to a point raised by Senators Paddy Burke and Michael McDowell. It is one on which I agree entirely with them, although perhaps it is a debate for another day. Senator Rose Conway-Walsh also referred to the issue. Senator Michael McDowell is absolutely right. We are going to wind up with politics being confined to a small narrow group who will have nothing to lose. That is not right for democracy. We have had considerable debate on the question of trying to get more women to become involved in politics. I came into the Houses in my 30s, but if he or she is anything south of 40 years of age, a person would want to have rocks in his or her head to put his or her name forward for election He or she would be putting himself or herself in a very vulnerable posittion if he has a wife or she has a husband , family and mortgage, like most of us do. Why, in the name of God, would a person enter politics in his or her 30s, given the way in which it has descended to the lowest common denominator and been run down into the ground?</p>
          <p eId="para_427"> The first thing I had to say about high pay was that members of the Government were not covered. It is the awful sad reality that every time we have to speak about any resolution, we must apologise for our existence as politicians. We have had debates on the involvement of women in politics, about quotas and young people, rightly so, but we need to start to have an honest discussion in the Houses on what we want from politics. If we want to keep it as the preserve of those who have nothing to lose, as Senator Michael McDowell said, that is fine. I have no problem with it. However, we should at least be honest about it. This place will only have seats for those who, if they are kicked out, will go back to where they had come from. If we truly want to have a representatives sample of the men and women of Ireland, we will have to reflect on what we should put in place. We need to put in place proper systems and schemes that will stand up to scrutiny, be fair and that the media might not like. I have never heard media representatives express views on their terms and conditions or pension remuneration. Everything I do, from the number of biros I keep to the amount of paper clips and toner I consume, is public information, rightly so, and I have no problem in standing over it.</p>
          <p eId="para_428"> No public servant covered by the agreement should be put in a situation where his or her job will come within the confines of a narrow set. I know that I am moving off script, but I agree entirely. The Seanad would do us all a favour in life if in the new year if it were to have a good, proper and mature adult conversation on the kind of politicians we want to have in this country in the future. If we want all of them to be from the same cohort, that is fine. As is said, we get what we vote for.</p>
          <p eId="para_429"> I have taken note of the remarks made. The main issue is pay parity and I have dealt with it. I have also dealt with the covered and non-covered pay aspects. It is welcome that amendments will be tabled, but I remind Senators that this is a money Bill and everyone knows that when it comes to money Bills, it is the Government prerogative. I remind Senators that we need to have this done before 1 January. I appreciate the comments of Senator Alice-Mary Higgins about the fact that the Bill is not being opposed. Many public servants are in the wings and want to ensure we will pay them what they are owed under the agreement. That must be the over-riding principle. I look forward to dealing with the rest of the matters raised on Committee and Report Stages.</p>
