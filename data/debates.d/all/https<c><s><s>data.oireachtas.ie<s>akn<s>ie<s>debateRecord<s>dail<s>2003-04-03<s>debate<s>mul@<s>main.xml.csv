#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following urgent matter of national and immediate importance: the need to instruct the Health Service Employers Agency to come to the table with realistic proposals to settle the public health doctors dispute as a strike cannot now be contemplated when Ireland is about to host its largest ever population mix at the Special Olympics, when there is a greatly heightened risk of bio-terrorism and when the WHO has just declared an emerging disease, SARS, a global health threat.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18281	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	30	The Government came to power having fooled people in the general election in regard to many of the promises it made.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18281	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	32	This side of the House will not facilitate the guillotining or the ramming through of a Bill which is designed to assist Ministers in running away from their legal responsibilities under the existing Act to be accountable for their decisions. It is good for Parliament that Ministers  be accountable for the decisions they make and that they come before the people to explain decisions they made after a lapse of five years. We will not facilitate any change in that. We will not facilitate the change in the Freedom of Information Act that ends the presumption of openness and instead creates a presumption of secrecy which the Ministers are seeking to impose throughout the whole structure of the Freedom of Information Act. Neither will we facilitate the throwing of a veil of secrecy across a whole range of bodies that will now be defined as Government. The amending legislation proposes to extend the same protection to committees appointed by Government as that afforded to the Cabinet.This is bad legislation and is being rammed through this House. It was not in the Government's programme and was never anticipated before the election. It was only decided after the election in the fateful month of June 2002 when the Government discovered it could not pay for its false promises. It also discovered that freedom of information was making Government impossible and cumbersome. This is bad legislation brought in by a Government which should be on the run and we will not facilitate it in any way.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	33	A small but immensely important aspect of the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill was brought to the attention of the select committee by the One in Four group. After many hours of argument the Minister accepted the excision of that particular phrase. However, the impression has gone out as a result of that, that somehow the Minister and the Government have backed down on this appalling legislation when the fact of the matter is that the substance of the amending legislation is intact. It ring-fences the Government from scrutiny or from any probing of the manner of the making of decisions. If it was as good an idea as the Ministers say it is, then why was it not advanced in the programme for Government last May of one party or the other?

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	35	There was no mention of it when they had to face the people. An entirely calculating, cynical decision is being made by the two parties in the coalition of the willing based on the perception that the public really does not care, that this is a media or Opposition issue. It is a profoundly democratic issue about the manner in which we do business. The Government wants to go back to old ways and old days and we will not facilitate that in this House.

#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	48	We are prepared to meet tomorrow. The last thing we need, as an Opposition, is to be told when we should finish scrutinising this legislation that overrides democratic rights, which has important constitutional implications and which assists the Government in doing its business at the expense of the public's right to know.This party will not co-operate with a Government which is prepared to ride roughshod over parliamentary procedures. There was never more than one Government representative present during the select committee's deliberations and, frequently, there was no Government representative present at all. We will not be told when we should finish scrutiny of a Bill that has already been guillotined on Second Stage, is being proposed to be guillotined on Committee Stage and it will be proposed to guillotine it on Report Stage for no reason other than the Government's convenience. It fears that April 21 will come and go and it will be forced to account for decisions it made in the past five years. We will not support that.

Let there be no mistaking that there is a real and inherent danger in the extension of Government from those who are democratically elected and accountable to committees which are neither accountable nor identifiable by name or by person. These elements have been exposed by the ongoing scrutiny of this legislation on Committee Stage with the Minister for Finance. It is imperative that the committee is allowed to carry out its full work and has adequate time to go through the detail of this so-called amending legislation so that the public interest is served. Ultimately, the only way that the public interest can be served and guaranteed is by the Government withdrawing this disgraceful legislation.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	66	I call Deputy Rabbitte.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	67	No measure should be brought before this House with Second and Subsequent Stages to be taken in one sitting. The Tánaiste and Government have known about this since the second Nice treaty referendum and certainly since last December. It is now to be introduced to the House and we are supposed to take Second, Committee and Remaining Stages in one sitting. This is not the way to deal with legislation. I have no idea why the Government finds itself in a situation where, day after day, it must resort to this mechanism to put through legislation as if the House was a sausage factory.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	68	I object to the proposal that the Employment Permits Bill would proceed to face – as with so much legislation of the recent past – a guillotine to conclude deliberations. No logical explanation has been given why Second Stage is being brought to a conclusion this evening at 6.30 p.m. and why the Report and Final Stages will have a mere hour following immediately afterwards. It is important legislation and important amendments have been tabled by Members. We are not affording the House the opportunity to deal with the important elements of this Bill within the restriction of time proposed by Government. I oppose the proposal to enforce a guillotine in this case.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	69	On that issue, I remind the House that the practice of continuing with guillotines seems to be a fascination for the Government at present. A panic seems to have motivated the Government in introducing legislation which require a series of guillotines. These guillotines are not used to create efficiency or to meet particular deadlines but to exclude the Opposition from the normal debating practice to which it is  entitled. I register Fine Gael's opposition to the proposal.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	70	I accept it is not best practice to take all Stages of any legislation in one day.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	72	From time to time, there are exceptional circumstances. There is a deadline. This legislation must be in place before the accession treaties are signed on 16 April next. That is the law that will apply.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	73	Why did the Government not bring it in before now?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	74	The important thing is that we are bringing it in. The Government has decided to open the labour market to the new member states from day one and that is why this legislation is necessary. That is, effectively, all that the legislation does. It is important that the legislation is passed. We have to do it in this way, unfortunately, as it has to be implemented before 16 April.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	75	Is the fourth proposal, for the sitting and business of the Dáil tomorrow, agreed?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18281	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	76	It is my understanding that Friday sittings will become standard as the Government's plans for Dáil reform are implemented. The principle being established in this proposal – that there will be no Order of Business on Fridays – is a wrong one.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	77	Hear, hear.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18281	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	78	The Government should be accountable to the House when the Dáil is sitting. As things stand, the Taoiseach comes to the House at 2.30 p.m. on Tuesdays and leaves at 12 o'clock on Wednesdays and that is the last we see of him.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	79	He is very busy.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18281	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	80	If we are to have Friday sittings, which is in accordance with Dáil reform—

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18281	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	82	—the Government should be present and properly accountable to the House in the usual manner.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	83	Deputy Kenny is missing.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18281	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	84	Deputies should have the opportunity to raise relevant issues of concern.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	85	The Taoiseach will go for the council.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	86	If we are to have Friday sittings, will the Tánaiste make a commitment to provide time to discuss the paralysis at the heart of the Government's health policy, arising from the dispute between the Ministers for Finance and Health and Children?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	87	That matter does not arise at this point.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	88	Will the Tánaiste allow Government time to debate the issues that arise from this paralysis?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I know that many backbench Deputies on the other side of the House—
#JohnCreganFF	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-party	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	90	The Deputy should speak for himself.

#DonnieCassidyFF	unknown-#DonnieCassidyFF-party	unknown-#DonnieCassidyFF-dob	unknown-#DonnieCassidyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	93	Welcome back.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	94	—and their abandonment of the national spatial strategy if we implement the rail review, as published today. The review is being discussed throughout the media, including in newspapers and on radio programmes. Given that we will sit tomorrow, I would ask the Government if it would it give time—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	95	We are discussing the proposal for the sitting tomorrow and we cannot go through the Government's whole legislative programme.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	96	Will the Government provide time tomorrow for discussion of the strategic rail review which is of interest to the inhabitants of every hub and gateway?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	97	The matter does not arise under this proposal. The Deputy will have to find another way of raising the matter.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	98	As we will not have an Order of Business tomorrow in the understood meaning of the Standing Order, can the Tánaiste arrange for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House to make a statement on the incident which took place outside the Oireachtas last night?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	99	That matter does not arise on the Order of Business.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	101	The Deputy must find another way of raising the matter.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	102	That does not arise. I will put the question.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18281	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	103	The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is responsible for the Companies Bill. In January of last year, she promised that the Bill would be published during 2002, but we see now that the publication date has drifted by two years at a time when the last quarter exports have collapsed by 10%, company profits and industrial employment are down significantly and many of the problems stem from the Government's failure to address issues.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	104	It is not appropriate to make a long speech on the Order of Business.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18281	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	105	The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is giving a poor example by allowing her legislative programme to slide in this manner.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	106	As the Deputy knows, the legislation referred to has nothing to do with export performance. One new investment has been announced each week for the past 14 weeks which is spectacular given the current global downturn.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18281	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	107	How does the Minister explain the 10% decrease in exports in the first quarter?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	108	That does not arise at this stage.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18281	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	109	The Minister did not answer the question on the progress of the legislation.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	110	Members should confine themselves to questions they are entitled to ask on the Order of Business.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18281	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	111	I asked a question on the Companies Bill, but I did not receive an answer.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	112	When is the Companies Bill to come before the House?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	113	The Companies Bill is significant legislation which contains more than 1,000 heads. I accept that it is taking longer than we would wish to bring before the House, but it will be ready later this year or next year.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	114	Does the Tánaiste agree with me that protecting access to and egress from this House is important? Has she had reports, as I have, to the effect that ordinary gardaí did a good  job and handled last night's situation correctly, but that there was no need to call in the riot squad?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	115	The matter does not arise.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	116	If the riot squad is to be called in in circumstances like this—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	117	That does not arise on the Order of Business.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	118	I would like to ask the Tánaiste if she agrees—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	119	Deputy Rabbitte is out of order. If I allow Deputy Rabbitte to speak on this, I will have to allow a whole debate. I have already allowed Deputy Costello to raise the matter on the Adjournment. Deputy Rabbitte is anticipating the debate.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	120	I had finished my question. Does the Tánaiste agree that if gardaí from the public order squad present in circumstances, they should be seen to wear their numbers given the experience in other parts of the city?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	121	As I have explained, the matter does not arise on the Order of Business. Deputy Costello has been given leave to raise the matter on the Adjournment at which time there will be a proper debate.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	122	Those people who are interested in the right of free protest on an issue as major as the current war want to hear the Tánaiste's views.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	123	Of course they do. The matter will be dealt with in the appropriate way on the Adjournment this evening.
#DonnieCassidyFF	unknown-#DonnieCassidyFF-party	unknown-#DonnieCassidyFF-dob	unknown-#DonnieCassidyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	124	Deputy Costello will share time with Deputy Rabbitte.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	125	The Taoiseach is not in the House to discuss this topical matter which means there is no time for Leader's questions.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	126	Deputy Rabbitte is anticipating the matter which will be raised by his colleague, Deputy Costello, in the appropriate way on the Adjournment.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	127	On a point of order, the Ceann Comhairle mentions that Deputy Costello is to raise the matter on the Adjournment. Many Members have sent in special notice questions. Will you accede to that and have the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform come to the House to answer them.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	128	The matter will be looked at.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	129	Will you examine the special notice questions and ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to answer for the disgraceful behaviour last night?

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	134	The heads of the Bill are expected in the middle of this year.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	135	Given the loss of jobs at the Wellman plastics recycling factory and the Government's previous indifference to the closure of the Irish Glass Bottle factory, why do we not have before us the Protection of the Environment Bill, consideration of which has been completed in the Seanad? It will not form part of next week's business and the following week the House will sit for only two days. It is an important Bill and it deserves as much time as possible.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	136	Second Stage of the Bill is due to be taken in this House shortly.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	138	That is a matter for the Whips.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	140	Can the Tánaiste express to the Garda Commissioner our appreciation for the professional manner in which gardaí dealt with last night's protest which was anything but peaceful? I would welcome the opportunity to discuss the matter in the House.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	141	That is not in order.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	142	Certain parties in this House are attempting to undermine the Garda.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	147	It is important that we have balance in the debate rather than have this sort of situation.

It is a matter for the Government.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	223	I propose: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."I am pleased to have the opportunity to present this important Bill to the Dáil. Enactment of the legislation gives us a wonderful opportunity, as a Government and people, to extend the hand of friendship and solidarity to the new European Union member states and to forge new alliances with these countries, many of whom will find themselves in a similar position to Ireland after we joined in 1973, in terms of economic situation, size and population.The Bill is designed primarily to provide a legislative basis for granting full labour market access to nationals of the EU accession states after accession takes place in May 2004. From the date of accession, nationals of these countries will no longer require employment permits to work in Ireland. It also puts in place a safeguard mechanism whereby a requirement for employment permits may be reintroduced in respect of nationals of the relevant countries, should the Irish labour market suffer an unexpected disturbance during a transitional period after EU enlargement takes place.I am also taking this opportunity to put the employment permit regime on a more sound statutory footing. This Bill incorporates a provision whereby, for the first time, a requirement for employment permits in respect of non-nationals working in Ireland is set out specifically in dedicated primary legislation, together with penalties for non-compliance by employers and employees.Before explaining the provisions of the Bill, I will place it in context as part of the general enlargement of the EU, as well as the Government's approach to matters pertaining to economic migration. An additional ten countries are to be admitted to the EU with effect from May 2004, namely the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta and Cyprus. From that date, they will be party to the treaties governing the European Communities. While the treaties provide for full freedom for citizens of the accession states to move freely through the enlarged EU, they do not provide for unchecked, automatic access to all community labour markets. In this area, given concerns surrounding possible labour flows and labour market effects, the EU has put in place a transitional measure, during which each member state will be able to exercise discretion as to the extent of access to their respective labour markets. The exception to this arrangement provides for full access to the EU labour market for two accession states, Malta and Cyprus.The essential components of the transitional arrangements that have been agreed at EU level  apply equally to Ireland and all other member states. They provide that for two years following the date of accession, national measures rather than Community rules will be applied to the newly acceded member states. In effect, this means we can choose to be as flexible or as restrictive as we like in relation to labour market access for nationals of these countries. Two years after accession, in May 2006, Ireland will have to decide whether it then wishes to apply the full body of rules on freedom of movement, or the Acquis. The expectation is that most member states would apply the full Acquis at this stage. However, member states may opt to continue the national measures operated in the first two years if they wish to do so, and it is expected that this will only happen where granting full freedom of movement may pose a threat to their labour market.The transitional period should come to an end after a maximum of five years, but it may be prolonged for a further two years in those member states where there are serious disturbances of the labour market or a threat of such disruption. This case would have to be demonstrated. Finally, national measures in the transitional period may not be more restrictive than the provisions in force at the date of signing of the accession treaty, 16 April 2003. Austria and Germany have the right to apply national measures to address serious disturbances, or the threat thereof, in specific sensitive sectors in their labour markets, which could arise in certain regions from cross-border provision of services.Turning to the current economic migration situation in the broader context of the Irish labour market, from 1997 to 2000, Ireland experienced an unprecedented level of growth of approximately 10%, year on year, in both GNP and GDP. This strong performance has brought about an unprecedented growth in the labour force, which, in the past five years has grown by 200,000 – currently 1.85 million – while the number employed has grown by 300,000 and is currently 1.77 million. The current level of unemployment is 4.5%, compared with an EU average of 7.9%. This level of employment growth has given rise to significant labour shortages and a rapid increase in the number of foreign workers. These have come not only from the countries of the European Union, the citizens of which enjoy freedom of movement under EU law, but from a wide range of other countries.While the longer term growth potential of the economy may still be reassuring, the short-term outlook has weakened. This is particularly the case in relation to unemployment. There were 25,538 redundancies in 2002, the highest level since 1988. This constituted an increase of 28% over those notified in 2001, which in turn saw an increase of 49% over year 2000. The trend is continuing with relatively modest growth forecast for this year and next. However, in relative terms, unemployment is still low and the indications are that we will still have a need for both skilled and  unskilled labour from overseas in the years immediately ahead.In 1999, 6,000 work permits were issued in respect of workers from outside the European Economic Area, a record at that time. By 2002, this figure exceeded 40,000. Persons coming here to work on foot of work permits are fully compliant with our immigration requirements and are made welcome in their places of employment and their new communities. Much of this labour migration is of a temporary nature and is consistent with the broader pattern of intra-European labour migration. In future, we should be able to meet the great bulk of our economic immigration needs from within the enlarged European Union. However, we should also be able to attract particularly skilled personnel from the wider world.The Government has decided that Ireland's national measures for the transitional period will be to grant full access to the labour market to nationals of the newly acceded member states from the date of accession, May, 2004. There are a number of reasons for this. First, and arguably most importantly, this will send a strong and unambiguous signal to the new member states that we intend to show solidarity and promote their integration into the Union from the outset. We intend that this should set the tone for longer term relations with these countries.There is no reason to believe that there will be a large flow of labour migration to Ireland from these states after accession, and experience to date supports this view. Previous enlargements of the European Union were accompanied by fears of a flood of nationals of the new member states entering the Union, which never materialised. The many studies carried out in this area in recent years do not support the argument that there will be large, disruptive flows to the labour markets of most existing member states.If we choose to restrict access to the labour market by continuing the need for employment permits, these new member states could well feel let down given the relatively healthy state of our labour market. This would be contrasted with the positions adopted by the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Spain, Greece and the United Kingdom, with which we share a common travel area, which will all apply full freedom of movement for work.Economic migration to Ireland from the accession states has been very positive in recent years. Personnel from these countries accounted for about 35% or 13,752 of work permits issued in 2002, of which 33% were renewals. While there is clearly a high rate of turnover in personnel, anecdotal evidence suggests that personnel from the accession countries are generally highly regarded by employers because of a strong work ethic and reliability.The Bill contains a provision that allows for a possible re-introduction of a need for employment permits if there should be a labour market shock warranting such measures. The presence of this clause in no way means that I have a pessi mistic assessment of our economic prospects over the coming years or that I expect an unmanageable influx of migrant workers from the new member states. It is, however, a prudent measure as we move into a new phase in EU enlargement and an uncertain economic climate. Not to avail of the option of a safeguard measure would mean that Irish domestic legislation was more liberal than the treaties governing the European Communities in respect of the freedom of movement of EU workers. It would also run counter to assurances given by the Government in the context of the second referendum on the Nice treaty. Other member states have also indicated that they will avail of safeguard measures allowed by the accession treaty.This legislation is a necessary instrument to give effect to the core policy decisions in this area. At present, the employment permit system is run on foot of an order under Article 4 of the Aliens Order 1946. The Government's legal advice is that this would not provide a sufficiently robust statutory basis for introducing the measures contained in the Bill. Any legislation to underpin the national measures we propose to introduce for the transitional period must be enacted before 16 April 2003, the date for signing the accession treaty. Otherwise, there is a danger that such measures might be held to constitute a more restrictive regime than was in place at the time of the signing of the treaty. This would be contrary to the provisions of the accession treaty. This is the reason the Bill is being put to the House at this time and it is in the public interest that it be enacted before 16 April.With this Bill I am taking the opportunity to put the employment permit system on a solid statutory footing. Section 2 was first introduced as an amendment to the Immigration Bill 2002, introduced in Seanad Éireann by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, late last year. The introduction of that provision was intended to remedy a basic defect in existing law, that is, the absence of a specific offence and related penalty that can be applied to an employer who knowingly employs a person not entitled to work in the State without an employment permit. However, as it is proposed that this Bill will be enacted before the Immigration Bill 2002, I am taking the opportunity to include this section in the Bill before us. It will subsequently be deleted from the Immigration Bill 2002. This gives greater coherence to the proposed measures.We have in recent years experienced what many other developed countries of the western world have already undergone: a growth in illegal economic migration. While the majority of employers and employees abide by all the rules and regulations of the employment permit schemes in place, there are individuals who do not operate within the confines of the law and who look to take the easy option wherever possible.The Bill states explicitly the requirement for an  employment permit where it is proposed to employ a non-EEA national and creates a criminal offence for both an employee and an employer where a contract of employment is entered into without such a permit. It has long been a source of concern that there is a great legal imbalance between employer and employee when it comes to the law on the employment of non-nationals. No right-thinking person can agree that it is fair that it is an offence for the non-national, in general, to be in employment without an employment permit while the employer can take such staff on with impunity. It is also unacceptable that some unscrupulous employers should be able to gain an economic advantage over compliant employers through illegal employment. The provisions contained in the Bill redress the existing imbalance. They send a clear message to employers, in particular, that exploitative activity of this nature is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.Work is continuing on preparing the more comprehensive employment permit legislation agreed by the Government last year and I intend that the legislation will be published shortly after Easter. The current proposals are in no way a substitute for that Bill.Regarding the provisions of the Bill, section 2 contains almost exactly the same provisions as sections 4 and 5 of the Immigration Bill 2003. Subsection (1) simply restates the present law, at Article 4(1) of the Aliens Order 1946, to be revoked by subsection (12) of this section, making it an offence for a non-national to take up or be in employment in the State in the absence of an employment permit issued by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. This reflects a key principle underpinning the economic migration regime in Ireland, that permission for non-EEA personnel to work in this State is a concession granted by the State rather than a right.This restriction does not apply to all non-EEA nationals. Section 2(10) lists the categories of non-nationals who are exempt from this requirement. These categories are: recognised refugees and members of their families who have been admitted to the State to join them; programme refugees admitted under section 24 of the Refugee Act; current EU nationals, nationals of the three additional countries of the European economic area – Norwegians, Icelanders and citizens of Liechtenstein – and Swiss nationals, all of whom are entitled to participate in the Irish labour market by virtue of membership of the EU or other international agreements; and other non-nationals whose permission to remain in the State includes a condition that they may work without an employment permit. The last category includes, but is not limited to, those who, though not refugees, have been given permission to remain in the State for reasons of a humanitarian nature.Section 2(3) is a new provision which creates a specific offence for an employer to enter into an employment contract in the absence of the neces sary employment permit. Until now, it has been an offence only for an employee to take up employment without such a permit, which has been a source of concern to me for some time. I am satisfied that it is right that we should take this legislative opportunity to redress the imbalance that has hitherto existedA measure of the relative degree of wrongdoing on either side of the contractual relationship between employer and non-national employee in such cases can be seen in section 2(3), which specifies the punishments. The lesser offence lies with the employee but it constitutes an offence nonetheless. The employer offence, on the other hand, can be prosecuted either as a summary offence or in the Circuit Court on indictment. If prosecuted on indictment, an employer may be fined up to €250,000 and may in addition face a prison sentence of up to ten years.The effect of the defence set out in section 2(4) is to place an onus on all employers, before they take on an employee, to carry out reasonably thorough checks to satisfy themselves either that the prospective employee, if a non-national, does not require an employment permit or that a permit has been obtained.The fact that employing non-nationals without an employment permit is to be a serious criminal offence makes it necessary to ensure that sufficient powers exist to enable such offences to be identified and detected. Accordingly, subsections (5) to (9) of this new section provide powers for a garda to search premises, by warrant of the District Court if necessary, to punish the obstruction of such searches and to arrest an obstructer without a warrant.Section 2(11), which specifies that, in the case where a requirement for employment permits is re-introduced for nationals of the new EU member states, preference shall be given to applications in respect of such nationals over applications in respect of third country nationals. This is in line with the accession treaty, which obliges current member states to operate any transitional measures they may have in place on a "Community preference" basis.Let us now move to section 3, which contains provisions specifically relating to the accession states. Subsection (1) exempts nationals from the accession states from the need to obtain an employment permit to work in the State. It states that countries that become member states of the EU after this Act is passed, yet who are not immediately granted freedom of access to the labour market in the treaty of accession concerned, will be granted full access to the Irish labour market. This will effectively exempt the eight accession states to whom transitional arrangements apply from the need for employment permits. As there is no transitional measure in relation to Malta and Cyprus, they will already be exempt from this requirement under section 2(I0)(c) of this Act.Subsection (3) provides that if the labour mar ket is experiencing, or is likely to experience, a disturbance, the Minister may make an order providing that section 2 shall apply to some or all the accession states, meaning that nationals of these states will require employment permits to take up employment. It is simply there as a "safeguard" in the case of an unexpected shock to the domestic labour market. This requirement would only apply during the transition period and would cease to be valid once the full acquis on freedom of movement applies to these states.Subsection (4) provides that in the event of a re-imposition of a requirement for employment permits for these new member states, at a date after accession citizens from these states already in employment in Ireland would not be covered by this requirement. This should ensure that such persons would not be at risk of losing their jobs in such circumstances. To avoid the possibility of tactically dated employment contracts designed to avoid re-imposed regulations in such circumstances, a six-week working period prior to the re-imposition is considered appropriate.I trust that my remarks will have conveyed the important public policy goals to be attained by enacting the Bill before the Dáil and the unusual urgency attaching to the legislative timetable in this matter. It is with the greatest reluctance that the Government has had to introduce these proposals at this late stage but legal advice is that this is the prudent approach. I commend the proposals to the House.

#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	226	This Bill which grants full labour market access to the citizens of EU accession states from 4 May 2004, the date on which accession occurs, must be welcomed. Allowing citizens of new EU member states to live and work in Ireland from the day of their accession without the need for employment permits is a practical and pragmatic move which fully complies with EU commitments and obligations. This legislation will create a firm legislative basis for accession state workers but it must also be our hope that it will create significant opportunities for Ireland to forge new relationships with the accession states.The benefits of this legislation for Ireland's business and enterprise sector will be important also. It must be hoped that this legislation will reduce labour shortages in crucial areas of the labour market. Ireland's increased prosperity in recent years has made it essential that immigrant labour into this State is encouraged.This crucial labour need has certainly been reflected in the growth of the work permit scheme. The number of applicants availing of the work permit scheme has increased from 3,617 in  1994 to 40,321 in 2002. It is also evident that the work permit scheme is benefiting key sectors in the Irish labour market.In 2002, over 6,000 permits were issued for the agricultural, horticultural and fisheries sectors, the majority of which were for the eight accession states of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, and Slovakia. Nationals from these eight states currently hold about 35% or 13,752 of all work permits in Ireland.This legislation will ease many of the difficulties, from an administrative perspective and from the point of view of the employee, that have occurred in the past due to the inflow into Ireland of citizens from accession states. Instead accession state workers will now enjoy the same opportunities and benefits when seeking work in Ireland as citizens from existing EU member states.From an employer's viewpoint it will ease many of the chronic staff shortages experienced by several industries, particularly those I mentioned, agriculture, horticulture and fisheries. Indeed, a continued pattern of inward migration into Ireland must be fostered given our ageing population and the need to maintain the current ratio of active to retired persons in our community. This is currently estimated at five active workers for every one retired person. However, while this legislation is a necessary step in the right direction it is only a piecemeal step and the broader issue of immigration and labour market needs in Ireland in the longer term must still be adequately addressed by the Government.The fact remains that Ireland does not yet have a comprehensive immigrant policy. The Government has persistently displayed a lack of urgency and determination to advance a cohesive and coherent immigration policy, which is of itself a central plank of public policy in Ireland. The employer body IBEC shares this urgent need for immigration planning. As I mentioned earlier, the Irish population is an ageing one. For example, in 2000 there were 74,000 18 year olds, but by 2012, this figure will have fallen to 45,000. Additionally, it is also accepted that female participation in the labour market may not significantly expand in the future, given that Ireland now exceeds the level of female participation in the workforce in several age groups. What such figures suggest to me is that there is a glaringly obvious need to formulate immigration policy to account for these trends. It is imperative that Ireland prepares for the long-term. This is particularly urgent if we are to maintain our competitiveness and remain an attractive location for inward investment and enterprise.FÁS, in its labour market review for 2002, supports such a view. It predicts that the medium-term economic outlook for Ireland is positive. FÁS estimates an increase in employment of approximately 190,000 or 10% over the six years to 2007. However, the Tánaiste and the current Government have frequently moved to limit the  number of work permits available to non-EEA state workers. Clearly, this move suggests a knee-jerk reaction by the Government, a crisis management approach and a neglect of the longer-term needs of the labour market.While this legislation will clearly allow for a smoother transition into the workplace for migrant workers from accession states, I am far from assured that such a smooth transition can be assured for non-EEA workers, who comprise the remaining 65% of work permit holders.It must be acknowledged that at long last legislation has come before the House to remedy the unbalanced situation which let the employee working without a legal work permit bear the burden of legal penalties. It is a positive development that the burden for the employment of illegal workers is now placed on the employer, who faces a fine of up to a maximum of €250,000 or ten years imprisonment for violation of employment legislation. Welcome though these penalties are, I believe this legislation does not address the inadequacies of the work permit system as it currently operates.Delays in the system of processing of work permits, which can take up to 12 weeks, are stifling our industry's competitive edge. This is a concern, particularly in sectors such as agriculture and horticulture which remain heavily reliant on migrant workers. These sectors are seasonal and the availability of workers is time critical. The Small Firms Association has publicly stated that employers want an efficient application system with an administrative turnaround time of one week. This is the time scale which the Tánaiste insisted in October 2000 was a stated aim of her Department, but unfortunately it has not yet been realised.While such delays in the processing of work permits have a negative economic impact, the human aspect of this inefficiency is much more disturbing. Current delays are encouraging the growth of a black market in non-EEA nationals being recruited without going through the formal process. The Garda estimates that there are currently more than 10,000 immigrants working illegally in the Irish labour force. I am sure no one here needs to be reminded of the dangers of exploitation of workers which can result. This is a situation which needs to be tackled urgently by the Government.However, even for those who possess a legal work permit their experience can be equally negative. The current work permit scheme unjustly ties the migrant worker to one employer. Work permit holders do not enjoy the flexibility to change jobs within their employment sector and thus cannot move from one employer to another, should they so choose. This is an unfair system, which makes the employee over-reliant on the employer, to the extent that they cannot be more selective over issues such as pay and general working conditions. The current work permit system allows unscrupulous employers opportunities to abuse procedures and hire cheap lab our to work under often-scandalous conditions. The recent case of the exploitation of Ukrainian workers highlights this. Another example of this is the plight of Filipino women hired as "domestic helpers". They have encountered several infringements of their employment conditions. These have included illegal deductions from their wages, being expected to do work outside the terms of their original contract and being expected to work longer hours than that stipulated in the terms of their employment, and as I mentioned, these are but a few examples.For them, and for many countless others the work permits system has failed them. The scheme adds to the "behind-closed-doors" nature of the work. Their employers apply for and hold their permits, creating an imbalanced and potentially exploitative relationship between employer and employee. The situation faced by work permit holders contrasts extremely negatively with the superior rights enjoyed by those who hold work visas. They have the right to move from job to job within their profession. This imbalance between the rights of work permit holders and their work visa counterparts needs to be clearly assessed and, if necessary, altered to ensure a fairer system for migrant workers.While the main elements of this Bill are not in contention, Fine Gael supports these initiatives, which are pro-European enlargement and strongly pro-enterprise. Nonetheless, I am uneasy that this measure does not go far enough. I support the statutory safeguards put in place for accession state workers, but feel much ambiguity still surrounds the whole area of migrant employment legislation. What is needed is legislation to state more clearly the mutual rights and obligations, which exist between employer and non-national workers. Many migrant workers remain unclear as to their legal entitlements and rights. Once such rights and obligations are clearly defined both parties are aware of their rights, and protections become more entrenched, thus reducing the potential threat of exploitation.In a wider perspective, my belief is that what is also urgently required is a more coherent and effective immigration policy, not last-minute, disjointed piecemeal legislation, which lacks foresight and planning in relation to Ireland's long-term migration needs, and sidelines the social protections which we must afford to those who choose to live and work in our State.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	227	I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this legislation. It is regrettable that we have to take all Stages on the one day. During the Order of Business the Tánaiste said she regretted that also. It is not good enough that just because we are trying to meet a deadline we are rushing Bills through the House. This should have come before the House at an earlier date and we should have had an opportunity to consider, over a decent period, the need for amendments between Second Stage and Committee Stage, and, indeed, Report Stage. That being said,  as Deputy Murphy has said, we strongly support the principle of the Bill.The main purpose of the Bill is to facilitate the granting of free access to the Irish labour market to nationals of EU accession states with effect from May 2004. Surely it makes sense that from the date of accession, nationals of new member states would no longer require work permits to be employed in Ireland. Although I do not expect we will have to use it, a safeguard is also being introduced in this legislation, which is prudent, in section 3(3) whereby during the transitional period, which is up to seven years, a requirement for employment purposes can be re-introduced in respect of nationals of the relevant countries should the Irish economy or Irish labour market suffer an unexpected disturbance after EU enlargement; in other words, if Ireland cannot cope with the numbers of people seeking employment here from the relevant countries and if it has a serious adverse effect on the economy.The accession countries concerned are the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia. At a later stage during the debate will the Minister provide some clarity on Malta? Is there a special case in relation to Malta or is it so small that we have forgotten it?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	228	Because they are so small, Malta and Cyprus have the right to come in.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	229	That is what I suspected but it is important to have it on the record. The population of the new member states is approximately 100 million. It is essential that a small country like Ireland – Ireland is used by many of these small countries as a model they wish to follow in relation to economic development and employment – sends all the positive signals that we are willing to open our gates and to welcome new members into the EU as well as welcoming them into the Irish economy.During the Nice treaty debate the argument was made by some that we would be overrun by eastern European nationals should enlargement proceed. For a start, they should not be considered eastern European, they are central European countries, primarily, at the heart of Europe and we should look at this as an opportunity rather than a threat to the Irish economy. There is no evidence to support the concern that we will be overrun by immigrants after enlargement. A number of surveys have been taken in applicant countries to establish whether people would be likely to move within Europe after enlargement. Surprisingly, the results appear to be that people are looking forward to the opportunity of improving their own economies rather than moving into others.It is the Irish experience once we have reached a position of prosperity, which many of these applicant countries will reach in a far shorter timescale than it has taken Ireland, that we now  have net immigration as opposed to emigration. In time to come, countries such as Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, in particular, which are similar in size and population to Ireland, will have net immigration as opposed to the other way around. We have a responsibility, as long as there is no serious negative impact on the Irish economy, to encourage that in any way we can.The only way to prevent the movement of people from east to west within Europe is to facilitate and assist in wealth creation in central and eastern European countries. That is what the whole enlargement project and the future of the EU project is about. This is the first test for Ireland to take action to back up the words stated by most of the larger parties in this House during the debate on the Nice treaty, while at the same time keeping a safeguard in place should there be an unexpected reaction following enlargement and in the event that the number of workers is such that we cannot cope as a relatively small economy.We should regard this legislation as offering the Irish economy an opportunity rather than posing a threat. It offers an opportunity to develop a positive working and economic relationship with new applicant countries. There seems to be a view, for whatever reason, that applicant countries are somewhat backward in their thinking, education and ability to develop as economies and that, as a result, their inhabitants will all want to come to Ireland for a more prosperous future. A different reality exists, especially in countries such as Slovenia. Anyone who has visited it will realise that its infrastructure is just as good as ours, if not better, and its education system is excellent, but that it has an unfortunate history in that it has been under the cloud of communism for so long, from which it is now emerging so quickly.The populations of countries like Slovenia will have massive opportunities within their own countries once the EU provides them with stable, peaceful and balanced economies in which to trade. We should be targeting the skills they can offer to our economy, particularly in the area of science, as opposed to seeing them as a potential threat. In certain scientific areas we can learn a lot from our central European neighbours.As Deputy Murphy has pointed out, there are some areas in which there are real skills shortages. I recall a very practical example of this. In the past fortnight a baker in Carrigaline in my constituency contacted my office and said he has been trying for six months to employ people with the necessary skills he insists upon to work in his small-scale bakery. He wanted two bakers from Lithuania to come here. Unfortunately, they are still in the process of obtaining work permits and will be for quite some time. Evidence that applicant countries, which are soon to be member states of the EU, can offer us assistance in respect of economic development lies in the fact that the two bakers would now be working in Carrigaline in the heart of my constituency if this legislation  were in place. I look forward to the time when employers will be able to look to applicant countries for skills they cannot find here and invite workers here who will pay taxes and play their part in furthering the growth of our economy and standard of living.Is it not the case that it would be almost immoral to allow Irish companies and workers to set up and work in applicant countries and avail of the opportunities that obtain in those rapidly growing economies while at the same time suggesting that we should not allow workers from applicant countries to come here to work? That would be against the spirit of the entire EU project. Since Ireland is a net exporter, and massively so, I anticipate that Irish companies will be looking to applicant countries for opportunities on a purely commercial basis. To suggest that we would restrict or prevent access for the populations of the new member states to avail of opportunities here is unthinkable. Unless we have a dramatic reason to impose restrictions on access into Ireland, such as one in the national economic interest, I hope we will not be reintroducing restrictions or a work permit system during the seven year transition period.Like previous speakers, I welcome the fact that the Bill puts in place penalties for non-compliance with the employment permits system by employers and employees. If employers make the effort to apply for a work permit through the proper channels, this should be recognised. They should not be placed at a disadvantage in respect of their competitors, some of whom, if the legislation is not enforced, may well be employing workers through the black market. That is happening at the moment to a serious extent. Penalties must be put in place to deal with those abusing the system. Otherwise, nobody would bother making the effort to abide by the law and workers would continue to be abused. Employers, who are effectively breaking the rules and the law, would continue to have a competitive advantage, which is unacceptable.The penalties are very serious, and rightly so. There is a penalty on employees of €3,000 or up to 12 months' imprisonment, or both. That balance seems to be right because the majority of employees working on the black market would not be able to afford to pay more than €3,000 anyway. It is a waste of time imposing large fines. The employers are being hit hard, which is sending out a tough but correct signal. The maximum fine is €250,000 or ten years' imprisonment, or both. This seems a little excessive for a person employing somebody on the black market, for example in a chip shop. Nevertheless, ten years is the maximum term in prison and we need to send out the right signals.I appeal to the Tánaiste to undertake an information campaign to target employers to make sure they are aware of this legislation. As Deputy Murphy said, there are up to 10,000 people working illegally without work permits. Many of them and their employers are probably aware that they  are breaking the rules but they are certainly not aware of the penalties. Before this legislation becomes law we need to get involved in an information campaign to let employers know what we are proposing.I have some concerns about the existing work permit process. It is taking between eight to 12 weeks for an application to be processed, which is not acceptable in a time of modern technology and IT developments.

It would be very welcome and maybe we should contact the employers organisations to try work through them to have an effective campaign. The campaign should not be political, but very practical.It is totally unacceptable that it takes between eight and 12 weeks to grant a work permit. Returning to my example of the Lithuanian bakers, the employer in question, although he is going through the work permit process, knows that the two bakers will be working somewhere else by the time the permits are issued, probably in two to three months' time. They are looking for work now. There needs to be a maximum turnover time of between five and ten days and there is no reason why we could not put a computerised system in place whereby applicants could apply for work permits over the Internet or by e-mail and have a response within a week. This surely makes sense.The delays in respect of work permit renewals are even more astonishing because the authorities already have the details on the persons concerned because they would have been obtained through the work permit application process in the first place. I have been told by the Department that renewals take the same length of time as work permit applications. A renewal takes eight weeks and, as a result, people are working here illegally. For example, if a person realises his work permit will expire in a month and applies for a renewal, which takes eight weeks, he is then stuck in limbo working illegally for up to a month while he is waiting for his renewal. We are talking about putting in fines of €3,000 for the worker and possibly €125,000 for the employer. That position is not sustainable. The renewal process must happen in two to three days. There is no reason it should not.To facilitate both of those concerns there needs to be a hot line into the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment so that TDs, Senators and public representatives can make a special case that can get priority treatment for the kind of seasonal work, for example, about which Deputy Murphy spoke. If a fish farmer, for example, who will harvest in ten days time, needs people to help him and is in a rush to do it, it is a waste of time to tell that person an application will take eight weeks because he will not need workers in eight weeks time.The final point Deputy Murphy made is the most important one. We need a co-ordinated and comprehensive immigration policy to deal with asylum seekers, refugees, work permits, students and holiday visas. People need to be itemised because at the moment the whole system is a mess. We need a more comprehensive and detailed policy to deal with each itemised area.

It is extraordinary that this legislation is coming in to replace a regulation under article 4 of the Aliens Order of 1946.

I have asked the Tánaiste many times to come forward with this kind of legislation. She will remember that just a few weeks ago I was the first Deputy to raise the horrendous treatment of 130 Ukrainian workers who were lured here and left almost penniless and homeless until some helpful Irish citizens brought the situation to my attention.It is also extraordinary that the central part of the Bill is replacing section 4 of the Immigration Bill 2002, which was recently before the Oireachtas.Deputy Coveney is right. The reason we are rushing today is because we have a deadline of 16 April. If this legislation is not on the stocks we will not be able to change the regime, as section 3 attempts to do, in the case of a disturbance in the labour market. There is now a whole series of efforts at rushing at the last minute to make up for the failure of the Minister to address this legislation. When work permits escalated between 2000 and 2001 – they doubled from 18,000 to 36,000 – why did the Minister not come in with her comprehensive Bill then? She told me a few weeks ago she was expecting the Bill towards the end of 2003. Now I understand the Department is saying we will have it in a few weeks time, before Easter. I mean the main works permit Bill and not the simple Bill for the ten countries before us today. I hope that is the case.The Labour Party has grave reservations about many aspects of this Bill and we will seek, in the brief time available to us to raise what we feel are critical issues. It is dreadful that the debate on this Bill is being guillotined to conclude at 7.30 p.m. this evening. The conservative parties – Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats and, at times, Fine Gael – seem to be where employers tend to go in this regard while the exploited and  maltreated workers like the Ukrainian workers tend to come to the Labour Party to put their side of the case about the lack of a system.The Labour Party believes the work permit system should apply to the workers and not to employers. In modern Ireland there should not be some form of indentured labour or bonded serfdom, which is a medieval concept. Particularly in terms of the ten new countries, the permit should apply to the workers, many of whom leave poignant messages on websites looking for work in this country and hoping they will be picked up by an Irish employer. We would like to end that system. The Tánaiste has not done so in the Bill. The workers should get the fundamental rights, as my colleagues in SIPTU have said and my party leader has said again and again, in their own names and not through employers who, unfortunately in a minority of cases, have grossly exploited them.I am amazed that the Minister has not, in section 2, tried to address the issue of rogue agencies. It was her own officials, two or three years ago when she was putting a Bill through and I was trying to give some helpful comments on worker protection legislation, who told me that in the mid-1990s we had something like two agencies bringing workers from outside the EEA area. Within a couple of years the number exploded to 600. Obviously, some were reputable agencies but there was also a number of cowboys and gangsters who were prepared to manipulate workers. Again, it is pretty outrageous that the recruitment agencies are not included here for penalties and sanctions under section 2 of the Bill. As in the case of the, so called, Vittor agency in Kiev and whatever operation it was trying to run through Ireland, there should be some way to strike at those who have maltreated workers coming into this country.In the Labour Party we also believe that when employers and workers have taken reasonable steps to get, for example, a renewal of a work permit, there should be a system of appeal through the Department. I hope it will be in the Tánaiste's major Bill. I know, from our civil service colleagues, that the Department is very hard pressed with a very small staff looking after, last year, 40,000 successful applications, not to mind the unsuccessful ones. I wonder should we have some structured appeal system.The other aspect of the Bill, in section 3 which I will come back to briefly, is the whole issue of disturbance in the labour market. Should the Minister not have spelt that out in some sort of detail? Should there not be some sort of trigger mechanisms, particularly in certain areas of the economy, when, for example, there is a massive growth in unemployment? I will draw attention later in my brief contribution to disadvantaged areas, such as those in the Tánaiste's constituency and mine, where unemployment among the least skilled is rising steadily and the substitution effect may operate. I know the Tánaiste has referred to  that in her speech and has tried to address it but it could have been spelt out a little bit more.They are our chief concerns to which I shall return. On behalf of my party, I warmly welcome the entry of the eight new central and eastern European countries – the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovenia – to full accession on 1 May 2004. I realise that Malta and Cyprus have their arrangements through the accession treaties. I warmly welcome those eight countries to the treatment they will now receive under section 3, by which their nationals will not require work permits in the transitional seven year period.During the Seanad debate on the Bill, I noted that many speakers, particularly from the Fianna Fáil Party, referred to the fears which were stirred up during the "No" campaign in the debate on the Nice treaty, particularly the very unwise comments of Mr. Anthony Coughlan in regard to workers from these countries. The real issues for those who had genuine concerns about the referendum on the Nice treaty was the governance of the EU rather than its future economic arrangements. All these states, with the exception of Poland, and possibly the Czech Republic, tend to have populations and territories approximating to our own. We are very much admired in many of the accession states which wish to emulate what they see as the Irish economic miracle that was promoted and assisted by the European Union. Eight of these countries are former socialist regimes which have a remarkably high standard of physical infrastructure. I noticed that the railway strategy was published this morning but I have not had a chance to look at it yet.

Light rail still does not exist in the Tánaiste's constituency – it is only beginning to be introduced there. There is a major contrast here. Nonetheless, with the doubling of our gross domestic product over the past decade as we have caught up with our EU partners we have become a great magnet for workers from the accession states and beyond the EEA area.The Tánaiste noted that a third of the work permits currently issued are held by nationals from the accession states. Of the 2002 figures of 40,000 permits, almost 8,000, 20%, came from two of these states alone – Latvia and Lithuania, on a roughly 50:50 basis. Poland produced another  3,000 of these workers while the bulk of the remainder came from the Czech Republic, Estonia and Slovakia. A less significant number came from Hungary and there were only 13 work permits issued to Slovenians, as referred to by a previous speaker. We have very substantial inflows of labour. Concerns have been discussed, particularly in the lead-up to the two referenda on the Nice treaty, about the economic impact, including on migration, of the accession of these ten countries. I read a very impressive study by Dr. Frank Barry of UCD in which he estimated that trade between Ireland and what he calls the CEE ten, the central and east European accession states, will double in the coming years. Many other economists also support the notion of there being massive trade opportunities. We currently run a trade surplus with all of these countries except Hungary, which seems to have an interesting niche in our high-tech and IT market.The point was made that we will have concerns about foreign direct investment, particularly in regard to our lack of physical infrastructure, given that the accession countries appear to be ahead of us in this area and they are in a more central position in Europe while we are in a peripheral one. On the other hand, we have a good education system, as my Fine Gael colleague noted. However, with current labour costs much lower in those countries we have to be concerned about the general direction of the economy in the future.I agree with Professor John FitzGerald of the ESRI that the absolute requirement is to put massive resources into infrastructure, particularly the broadband network. I have responsibility for this area within my party as it comes under my remit as spokesperson for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. We must put the resources into this area. The ludicrous exchange of letters that we had recently between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Transport should be a thing of the past.As the Tánaiste and Minster for Enterprise, Trade and Employment said in regard to migration, the evidence from previous migrations, particularly in respect to Spain, Portugal and Greece is that there were no major outflows. It has been said, perhaps rightly, that both Germany and Austria will have real concerns about labour market instability. While migrants from the ten accession countries already constitute 0.7% of the Irish population, their impact on the labour market will depend on the level of skills.As I already said, section 3 (3) gives the Minister power to intervene if the labour market is experiencing, or is likely to experience, a disturbance. The possibility exists of re-introducing work permits for citizens of the ten – or perhaps eight of them – in the transitional seven years. That area is not spelled out and perhaps the Minister might return to it in her final contribution. We face a deadline of April 16 but the Bill does not really indicate what would constitute a disturbance. A serious downturn could occur in the  economy following a major external shock, such as that resulting from the current war in Iraq.In the Seanad, the Minister noted that our current level of unemployment is 4.5% compared with the EU 7.9%. Despite the massive expansion of the labour force to 1.85 million, she indicated that there are still labour shortages. She admitted today that there is a worrying level of redundancies – over 25,000 in 2002, which is the highest in nearly 15 years. My own north side region of Dublin has been devastated by a series of closures in the IT sector since the summer of 2000. The collapse of Gateway in 2000 was the first shock to the north side although a large part of its work force was composed of migrant workers. Tomorrow, a small but highly skilled company called SaRonix Ireland Limited, which makes oscillators, will close. This company employed up to 200 workers. I am not sure if the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is even aware of this. The company has been run down over the past year and a half.Disadvantaged areas with early school leaving and grave social difficulties where there have been huge community efforts at job creation and re-generation may well be placed in difficulty by the expansion of the labour market to the accession countries. The Minister recently visited the Northside Partnership where we targeted four areas of unemployed citizens – Travellers, people with disabilities, ex-offenders and recovering drug mis-users. This programme depends on the support of local employers and it may become more difficult to place people.I welcomed the last review of labour market policy in Ireland by FÁS. It's director general, Roddy Molloy, rightly indicated that it was necessary to insist that the local employment service database and that of FÁS be accessed first by employers, particularly in disadvantaged areas – especially for less-skilled workers. The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment confirmed that change of policy in January of this year and reiterated the point that work permits must be designed to meet the demand for labour in circumstances where appropriate skills are unavailable locally.She also referred to our future obligations as a member of the EU where we will have to give preference to EU members. That is one of the key effects of section 3. There is currently a major influx of migrant workers from several of the accession states to Ireland, especially Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Czech Republic and Estonia. Given the happy prospect of full accession from 1 May 2004 and the original fundamental economic aims of the European communities there is a clear obligation on the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which the Minister clearly recognises, to give priority to migrant workers from these future partners. In many respects, aside from infrastructure, the stage of development these countries are at is analogous to our situation between the 1950s  and the 1980s, when we had massive outflows of workers, especially to the UK and the US.The up-to-date work permit statistics show that significant numbers of workers have migrated here from countries outside the EEA. The 40,000 permits issued in 2002 included workers from countries such as Bangladesh, Brazil, Bulgaria, China, India, Malaysia, Moldova, Pakistan and the Ukraine. An amazing 3,255 workers arrived from the Philippines, 2,459 from Romania and more than 2,000 from both Russia and South Africa. Section 2 of the Bill will apply to these and all other non-EEA workers. In that sense, this legislation is long overdue and still far from comprehensive.There is a basic and fundamental distinction between migrants who come here to work, who will for the first time be subject to serious penalties under primary legislation, and migrants who come here to establish a business. The latter category does not seem to be referred to in primary legislation, and we all remember the bizarre passports-for-sale scam of the Haughey-Reynolds era, whereby rich people were sold Irish passports on the basis of sometimes spurious business investments. Romania and Bulgaria are well on the way to joining the EU, possibly as early as 2007. The pre-negotiating stage of Turkey's entry, if it is ever to proceed, must get under way by the same date, depending, of course, upon Turkey's future democratic development and its treatment of the Kurdish nation. I hope, amid the very sad days we are enduring in the Middle East, that one of the effects of all the bloodshed and suffering will be, at long last, an autonomous Kurdish state for a historic people who have been very badly treated, especially by Turkey and Iraq, since the Treaty of Versailles in 1919.Given the figures listed earlier and our growing familiarity in the past few years with Romanian workers in particular, the entry of Romania and Bulgaria to the EU will probably accentuate the issues I have outlined, particularly in relation to the sourcing of non-skilled workers outside the EEA. Section 3(3), which deals with future trends, may have to be developed in the context of further accession negotiations and the transition periods of these two southern European states.Turning to section 2, grave concerns have been raised in this House and the media over the past four and a half years about the treatment of migrant workers, especially those from outside the EEA. These concerns often relate to recruitment agencies as well as unscrupulous and even criminal employers. For that reason, I welcome the moves in section 2(2) and (3) to at last impose serious sanctions on such employers. I will try to amend the Bill, if the Minister consents, to include reference to unscrupulous agencies. My colleague in the Seanad, Senator Tuffy, felt that some of these penalties on indictment were draconian, and I have some sympathy with that view. However, given the reports we have received from some maltreated migrant workers, very  serious penalties are clearly necessary for rogue employers and agencies.The most important defect in the Bill is the complete lack of reference to recruitment agencies both here and abroad, and I hope this will be addressed by the Minister in her long-awaited main permits Bill. There is no reason the mushrooming and growth of these agencies should not be examined and regulated in this legislation. A brief Internet search using the key words "work in Ireland" throws up a huge plethora of websites around Europe and beyond. While many of these, such as the FÁS site or nixers.com may well be reputable agencies, there are appalling stories of grave injustice and serious abuse of workers.I think I was the first Member of the House, about three weeks ago, to raise with the Minister and the Taoiseach the disgraceful treatment of more than 100 Ukrainian workers – I have copies of the passports of a number of these people before me. They were brought here by a Mr. Victor Malyuga from Kiev and his Vittor agency. The group that approached me had paid this agency between $1,500 and $3,500. Of course, when they arrived in Ireland and turned up on the doorsteps of companies to begin work, companies had never heard of them or their so-called work permits. This situation has received media attention in recent days, particularly in The Irish Times, and I hope that the Minister and her two colleagues, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Foreign Affairs will try to remedy the suffering of these workers.The Minister may remember that in October 2002, I also highlighted the disgraceful treatment of a group of Brazilian cleaners, three of whom were awarded €50,000 in the High Court. At the time, they had complained to the Minister's Department, but when she was questioned in the media she was unaware of this, so I had to remind her that these workers had made a complaint. They were left penniless and without food, working 15 hours per day in desperate circumstances by a certain rogue employer. Obviously, this is not the only such case. There are many other cases of abuse of workers. My colleague, Deputy McManus, for example, drew attention to the appalling living conditions for Filipino nurses in 2001. Another colleague, Deputy Stagg, drew attention to the six-day imprisonment of 19 Moldovan workers in Mountjoy. These people became unemployed through no fault of their own because of the downturn in the beef market as a result of BSE cases. They were left without legitimate work permits.My party leader, Deputy Rabbitte, highlighted the ludicrous Operation Hyphen a few months ago, when 300 gardaí were allocated on one day to track down three mushroom-picking workers in County Monaghan. In late 2002, Niall Crowley and the Equality Authority informed us that immigrant live-in nannies and domestic workers from countries such as the Philippines and Malaysia are not covered by our workplace equality legislation. If that is still the case, I urge the Mini ster to bring the matter to the attention of her Government colleagues and see what can be done. Mr. Crowley and his highly efficient Equality Authority said that there is an exemption in the Employment Equality Act 1998 for people employed in domestic service. Mr. Crowley also maintained that there is anecdotal evidence of high levels of exploitation among these domestic workers in terms of excessive hours, low pay and lack of decent conditions.The disgraceful role of some of these recruitment agencies was highlighted a few weeks ago when we read the appalling account of an agency called PC Recruitment, owned by a Mr. Patrick Coyle, which was offering Nepalese workers to Irish meat companies on the basis that the Nepalese "are shy and do not cause trouble" and that they would "be thrilled to earn the Irish minimum wage."  The general secretary of the ICTU, Mr. David Begg, rightly described this as very disturbing. I commend the Minister and her Department for acting swiftly upon media reports of that disgraceful gentleman and his company.My colleagues in the trade union movement have played a very honourable role in drawing attention to the abuse of migrant workers by agencies and rogue employers. I particularly commend SIPTU and one of its officials, Mr. Mike Jennings, for drawing attention to the whole situation of groups of workers whom he characterised as being almost like bonded serfs, unreasonably and unjustifiably tied to one employer because the work permit system operates through the employer. I know the Minister will tell us later of the clear view of her Department that employers should hold permits, but given the cases identified by Mr. Jennings and SIPTU and brought to my attention and that of other Labour Party Deputies, this is an issue the Minister should address again in a fundamental way in the main work permit legislation. As I said, many cases of abuse of workers have been highlighted where accommodation and food costs and even fares are deducted from wages leaving workers in very vulnerable positions and in conditions which most Irish workers would not tolerate or consider just. The Bill should have included an attempt to address this fundamental injustice. When one considers the other major inconsistencies in the present regime for migrant workers, the injustice of working solely through employers becomes clear.The work authorisation visa applies to highly skilled workers. However, the intra-corporate transfer, which was used a lot by information technology companies in the past, has been suspended. There was also, of course, the van der Elst case workers. I saw men working in my constituency recently who, I presume, were working for a foreign subcontractor. This is a concern in Germany, in particular. If a worker is working for a foreign subcontractor, the work permit system does not apply to them under the van der Elst legislation. Another group of workers on which people comment are non-EEA students who may  work up to 20 hours per week. There is anecdotal evidence that some of the young workers in the black economy come from this group and that there is an abuse of the student system.I welcome this Bill and I warmly welcome our ten sister countries and their workers into the European Union next summer. I note what the Tánaiste has done in section 3. My party believes that a permit should be in the worker's name. We should have acted on the problem of agencies and we should look at the level of penalties. The Tánaiste should spell out more clearly what "disturbance" means. The Tánaiste addressed the substitution area today and I commend her on so doing but we need to keep it under close review, particularly for our lowest skilled workers in disadvantaged areas of our cities and in rural areas, in the context of the management of our labour market in the future and the likelihood that the bulk of migrants to this country will come from 25 or perhaps 27 countries.

Reading the Bill, it is interesting to reflect on how much has changed in a year. About a year ago our official position was that we were very much in favour of workers from the accession countries having open access to this country. I regret very much that during the Nice referendum campaign, that changed somewhat due to some of the poor and disreputable arguments used by the anti-treaty side. The Tánaiste seemed pressurised to include a clause where we would not be accepting of or open to the accession countries and I regretted that. I welcome that it has been somewhat opened again athough the inclusion of the caveat that it depends on our economic conditions, which I understand from our economic point of view, will be read by the accession countries as not necessarily a full and free welcome to them into the Union. That is regrettable. I very much welcome the ten countries into the Union and I welcome their workers into this country. We entered into a common market and a common Union in other ways as well where we provide each other's citizens with similar rights. While I understand our economic interest in possibly including a caveat, does it take some of the welcome away from those accession countries? Are we, to a certain extent, having our cake and eating it?I understand the economic arguments for including a caveat because I have profound fears  about the employment prospects for this country in future years. I fear the very dramatic increase in redundancies, which we have seen in the past two years, is likely to increase. I fear those jobs will not be replaced by the new jobs we were lucky to get in recent years. I fear we are facing a period of serious job losses and that we will have to use the caveat included the Bill.I have a slight fear that the 40,000 immigrant workers who came here in one year have, in a way, created a dangerous environment for Irish workers. I do not wish to turn away migrant workers but the problem facing our economy is that it is a high cost economy. By using large numbers of migrant workers, are we putting off the inevitable day when that high cost economy comes home to roost in terms of job losses? If at that stage we have to place restrictions on immigrant workers coming in, we will be left with the worst of both worlds. We will have an economy which will find it difficult to shift to become more competitive and we will not be able to take in migrant workers for, understandably, political reasons. We are facing very perilous times in that regard.I am concerned that legislation in this area is geared too much towards the needs of employers and not necessarily the needs of the employee, whether Irish or migrant. To take up the point made by Deputy Broughan, the permits should be issued to the employees. The current and the proposed situation where the employer holds the permit gives undue power or influence to the employer. It is important for reasons of negotiation and workers' rights that the employee is the permit holder.I regret very much that the main employment permit Bill, which is due after Easter, could not be introduced at the same time as this Bill. It would have made a considerable amount of sense when legislating for employment permits, to outline their nature. I find it hard to understand why the Department, which had a year to prepare the broader employment permits Bill, could not have brought it in with this Bill. It has been six months since the Nice referendum, so there has been a period of time within which it could have been done. I will be interested to hear why that was not possible or whether there is a particular reason. I am disappointed the two Bills were not brought in together for the efficiency of this House and for better debate on both Bills.In general, I do not have a problem with the provisions of this Bill. Some of the points Deputy Broughan made about bringing the agencies under control, giving the permit to the employee and giving employees and migrant workers access to the labour relations and employment appeals systems may well be contained in the forthcoming Bill but I would have preferred it if both Bills had been introduced at the same time so we could have had a proper debate. We would have been able to see the system we are setting up.If we face a difficult employment situation and have to restrict access to the accession countries,  will Irish workers be restricted in terms of their working rights to travel to Poland, Hungary or the other accession states? What will characterise our employment patterns over the next five to ten years will be a significant movement of employment to those countries which have a well educated workforce, like ourselves, better infrastructure, much lower access costs, because of their location, and which have lower communications, transport and other costs. In the next few years, we will see Irish and multinational employers moving their manufacturing and labour-orientated bases to those countries. In many cases, Irish employers will look for work permits for their businesses in Hungary, Poland and in other countries. That is something we cannot stop if we are part of this broader common market. That is the way things will go. Will we see a strange turnaround where we are looking for permits from those states?The world has changed hugely in the past year. We face precarious and difficult times. The European Union has been riven. Prior to the Gulf War, no one could have predicted the breakdown in the concept of or confidence in where Europe was going. In those circumstances, it is hard to know what the real effect of this Bill or what the migration patterns will be. I welcome the Bill.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	243	I would like to record my concern that employment permit legislation is being dealt with in stages. I particularly refer to the comments of the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, in the Seanad last week where he said that work was continuing on more comprehensive employment legislation and that a further Bill on this issue would be published after Easter. I would appreciate clarification of the Minister's comments to the Seanad to identify why this was not brought together.I welcome the introduction of the Employment Permits Bill although I have reservations regarding some elements contained in it. The Bill is necessitated by the current direction of the EU and arises from the creation of a two-tier Europe in which accession states are not accorded the same rights and freedoms from the time of accession as states which have joined the EU to date.I welcome the fact that this Bill will facilitate citizens of the accession states who wish to work in Ireland. Contrary to what has been reported in some media, there is no evidence that there will be a flood of immigrants into Ireland following the accession of these countries. I hope the welcome which this Bill has received in the Houses of the Oireachtas will be reflected in the treatment of migrant workers from these countries when they come to Ireland.Sinn Féin believes in a progressive immigration and asylum policy. There must be clear recognit ion of the importance of a positive immigration policy which will help to enrich this country economically, culturally and socially. We need to emphasise the positive aspects of immigration and recognise the huge richness to be gained from multiculturalism. The question of how we allocate work permits or immigration visas to accommodate both humanitarian and economic objectives must be tackled. We must develop positive criteria for immigration such as a points based system similar to that which exists in other countries. The multidimensional aspects of skills can be combined into a single index for issuing work permits by a points system. Points might be awarded, for example, for each level of schooling completed or for apprenticeship training, vocational training or relevant job training.I point out to the Minister that the director general of FÁS, Mr. Rody Molloy, is also of the belief, as was mentioned earlier in this debate, that there is a need for immigration and work permit procedures. He stated in The Irish Times of 28 March: “There would seem to be a need to move to a new system based on nationally identified occupation or skill linked immigration needs or procedures”. I welcome the fact that this will end the anomaly whereby it is not an offence for an employer to hire immigrants who do not have the necessary employment permits even though it is an offence for the workers in such cases. This was particularly inconsistent as it was the employer who was granted the work permit, and that will be the case even with regard to the Bill before us. Because of this, employers faced no penalties if they did not renew permits for their employees and they were able to act with virtual immunity.Many cases have been reported where employers have either forgotten or simply not bothered to renew permits. Such actions by employers undermines the legal status of immigrant workers. In many of the cases dealt with by the Migrant Information Centre in Dublin, employers did not tell workers that they did not renew their permits. Workers found that their permits had expired, that they were illegal and could face deportation. Introducing penalties for employers who break the law will, I hope, go some way towards discouraging this type of behaviour by employers.There is one particular deficiency in the Bill which I would like to address and which I will seek to amend on Committee Stage. I refer to the failure of the Bill to address the current situation where employers hold the permits, thus allowing what is nothing less than medieval bonded serfdom to continue. The problems which arise as a result of this have been clearly illustrated in recent days with the case of the 100 Ukrainian migrant workers who came to Ireland under the impression that they were in possession of genuine work permits. These permits had been accepted by the Irish authorities but turned out to be false. These workers are now facing deportation. This would not have occurred if the work  permits were held by the workers instead of the employers. If we do not address this issue, criminals will continue to exploit the vulnerability of workers due to the inadequacy of the current legislation.Another example of this exploitation is the case of the Brazilian cleaners, alluded to earlier in the debate, who were recently awarded compensation for their ill treatment after they took their case to the High Court. They had been forced to work 15 hours per day with no pay.There are also well documented examples of workers at various meat processing plants throughout Ireland. These cases include the confiscation of passports, workers being paid less than their Irish counterparts and allegations that workers had been asked to sign contracts obliging them to live exclusively in accommodation provided by their employers. There was also the example of Brazilian staff in a meat processing plant who were raided by their employer after it was alleged that meat had been stolen. The meat had been confiscated, but had to be returned when the worker proved that he had bought it by providing a receipt issued by a local butcher who sold it to him.The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has said that non-EEA workers enjoy the same rights under labour law as Irish citizens. The fact that this is patently not the case, however, is borne out by the reality of most immigrant workers' experiences. In a written reply to a question asked by my colleague, Deputy Ferris, the Minister said that "legislation makes no distinction whatsoever between the rights of foreign workers and any other workers and as such all workers in Ireland without exception are entitled to the same statutory employment rights and protections."  She referred to her Department's labour inspectorate's powers to investigate non-compliance with employment rights legislation. Her comments did not take into account the problems which are caused by the fact that permits are granted to employers and not to employees.The instances I have mentioned clearly demonstrate that foreign workers are not protected by the same laws as indigenous workers. Non-nationals are often the most vulnerable employees in the workforce – very often, they cannot speak English. They may not be accompanied by their families, to whom they send the few bob they earn in this country. They are often afraid of losing their jobs and of being thrown out on the street if they make a complaint. They are aware that they will be unable to get another job in such circumstances as their work permits remain the property of their employers. The system ensures that they are locked to their employers.I query the power that is being given to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in section 3(3) and (4) of this Bill. The Minister will be allowed to decide when the labour market is unable to deal with further migrants. Section  3(3) provides that the Minister can make an order to provide that section 2 shall apply to some or all of the accession states, if he or she is of the opinion that the labour market is experiencing, or is likely to experience, a disturbance. This measure gives far too much power to the Minister. A decision to require citizens of a particular state to have work permits, which this Bill provides shall be based on the opinion of the Minister, should be taken in consultation with the social partners, representatives of trade unions, the community and voluntary sectors, the relevant Departments and business and employer organisations. The groups I have mentioned should be allowed to feed into a collective decision-making process.Section 3(4) of this Bill allows for the reimposition, in certain circumstances, of a requirement for employment permits for citizens of the new member states. The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, recently said in the Seanad that "a six week working period prior to the reimposition is considered appropriate to avoid the possibility of tactically dated employment contracts designed to avoid reimposed regulations."  This unnecessary provision could create problems for workers from accession states who have been in employment in this State for less than the specified six weeks. I have indicated to the House's officials that I intend to withdraw the amendment I have submitted to this section because it contains a technical error, which I made as a consequence of the pressure of work. The six-week provision is unnecessary and cumbersome.Although I welcome the general thrust of this Bill, as I outlined in my contribution, I believe that further reforms are necessary in relation to work permits. I would like the system of renewal of such permits to be streamlined. I share the sentiment that a two or three-day period should be sufficient for renewing permits in this technological age, expressed by Fine Gael Deputies who raised this matter earlier in this debate. Action is also needed in relation to rogue agencies. It seems those who establish agencies to bring migrant workers to this country illegally, or apparently illegally, get away scot-free, whereas the persons who are brought here are subject to the rigour of the legal system. A clause should be included in this Bill banning or punishing agencies that behave in an illegal manner.How will we cater for people from the accession states who wish to come here to set up businesses? I refer to those who do not want to work for somebody else but who are entrepreneurs. Such a person may like to develop an industry that is strong in their own country, or they may be interested in becoming involved in establishing a butcher's shop, for example, or a retail shoe outlet. How can self-employed people qualify for work permits? They cannot say that they are coming here to work for somebody else, as they will not have an employer. I expect that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will include some provision in this Bill to  facilitate the arrival in this country of those with an entrepreneurial spirit. I would appreciate clarification of this matter by the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern. How will such people be facilitated in the circumstances I have outlined?A number of the points I wish to make were alluded to earlier in this debate by other speakers and there is no sense in occupying the time of the House by reiterating such remarks as we need to examine and deal with this Bill quickly. I wish to demonstrate that Deputies on this side of the House do not necessarily prolong debates when it is not necessary to do so. Many of the guillotines that have been imposed, therefore, are less than necessary.

I abhor the widespread human trafficking and exploitation which has been taking place on both sides of the Border. Scenes of such abuse, which were shown in a television documentary on Tuesday night, would normally be associated with countries other than Ireland, such as those in South America. The problems I have mentioned are to be found on our doorstep. People can be smuggled into Ireland conveniently and safely at the Border. Although we are not supposed to see it taking place in the Border region, we know that it happens.Latvian and Lithuanian nationals, for example, were ruthlessly exploited by unscrupulous employers and forced to live in conditions unfit for animals. They worked for 16 hours each day and, in most cases, were paid less then €1 per hour, which is a great deal less than the minimum wage. I do not know whether such people were duped by a promise of a steady job, abducted by smugglers or charged an exorbitant fee for a perilous ride in a leaky boat. Women and children who are the victims of human trafficking are sometimes treated as commodities by the slave traders who transport them. Such people are vulnerable and desperate and take desperate risks.The UN estimates that four million people are involved in human trafficking each year. Those involved in organised crime, such as trafficking, earn €7.8 billion per year from such practices. Between 20,000 and 50,000 people are smuggled from eastern and central Europe each year. Wars have separated families and created orphans. Many people who have suffered economically as a result of the transition and social upheaval following the collapse of communism have been duped into making a journey by the promise of employment as a waitress or a babysitter and, literally, untold wealth as a result. The moneys involved are often considered to be great. Smugglers who transport clients may also supply false identity papers as part of their services. With housing, transport and food expenses, documentation is a factor that may contribute to the debt bondage that keep men and women in debt to, and working for, their contacts.Smugglers use the cheapest forms of transport and pack containers and boats with many people because they want to maximise their profits.Every so often we hear of boats being overcrowded and capsizing with resultant loss of life. It is during the process of smuggling and transportation of migrants to their destinations that tragedies and human rights abuses frequently occur. The tragic deaths of 58 Chinese migrants trying to reach Britain some years ago represented the tip of the iceberg and was only one of several recent accidents which showed the magnitude and seriousness of the problem. Some illegal immigrants melt into the population of a country and have nothing further to do with the smugglers, but some smugglers victimise the clients they transport by confiscating their passports and dole out violence to force women to work in prostitution or slave labour. This slavery is not just economic. When labour and debt enslavement, the exploitation of migrants and classic slavery are considered, the problem amounts to the largest violation of human rights in the world. Many others enter the country legally and overstay their authorised visit. They prepare to build lives in countries like Ireland where they can find work as unskilled labourers and maintain a lifestyle far above the level prevailing in the former Soviet or socialist states.I envisage that this Bill will be instrumental in bringing such practices to an end. Its more open policy of immigration will help to curtail trafficking and cope with the wave of immigration that will not disappear in the medium to longer term. In common with other western European countries, Ireland will continue to need immigrants to compensate for declining birth rates and to fill a considerable need for unskilled labour and certain high-tech jobs. I submit that establishing annual quotas to fill vacant jobs is infinitely better than the immigration minimisation policy some EU countries have adopted.Economic development could be adversely affected by recent decisions in relation to work permits, in particular the suspension of inter-company transfer schemes due to its abuse by certain employers. As a result, employers are now compelled to apply for work permits in respect of such transfers and the process can entail an extensive processing period of several months. Such difficulty in the routine transfers of legal employees can impact negatively on a company's competitiveness. I welcome the closing of the loophole that previously allowed employers to escape scot-free having employed persons without permits where such permits were required. I welcome also the creation of an offence in this regard to which severe penalties are attached.The Bill safeguards Irish jobs by providing for the reintroduction during the seven year transition period of the permit requirement for workers from the EU accession states in circumstances where there might be a dramatic downturn in the Irish labour market. I would like to see the evolution of a system in which work per mits would be issued by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to individual employees instead of to employers. Some employers abuse the work permit system to place their employees in an invidious position and exploit them. I would prefer to see a system in which an employee's rights would be safeguarded to a much greater extent. I welcome this Bill.

As Deputies will know, I have had difficulty with people coming here illegally and I will be discussing this matter when the House considers the Immigration Bill 2002.The purpose of the Employment Permits Bill is, primarily, to facilitate the granting of free access to the labour market to nationals of EU accession states with effect from May 2004. From the date of accession, nationals of these countries will no longer require employment permits to work in Ireland. The Bill also puts in place a safeguard mechanism whereby a requirement for employment permits can be reintroduced in respect of nationals of the relevant countries should the Irish labour market suffer a disturbance after EU enlargement. I have a difficulty with the fact that we must strike a delicate balance. We must protect our indigenous workers who are currently out of employment and we must encourage employers to hire Irish people where possible. The other difficulty I have is that, according to reports made to me, some Irish people may have difficulty in taking up jobs at different ends of the market. This is a concern. There are certain sectors in the service industries which depend wholly on workers from various countries who are legally here and have work permits.The Bill incorporates a provision whereby for the first time a requirement for employment permits in respect of non-nationals working in Ireland is set out in primary legislation together with penalties for non-compliance by employers and employees. It is expected that the granting of free access to the labour market to nationals of accession states after EU enlargement will result in a work permit processing fee reduction of about 35% with consequent savings for potential employers. Despite the economic downturn which resulted in unemployment increasing to 4.4% last year, the number of applications has continued to climb, which leads me to feel concern for our own people. Are they being given the chance to take up employment, or are they applying for these jobs? Traditionally, Ireland has been a country of net emigration, however, increased prosperity resulted in the number of work permits issued growing from 3,617 in 1994  to 40,321 last year. It is worth noting that 16,500 were renewals for the year 2002, which was up 6,485 on 2001. That means people who were already here on the one year work permit were given renewals for a further year.Over 40% of the permits granted last year involved jobs in low skill areas such as farming, construction and catering. It is important to record our gratitude to the Department officials who deal with work permits on a daily basis. It is a fair process involving a numbering and a date system. Officials have been more than helpful and I hope the Minister will convey my sentiments to them. They assist public representatives to progress applications. I have assisted quite a number of employers and people to acquire work permits over the last number of years.It is virtually certain that the labour market will continue to require workers to supplement the domestic labour pool, but I caution that a balance must be ensured. It is essential to include safeguards in the Employment Permits Bill which allow the reintroduction of the requirement for permits from EU countries in the case of a labour market disturbance following enlargement. Some 35% of current work permits are held by citizens of the EU accession countries and demand is expected to have dropped by this amount by next May. The Government's position is in line with other member states including Denmark, the Netherlands, the UK, Spain, Luxembourg and Greece.Some Members have spoken about the exploitation of workers by a small number of employers. It is important to state that the vast majority of employers respect, treat well and pay their workers a fair rate, be they indigenous or foreign nationals. We must recognise that a small number of employers have exploited the system. We should record our appreciation of employers who have created jobs and developed the economy along with the State.I was interested in what FÁS had to say about work permits for immigrants. In January, FÁS called for an overhaul of the work permits system in order to better fit or fill skills shortages with qualified immigrants. Currently, the system allows the employer of any non-EU citizen who is offered work to apply for a work permit to employ that individual. In its labour market review of 2002, FÁS recommended a system similar to that used in Australia which links a permit application to skills shortages rather than to employment vacancies. Under the system proposed by FÁS, workers wishing to take up a job in Ireland would be awarded set points for skills they hold. The sum of points awarded for practical, language and education skills would provide for a far more targeted system which could better cope with skills shortages.According to FÁS a similar work permit system is already in place in Australia and has allowed the authorities to direct immigrant labour to the sectors where it is required. The number of work permits issued to workers from outside the  European Economic area had doubled to 36,500 last year and FÁS could not see the employment labour market growing by any more than 1.5%.The Department last January said it did not envisage any changes but has the Minister given any thought to the FÁS proposals and will she make a statement to the House about them during the passage of the Bill?I am concerned about another statement by the Small Firms' Association last Monday. It carried out a survey on employment needs and described the results as the worst on record. The association said that the number of projected new jobs this year were down from 36,238 to 17,420. Some 62% or 1,049 responding companies have no vacancies. In addition, part-time work available is down by 10% this year and by a massive 60% since 2001. Demand for foreign workers is down by 56% and the same percentage of firms cite unrealistic salary expectation as an obstacle to job creation. They project that this year the demand for labour will be 2.7% down from 6.5% in 2002 and from 7.8% in 2001 and 10.9% in 2000.The results of this survey give a clear indication of what jobs are available. This survey was conducted by an important organisation representing thousands of small businesses. I am concerned about these statistics and about plans to open the labour market further with the accession next year of the ten extra states into the EU. The Minister should analyse these figures and study the response to the survey from small businesses. There should be mechanisms in place to ensure that the delicate balance between demand and supply is maintained.

The Employment Permits Bill is important for three reasons: it provides for full labour market access for the ten accession countries from May 2004; it substantially strengthens the existing arrangements for work permits generally; and it introduces for the first time significant penalties for employers who abuse the permits regime.This legislation is being introduced against a background of EU expansion and of continuing labour market shortages as alluded to by many Members. Despite the economic slowdown this seems likely to continue for some time. Like many Members of this House I remember the bad old days of the mid-80s when emigration was the order of the day and when we were told our most talented young people had no option but to go to Boston or Berlin. It is very gratifying to see how our economy has grown and where we needed to bring in 40,321 non-European Economic Area workers just to sustain that level of growth. It is highly significant that just over one third of those who currently hold work permits hail from the ten accession countries with which our export trade has increased six-fold in recent years.The enactment of this legislation will send a positive signal to our new EU partners with whom we will need to build and consolidate  alliances in the future as we seek to protect Ireland's interests in an expanded Europe and as we work to increase our export markets.The inclusion in the Bill of a provision for the re-introduction of permits in the event of a major upheaval in the labour market is a solid and prudent one. Its inclusion reflects a pragmatic approach to a situation in which we cannot have absolute certainty about the economic climate which will prevail post-enlargement.Contrary to the predictions of some of the anti-Nice campaigners, we can be reasonably confident that we will not see a mass influx of workers into Ireland from accession countries. On a recent visit to Hungary, one of the accession states, I saw the determination of those accession countries to use their future Community membership – as Ireland has done over a long period – not to access other EU labour markets but to substantially enhance their local and national economies.The Bill addresses the general issue of work permits for those originating outside the EEA and I am pleased the disparity which has existed between the position of the non-national working without a permit and that of his employer is addressed by making it an offence for the employer to employ a non-national without the appropriate documentation. Until now the illegal non-national working here was guilty of an offence but the employer in the position of advantage could walk away scot-free. It is entirely appropriate for the State to insist that there is a heavy responsibility on the employer to ensure his compliance with the law in the employment of non-European Economic Area nationals who are availing of a concession rather than a right to work here.The introduction of a system of fines of up to €250,000 and ten year's imprisonment or both, for employers found guilty of hiring illegal workers, will act as a realistic deterrent to breaches of the law in this respect.The experience of most migrant workers who come here to work is positive, as Deputy O'Flynn said. In my constituency of Kildare there are numbers of Moldovans employed in the meat industry, Ukranians in the agri-sector, Japanese and Koreans in the bloodstock industry and South Africans and Romanians in the hotel and catering sectors. It is worrying, to put it at its mildest, to read in the 2002 annual report of the Equality Authority that upwards of 25% of complaints of discrimination in the workplace are on the grounds of race. As we put in place a legal framework within which non-nationals may work here, it is absolutely necessary to ensure that those who avail of the option and thereby contribute to our continued well-being, do so in an environment where their presence is welcome and valued and where the spectre of discrimination or racism is not allowed to raise its ugly head. I commend the Bill to the House.

Tá áthas orm le feiceáil go bhfuil mic léinn óga ó Ghaelscoil Charman anseo leis an díospóireacht inniu agus go gcloisfidh siad na tuairimí éagsúla atá ag a bpolaiteoirí faoin mBille seo.I welcome the opportunity to speak on Second Stage of the Employment Permits Bill. I am pleased to see young people from Gaelscoil Wexford in the Public Gallery because this Bill is somewhat relevant to Wexford. There are areas of employment in Wexford where there is a huge shortage of employees and we are dependent on foreign workers. This Bill will allow non-nationals to work in Wexford.The Irish saying "Más maith is mithid" is twofold in its impact; if it is good, it is also timely. I congratulate the Minister and her Ministers of State on the timeliness of this Bill. In recent months I have had representations from people in the fruit growing industry, the long haulage business and the hotel industry in Wexford. There is a huge shortage of employees and these businesses have been forced to apply to the Department continuously in recent years in order to obtain work permits.The Bill will make it unnecessary for nationals of the EU accession states to apply for work permits. I was interested this morning to hear Deputy Murphy welcome the Bill, qualified though it was, and Deputy Morgan speak about how workers have been exploited, which is an important matter.As the Tánaiste said, this Bill is about extending the hand of friendship and solidarity to the new states. In the past, this country has lived off emigration. I was one of many forced to emigrate and join many Irish workers in London, New York and so on. The young visitors here will not be familiar with that concept because they are used to hearing foreign accents and foreign languages around Wexford town, which was not the case during my youth.Now that we are joining the wealthiest nations in the world, it is appropriate that we should extend the hand of friendship and solidarity in helping to build the new accession states. All of us have brothers and sisters abroad. Our economic success is probably due in part to emigrant remittances and to workers returning with new skills from New York, Boston or London. I hope that will be the experience of the new EU workers who will be able to come here from 1 May. The Tánaiste said in her speech that our experience to date is that most people who come to work here do so in a temporary capacity.I thank the officials of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment for their diligence and hard work in processing the permits currently required by people coming to work in Ireland from EU accession states. Despite their hard work, the need to scrutinise the applications result in a delay. Some 35% of applicants come from the new accession states, therefore, there  will be a 35% reduction in the whole processing procedure. Apart from saving time, it will result in a saving of approximately €4 million, which is very important.There are those who fear the legislation will result in a flood of immigrant employees to Ireland. To say that is to prove that one is unfamiliar with the fact that in 1994, 3,617 workers came to this country. In 2002 the number of immigrant workers had increased to 40,321. We are already welcoming such workers, 35% of whom come from the new accession states. We must legitimise what is happening and make it respectable to work in Ireland and have freedom of movement.The Bill addresses for the first time the exploitation of workers hired by illegal employers. While these people have not been illegal to date, a minority of them have exploited people from abroad. Under the legislation, employers found guilty of hiring illegal workers can be fined up to €250,000 and, more important, can be sent to jail for ten years. I welcome that measure because it will protect unfortunate people. As a former emigrant, I know that people can be exploited.The key issues for the new accession states centre around human rights, poverty and democracy. The Bill demonstrates our willingness as a modern democracy and successful economic entity to help to address these problems and provide some type of solution. The challenge is not just economic, it is also social. It would be a tragedy if the new-found political freedom of the new accession states, particularly the eastern European states, were undermined by desperate depths of poverty.This is currently a very well off State. Unemployment levels have risen in recent years but are just 4.5%, compared to 7.9% in Europe. Lithuania faces the challenge of posed by its young people, 8,000 of whom are in Ireland. Táimid réidh chun cabhrú leis na tíortha nach bhfuil chomh saibhir lenár dtír dúchais féin anois. We are willing, ready and the Government has shown a willingness to help those who are not as wealthy as we are.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	250	I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this important legislation. As someone who has been involved with farming organisations all my life, I appreciate the benefits we have obtained from our involvement in the European Community since the early 1970s. Therefore, it is only right that we should extend the hand of friendship to countries which now wish to accede to the EU by opening up the labour market in general.Obviously there are worries at present in regard to job losses. There was a meeting in my home town of Clones recently regarding the 140 jobs being lost in CPV, therefore some may ask why should we legalise the right of people to come into this country to work. I read with interest the Tánaiste's speech. I did not realise that of the 40,000 people who came here on work permits in 2002, 13,752 were from the accession  countries. It brings me back to the late 1980s and early 1990s when the then Minister, the late Brian Lenihan, said 40,000 of our best and well educated young people were finding good jobs in countries throughout the world. It is important to remember that most of these people got a reasonably good welcome in the UK, USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and in parts of Europe. In the 1950s our people emigrated without education or money. We need to remember that when some Members criticise and perhaps instigate anger against people who come to work and live in this country. I appreciate there are illegal immigrants who should not be here. However, we could not have built up this country in the way we did were it not for the contributions of people who came to work here. I found it interesting that the figure of 40,000 in 2002 was similar to the number of people we exported in the late 1980s and early 1990s.We must take into account the anxieties of small firms in regard to insurance costs, economic factors and so on because some worry that jobs will not be available for our own people. I am pleased there is a stipulation in the Bill to curtail the flow of immigrants into this country in the future if the need arises. Those who opposed the Nice treaty said we would be flooded with people from the rest of Europe if we voted for the treaty. I was interested to hear some people who campaigned against the treaty admit that has not been the case. It is important that we retain the right to curtail the numbers coming into the country if it is considered necessary in the future.It is also important that all workers in the country, be they Irish or immigrant, are treated in a similar manner. This morning I consulted a person involved in the retail business who is aware of the situation in Clones. I was advised that employers would like to give employment to Irish workers if at all possible, but they sometimes find it impossible to get them to work in the retail trade, especially when late and long hours and weekend work is involved. They would find it very hard to run their businesses in the absence of legal workers on permit. These workers fulfil a role.The Cavan-Monaghan constituency is the home of the mushroom and poultry industries. It would be much more difficult to keep them going in the absence of "permit" workers. They are not high paying industries and young graduates do not want to work in them, with the result that vacancies have had to be filled by workers coming into the country under permit. If it is the case that the €500 charge that had to be paid by the horticulture industry on behalf of these workers has been discharged I welcome it. It was a surcharge the industry could not afford.The mushroom industry competes in the United Kingdom market with products imported from other countries, such as Hungary and Poland, where the work force is paid much less. A few years ago I visited these countries as part of a delegation from the Oireachtas Joint Com mittee on Social and Family Affairs. The personnel we met in Hungary were pleased to have secured agreement on a minimum wage of €200 per month at a time when the minimum wage here was £170 week. I hope that following accession to the European Union, workers in these countries will be able to work at home for increased wages. In the meantime if we can provide them with opportunities we should do so.When I visited Poland I saw farming structures requiring an intensive labour component of the kind that prevailed in this country in the 1940s and 1950s. A delegation from Slovenia is visiting the Oireachtas and I hope to meet it shortly to discuss the situation here and the opportunities for co-operation. We must extend the hand of friendship to the accession countries. This Bill is a part of that process.Previous speakers, including Deputy O'Flynn, who made a name for himself on the immigration issue, referred to the delays in issuing permits. I agree with Deputy O'Flynn that the staff in the permits processing office is helpful. However, if the system was working as it should, Deputies would not have to contact the office on behalf of employers and employees. There is a need to look at this aspect.When workers come in to the country on permit they should be allowed the freedom to move to new employment if necessary. Sometimes this has happened illegally, which is of no benefit to anybody. The Bill should provide for a mechanism to allow for transfer, which would be of mutual benefit to employers and employees. It can often be difficult for an agency to decide on a correct match between an employer and employee. If it does not work it is not in the interests of either party that they should stay together. Any mechanism that seeks to address this should ensure there is no necessity for either party to behave in an illegal manner.The question of labour shortages has affected not only the mushroom industry but the entire food processing and retail industries. Workers at the various boning halls have played a major role. If some of them want to stay in the country for the longer term they should be allowed to set up their own businesses. They should not be confined to the work to which they were initially allocated. If necessary, they should be allowed to become self employed and should be treated like any other citizen.Immigrant workers have been, and are, used in the hotel and catering industries. In some hotels in this city and elsewhere I have found it difficult to deal with the personnel, for example, those looking after the bars or restaurants. It is in the interests of the industry to ensure that such workers get proper training and are reasonably fluent in the language. Many in this country speak in different dialects and accents and it is sometimes difficult for us to understand each other, which underlines the importance of ensuring that immigrant workers are properly trained. It is unfair to the industry and the workers if there is  a language barrier between those working in the industry and those using it, especially tourists.Other Deputies referred to illegal immigration. Illegal immigrants have caused major problems in some parts of the country. I understand everything possible is being done to prevent them from entering the country. However, when they arrive here they must wait a considerable time to deal with the immigration services. They should be allowed to work on short-term permits. It annoys many that they receive social welfare payments and benefits. According to those on social welfare, many of them are better looked after. There is a view in the media that this is causing some of the problems and Deputy O'Flynn and others have referred to this.

The latter means that the product may be purchased from a pharmacy without veterinary prescription, while veterinarians may also supply the products in certain circumstances.The position on vaccines is that it was necessary to review licences for products on the market because the existing licences covering such products were based on outdated legislation. The Irish Medicines Board is charged with undertaking the detailed examination of each product dossier and making an appropriate recommendation to the Department. The Department, as competent authority for vaccines, issues a licence, taking due account of the Irish Medicines Board recommendation. Regarding the designation of route of supply, this decision is taken on an individual basis, reflecting the characteristics of the product. In doing so, the full range of potential outlets provided for in the Animal Remedies Regulations 1996, including "licensed merchant", is considered having regard to the objective criteria set out in the regulations.Regarding intramammaries, the Department is considering how best to give effect to a recom mendation of the IMB that all such products should only be available on veterinary prescription. In formulating a prescription regime for intramammaries, the approach is to put in place a workable system which provides the essential guarantees for public health and animal health and welfare and recognises the important part played by all stake holders, including the milk processing industry.As regards designation of routes of supply, the Department does not have a policy to exclude any of the legitimate outlets which are provided for under the 1996 regulations. Neither could this exercise be approached in an arbitrary way to apportion market share between the various commercial interests in the marketplace.The Department will continue under the review of vaccines to designate individual products to the appropriate route of supply which, based on its assessment, is the minimum required to safeguard human and animal health.

I wish to raise the issue of intramammaries. Does the Minister of State agree that co-operatives have a vested interest in ensuring that intramammaries are used responsibly, that farmers are professional people who use the products in a responsible manner and that, if co-ops are prohibited from selling the products and their sale is left to vets and pharmacists, costs will increase and a black market may develop in this area, as has happened in some countries?Will the Minister of State assure me that the sale of intramammaries will continue in the current form and that no changes will be made? There is considerable concern among farmers who are responsible people. It would add an unnecessary cost and would not benefit the consumer or food safety to have intramammaries on sale only in pharmacies or by veterinary prescription.

The Department is mindful of increasing costs on farmers and it was with that in mind that extensive consultation took place with all farming organisations and the many interested groups. There are three methods of availing of intramammaries: from the veterinary profession, pharmacists and co-ops.I will give some background to this debate. The Minister was obliged to take on board the recommendation of the Irish Medicines Board which had made proposals as far back as 1999 to the Department. These were studied by experts in the Department. Even at that stage the board recognised that the tight prescription rules in legislation would be unworkable in the case of intramammaries. Further clinical examinations were carried out on the basis of periodic monitoring of mastitis control on farms.The intention and hope would be that, as a  result of these ongoing discussions, a safe, practical and workable method of dispensing intramammaries can be put in place. The Deputy must remember that the overriding concerns of the Department are public health, animal and health welfare and the cost to the farmer. We are trying to bring together an arrangement whereby we achieve the best result for all concerned.

I assure him that, if there is a change, costs will increase. He also mentioned animal welfare. Groups have attended Oireachtas committee meetings on this issue and no evidence has been produced—

No evidence has been produced that suggests there is a difficulty with animal welfare or that there has been a difficulty with food safety. I agree with the Minister of State on those points. Can he assure me there will not be a change in the current system of dispensing intramammaries?

We have accepted the report of the Irish Medicines Board which is charged with the responsibility of advising the Minister for Agriculture and Food. It has recommended the prescription method, but the fact remains and we in the Department realise only too well that we cannot impose the cost of a visit by a vet to a farm every time a prescription is necessary for the treatment of mastitis. We are putting together a proposal that would perhaps allow—

That would take into account the number of animals on the farm and the record. We are conscious that there is a cost factor, but there are also obligations on the Department.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	266	Commissioner Fischler published the European Commission's detailed proposals for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy on 22 January 2003. At the meeting of the Council of Ministers on 27 January, Ministers gave their initial reaction to the proposals. In that discussion I clearly set out the Irish position. Elements of the proposals have been discussed at meetings of the Council in February and March and a further discussion is planned for the April meeting. Since the proposals were published, they have been undergoing detailed examination at official level in various committees in Brussels on which all member states and the Commission are represented.The Greek Presidency has indicated its intention to reach agreement on the Commission's proposals in June this year. Given the complexity and importance of the proposals, this objective will be difficult to achieve. It is not possible for me to speculate on the final outcome while the negotiations are in progress.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	267	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire for the response and the material on Henshaws he provided yesterday.What is his response to Commissioner Fischler's recent statement that his proposals are not set in stone and that is up to member states to make counter proposals? Is there something the Minister has done or will do. Will he elaborate on this? Would he feel that somehow the debate has already moved on to the extent that other states have ensured that their concerns have been placed at the centre of the debate and have possibly already secured concessions on issues which, if part of the final agreement, will have harmful effects on the Irish farming industry?
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	268	I was glad to be able to resolve the Henshaw matter which was particular to reactor cattle. I was able to get a bonding system in place which hopefully will obviate this type of difficulty in the future.In regard to the mid-term review, since January detailed meetings have been taking place in Brussels at workshop and special committee level. Of course, the mid-term review is discussed at each of the Council meetings. We have made it clear that we had a review of the Common Agricultural Policy in 1999 which was termed Agenda 2000 and was to continue up to the end of 2006. We see no reason, market or otherwise, why there should be a fundamental reform of Agenda 2000 at this stage when a number of years have yet to run in that scheme. We think it is unfair to farmers to change mid-stream. They are entitled to a degree of stability into the future and fundamental reforms like decoupling, modulation and  depressivity should not be thrown at them at this stage of the game.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	269	I know the Minister is not going to tell us that we have missed the boat on this but has he actually commenced a process of stating our position firmly to other countries and trying to garner support on that? Fischler said that it is not set in stone and it is up to the member states to make their own concrete proposals. The Minister is sticking with Agenda 2000. Is it the case that he has no additional proposals to make at this stage?
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	270	The position is that at least ten of the 15 member states were quite negative and hostile to the proposals for reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. Ireland was included in those countries. Since then, I have had a number of bilateral meetings with a number of like-minded countries. What we want to get out of these negotiations is a situation where we protect the gains and advantages of Agenda 2000 and leave the European Union in a good positive position going into the WTO world trade talks.

I would like all Members, not just the Deputy, to get back into that practice in the House.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	272	There are many farming people around Ireland who have other names for him.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	274	The partnership talks involve a series of complex discussions between the Government and four pillars comprising the voluntary and community pillar, the farming pillar, the employers pillar and the trade union pillar. The agreement that is reached is not simply on the basis of what each pillar has received but also encompasses a series of shared societal goals which involve an inter-linking of areas of economic activity, pay, taxation and social policy. The final result is an agreement which covers a number of areas, some of which impact on each pillar  directly and others such as macro-economic goals which benefit all by improving the economic climate in areas such as reduced inflation, higher economic growth, etc.To indicate the comprehensive approach taken in the discussions in relation to agriculture there are solid commitments on the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy, the WTO, the dairy sector, the beef sector, the food industry, improvement in REPS, improvement in the farm waste management scheme, commonage framework plans, SACs, disadvantaged areas, stamp duty for young farmers, stock relief and land annuities. The proposals on the table will bring significant advantages to the farming community.Social partnership has been shown to be the major driver of Ireland's economic success and has delivered many benefits to the farming community as well as to all other sectors. The fact that other social partners, namely the union and employer pillars, have agreed to participate in the new agreement, notwithstanding current economic difficulties, makes it even more important for the agriculture sector to be represented in the process.It is no secret that the current round of partnership talks have taken place in a difficult economic environment. However, social partners have overcome many difficulties since the instigation of the whole partnership process in 1987. It should be remembered that partnership has served farmers well and I applaud their contribution to the partnership process over the years and their input into the series of previous agreements. I, like my other colleagues in the Government, would like that input to continue.Although the timeframe for completion of the new agreement, Sustaining Progress, is now short, I remain hopeful that the farming pillar will continue to be fully involved in partnership and I will make every effort to bring this about. To this end, certain contacts have and are taking place to establish if the farming pillar can enter this new agreement. In this context, it would not be appropriate at this stage to go into detail but to simply indicate that the area of major financial interest relates to REPS and the farm waste management programme.
#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-party	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-dob	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	275	I thank the Minister for his reply. I take it that he is saying that the €300 million is in the farm waste management programme and the REPS scheme. Can he confirm that?The Minister mentioned the four pillars but would he agree that the treatment this Government has handed out to the agricultural pillar has merely made a Lot's wife of the farmer pillar and turned it into a pillar of salt? The Government has left the farming community with little option but to perhaps remain outside the partnership agreement. I would like to see them go into it but I can understand why they might not, having suffered one blow after another.What is the final closing date for the farm organisation entry into the partnership agree ment? I am given to understand it may be today but I am not too sure. What is the cut-off date? What new issues has the farming community brought to the Minister in the past few days?I sought to put down a couple of questions on the Minister's approval for the Teagasc recommendations. They were ruled out of order, incorrectly I believe because the Minister for Agriculture and Food has to approve those recommendations and in that regard has a responsibility. What is the position on the Teagasc proposals, recommending the closures, submitted to the Minister? I urge him to send them back and refuse to accept them. These closures are being put forward as a result of the €12 million cutback which was the result of the mishandling of public finances and the projected Exchequer returns at the end of the year were off the mark and were, in fact, better than expected. I ask the Minister to revisit the issue.In a nutshell, does the Minister agree that the Government has made life difficult for the farming pillar? Can he confirm that what he is offering the farmers is the €300 million, in the context of farm waste management and REPS which were included in the national development plan going back to 2000 anyway and have been dramatically cut back, if memory serves me correctly?
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	276	We are at a critical stage now in the negotiations on the future of partnership. Now that a number of the pillars have accepted it, it is important that the farming pillar is also included. Contacts are continuing and constructive negotiations are still ongoing. There are solid commitments, particularly on REPS. That is important, not alone for REPS itself but for issues like the nitrates directive and a number of other areas including farm waste management, on-farm investment, stamp duty, stock relief and land annuities.I do not want to go into any further detail in regard to the negotiations other than to say there are still a few days left. I hope that matters could be concluded this week in preparation for next week. I am hopeful that can be achieved.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	277	The issue of the co-existence of GM crops with organic and other non-GM crops is currently being discussed at EU level, at the Council of Agriculture Ministers and in other fora. Among the questions which arise  are how to manage the adventitious or unintentional mixing of GM and non-GM crops resulting from seed impurities, cross-pollination, harvesting methodologies, storage and-or transport practices, as well as the possible economic consequences to which the Deputy refers.The EU Commission held a detailed policy discussion on the issue in early March and this will be followed up by a round table meeting of all stake holders on 24 April 2003 at which all of the current scientific knowledge and experience will be assessed and evaluated. The Commission has promised to table guidelines following this meeting.Teagasc is also currently involved in evaluating all of the scientific data available on this issue including data from France, Australia, Canada and particularly from the five-year study recently carried out in the United Kingdom. This evaluation will be supported by research work in a controlled glass house environment to determine the degree, if any, of cross contamination.Based on guidelines emanating from the European Union Commission and the outcome of our own national evaluation, a programme of managed development of GM crops will be devised.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	278	Does the Minister accept that the co-existence of genetically modified crops and organic crops is impossible? If organic crops are contaminated in any way with GM organisms they cease to be certifiably organic. This will result in the ruination of organic farmers if GM is allowed to be grown or, as the Minister of State said, to co-exist with organic growing areas. In that regard will he agree it is against his Department's stated policy of promoting organic farming to tolerate genetically modified crops? Will he ensure in the course of international discussions, particularly in relation to the World Trade Organisation, that Ireland would state, as its bottom line, that it will continue as a GMO free country in terms of crop production, animal feed production and animal feed imports for organic growing and organic production? Can he say that will be a bottom line and that he accepts the concerns of the organic bodies that the Government needs to state its position clearly on this matter?
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	279	The EU Commission view is that co-existence is about economic and legal questions, not about risks to food safety because only authorised GMOs can be cultivated within the European Union. I cannot conclude what is possible or impossible or de facto at this stage. The scientific reports are being evaluated, data from the various countries are being evaluated within the plant bio-technology unit of Teagasc. We will await the conclusions arrived at. Research is critically important to the well-being of mankind. There is no difficulty pertaining to the Department's policy on organic farming. We have a clearly defined publicly issued policy on organic farming. Recently we have taken decisions that underpin and give sustainability to organic farm ing. I am confident until there is an absolute scientific conclusion, that nobody can make a statement saying co-existence is or is not possible.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	280	People can say it is not possible. If organic farmers are found to use GM feed or if their crops are contaminated by GM they lose their certification. Therefore, it is not possible for the two to co-exist. I certainly agree with the Minister of State on the importance of research. I am surprised, therefore, that the organic poultry unit at Mellows College, in his own constituency, is under threat. Is he referring to the seeds of doubt report by the soil association when he mentions the UK five-year study which states clearly that GM products and organic products cannot co-exist? In relation to imports from Argentina of soya bean coming on the black market, has he got the testing and the traceability in place to ensure that GM products, which may make their way into organic farms, are not imported into Ireland by the back door?
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	281	I am satisfied the inspectors in the Department are doing an excellent job in carrying out regular and ad hoc testing of various products to ensure absolute protection and guarantee for consumers, farmers and livestock. Products coming into the country are also tested to ensure an added guarantee. Obviously one can never be certain, in so far as we are dealing with the human management of the transfer of a product from an international location, that at all times we will be able to identify everything. So far as our inspectors are concerned they have done an excellent job and will continue to do so. The study to which I have referred is the five-year study which was carried out recently in the United Kingdom.

I cannot decide whether a study in the United Kingdom is published or otherwise. Teagasc is doing a desk evaluation plus a scientific evaluation of that study which has come to it along with the data from various other countries. That is an ongoing process and something that will not arrive at a sudden conclusion.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	296	The prices paid by processors for cattle is a matter for direct negotiation between beef producers and individual beef processors.The profitability of specific producer sectors will depend on a combination of prices paid to producers for finished animals, their own cost structure and, critically, the prices paid for young animals.As far as current cattle prices are concerned, they have to be seen in the context of the Agenda 2000 Agreement which provided for a 20% reduction in institutional prices in return for a substantial increase in premiums, worth approximately 73c per lb in the case of steers in comparison with 46c per lb in 1999. Current prices for steers in Ireland are roughly at the same level as 1999.The major factors in determining overall price levels paid by the processing sector are the availability of and ease of access to markets, the returns from those markets and, in addition, in the case of third countries, the level of export refunds. Other factors involved include efficiency at processing level and the extent to which value is added to the primary product.My function in relation to cattle prices is to set the policy parameters and support framework  and to seek by every political and diplomatic initiative to secure access to markets.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	297	Is it also the Minister's function to increase the cost to farmers, which he mentioned as being one of the parameters, by doubling the disease levies and will he do something to redress that situation? Will he agree that profitability is affected by costs at one end and prices achieved at the market at the other end? His actions and those of his Department and the Government are about to increase costs. Has the Minister any information with regard to any recent developments in the Russian market? Has it introduced quotas or is it about to introduce them and, if so, what will he do about it and, what would be the likely impact? What is the position about traceability in regard to third country imports to Ireland and its impact on profitability? Will he agree that beef from markets outside the EU should be labelled and that the consumer should be told where it originates?
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	298	There is a margin in every area of activity. Farmers are in the private enterprise world and many of them buy store cattle. At present, store cattle are about 11.7% dearer than they were this time last year. Those without a premium are making around €300 with their weight, and they are making up to €1,000 if one can draw two premia on them.I find it difficult to understand how farmers pay that amount of money for store cattle and expect to make a margin next autumn, but that is what is happening. Under the EU premia arrangement, farmers are now receiving a total of €540 per head if they draw all their premia. Cattle are making about €200 more per head than they were in 1999 in terms of premia.There is a change in the Russian market. With effect from 1 April 2003, all shipments of beef to Russia came under a new quota regime and the total quota is 420,000 tonnes. The application process will be operated under import licences and the industry in Ireland is already applying for them. I expect that the present quota arrangement will not make any great difference to us.Deputy Stanton mentioned imported beef, which is a straightforward issue. We produce approximately 500,000 tonnes of beef, of which we export about 450,000 tonnes. Some 245,000 or 250,000 tonnes are exported to the UK, some 90,000 tonnes are exported to Russia and 100,000 tonnes are exported to mainland Europe. We consume approximately 50,000 tonnes ourselves, 12,000 tonnes of which is imported, some of which is for reprocessing and re-export. If one has an industry producing 500,000 tonnes and imports 12,000 tonnes, this is indicative of a pretty good ratio in an open economy such as ours.I have been assured by the Commissioner with responsibility for health and consumer protection, Mr. David Byrne, that the quality and safety  of food imported into Ireland is up to the very highest standard.

That is only a minor technical matter. The Russian market is very valuable to us and we export about 90,000 tonnes to it. The big breakthrough has been in the UK market, which is the most remunerative because of the strength of sterling and the fact that we export 250,000 tonnes to it. Additionally, a major effort has been made by Bord Bia, the industry itself and the political system, including myself, in respect of mainland Europe. As the Deputy knows, following the foot and mouth disease crisis and some food scares, consumption decreased by about 80%. This has increased again and we are now exporting 100,000 tonnes to mainland Europe.I succeeded in reopening the trade to the Egyptian market. The industry has not taken up on this yet because the return is not as good as that from our nearest neighbour. I am still in negotiations with the Gulf states and South Africa. It is tough going because we still have a low level of BSE, with intermittent outbreaks—

#LiamAylward	unknown-#LiamAylward-party	unknown-#LiamAylward-dob	unknown-#LiamAylward-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	311	The prescription only exempt category is one of six possible routes of supply which can be applied to an individual veterinary medicine, including veterinary vaccines, under the Animal Remedies Regulations 1996. Therefore, there is nothing new about this category, which has existed since the coming into force of the above regulations on 1 August 1996. The purpose of having a range of routes of supply is to enable products to be subject to the degree of control necessary to safeguard human and animal health, and decisions in individual cases are taken on a scientific basis taking account of the individual characteristics of the product in question and the objective criteria laid down in the Animal Remedies Regulations 1996.I am aware of certain concerns which have been expressed about the designation of some vaccines to the prescription only exempt category, which means that the product may be purchased from a pharmacy without veterinary prescription. Veterinarians may also supply the products in certain circumstances. Such designations have arisen from a review of the marketing authorisations for all vaccines on the Irish market. It was necessary to conduct this review to ensure that products met the standards determined by current scientific knowledge, thereby maintaining confidence in the regulatory regime that underpins the production and marketing of Irish animal food products on home and export markets.As regards designation of routes of supply, my Department does not have a general policy to exclude any of the legitimate outlets which are provided for under the 1996 regulations. Neither could this exercise be approached in an arbitrary way to apportion market share as between the various commercial interests in the marketplace. Nonetheless, while it is not an issue my Department can take into account, I do not see how supply of products through pharmacies could, of itself, justify increased costs when compared with other outlets.My Department will continue, under this review, to designate individual products to the appropriate route of supply which, based on its assessment, is the minimum required to safeguard human and animal health.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	312	Does the Minister not think that a preventative medicine approach might be very useful in this case and that the putting of additional resources into supporting better animal husbandry, for example, would effectively reduce the need for antibiotics in particular? What current scientific evidence indicates that there is a risk to human health that could be related back to the misuse or abuse of antibiotics as purchased via the co-operative system? I understand that there is considerable traceability and a close record kept of any products bought in this way, thus providing accountability. Surely, making the products available on a prescription-only basis will increase the cost significantly.
#LiamAylward	unknown-#LiamAylward-party	unknown-#LiamAylward-dob	unknown-#LiamAylward-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	313	I think there is a misunderstanding. Question No. 1 referred to intramammaries which we discussed in respect of the designation of prescription-only medication. The Animal Remedies Regulations Act 1996 allows the Minister for Agriculture and Food, as the competent authority in Ireland, to license veterinary vaccines. Therefore, there is a great difference between this case and what we were discussing earlier.The Minister licenses veterinary vaccines in co-operation with or on the recommendations of the Irish Medicines Board. There is a huge range of vaccines involved, approximately 160 or 170. The board makes its recommendations to the Department of Agriculture and Food, but the Department does not necessarily follow them. In recent years, the Department disagreed with some 18 of 66 recommendations by the board for sound and constructive reasons. This will continue to be the approach of the Department.We must return to the issue of the cost factor. People will still have the opportunity to apply to the Department for their licences, and it will assess the applications. Strict information has to be provided to the Department and this can only be done by the Irish Medicines Board. We do take its recommendations on board.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	314	Does the Minister agree that there is no evidence to show a risk to human health up to now from the current arrangements? Would he not agree that introducing "prescription only" medicines on a wider basis would lead to a growth in the black market and more risk? Would he agree that the current professionals who are dealing with this issue and are registered are operating, by and large, in a very responsible way and there is, actually, no problem?
#LiamAylward	unknown-#LiamAylward-party	unknown-#LiamAylward-dob	unknown-#LiamAylward-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	315	I thought I said that heretofore there has not been an problem and that is why the attitude adopted by the Department is the one most people would favour. This is partic ularly true in the case of vaccines as against intramammaries, regarding which we are directed by the Irish Medicines Board. The Irish Medicines Board operates in a consultative capacity in this case. The Department takes on board its recommendations and views but does not necessarily follow them.There is not any need to worry about the black market in this instance because apart from our pharmacies, vets and co-ops, the bona fide operators who attend at marts must apply for a licence through the Department. There is no question of a black market. The black markets that might have existed in the past have been stamped out. We all know about the "back-of-the-van" syndrome.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	316	In relation to the "prescription only" medicines exemption, does the Minister of State see an animal welfare issue? He mentioned this in his reply to Question No. 1. The same question arises here. What are the animal welfare issues that might be significant here?
#LiamAylward	unknown-#LiamAylward-party	unknown-#LiamAylward-dob	unknown-#LiamAylward-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	317	When a licence for a product is applied for it goes directly to the Irish Medicines Board, which does a very strict analysis of what is involved and then makes a recommendation to the Department. We have a very professional veterinary unit within the Department. Incidentally, the unit recently won the ISO 9000 quality management systems standard, which is a remarkable achievement for part of a Civil Service organisation. I recently had the pleasure of accepting the award on the unit's behalf. This proves how capable the unit is in dealing with the questions raised by Deputy Upton and I see no reason for concern.The EU was dissatisfied with some of the loose ends in Ireland and in other member states. Because of the value of our export markets, to which the Minister has already referred, we must be ever vigilant that we have the best products available. We must be able to convince the market that we have those products.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	318	I hear what the Minister of State is saying with regard to not always taking on board the recommendation of the Irish Medicines Board and being judicious about it. Would he accept that there is an important role for Government in counterbalancing the huge pressure from particular vested interests in promoting the pharmaceutical products they have developed with profit in mind at the sales end and from vested interests which want as many products as possible to be on prescription, from the veterinary point of view? Would he accept that there is a Government responsibility to take the long-term view of avoiding immunity build-up to certain pharmaceuticals and in particular to antibiotics, which have a knock-on effect for humans as well as animals? Would he accept that this is a role that goes beyond some of the pressures that are coming on the Department to take on board particular pol icy areas that would reflect the pharmaceutical sector's interests.
#LiamAylward	unknown-#LiamAylward-party	unknown-#LiamAylward-dob	unknown-#LiamAylward-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	319	I concur with the Deputy's views. That is the reason all of these safeguards are in place. At the same time, regard for public health is the overriding concern of the Department. We are also concerned for animal health and welfare and our third concern is to deliver a service of which our farmers can avail and operate in a practical workable way with safeguards built in. That is what we have been trying to do and that is the reason the Irish Medicines Board is on board.The Department is most rigid in everything it does. In fact, we are generally accused of being too rigid. The Deputy can rest assured that we are all right in that regard.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	320	I call on Deputy Upton to put her question to the Minister for Agriculture and Food.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	321	asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food the steps he plans to take to seek a solution to the industrial dispute now involving up to 900 members of staff of his Department, following his decision to remove 150 staff from the payroll earlier this week and the serious consequences of the dispute for services to farmers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	322	I thank Deputy Upton for raising this matter because I welcome this opportunity to tell the House the background to the action being taken by the CPSU in my Department's local offices. I regret to have to say that the union's action is contrary to the existing Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and the new Sustaining Progress Agreement.My Department's decision to remove staff from the payroll was not taken lightly. The union members had decided not to perform normal duties arising from 'phone calls and faxes. In addition they refused to perform duties at reception desks. The services provided from our local offices are essential to the farming community, in particular in the context of cattle movements to factories and marts as well as the various direct payments to farmers.CPSU members in the Department's local offices voted in favour of industrial action to secure what they considered improved promotional structures. The CPSU commenced industrial action in the local offices with effect from Tuesday, 18 March 2003.The CPSU advised the Department that it would regionalise the dispute. The country has been split into four regions as follows: region one, Waterford, Cork, Tipperary north and Tipperary  south and Clare; region two, Limerick, Kerry, Galway and Mayo; region three, Longford, Sligo, Roscommon, Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan; and region four, Carlow, Dublin, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Meath, Offaly, Wexford, Westmeath and Wicklow.Region one commenced industrial action on a regional basis on 25 March 2003. This involved a ban on 'phone and fax queries and counter duties in the afternoon. This action continued until 28 March 2003. CPSU originally intended to rotate the action between regions on a weekly basis as follows: region two from 31 March 2003 to 4 April 2003; region three from 7 April 2003 to 11 April 2003; and region four from 14 April 2003 to 17 April 2003. I emphasise that normal duties are being carried out by CPSU members in regions other than the one engaged in industrial action.The CPSU has advised that the action will apply to FDS offices and regional labs in addition to local livestock offices and district veterinary offices. There are 790 CPSU members out of a total local office staff complement of 887 involved in the dispute.The Department was advised yesterday that with effect from this morning CPSU members would picket the offices which are the subject of industrial action for this week. The offices affected by the picketing are those offices in region two, that is, Limerick, Kerry, Galway and Mayo.The scope for agreeing any resolution to this matter is limited by the terms of the various social partnership agreements, the need to control public expenditure and the implications for other sectors of the public service if a concession is made in this case.The action taken by the CPSU cannot be condoned and is contrary to the terms of social partnership agreements. Arrangements have been made to remove from the payroll with effect from 2 April CPSU staff members who refuse to perform core duties. This action applies in the region which is involved in the industrial action this week. The details are as follows: Galway – 58; Kerry – 37; Mayo – 43; and Limerick – 21.Officials from my Department met CPSU representatives yesterday but unfortunately no basis for a settlement emerged. Yesterday afternoon the CPSU advised that the officers who have been removed from the payroll in Galway, Limerick, Mayo and Kerry will not return to work until the dispute is resolved. They also indicated that they would picket the offices involved from today. I now understand that non-local office CPSU members in the Castlebar office have refused to pass the picket. However, I would add that all of the offices are open, although, as expected, there is a disruption to the services provided to its customers.The union demands that we increase the number of posts in the staff officer and executive officer grade. They have mentioned a figure to  my officials which, by any definition, means their demand is a cost increasing claim.The PPF, on page 35, provides as follows:1. That no cost-increasing claims by trade unions or employees for improvements in pay or condition of employment, other than those provided in clauses 3 to 5, will be made or processed during the currency of the agreement; 2. Commits employers, trade unions and employees to promoting industrial harmony and; 3. Precludes strikes or other forms of industrial action by trade unions, employees or employers in respect of any matters covered by this agreement, where the employer of trade union concerned is acting in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.The Sustaining Progress agreement reinforces this commitment. This agreement provides for a 7% pay increase for all civil servants and for the payment of the relevant awards made by the benchmarking body. In the case of the CPSU this involves a further 8.5% increase. My Department is prepared to examine the staffing of our local offices. However, any reorganisation involving upgradings would have to be dealt with against a background of the continuing need to control public finances. In any event, as I have said, the industrial action is contrary to the general pay agreements and I would appeal to the union to instruct its members to resume duty. My Department's officials are available for talks at any time.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	323	Why was there no direct intervention when it was clearly flagged two weeks ago that this dispute was on the cards. The strike was imminent and there was a two-week gap in which some action could have been taken. What might be considered a pre-emptive strike was taken when 150 members of staff were suspended on Tuesday, two days before the meeting between the CPSU and the Department of Agriculture and Food. Would it not have been more appropriate to wait until after that meeting had taken place to give the union a chance to voice its side of the story before the suspensions were made?Will the Minister describe in detail what services to farmers are being affected? In a time when farmers have much to be concerned about, it is important that they be given an assurance that measures will be put in place to alleviate their concerns in regard to the services that will be disrupted if this strike is allowed to continue for any length of time.Does the Minister acknowledge that there is a lack of promotional opportunities in regard to the jobs involved in comparison with peer groups in other Departments? Will he meet the CPSU to try to resolve this dispute?
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	324	I regret that this dispute is taking place. There are very good staff relations in the Department of Agriculture and Food and we do  not usually have to cope with this type of situation.As I have said, it is contrary to the partnership programmes. It is outside the terms of those programmes and is causing serious disruption to clients of the Department, which are essentially farmers and representatives of the agriculture industry, and that is a pity.The personnel section in the Department tried yesterday to find a basis for a resolution but it was to no avail. Decentralisation to a number of local offices may be giving rise to the problem. The staff there are entitled to promotion the same as staff in any other part of the Department but in some cases the promotional opportunity may be in another office which may be a cause of some difficulty.We believe there is a basis within the partnership programmes for a resolution of this dispute. I again call on the staff concerned to resume their duties and we will see to what extent we can be helpful in sorting out the problem.

My understanding is that it will have an impact on the beef trade going to factories, which is a very serious matter. I urge the Minister to take whatever steps are necessary to resolve this dispute as soon as possible. This is a very difficult time for the farming community. Irrespective of what was agreed through the PPF it is imperative that the Minister becomes involved to put a stop to the dispute.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	326	I agree with Deputy Timmins that essential services should be provided for farmers, such as those in regard to permits and the general information which they require to conduct their business. When farmers require permits to go to the mart they contact their local office and usually get a very helpful service. Phone and fax services that are usually provided have been out of commission in a number of regions and, unfortunately, since the placing of pickets due to the industrial action no service has been made available. Such issues should not arise when we have partnership programmes. Partnership deals are about precluding this type of action. I urge the staff concerned to call off their action and, in so far as it is possible, we will try to find a resolution to it.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	327	Does the Minister agree that his Department's personnel section should have intervened before yesterday?

#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	329	Some 150 people had already been suspended, which was not helpful in any way and was probably the direct cause of the escalation of the strike. Will the Minister intervene personally  to ensure that this dispute is resolved, for the sake of the staff involved and the farming community?
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	330	There is a difficulty in so far as my intervention is concerned. The scope is limited because we have to accept the terms of the partnership programmes. The deal involved is specific and what the union is seeking is outside the terms of the partnership programme. The union is demanding that we increase the number of posts at staff officer and executive officer levels. The figure that has been mentioned to my officials goes way beyond the PPF, which, as I said, is specific in this regard.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	331	Am I right in saying that this dispute predates the partnership agreements? It is a long-running one that should have been resolved but has not been.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	332	It predates the current partnership arrangement but it is contrary to both the PPF and Sustaining Progress agreements.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	333	The Minister's position is unclear. In reply to a supplementary question from Deputy Upton he said the response to the dispute is limited because of the PPF and the new programme. He also said that if the strike is put on hold he would do what is possible to resolve it.If he had prior knowledge that the strike was imminent why did he not involve himself at an earlier stage, along the lines suggested by Deputy Upton and others, instead of bolting the door when the horse was gone? To what extent does he think he will be effective in attempting to slam the door now that the horse is gone?
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	334	The scope for any deal or resolution is very limited because it has to be within the terms of the PPF, which was the agreement in operation when the difficulties arose. It also contravenes the Sustaining Progress agreement which is currently in operation. The PPF specifies that no cost-increasing claim can be made by trade unions or employees for improvements in pay and conditions, other than those set out in the partnership programme itself. It commits employers, trade unions and employees to promote industrial harmony and precludes strikes and other forms of industrial action. Nothing could be clearer than that.

This is causing, and will cause, great hardship for farmers. The Minister can see the frustration of the staff. He praised the commitment of the staff over the years and I agree that they are very  helpful and work very hard. Can he not understand the frustration of staff in the west of Ireland when they are promoted by the Department and asked to go back to Dublin after they fought so hard to get out of the city. This issue is really about promotion. It is nothing new.There are two Ministers of State present and I would like to see the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, protecting the west of Ireland and not allowing this to happen.

What is the Minister going to do about this? Is he going to allow it to develop? Did he sign off on the Teagasc deal today? That is the next dispute that will involve farmers as they enter a busy time of the year. People's payments will be affected, and the time will come, and rightly so, when others will not pass the picket. That is the next danger. Is the Minister going to get directly involved? If so, when? What is the situation regarding the Teagasc offices?
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	340	We have had a partnership arrangement in this country since 1987 and it has worked extremely well. The whole mechanism for sorting out issues like this when they arise is in place and I urge the unions concerned to use those mechanisms. There should be no way in which strikes occur, pickets are put in place and farmers are prevented from going about their normal business. I call upon the unions to use existing mechanisms to resolve this dispute.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	342	I ask the Minister whether he has signed off on the Teagasc deal. Does he realise the serious consequences of that whole situation for the smaller and less-educated farmers who depend on their local Teagasc offices to fill in many forms? The closure of the office in Bailieborough, County Cavan, for instance, is an absolute disaster for that area. An office that has cost the Department no money is to be sold off.The real issue, however, is the effect that the dispute in the Department of Agriculture and Food will have on farm incomes, if it lasts. The Minister has agreed with my colleague, Deputy Timmins, that the dispute will have implications for the issuing of permits to move cattle to factories or elsewhere. In the long-term, if the dispute is allowed to continue, when will farmers get paid the subsidies, premiums and so on that now literally constitute 100% of their incomes? The Minister was well aware that this situation has been emerging for quite a long time, and not just over the past few weeks.The Department refused to extend my local  office, so the number of jobs in it are limited and the scope for promotion small. It is wrong that an office structure already in place and that could be improved very easily was not extended to bring in the necessary staff for proper upgrading. I had to get the then Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, to intervene in another dispute there six years ago, and nothing has happened since the extension that took place then. There are real problems that must be dealt with in order to allow personnel in these offices to achieve what they see as their entitlement to upgrading within their own areas and not have to travel to Dublin or elsewhere. This is an urgent issue, and if the Minister cannot intervene directly, then I urge him to do so through his staff. These are the bread and butter issues of rural Ireland and we cannot afford to allow these offices to stay closed indefinitely. That is what will happen if no effort is made on behalf of the Minister. Ultimately, the buck stops with the Minister. We can talk about partnership agreements and so on, but it is the personnel working under the Minister who will actually negotiate and decide this matter. Can the Minister intervene diplomatically and offer these people the necessary assurances to get them back to work?

That arrangement has not been observed in this case by the union concerned. I regret that very much. It would be inappropriate for the relevant Minister in any Department to start wading into industrial relations matters under the partnership arrangement. That would not work. The only way of resolving this dispute is for the unions to call on their members to resume their duties. Staff within the personnel section of the Department of Agriculture and Food would then be happy to sit down with them and try to bring about a speedy resolution to this problem.

There is confusion as to whether this dispute is in breach of the partnership agreement, but the latest partnership agreement is only a couple of hours old, so it must be fresh in the minds of everybody, including the Minister, as to when the agreement was reached. I cannot but conclude that no attempt will be  made to resolve the dispute because it is a self-serving exercise for the Department and will save it money. There will be a breakdown in the system of payments in affected regions, which will meet the requirements of the Department. I ask the Minister to give an undertaking to the House that this is not the purpose of the exercise. If it is, it is a very peculiar way of going about business.

I regret the fact that when personnel staff within the Department of Agriculture and Food met the unions as late as yesterday afternoon, they were unable to find a resolution to the problem. There are mechanisms to resolve this matter, and they are the mechanisms established under the partnership arrangements. I call on the unions and the members concerned to seek urgently to address the problems through those mechanisms.

Farmers have suffered enough and cannot put up with any more hardship. To be fair, the relevant staff at the Department do an excellent job and have been loyal to the Minister, the Department and the Government over the years. When they have been asked in the past to do overtime to organise payments and other difficult tasks, they did the job for the Department on most occasions. I ask the Minister not to let this dispute escalate and to immediately have the relevant parties within his Department sit down with the unions and resolve this dispute in order to be fair to the people, particularly those in rural Ireland.The Minister talks about decentralisation, but that will not work unless it is based upon fairness. The people involved in the dispute are rearing families and have other commitments. They do not want to be on strike. They want to be working and to get their salaries next week, but they also want fair play from the Minister and his Department. They are not getting that at the moment. I ask the Minister, as soon as he leaves this House, to have his officials contact the unions to try to sit down and resolve the dispute.

#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	355	I am delighted to speak on this important Bill. The perception of work permits is something at which we should look. The Minister indicated that 36,000 permits have been issued. How many workers does that represent? Some employees have three or four permits so it does not follow that we are talking about 36,000 people. How many overseas workers are working in this country? There is a level of double accounting which can cause a problem.The Minister indicated that 36,000 permits had been issued last year but, in some cases, an employee can have three permits. It is important to clarify this because people will say those who are getting permits are taking jobs from Irish people. The issuing of work permits is very worthwhile and creates a healthy and competitive economy which is what the Minister is looking for. These people are doing jobs which Irish people will not do. When the Minister goes on radio and says she has issued 36,000 work permits, the listener assumes they have been issued to 36,000 people, but that is not the case. The Minister should say there are 20,000 people with 36,000 permits. I know a case where an employee has three permits. That is a point which the Mini ster should clarify because the wrong impression is being given and people looking for jobs think foreigners are taking their jobs. The double accounting in the system is wrong. I am amazed this has not been explained before.How many of those permits are renewals? We could be talking about the same 36,000 people in that a considerable proportion of those permits could be renewals. How many foreign workers are working in this country? Last year the Minister said she granted 40,000 work permits. Are we talking about the same people, duplication and double accounting? That is an issue at which the Minister should look.I refer to the cost to employers of renewing work permits. Of the 36,000 permits granted, I believe renewals comprise half that figure. The cost to employers has increased by 500%. If a job cannot be filled by an Irish employee, the cost to the employer of renewing a work permit should be considerably less. An employer with a factory employing 20 people must pay €8,000 or €9,000 to renew a work permit.Although there are rogue employers who are taking advantage, the majority of employers who avail of work permits are well intentioned and are bringing in people who are creating a competitive workplace. If we do not have a competitive economy, employers will not survive. It is not a case of people employing people because they are cheap, they are employing people because they are skilled and are prepared to do a particular job. What I am saying may be different from what other Deputies have stated but the impression created by the media that 36,000 work permits have been granted to that number of individuals, and the double accounting in the Department where one employee can have four permits is wrong. The figure is considerably less.There is no cheap labour in this country since the introduction of the minimum wage, which is effective. There has been a 50% to 60% reduction in the number of employers seeking permits. The downturn in the economy should not prevent the issuing of permits where there is a justifiable need and a requirement by employers.There is a difference between the rising number of redundancies and the migrant labour requirement. We are talking about a different category of worker. There is still a huge difficulty in the hotel, retail and service sectors, although there has been a complete slowdown in the tourism sector which has been very much accelerated by the war in Iraq. That will have a clear impact on the economy. Small employers have been the backbone of this economy to date. Yesterday I heard Deputy Ring speak about people in private enterprise who take risks but who get very little recognition for doing so.The impression that the majority of employers who seek work permits are rogue employers availing of cheap labour by bringing in migrant workers is wrong.FÁS is both poacher and gamekeeper at present because it is dealing with skills shortages  and matching these up with employers. FÁS administers this scheme and it is very much at its discretion as to what is on its books and who is looking for work. I contacted FÁS last week with regard to a permit renewal and was told that there was a total derogation for bar work. The only exemption was for chefs but jobs such as waitressing were excluded. I mentioned the incoming regulation but was told that FÁS was given a directive from the Department to the effect that all jobs should be actively advertised and it would then get a clearance form to grant a permit. The permit would not be issued by Davitt House until that form was issued.Permits should be issued by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This is not a job for FÁS because it deals primarily in skills needs. CERT, which has now been incorporated into the new tourism body, deals with skills shortages which prevail in the tourism sector. There is inefficiency in that people must wait weeks for a permit from FÁS.With the technology available, the application process for permits should be web-based which it is not. People must queue to make an application at present. I hope the Minister's officials take note of this and bring in web-based applications.The demand for foreign workers is down by 50% and the economy is now totally different from what it was. It is wrong that FÁS is taking the upper hand in throwing out applications because it feels pressure from the Department to ensure that people can get a job. Some people do not want to work or take the jobs on offer. If there is an exemption to the job specification, permits will not be granted to employers in various categories.The economy has slowed down and the projections for income from indirect taxation through VAT and VRT are lower. The backbone of the economy has been the service sector which has created a huge number of jobs with little or no assistance from any Department, by grant or otherwise.The fact that employers are using migrant workers and availing of cheap labour gives out the wrong impression. When bringing in this legislation, the Minister should market it in such a way that those who get permits are not seen as stealing a job from somebody who is looking for work. It should be made known that they are employed on their merits because the employer felt they were most suitable for the job and because the unemployed here did not apply for the job – a major distinction. I also draw attention to the provisions in the Bill for fines to be levelled at employers.The Minister should tell the House how many foreign workers are in the State. While she said on the airwaves that she has granted 36,000 permits, she should tell us the number of people that refers to. It is outrageous that one person can have four permits. That is how inefficient this system has been to date and I hope, under the new  controls, that there will be equality and fairness on all sides.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	356	I am delighted to contribute to this Bill. With regard to work permits, many Irish people are confused about the difference between those who enter the country with work permits and refugees. Foreigners are seen working in shops, factories and farms and it is mistakenly thought they are refugees. Many are people who applied for a work permit or had somebody apply on their behalf. They are working, getting paid and paying their taxes.The Minister should make available a facility for Deputies to get a reply from the Department and to be informed as to the situation in this regard. The Department has failed over the years and the Minister should do something about it. The officials in the Department should have some kind of a line open for elected public representatives. Members of the House are rubbished by most Departments. However, I will give credit where it is due – if a Dáil question is asked of the Departments of Social and Family Affairs and Agriculture and Food, Members are contacted by an official and have the opportunity to get the information they require. The relevant question can be withdrawn or left to be answered but at least the facility is in place. However, one could write to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment today and be lucky to get a reply this time next year. That is not good enough. It is bad business and bad manners for elected public representatives not to get a reply.What proposals has the Minister to give work permits to the workers who come to this country rather than to the employers who seek them? That is what should happen. We have all heard the horror stories regarding those who have been abused by the system, those who have been mistreated, badly paid and housed in bad accommodation. This House is great for bringing in legislation and regulations and for telling employers what to do, but the Government and its Departments have nobody in place to work the regulations. It is fine to bring in new rules and legislation but we must also provide the necessary staff to check that people have permits, that they are working in good conditions and that they are being properly paid and cared for by their employers. It is important that the necessary staff are put in place.I agree with some of the points raised by the Minister in this Bill. I am concerned that many people who could take available jobs do not do so because employers will not pay ordinary Irish people and those coming from abroad. That is why workers must be protected every step of the way. There are some wonderful employers who pay their staff properly and treat them well. However, there are others who do not do so and who have always had a name for not paying staff properly. One can go into a shop anywhere in the country and not see any Irish people working there. There must be somebody in that com munity who needs an income and is prepared to do the job. They cannot do it because some employers are not prepared to pay their staff, will not give them the correct hours and will work them day and night, seven days a week. Workers must be protected.Deputy Perry referred to FÁS which seems to be the watchdog in this regard. Before applying for a work permit, the job must be advertised in a local newspaper and a check must then be made with FÁS to discover if anyone is available. I have a major problem with some of the categories which are not allowed. There are Irish people prepared to do these jobs provided they are paid for their work. That is the big issue.As a Deputy from a rural constituency, I recognise that the Minister is a strong link between Boston and Ireland, and I would be with her part of the way in that regard.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	358	The Minister and her Department hold talks often with the American administration. A tragedy is taking place at present with regard to many Irish emigrants in America. The Minister will visit America again and will talk to the administration there with regard to Irish, American and world issues. Will she try to obtain some permits or leeway for Irish people illegally in America? I realise that the Minister might not think this the right time to raise this matter. However, I was sad at Christmas when I met a woman who is dying from cancer. She has a son with a good job in America, where he has a partner and child. He will not come home because if he does, he knows that he will not be able to get back into America again because he has been there illegally for some years. He has tried on many occasions to get a green card from the US.Perhaps the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment could ask the authorities in the United States about the thousands of Irish people who were given a green card but did not use it. Provisions are needed for such people, similar to those the Minister is making for non-national workers in this country. Some Irish people travel to the US for a week or two weeks to ensure they can keep the card in order. The Minister should pursue this matter with the US Administration. The people to whom I refer are immigrants and are treated in the same manner as immigrants are treated in this country. We must ensure that Irish citizens are protected abroad, just as citizens arriving here from other states are protected. I ask the Minister to pursue this important matter.I hope the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will try to deal with work permit applications as quickly as possible and that sufficient staff levels are put in place to that end. I would like the correspondence between elected representatives and the office to be improved. Some people in the office think they do not have  to respond to public representatives. I have always found the Minister, Deputy Harney, to be courteous in her dealings with Deputies, including me. She is a good Minister and I ask her to deal with the matters I have mentioned.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	359	I welcome the Employment Permits Bill 2003. While it should have come before the House earlier, it is great that it has been brought forward.Ten countries are to be welcomed into the European Union as a consequence of the ratification of the Nice treaty, which was the subject of a great deal of discussion. It is obvious that work permits have been allocated to the citizens of these ten countries in the past. When this Bill has been passed and the accession states have joined the EU, such people will have the right to work in this country without requiring a work permit. Approximately 40,000 people came to Ireland on the work permit programme last year. It is important that Ireland, as an isolated country on the rim of Europe, should have a multicultural and intercultural society.I mentioned that the ratification of the Nice treaty was the catalyst for this process. The Labour Party insisted, with the agreement of the Government, that the Seville declaration on neutrality should be ensconced in the Constitution. My party also brought forward the Bill which led to the European Union (Scrutiny) Act, which allows for much greater scrutiny of measures that are before the Council of Europe. Discussions now take place on matters that would, largely, have been dealt with in the past on the basis of civil servants advising Ministers, who acted in consort with the civil servants and without reference to the House or the relevant Oireachtas committee. All such matters now have to be discussed by the relevant committee before they are brought to Europe and before a Minister can speak on behalf of the Irish people in relation to them. The new scrutiny provisions are welcome and have helped to effect the processes of enlargement and European democracy. They have generated a new perception that there is greater accountability and transparency in relation to EU matters. A great deal of further work needs to be done in that regard, but the measures that have been taken represent a step in the right direction.This Bill facilitates the granting of free access to the Irish labour market to nationals of the EU accession states, with effect from May 2004. Such people will no longer require employment permits from that date. Can the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment tell the House the number of nationals of such countries who have come here in the past with work permits? How many of these people have been deported back to such countries in recent years, having applied for and been refused asylum? Approximately how many people have applied for asylum in Ireland in the last ten years? Such statistics would be interesting. I do not doubt that  many people who apply for asylum in this country are economic refugees. We know that many Irish people continued to go abroad until recent years, over many decades and centuries, in search of employment, asylum and relief from persecution. This country should be one of the most sensitive and sympathetic to people who come here in search of asylum or employment, or both.The categories of permits that are allocated, as well as the categories of people who come to this country to apply for asylum each year, should be examined. It is inevitable that some of the 10,000 to 12,000 people, approximately, who apply for asylum in this country each year will be economic refugees. Would it not be better and more desirable to establish a quota of work permits for people outside the European Union, after it has been enlarged? People who apply to come to Ireland for economic reasons should be able to apply in their own countries, so that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will no longer feel the need for expensive procedures such as Operation Hyphen. The deportations that are taking place as a result of such operations are heart-rending. The system I have suggested would be a means of putting some order on the asylum process, thereby replacing the disorder that exists at present.This Bill contains a provision that allows the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, in the event of "a disturbance" in the labour market's fortunes, to revoke permits within six weeks of their having been issued. It would be wrong to make an order revoking work permits that are less than six weeks old, however, as a person who has been issued with such a permit will have incurred the cost of travelling to Ireland and will, presumably, have been employed in useful remuneration for a period of time. No permit that has been granted should be revoked as a result of "a disturbance" in the labour market, whatever that may mean. Any person with a bona fide permit should be allowed to see it through to the end of the contract period.The sanctions provided for in this Bill – a fine of €250,000 or ten years' imprisonment – seem heavy, given that one may not be imprisoned for ten years for committing murder. This Bill has been geared harshly by the Department against the employment of any person in an irregular fashion, but I do not think such a heavy-handed approach is necessary. I do not believe there is a requirement for such a bludgeoning type of sanction. The Minister could have removed such practices without introducing measures of this kind in a welcoming Bill that is permitting people to work here. I do not believe this legislation should be heavy-handed and deterring.The present situation as regards work permits is unsatisfactory. It is wrong that employers can rule the roost by dictating who can and cannot come to this country, the length of time they can spend here, the conditions they work in and the wages they are paid. That would not be acceptable under any circumstances relating to domestic  employment. If it is not good enough for our citizens, it should not be considered good enough for citizens of the world. The same standards must apply to all people who come here to take up employment. We cannot exempt domestic workers from the Equal Status Act as to do so means that some of our most vulnerable people will not have the protection of equality legislation. In the last report of the Equality Authority, the Government was decried for not allowing the terms of the legislation to apply to domestic workers. This is one of the areas in which people are most vulnerable and poorly paid. Where they need the most support, they get the least.The third Equality Authority report makes very interesting reading in relation to migrant workers who hold permits to work here. Many occasions of discriminations are instanced. Pregnant women and farm workers who have come here on permits have been discriminated against as have factory workers, particularly in the beef industry. Discrimination is widespread and the number of instances is increasing according to the work carried out by the Equality Authority. We must ensure that the same standards apply to every person who works in this country whether they have a permit or citizenship.Anyone can become a bonded labourer whereby they are contracted and tied to their employer. The practice continues to operate in certain provinces of China and India and we have reintroduced it here. The permit holder is tied to the employer and subject entirely to the terms of contract the employer sets out. It is an employer's market and it does not respect the individual as a person. Why can we not give the permit to the person? Why give it to the corporate body of the employer? We should look at the question from the point of view of the person and of human dignity. If we respect the person, we are likely to see much better terms and conditions of contract and much better wages. One of the most ridiculous recruitment statements of all time related to the Nepalese who were recruited through the PC Recruitment agency. They were said to be nice, shy and retiring people who had no problem working for the minimum wage.What regulations does the Minister propose to introduce in relation to recruiting agencies? They purvey labour from abroad for potential employers at the lowest possible rate of pay. They sell the labour on the market at the cheapest price they know the employers can pay. That is not right and it is not fair to people who do not speak the language and find themselves at the whim of the contract of whatever employer has issued the permit.There should be a crackdown on the manner in which recruitment agencies operate and advertise. There are recruitment agencies in other countries which seem to be operating as cowboys. The plight of 100 Ukrainians came to public notice last week and I hope the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has adopted  a sympathetic attitude to them. They have been conned left, right and centre from the moment they began to seek work in Ireland. They have been deprived of their money by conmen. According to the Ukrainians themselves, the agency responsible still operates. There is no reason we cannot contact Interpol or ask the Ukrainian police to deal with the agency. I would like us to be proactive in tackling cowboys abroad. If drugs were being purveyed by criminal gangs, we would co-operate extensively with international police, but there seems to be no interest when human trafficking is the issue. I would like to see the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment taking an active role in the matter to ensure that we do not find hard cases of this sort arising again. If the operation in the Ukraine is indeed of a Mafia sort, as has been presented, its victims are entitled to apply for asylum here. If they return home without the means to pay back the money they have borrowed, they will be subject to all forms of malpractice and persecution.Unfair dismissal seems also to be a problem in the migrant labour market. I would like to know what number of people are sent home. What figures do we have regarding people whose contracts have been terminated? Is anybody monitoring the termination of contracts pertaining to employees who have been acquired for a certain period of time for whatever reason? How is the Minister's Department addressing that matter?The Minister has failed to translate into domestic legislation 14 European Union directives which does not speak well of the responsible operation of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment according to good practice across the State. The directive which protects contract workers has not been introduced into legislation despite the fact that it has been in operation since July 2001, which is almost two years ago. We have breached the deadline for its introduction as we have for the others. To breach the EU directive deadline in 14 instances shows a lack of care in dealing with serious human problems. Will the Minister provide the House with a commitment as to when she will implement the directive ensuring work permit holders are treated fairly and similarly to their European counterparts and to indigenous workers here?United Nations day for the elimination of all forms of discrimination against people occurred on 21 March, which is particularly appropriate given its proximity to St. Patrick's Day. St. Patrick was a person from abroad who came here as a slave and returned once free to give us certain values. March is also a time when Ministers join the great Cabinet diaspora which follows the Irish diaspora throughout the world to celebrate with them abroad. They go also to drum up business. St. Patrick's Day is a time of symbolism for those people who fled this island for one reason or other, mainly because they were looking for  better lives and opportunities to work in far-flung countries.It is appropriate to take the celebration of St. Patrick's Day as our guiding symbol for the elimination of all forms of racism. We must put in place proper protections and education and awareness programmes for all those who come here from other countries whether they come as workers or asylum seekers or for other reasons. The Minister's Department should have a particular role to play because the vast majority of those who come to Ireland are attracted by our economic success in recent years. We must ensure that no forms of racism or xenophobia continue to operate in this country.I welcome the legislation. It is a great day to see the extension of the European Union to include another ten countries. We are in the lucky position of being able to invite people to come here on work permits. I look forward to the day when they can be invited as persons in their own right without being in any way subservient to employers or where employers have control of the circumstances of their work here.

Before I speak about the technical details of the Bill I wish to record our deep appreciation of the contribution made to Irish society by all non-nationals living and working here. They have made major efforts in the development of the social, economic and political life of the country. Quite frankly, there are many services that would not be able to function and develop without their skills. We thank them for this work and we acknowledge their enormous contribution to Irish life.We must put on record our total opposition to the emergence of racism over the last five years. Racist attacks and abuse do not represent the views of the vast majority of Irish citizens. Non-nationals are welcome in our country. As a nation with a history of emigration we have an extra responsibility to ensure equality, justice and fair play.The Bill will facilitate the granting of free access to the Irish labour market to nationals of EU accession states with effect from May 2004. From the date of accession, nationals of these countries will no longer require permits to work in Ireland. I welcome this provision and I hope that all non-nationals working here are treated with respect.I believe that interculturalism is the way forward. However, I have some concerns about some sections of the Bill. I hope that the section which refers to the Irish labour market suffering disturbance after EU enlargement will not be used in a negative way against non-nationals or used as an excuse to harbour resentment. This section has the potential to inflame, and expulsions should never be tolerated. The persons concerned should be treated with sensitivity and respect.I am also concerned about the section dealing with penalties for non-compliance by employers and employees. This is extremely dangerous and I urge the Minister and the Government to drop these penalties. One can imagine our reaction if, for instance, the US Government or any other government decided to implement this type of legislation. Thousands of Irish people could possibly be thrown out and we would expect them to be treated with respect and dignity as Irish citizens abroad.Punishing employers and workers is not the way forward. This section of the Bill should show more vision and compassion. I urge the Minister to listen to the views of the groups working on human rights and working with non-national groups who know the legal and constructive way forward. I ask that this section of the Bill be deleted because it smacks of the fortress Europe approach. It has the potential to penalise workers and their families.Section 3 of the Bill provides that the requirement for the employment permits will not apply in the case of employment of nationals of EU accession states after enlargement. The red light goes on here as I see the potential for exclusion and damage to our economy. There are many reliable and top quality non-national workers working here and they are both a human and an economic asset. We must value and look after people who make a major contribution to our economic life.Those of us who are often stigmatised as being soft on immigrants are attacked and labelled as misguided. This criticism lacks logic and it also shows ignorance of the issue. Most independent objective economists have always valued the significant contribution which immigrant workers make to the economic development of any state. One need only look for proof of this to the Irish in England, in America and in other parts of the world.Part 3 of the Bill lists the financial implications. It will result in a reduction of work permit processing fees of about 30%. This Bill also claims a reduction in demand for work permits thus facilitating a better customer service and quality control.I wish to see a Bill that respects the rights of immigrant workers and does not penalise them in any way. I ask the Government to support the recent NGO alliance report on implementing commitments from the world conference against racism and to implement the recommendations from this alliance for Ireland's national plan against racism. The report contains many constructive proposals. It tackles issues of racism and discrimination at both community and institutional levels and they must be dealt with in terms of education, housing, health care, work and religious practices, in order to ensure equality for all. This Bill could be a block to this type of new Ireland.Other speakers have spoken about the question of illegal trafficking of people and instances  of families dying in the backs of trucks. This is horrific and we should ask why families are forced to take such desperate measures.There are highly qualified non-national people working in low paid jobs – I know of a biologist and a teacher. Our disadvantaged schools need teachers and we need people to do research. I had the privilege of working in a primary school in the north inner city for 20 years. Non-nationals made up 15% of the pupil numbers. They made nothing but a positive contribution to the school. Many of the parents were working and living legally here – many of them wore Dublin Bus uniforms. It strongly challenged the myth that many people were living off social welfare and exploiting the system.We must ensure in the legislation that all workers are treated equally. We must examine the issue of low pay. Irish workers will not work in some jobs because the pay is so low and it seems some employers are exploiting their workers.I have concerns and reservations about this Bill but I am grateful for the opportunity of speaking in the debate.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	361	At the outset I wish to express my concern at the manner in which this Bill is being brought before the House. In this 29th Dáil the Government has presented 19 Bills, 13 of which have been subject to a guillotine of one form or another, either on Second Stage, Committee Stage or Report Stage. In some cases of important legislation the guillotine has been used on all Stages. The Minister is obviously exercised by the deadline of 16 April but that is no excuse not to have introduced legislation of this type well before this time.We had this debate on the occasion of the second referendum on the Treaty of Nice. I would have thought the opportunity would have been taken then to present and fully draft legislation of this type. It is surprising that since that time, the Government's position has shifted in many ways in relation to the type of restrictions or lack of them that it would place on immigrant workers from EU accession countries. At the start the position was that all workers would be allowed in without any such restrictions. That was the correct attitude, which was consistent with the EU's goal of free movement of labour throughout the EU. During the course of that campaign, and responding to some who were playing on racist fears, the Government let it be known out of the side of its mouth that it was willing to consider introducing measures that would restrict the flow of workers or review their entry into this country after a considerable period.Now there is a third position, which is a bit of both. The Government indicates it will let workers into the country without restrictions in the beginning but it reserves the right to review the position after a number of years. The thinking in Government is mixed up in this regard. It is still trying to send a signal to those who are ignor ant of the need for foreign workers to come to this country because of what they can contribute and those who seem to play on the fears of others that such people are coming in and taking what are perceived to be Irish jobs in the midst of rising unemployment. The reality is that the people who need to be encouraged to come to this country work in sectors where Irish people are not available to work and may not be available for several years unless we take measures in our third level education system to ensure we have the expertise in important areas of science and technology.We tend to forget the fear of a horde of foreign workers coming to this country. It is not recognised that already people from countries who are not part of the European Union have the right to enter this country without work permits. Members of the European economic area, such as Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, have that right. While they might be relatively wealthy countries, the fact that we do not have a large Norwegian or Liechtenstein presence in the workforce indicates this is a right people use depending on whether they have a need for employment or they fit the gaps in employment that exist in our economy. We must also face the fact that people might not like living in our society.I happen to be a child of Irish emigrants – my mother was a nurse and my father a carpenter – who sought and achieved employment in the United States. As a result they achieved a good standard of living for themselves and their family without the type of administrative restrictions this Bill seeks to address. If the Minister had any excuse for introducing this legislation at such a late date, I would have thought she would have used the opportunity to address the central problem in the work permits system in that work permits in the hands of employers is a form of economic chattel. This should not be the case in the 21st century. If we want workers and if we value the dignity of labour, work permits should be in the name and possession of the people who are doing the work. This system, which operates elsewhere, is the type of system which should operate here. It is the type of reform which should be introduced in this legislation. The fact that the Minister has chosen not to adopt such a measure indicates that she is prepared to listen to many employers' organisations who exploit foreign workers.A constituent of mine, an Indian national, was brought into this country as a skilled engineer to work with ISPAT International. After a short time he was fired by the company and found himself in straitened economic circumstances. He then went through a series of jobs where he found employers who were willing to take up his work permit. These jobs had nothing to do with his qualifications and were very lowly paid. His story is not unique in the Irish economy.In light of all this talk about EU accession  countries, I am disappointed the Minister has not used a lead-in period prior to accession. Many nationals of accession countries who have come to Ireland to seek direct employment have had to go through the rigmarole of the work permit system, even though eventually they will be part of the EU and will not require work permits. The Minister should have been more far-sighted. She should have introduced a lead-in period in advance of accession which would have given people from the Baltic states and Mediterranean countries an opportunity to work in this country. The fact that she has not done so means she is sending out mixed signals about the nature of employment and unemployment here.I commend the amendment of my party spokesperson on enterprise, trade and employment, Deputy Ryan. It proposes that there should be an immigrant worker's rights unit within the Labour Relations Commission. There is an obvious problem which the Government is not willing to identify or tackle, not just in terms of rates of pay but in relation to working conditions. There is a large infrastructural project under construction in my constituency, the Ballincollig bypass. The work is being carried out by a Turkish company. It is the first such project to go to a company outside of Ireland and the EU. While the workers seem to have good working conditions, the accommodation conditions associated with their employment is another matter in that there could be 12, 18 or 20 people living in single households. The central principle when inviting foreign workers to this country should be that the rights they enjoy should be no less than the rights we seek to give Irish citizens in employment.On those grounds, the Government has produced a very narrow Bill. It has missed a huge opportunity to improve rights for all workers regardless of their background and nationality. I am disappointed this is the best the Government can do and I hope there will be better legislation in the future.

Tar éis 50 bliain de eisimirce, an diaspora agus pobail Gaelacha agus Éireannacha a gcothú thar lear agus an tionchar a bhí acu ar an dtír seo, tá athrú ag teacht ar ár dtír féin. Tá daoine ó gach uile cearn den domhain ag féachaint ar Éirinn mar áit chun maireachtaint agus obair innti, sa bhealach a d'fhéach ár sinsir ar Mheiriceá, ar Shasana nó ar an Astráil san 19ú nó 20ú aois. Is athrú deimhneach é sin ar chóir go mbeadh fáilte roimhe. Is léiriú cé chomh aibigh is atáimid mar shochaí an tslí a chaithimid leis an athrú sin amach anseo nó mar a chaithimid leis faoi láthair agus mar a dhéanaimid déileáil leis an athrú daonra nó an athrú cultúir atá ag teacht dá bharr.Dá bhrí sin, táim ag impí ar an Rialtas polasaí deimhneach imirceach a mhúnlú, polasaí a thabharfadh aitheantas do na buntáistí a bhaineann le himirceacht, polasaí atá ag leatha fáilte seachas a bheith ag déileáil le himircigh mar bhagairt agus  ag déanamh iarracht bacanna a chur os a gcomhair, mar atá an polasaí atá ann faoi láthair ag déanamh.Contrary to popular misconception, immigrants are of economic benefit to Ireland. Immigrant driven economies are dynamic because immigrants tend to be young, entrepreneurial and economically productive. Our experiences of migration and the incredible productivity of the Irish abroad shows the truth of this. Immigrants do not drain scarce public resources. They generally make a net contribution to the public purse.Dá ndéanfaí imircigh a mhealladh agus cead a thabhairt dóibh oibriú a luaithe agus atá siad anseo d'ardófaí an ioncaim cánach agus chuirfí leis an gcaiteachas sa gheilleagar.A positive, compassionate and anti-racist immigration policy would develop positive criteria for immigrant selection, based on skills and other suitable factors, on more than the mere European nationality. The current work permit system should also be reformed so that permits would be granted to employees, not employers. This is necessary to reduce the exploitation that has been occurring, as my colleague, Deputy Morgan, outlined earlier. There was an opportunity today to introduce this reform. Sinn Féin has tabled an amendment to this effect and I would welcome and encourage support for it from both sides of the House.The positive immigration policy proposed by us would end the punitive direct provision policy which prevents refugees from working while their claims are being processed. Most asylum applicants could be productive in employment if given the chance. Those who earn an income and pay taxes could likely offset the number who are unable to work or find suitable work.We also need legislation that will recognise and extend the right to work so that not only will all refugees be entitled to a work permit, but asylum seekers whose claims are still being processed after six months would be allowed to work. Most importantly, as part of a positive immigration policy, there is a need to create a separate agency, not under the auspices of the Garda Síochána, to deal with immigration matters. Immigrants as a class are not criminals and there is no reason they should be treated as such.Sinn Féin is totally opposed to the plan by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to introduce compulsory finger printing for non-nationals. It is a draconian measure and racist in the extreme. As part of a positive immigration policy, a single immigration and citizenship agency could deal with all aspects of immigration in a coherent, cohesive and efficient manner that complies with, and exceeds, the minimum international standards. Such an agency could deal with student permits, work permits, holiday visas, permanent residency applications of fiancées, spouses, partners and other family members, refugee applications and applications for complementary protection. That would allow those not found fit under a strict definition of what is meant  by a conventional refugee to remain in Ireland on the basis of other humanitarian and compassionate grounds, if applicable.Fáiltíonn Sinn Féin roimh an chuid is mó de ghnéithe an Bhille seo ach creidimid nach dtéann sé fada go leor. Polasaí inimirceach atá deimhneach, atruach agus, chomh maith leis sin, frithghníomhach, atá de dhíth. Iarraim go dtacófar leis an mBille agus go ndéanfar machnamh ar ár moltaí.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	363	I acknowledge the need for this legislation. Over the past couple of years it has become apparent that there is a need to order the work permit process and the system of entitlement for non-nationals who wish to remain in the country. Following the Nice treaty, there is a new responsibility on the country to make statutory provision for the accession countries. We have no option but to proceed on this basis. It is the least we might do and it should be implemented as a matter of urgency.Given Ireland's history, we should never forget that for several generations, the people of this country had to travel the world to seek employment. They were fortunate to succeed as they did. Almost 80 million people of Irish descent are spread throughout the world. It is a huge diaspora. Were they all to return home it would create insurmountable problems for the Government and the country. It serves us well to ponder the circumstances faced by migratory workers. It behoves us to keep in mind that when immigrants seek a living here, many of us and our predecessors went abroad, more in hope than expectation, and were lucky in their travels. It is a good thing that we have been able to facilitate many of those who have come to this country to work.While the Bill does not deal with this, we should recognise the degree of exploitation of some immigrants who have been the victims of illicit trade in human beings. Some were dead on arrival to the country as a result of the activities of scurrilous and unscrupulous people who are dealing in human trafficking.The Minister has said that as our economic circumstances change we may have to revise and rethink our attitudes. In a few years those in the applicant countries will be able to travel and seek employment as they wish within the European Union. That is as it should be because otherwise, the question of the European project falls to one side. While I do not wish to become involved in the debate on what would happen in such an eventuality, it is no harm to recognise that we need to be careful. The European scene is not as peaceful as it was, nor is the question of European integration and cohesion as settled. The issues that divided Europe in the past appear to have been raised again. With that, there will be an ongoing debate on the best way to proceed.I have no doubt as to the direction Europe should take and I have exchanged my views with the Minister on previous occasions. It is essential that those who live on the Continent of Europe and are signatories to the various European treat ies and agreements remember that as Europeans we have a common interest. We must stick together and work out our own future. Some of our colleagues in Europe have moved in diverse directions and have been over-expressive on these issues. That has not been helpful and it could have serious consequences for the type of Europe envisaged by the European Union's founding fathers.All-party support and the combined efforts of the Government and Opposition parties contributed to the successful ratification of the Nice treaty, but it required a huge effort. The treaty provides for the freedom of people, money, services and goods throughout an expanded Union.I disagree with the view that should our economy constrict further, it may be necessary to impose restrictions on the number of immigrant workers. It has been suggested that FÁS and other training schemes would not be necessary if jobs were available for participants. However, they may not have the necessary qualifications for vacancies that are better filled by suitably qualified people. This has been proven in other economies outside the European Union. The Minister should bear in mind that in addition to forces beyond our control, the economy could be constricted by action taken in this country. An example would be a decision to prevent what could become an excessive number of overseas workers from continuing to work. At present they fill a role and contribute to the economy.Some speakers referred to unscrupulous employers or, in some cases, employees. We should always recognise in dealing with non-national workers that they are far from their own land. They come here with the purpose of doing better for themselves and their families and, given the circumstances in their homelands, one can scarcely blame them for so doing, no more than one could blame Irish workers 100, 50 or even ten to 15 years ago for going elsewhere to achieve something for themselves. There is a tendency in this country to believe that non-nationals are here because we allow them to be. We have been in the same position and should never forget that.I know the Minister is fully aware of the issue I wish to raise and I have asked questions on it regularly, namely, where a non-national worker has a row with his or her employer who does not treat him or her well. There can be two sides to the argument and it does not concern me who is right or wrong. The end result is that the employee finds himself or herself out of work. There have been cases resulting in prosecutions where employees were not treated well and found themselves out of work. We must always recognise the vulnerability of someone far from their own land in this situation. There have been many such cases in this country and I am sure that every Member has dealt with them as much as the Minister and I have.Would it be possible to devise a smoother mechanism or system where an employee finds  himself or herself out of work so that he or she can obtain other employment? This is essential because in many cases the employment is readily available. Employers seek the services of the workers and want to employ them as quickly as possible, but because of the procedures in place, whereby in some cases the workers must return to their home country to reapply, the situation is made extremely difficult. It should and must be possible to rationalise the system to try to speed it up. The first qualification would be that the person was out of work before he or she would qualify for new employment. If we do not rationalise the system and, instead, make life extremely difficult for these workers, they will become fed up and return to their own land. We would be better off in cases where they return home if they do so of their own volition and with fond memories, rather than the opposite.The presence of non-national workers has been good for the country and has helped correct our attitudes in certain circumstances. It is no harm for children to attend school with children of other nationalities, to have social interchange with people of other nationalities and for people to recognise that we are part of a large world. This is especially the case in the context of membership of the European Union.Whether we like it or not, we are members of the EU and must go along with all that entails. I am aware that, on issues such as neutrality, we like to opt in and out as suits the occasion. Agreements are not like that. We are either committed or not. We are a member of the European Union regardless of whether we like it and I hope we can make a worthwhile contribution to its future shape and development. If we do not do that, we are being less than honest with ourselves and selling ourselves short. We have a lot more to offer.For that reason, it has been good to have non-national workers in the country mingling with our population. It teaches us and them the need to recognise each other's position and existence and the fact that not everyone is as fortunate as we have been for the past five to ten years nor were we before that.The various processes that must be undergone by people from outside the European Union to achieve naturalisation are wrong. I do not criticise anyone in particular when saying that. The processes are especially wrong when, by virtue of their position as asylum seekers, some non-nationals are not allowed to work while they await determination of their status. It is ironic that in almost every case, these unfortunate people want to work. They tell us as much in our clinics. They want to obtain the necessary status to be able to remain in the country and work. They say clearly that they do not wish ever to return to their country for a variety of reasons, in many cases compelling ones. We would be failing in our duty if we did not recognise their position. It is very difficult for them.I have often tried to discover what happened to those who were expelled or deported. It has  been said that they turn up again in another part of Europe, that they come back in by another route and possibly under a different name. I would like to be certain that that is the least that happens to them because I am not certain it is. I believe there have been situations where tragic circumstances have overtaken some of these people. That is sad, especially given our turbulent history and the knowledge we have of such matters. It is unfortunate and sad but that is the way it is.It is important for us to realise and recognise that refugees who become part of the labour force by virtue of qualifying under various headings are entitled, once they become citizens, to every service within the State and as much as anyone else. I know there is no attempt anywhere to prevent them from so qualifying. The procedure they undergo to reach this position is tedious, extremely long-winded and difficult. It is difficult to sell the notion to the public that these people cannot work for a period of anywhere between two to five years. They cannot work, much as they want to and contribute to society and the country in which they live, because of immigration laws.I am aware there must be controls and other speakers referred to this. I am also aware that Australia, the United States and a number of European countries have immigration controls. I also know the European Union failed in its efforts to apply a universal rule across the board where everyone was treated equally and each European country treated asylum seekers or refugees in an even-handed fashion.The Dublin Convention never really did the job it was supposed to do but that is the way it is now. The danger is that the general public tends to blame the people in those circumstances for not working when they could be working, even though they want to work, instead of blaming the system that forces them to be that way. I do not have to go through the details again of the colossal cost to the Exchequer.I hope something can be done in the not too distant future whereby a refugee or asylum seeker who has been vetted for security reasons – we do not want drug barons or criminals as we have enough of them in the country and there is a simple system whereby applicants can be vetted – could, pending the processing of their application, be given a work permit. I see nothing wrong with that. The people who are coming into the country in those circumstances actually want that. It is the obvious thing to do. It costs a lot less, it keeps everybody happy, it is good for the economy and the morale of the applicants and it is good for society in general. Although this is not directly related to this Bill it relates to those non-nationals who may seek employment here.I know another Bill is promised and I hope it will come before the House in the not too distant future. I hope the whole issue, referred to by speakers on all sides of the House, will be dealt  with in the context of a comprehensive Bill to deal with the issue of work permits and the availability of work permits to those whose application for asylum or refugee status is pending. Rather than have somebody accommodated in sometimes very unfit but always expensive conditions, it would be far better to have them working in the meantime and contributing to the economy. If it transpired that they were not entitled to be here for some legal reason or whatever, that decision should be made when the time comes.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	364	I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this Bill which I welcome. Tá fáilte mór roimh an Bille seo. I am grateful such a Bill has been introduced. It is badly needed. It says a lot about us as Europeans to our partners in Europe and the eight countries that will join the EU. It is a wonderful thing we are doing for them. It is very Christian and Irish. I congratulate the Government on this. Certainly, the position could have been otherwise. There could have been restrictions as there are in other European countries but Ireland chose to do the honourable thing and to be true to our tradition of Ireland of the welcomes. These people are a group who have contributed greatly to us already and we have a proud tradition of welcoming people.We have changed from emigrant to immigrant status. Our people emigrated all over the world. I am involved in the safe home project which deals with Irish emigrants in large population centres abroad. I pay tribute to the Minister for her help with that project. It has been important for many of our citizens who went away, fell on hard times and wished to come back again but did not have the means to do so.There is a proviso in the legislation that if the labour market becomes precarious we can bring in safeguards to ensure that we can introduce work permits for people from other countries. While other speakers have said this is regrettable, I wonder how people would feel about it if the provision was not there and the labour market seized up. Would they say to the Government that it should have introduced a provision? The rationale behind that would be, there is no point in shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted.It is important that we treat all our workers with equal respect whether they are from other countries or our own. The situation where work permits are in the name of the employer gives an employer, as other speakers have said, the opportunity to put pressure on the employee or to threaten them with unemployment or deportation. As someone who worked in the United States as a student and who ended up going to an employment agency, one or two weeks wages went towards paying the agency for getting me the job. Anything we can do to stop this type of exploitation is to be welcomed. Anything we can do to make things easier in regard to the bureaucracy of form filling and so on would also be welcome.We have a great responsibility to all our  workers to give equal opportunity no matter where people come from. The people coming from the accession countries may be much like we are. Irish people have been renowned for their work ethic. They went to the United States, England and elsewhere to work. After the Second World War when England needed people to build up the country the Irish were there to do it. Equally, we need people from the accession countries to help us build up our country. We have needed them for the past decade when we did not have enough of our own workers. It is a two way process.It is important that the regulations are there, particularly to ensure that there is no exploitation of workers and that there is no opportunity for employers to exploit them. I welcome the introduction of a system of fines in regard to where employers and employees enter into a contract which is not legal as regards work permits. Up to now the employer has got away scot-free with exploitation. I understand the fines range from €3,000 to €250,000. This is a significant amount and is no doubt a disincentive to the type of shenanigans that go on.The world is a big pond. The Irish have gone all over the world and now it is our turn to welcome people who deserve the same chance as we got in America, England and elsewhere. It would be remiss of me not to comment on the fact that while this is happening it is important that we ensure our own people find labour. My own area, for instance, is probably the most economically deprived area of Ireland. We are told that west of a line stretching from Killala to Newport homo sapiens will be extinct by the end of the century. That is the trend and if present economic circumstances continue that will happen.There was a lot of talk today about the Railway Bill, about what is being proposed for the railways and about the need for balanced regional development. Whatever can be done in our area to ensure that we can keep our people locally and that there is a future for them in the area must be done. This is not to say that I do not welcome equal rights for everybody no matter where they come from.I welcome this Bill which is a forward step. We are honouring our proud tradition and nothing but good can come of it.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	365	I thank all the Members of the House who contributed to this debate. Best practice does not mean having all Stages of a Bill on the one day as I explained on the Order of Business. This was an exceptional situation where we became aware only recently of the legal requirement regarding legislation of this kind, that the Bill was necessary if we wanted to have a safeguard and allow citizens from new applicant countries free access to our labour market from day one, and at the same time have some control in the event of a sharp or sudden  shock to our labour market. This was on the basis of legal advice.The Bill has generally been welcomed by the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party, Sinn Féin, the Green Party and the Independents. I accept that Members have put forward their own views regarding some aspects of the Bill. The Bill before the House relates to specific issues that must be dealt with now. It is not a substitute for the more comprehensive legislation which is being prepared in my Department and which we hope to publish after the Easter break. A number of the points raised by Deputies are the subject of proposed amendments and will be dealt with in more detail on Committee Stage, which will follow.I wish to deal with some of the issues raised by the spokespersons. Deputy Coveney and others raised the issue of how long it takes to get a work permit or renewal of a permit. The Department did have the time down to 15 working days in the second half of last year but it has increased again to about 30 working days, due mainly to the continuing growth in demand. In January 2003 the Department accepted some 4,000 applications for new permits compared with about 3,000 in the same month in 2002. In the three months from January to March 2003, the Department issued 9,500 permits, only about 300 less than in the same period last year. At present, permits are being issued at a rate of 950 to 1,000 per week. However, employers must do some more forward planning. Deputy Coveney asked about the possibility of a hotline to the permits section for Deputies but I am not convinced this would be of assistance. Decisions are made on the basis of the information supplied with the application and the employer should submit this directly. Rarely does additional information come through public representatives.Deputy Broughan mentioned the abuse of the existing system. He can be assured that where my Department has evidence, permits will be refused and employers will find that employment rights legislation will be enforced. On the question of labour mobility, I can advise the House that work permits personnel do change employers all the time. This is the age of the mobile telephone and information spreads quickly. Our data suggests that about 2,500 or 2,600 such persons changed employers in 2001 and the final figure for 2002 was in the region of 3,000 to 3,500 people. In the first half of last year, permit personnel were changing employers at a rate of 70 per week. I suggest this hardly amounts to a system of tied or bonded labour.Other European countries that issue permits to employers, particularly for semi-skilled or unskilled personnel, include Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Finland, France, Spain and Italy. It should be noted that the United States also has temporary foreign worker programmes in addition to the green card programme where the majority of successful applicants gain their card  because of existing family ties in the United States.Deputy Broughan also mentioned some specific abuses of immigration. I can advise that my Department had no part in bringing certain Ukrainian personnel into Ireland. Apparently, they agreed to buy fake Irish work permits in the Ukraine from fellow nationals. We have had a new high security permit in place since January 2003 which is intended to make such fraud more difficult and expensive. Without going into detail I should say that some others he mentioned were certainly the subject of exploitation while here but some of these, the Brazilians, were here illegally.The State cannot be expected to accept that everyone is a victim and has to be fixed up. We try to be sympathetic but this can be exploited by those who will keep sending people in on the basis that eventually everybody will be facilitated in staying here.In regard to the second Employment Permits Bill, questions were raised about what that Bill will include. It will provide for criteria for the issue of permits, it will require the disclosure of relevant information, it will deal with refusals and the basis on which refusals are dealt with, it will deal with the revocation of permits in certain circumstances, it will provide for an appeals system, it will deal with deductions from employees' wages by employers or employment agencies in connection with the issue of permits and related matters. Issues such as employer penalties are now addressed in the Bill before the House.Any proposal to issue employment permits directly to employees raises the following questions. To whom do we issue permits and in respect of what skills? How many per year? Do we give quotas to other countries and, if so, which countries? For how long may a person seek a job? What do we do if a person does not find a job within the period allowed? Can families travel immediately and, if so, who is responsible for their subsistence in Ireland? What impact would such a programme have on the housing market, particularly at the lower end of the rented private sector?In terms of the resources, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has had to put in place the equivalent of a Government Department to handle applications from 10,000 to 12,000 applicants per year. Are we prepared to devote an equivalent amount of resources to processing employment applications from prospective employees? The present system is operated by about 30 employees in my Department. Normally alternative systems are based on applications being made while the prospective immigrant is still living abroad. We would want to be sure that the prospective benefits were commensurate with the likely costs of such a system.Reference was made by Deputy Broughan to recent abuses. One Nigerian gentleman who was deported recently by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform had two passports, two  work permits, was an asylum applicant and owned a house on Carndonagh Road in Cabra or Finglas. It is important to have a penalty process in place, as Deputy Cowley acknowledged. At present, there is a major gap in our legislation in that it is not an offence for an employer to employ a person without a permit. Clearly that is an unsatisfactory situation as I said this morning. It may well be the case that somebody who does not have a permit for an employee does not pay the appropriate taxes and make welfare contributions. There may be a host of other problems that flow in the wake of that type of behaviour and other employment laws may not be enforced either. For a host of reasons a penalty system must be in place to make the legislation enforceable and effective.I thank the House and express my appreciation to the parties for dealing so supportively with the issues at stake. It is an important Bill. It has been well received in the applicant countries. I have had letters from a number of the ambassadors in Dublin who are pleased that the Government is making this decision in favour of their country when they come to join the European Union.On the issue of Malta and Cyprus, there is no need to have Malta and Cyprus included because from day one it will be agreed under the accession treaty that their citizens will be free to come and work in any EU country. Due to the fact that they are small countries it was never envisaged they would have a major impact on the labour market in any European country. Therefore, there is no need to include them in the legislation being put through the House. It does not apply.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	366	Amendment No. 2 is an alternative to amendment No. 1 and amendment No. 16 is related. It is proposed to take amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 16 together, by agreement.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	367	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 4, subsection (1), line 5, after "Minister" to insert "to the employee".I am pleased the three amendments are being discussed together because they are similar. My amendment seeks to rectify the unacceptable situation where work permits would be issued by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the employer rather than to the employee. I will not elaborate on this because we have had a good discussion on it on Second Stage. It is certainly clear that Members on this side of the House are very favourably disposed to the  idea. The Bill as it stands makes the worker absolutely dependent on the employer, and employers could actually threaten to have a worker deported or to have his passport confiscated. I hope the Minister will accept my amendment.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	368	My amendment and that of Deputy Morgan seek to initiate a debate and make the Minister reflect on the massive increase in the number of migrant workers that have entered the country in the past four and a half years and the manner in which this is dealt with through the employer mechanism. Section 2 of the Bill refers to the necessity of work permits and the sanctions to be imposed if one does not have one. During the Second Stage debate, colleagues referred frequently to individuals from different cultures, with a different language and perhaps no English, who are in an extremely dangerous and vulnerable position because of some unscrupulous employers. Trade union colleagues, particularly in SIPTU and the Irish Nurses Organisation, feel that because of many cases that have come before them, we need to initiate a system in which the worker would be the recipient of the work permit to prevent indentured labour, or bonded serfdom as I think my party leader called it this morning.While looking at recruitment agency websites, I noticed that some workers created their own little sites looking for work in Ireland. It seems there are many people who would like to make their own way both within the ten applicant countries and outside the European economic area. The officials who briefed us earlier made the point that the employee is put at an enormous disadvantage even after a year and throughout the permit renewal process. That may well be improving because of the work of the Department and the Minister but it still seems to be the case. I have asked the Minister to consider an individual-based approach, particularly because people may link up with companies in Ireland in the transition period of seven years which pertains to the eight countries. People should have an input into their careers.If one looks at our own tradition of emigration, one will see that we are very much an emigrant people. Our previous President, Mrs. Robinson, used to refer frequently to the Irish diaspora throughout the world and to our emigration to a few countries in particular over recent centuries. It is right that people are allowed to seek work, make it on their own and not be forced into indentured labour, as happened several hundred years ago. I urge the Minister to consider inserting "granted to the employee, which shall not be limited to employment by a particular employer" after "permit" in section 2(1), line 5. This would create the grounds for people leaving one job to seek another and prevent the recurrence of outrageous events such as that which I mentioned on Second Stage in which a group of  Moldovan workers ended up in Mountjoy Prison for not having work permits when the meat company in which they were employed suffered a major downturn. I urge the Minister to rethink her approach, preferably in this Bill, or, at the very least, in the major Bill she has promised to bring before this House for the past four years.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	369	We fully support the Labour Party amendment. One would have to be very naive not to think it outrageous that an employer could have total control over whether an employee could have a job or whether he or she would have to leave the country. Employees in such circumstances are bound to be under fierce pressure to work more hours and to work for less money at times and are in constant fear of losing their jobs and of not being allowed to remain in the country. We must remember that most of these people are extremely vulnerable. They are not totally familiar with the language and definitely not familiar with employees' rights. If we do not deal with this problem urgently, more abuses of the system will crop up on a daily basis. I urge the Minister to deal with it as soon as possible.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	370	I am not in a position to accept this amendment for the reasons I outlined in my response to the Second Stage debate. I have given much thought to this issue and if I thought the amendment would work, I would be very anxious to accept it. The reality is that 3,000 to 3,500 people changed employer last year. It is not difficult to do so if one comes here. If one is not treated well, one can move on to another job and get another permit. Some people come here with a permit and often go to FÁS to look for a different job before going to the employer who got the permit for them in the first place.It would be difficult to accept what the Deputies are suggesting because we would have to answer the following questions. To whom should we issue permits and on what basis? How many should we issue? Should we give quotas to countries? If so, which countries? For how long may a person seek a job if we grant him a permit and he comes here? What do we do if a person does not find a job within a reasonable period? Can families travel immediately? If so, who is responsible for their subsistence here? What impact would such a programme have on the housing market, particularly at the lower end? The reality is that we issue working visas at the moment to certain skilled personnel in the IT sector, building professionals, such as engineers and architects, and nurses and medics. We do so because they are unlikely to be out of work for a long time and if they become unemployed it is usually only for a short period. Therefore, it is much easier to issue permits in such circumstances.Additionally, there would be a huge administrative burden if the amendment was accepted  because I anticipate, given the interest in Ireland around the world, that there would be many thousands of applicants. I heard recently from an embassy official in China that about 50,000 or 60,000 Chinese people applied for a visa to come to Ireland last year. I do not know how we would be able to control this and on what basis officials in my Department could decide who should receive visas or permits. Huge bureaucracy would be generated.When enlargement takes place it will bring in between 70 million and 80 million more people. Countries such as Romania and others will join subsequently. I do not envisage there will be much need for permits then. We should be able to fulfil the needs of the Irish labour market from the wider European Union, when people will be able to come freely and work in this economy.Unfortunately, I am not in a position to accept these amendments. I understand the motivation of the Deputies and it is something I had applied my mind to some time ago. When one looks at the difficulties it would cause and the problems it would raise I believe the current system is the best. We genuinely offer new permits to those who have been either badly treated or who may want to move to another employer. It is not difficult, if a person can find another job, to get a permit to work in this country.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	371	In essence, we are asking the Government to put in place a comprehensive immigration policy. The experience of the past four or five years, with people seeking asylum, students seeking work and, above all, people seeking work permits, indicates that perhaps we need a fundamental review of the Minister's Department and of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.The Minister rejects the idea that we could have an Irish green card, for example, and a quota type system. Nevertheless, when one looks at the whole range of people coming to the country one sees many people who are economically motivated. They are out to make a new life for themselves and their families, just like our people did in so many countries around the world in past decades. It is a fair enough objective but in terms of the cohesion of our community and the integration of people who settle among us, perhaps it would be better, as my colleague, Deputy Howlin, proposed a couple of years ago, to seriously examine such a system. We see the pattern. I referred this morning to the non-EEA countries with whom we already have a relationship of three or four years. There are certain countries – even among the eight there are Latvia, Lithuania and Poland – where there is a preference to come to this country. It is something I urge the Minister to look at seriously.I commend the Minister on her Department's website. It is very helpful to be able to see all the companies that have been granted work visas. The figures I quoted this morning were for the month of January. The website enables us to have  a transparent system and I know the tremendous efforts made by the work permits system in recent times. One of the Department's documents advises employers to make renewal applications one month in advance of the expiry date. Employers are warned that applications received after this will be refused, in which case the whole system must start again. That type of rule seems to clash with other comments in the document.Workers – I include those looking for renewal of permits – can be faced with unacceptable delays and the Minister should consider, in justice and humanity, a system based on individuals and not on companies. I urge the Minister to accept this amendment.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	372	Without adopting these amendments how would people be facilitated if they came to this country to set up their own businesses and were, themselves, employers? I am referring to entrepreneurial people to whom the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment alludes in its title. How would such people be facilitated without the adoption of these amendments? I have only been a Member of this House for nine or ten months, and maybe the Minister will stand up in the next few minutes and say she is fully accepting these amendments and we will all live happily ever after, at least as far as this section of the Bill is concerned.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	373	To be fair to the Deputies, the Bill to be introduced after Easter will be much more comprehensive and will deal with immigration related issues in so far as they affect the labour market. It will be dealt with in the appropriate fashion and we will have a lot more time. We will be able to tease out some of these issues on Committee Stage. There are obviously grey areas here, and they must be considered.Generally speaking, if someone comes here and is not satisfied with his or her employer, or the terms on which the permit was issued are not being honoured, provided he or she can find another employer to take him or her, he or she will be issued with a work permit. If complaints are made to my Department by a fellow employee in a place of work that is taken on board as well.As a matter of interest, we have translated the labour law into nine different languages so that those who come to the country and do not speak English can easily understand their rights. I believe that is important and it is being seen as a very valuable service by many of the people who come to Ireland on work permits.I will have to revert to the Deputy regarding issues to do with self-employment. I am not aware of huge numbers of people coming here who want to create businesses. I do not know if that is the point Deputy Morgan was making.

If Deputy Morgan is talking about someone who wants to come and set up a business there are immigration issues relating to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in relation to such a person. Maybe I could revert to the Deputy in relation to the precise detail he seeks.

In page 4, subsection (2), line 6, after "State" to insert ", nor may an employment agency facilitate such employment in the State,".I spoke at length this morning about a key problem for migrant workers and their representatives, which I have brought to the attention of Ministers or have outlined in this House. In the area of recruitment agencies and middle men, fixers and agents is a territory the Minister should also have included in the legislation, particularly in relation to sanctions. People who are outside the State are outside its jurisdiction but I hope that in the Ukrainian case, to which a number of Deputies referred today, the Ukrainian authorities will be encouraged to deal with the thieves who robbed those Ukrainian workers and brought them to this country under false pretences.There are also agencies with Irish connections. I referred to the appalling reports earlier this year about a person with Irish connections who was operating in the Far East and put out appalling advertising to Irish employers about Nepalese workers. The advertising referred to how easy such workers were to manage, how hard they could be worked and how little they would work for. That is very bad.As I recalled this morning, it was from the Minister's officials in another section of the Department that I learned about this area of activity when we were dealing with a Bill relating to leave for carers. I was struck by the explosion in the number of these companies which had come to the fore in the absence of more recent regulation. There was a feeling then in the Department that we should have taken some action about them and checked their bona fides.  I accept that when one inputs "work in Ireland" into a computer search engine one will find many reputable agencies, but there are also ones flying by the seat of their pants with little knowledge of the difficulties that workers face and who want to abuse and misuse people from other countries in our labour market, which is something we should not tolerate.The Labour Party and the trade union movement fought hard over the years for advances in worker protection legislation, as did you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, in your career. We tried to bring forward improvements in regard to workers' conditions, health and safety and so on. While I am sometimes critical of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I acknowledge that during her period in office she brought forward the minimum wage. I regret that members of my party were unable to make that claim in regard to their ministerial careers. However, the Minister did not accept my Bill on trade union recognition. She has set her face against that. I hope that in the future the Labour Party and its allies in this House will be able to bring forward a good trade union recognition Bill. We have set up a whole platform of workers' rights and it is important that this would not be denied to other people coming to seek a future in this State. We should not expect them to put up with worse conditions than we would expect Irish citizens to tolerate, nor should we allow this country's reputation to be sullied by offering appalling working conditions whether it is in the food industry, the service industry, restaurants or elsewhere.The Minister needs to grapple with this issue, which is similar to the previous matter discussed. Perhaps she will include it in the forthcoming legislation on this area. I am aware that legislation exists in this regard but the situation has changed somewhat since it was framed and a different structure is now required in order to protect migrant workers, many of whom will settle among us as citizens. I urge the Minister to re-think her position. The best solution we could find was to try to insert the phrase, "nor may any employment agency facilitate such employment in the State," in subsection (2), line 6, after "State", without employment permits. Presumably the penalties referred to under the body corporate could also apply to these agencies. I again urge the Minister to accept the amendment given what is well documented in the media, by the trade union movement and what her Department knows. We should bring these recruitment agencies within the ambit of this legislation. If not, the matter should be dealt with in detail in the legislation which the Minister is to bring before the House in the near future.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	380	I support the amendment. It is another weakness in the Bill that it does not allude to the rogue agencies in some way. This amendment would fulfil the requirement in that  regard and I commend Deputy Broughan for moving it.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	381	I accept that there are issues in regard to employment agencies. It may be more correct to say that there are issues in regard to some of the middle people, some of which are agencies and some of which are not. Many of them are registered abroad. We have regulations dealing with employment agencies and this is an area which we can examine to see what the appropriate sanctions might be if they prove to be inadequate in the current regulations, in the context of the more comprehensive legislation due to come forward after Easter.The employer who is the one ultimately responsible for the work permit is who the penalties have to be levelled against. Some agencies are most reputable and help employers to locate staff but after they have done this they do not usually have any further contact with the person that they put in touch with the employer and the responsibility passes on through the permit to the employer. It would be extremely difficult if one were to have a situation where an intermediary such as an agency was responsible for some aspects of the matter and then the employer took over other responsibilities. Given that I am aware of some of the difficulties that have arisen in regard to agencies or so-called agencies, I give a commitment that I will examine the matter in the context of the more comprehensive legislation to come.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	382	I move amendment No. 4:
In page 4, subsection (3), lines 13 to 16, to delete paragraph (b).This amendment was proposed by my colleague, Senator Tuffy, in the Seanad, on the grounds that the range of penalties in both cases, especially in regard to workers themselves, was draconian – on indictment a person would be fined €250,000 or up to ten years in jail. Given the account that I went over this morning and the reference made to cases of clear abuse in regard to rogue employers, there is necessity for a serious sanction.In regard to the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) (Amendment) Bill, I raised the issue of proportionality with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern. Proportionality is an important attribute in regard to sanctions and the penalty proposed here does not fulfil this requirement, which is why this amendment has been tabled to delete paragraph (b).I urge the Minister to look at another issue which has not been put forward in an amendment but which is related and this is in regard to an appeals system. In subsection (3) and subsection (4), a person charged with an offence will have to show that he or she took all such steps as were  reasonably open. Earlier speakers referred to the system of work permit applications and renewals or the case of a worker changing from one employer to another, where it is easy for an injustice to be done, notwithstanding the best efforts of the Department. I think Deputy Eamon Ryan has tabled an amendment somewhat along the lines I envisage in order to put in place some type of appeals system.This is common practice across a range of Departments, particularly in the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Although in the past I criticised it for not being on a statutory basis, it does exist. We are used to other appeal mechanisms and there should be one in the context of work permits. I understand that officials in the work permits section are under intense pressure. A very small number of staff must deal with a huge number of workers, employers and agents. Nevertheless, I call upon the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to consider a system of appeals within his Department.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	383	I have no problem whatsoever with the €250,000 fine or possible ten years imprisonment for rogue employers. It was mentioned earlier that a good publicity campaign should be run to ensure that all employers realise the implications of this Bill. If that is successfully done, there is no excuse for employers to break the law.I have some reservations about the penalty of €3,000 or one year of imprisonment for employees. The Garda seems to indicate that there are 10,000 people working illegally in this country. Many of them are working on the minimum wage, paying back money they had to hand over to get here in the first place and trying to support families in the countries they came from. We will find it very difficult to extract any financial payments from these people. Some interim arrangement will have to be looked at if the figures are as large as the Garda seems to indicate. The problem lies more on the employee side than the employer side.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	384	Even by the standards of the Progressive Democrats, section 2(3)(b) of the Bill is an absolutely incredible provision. It beggars belief that the deputy prime Minister would come into Dáil Éireann and provide penalties of €250,000 or ten years in prison for the crime of employing somebody from outside the EU without a permit. What planet is the Minister living on? If memory serves me correctly, that is roughly the penalty that is imposed on a gangster for importing large amounts of heroin to enslave working class kids in drug addiction and cause endless suffering, misery and crime for working class communities. To equate the employment of somebody without a permit from the Government with a heroin-importing gangster who destroys communities and people is absolutely unreal.However, it is in keeping with the Minister's  approach to immigrant workers, which has been shown to be callous in the extreme, bordering on xenophobic. The attitude of the Minister, as indicated in many of her speeches I have read, is that immigrant labour is to be used strictly when it is urgently required by the State because employers cannot find Irish citizens or residents to do certain jobs. When people have a choice, they will not opt for the unpleasant and dirty jobs. In those circumstances, the Minister says that it is fine to bring immigrant workers in and send them on to farms to pick fruit, clean floors or whatever. However, if there is any tightening in the labour market, to use the language of the Progressive Democrats, they should be sent back to where they came from and dispensed with when they are no longer of use.This is not the first time we have seen this in the EU. We had exactly the same experience in Germany. In the period of boom for German capitalism, tens of thousands of so-called guest workers were brought in from Turkey to beef up the profits of German corporations. Then, when things began to tighten, successive German Governments changed their tune and went on to create an atmosphere of racism and xenophobia against the Turkish guest workers who made such a contribution to the German economy.I ask the Minister to think of the plight of our fellow countrymen and women who are in a similar position in the United States. Through no fault of their own, they are living in a sort of twilight world and depend on some employer, perhaps, to give them a job to survive. If we adopt a similar approach to this, it is those who are already marginalised who will suffer. Some asylum seekers have been here for years but are denied the right to work and are driven into welfare by the policies of the Government. This is absolutely incredible. If the Government has any honour, I ask the Minister to withdraw this provision forthwith and accede to the Labour Party amendment. Do not disgrace us completely. On this issue at least, let us use a different yardstick to the one the Minister is using in allowing Shannon Airport to be used by US military war planes, terrified that she will lose some revenue.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	385	When I woke up this morning and looked at my morning newspapers, Deputy Higgins was eagle-spread across the front of several of them. I saw a different perspective on Deputy Higgins from what I normally see in this House. His attitude to this amendment is astonishing. We have a situation at the moment where an employee can be prosecuted for working illegally but there is no such penalty on the employer. Thankfully it is not common, but employers exploit people from time to time and employ people illegally, do not insure them, do not deal with health and safety issues and do not pay appropriate taxes to the authorities. Deputy Higgins is saying that is not important and we should ignore it. It is important. It is important  for employee protection and for protecting the State's revenue base.More importantly, I know of no country that has the kind of open door approach to immigration that Deputy Higgins seems to be suggesting. He seems to take the view that anyone who comes here, no matter how they get here, should be entitled to work without a permit and that there should be no offences or penalties if they work illegally. That makes no sense whatsoever. Our first responsibility is to our people and to other citizens of the European Union. We have a population of 3.7 million. Thanks to our economic growth and prosperity in recent years, we have been able to provide employment opportunities not only for our own citizens and returning emigrants but for the citizens of many countries, both in the EU and further afield.Many have obtained good employment opportunities here that they could not have got in their own countries, just as we found opportunities in other countries in the past when this economy could not provide opportunities for all our people. A sensible immigration policy must be based clearly on opportunities that exist in Ireland. There is no point in bringing in thousands and thousands of people if there are no jobs for them. Just think of the pressure that would place on the housing market, our medical service and our education system. It is the people at the bottom in our society who would suffer most if we were to adopt that kind of approach.I referred earlier to the Nigerian who was recently deported who had two passports, two work permits, was an asylum applicant and owned a house in Cabra. Is somebody seriously telling me that we should ignore that? Can we afford to ignore that?I do not believe that is what the people who elect us want us to do.These penalties are being introduced to ensure appropriate penalties for employers who flout and ignore the law and who have an unfair advantage over other employers who comply with the law. Such penalties are necessary. The culpability of the employer in many of these cases is likely to be far greater given that the employer who takes on the person to work illegally holds most of the advantages over the employee in this relationship. If the person is off the books, as it were, he or she can remain invisible to the authorities. The unscrupulous employer can take advantage of the non-national's illegal status, for example, to illicitly save on costs, such as wages and insurance, and ignore the law of the land in relation to employment conditions, such as health and safety in the workplace and so on. The illegal employee on the other hand, can live under a regime of virtual servitude with the constant threat of being uncovered by the authorities or of being revealed to those authorities by the employer who no longer needs his or her services or as a punishment for some perceived wrong-doing.One should not underestimate the negative influence for the individual and society posed by those who knowingly exploit their workforce in this way. Some of this exploitation is well organised and run by criminal gangs who can earn much of their profits on the backs of their illegal workforce. There are negative economic effects on the domestic labour workforce which may be denied the prospect of competing for certain jobs because of the illegal employment of foreign workers. This issue has been raised with me on many occasions by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.This is all the more of concern given that the last number of years have seen unprecedented numbers of non-nationals coming legally to work in Ireland. It is not difficult to get a permit if there is a job and to be legal. The requirements of an employment permit system are straightforward, sensible and far from over-burdensome and they show that if there is a genuine job available which cannot be filled by an Irish person or an EU citizen, a work permit will be granted.When I became Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in 1997, we were granting just under 3,000 permits per year. We had an extremely illiberal, rigid and conservative approach to foreign immigration. Last year we granted 40,000 permits. There must be flexibility in this regard and we must have regard to the needs of our economy and to the opportunities in this economy. It would be foolish in the extreme, to put it mildly, to take the approach that whether a person is legal or not, it does not really matter and there will be no penalties, fines or prosecutions. Clearly, the imposition of a fine, which would be at the discretion of the court, of somewhere in the region of €250,000 would, I imagine, only be imposed in extraordinary circumstances of exploitation and of unscrupulous behaviour. I do not believe the courts would impose high fines for offences which might be relatively minor. In any event, the fine for a minor offence is €3,000. The higher fine is for serious breaches and for constant exploitation of vulnerable people who are brought to this country, perhaps in dubious circumstances.One cannot enforce a sensible immigration policy unless one has a penalty system. Every other country seems to have such a system and it does not cause problems. As I said to Deputy Joe Higgins, I know of no country which allows the kind of open door approach he seems to be suggesting in his comments.

I appreciate there are rogue employers and we detailed some of the many cases of workers being grossly mistreated. There should be a sanction but this one seems to be out of all proportion to the core offence, which is, not having a work permit. Obviously, there are sanctions in other worker protection legislation which provide the possibility of punishing employers. In the years I  have been trying to monitor the Minister's administration, there has been a lack of inspections. I know the situation has improved recently but we witnessed the terrible saga of a number of deaths on building sites and so on. There was also a serious failure to monitor how employers behaved in a range of other areas. The situation would have been different had the Minister accepted the earlier amendments from the Labour Party and Sinn Féin but as it stands, this paragraph should be deleted.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	390	I debated this with the gentleman on BBC radio a while ago. I regretted that he was giving cover to the Government for its attempt to criminalise the peaceful anti-war movement.I am not saying the State or its agencies should ignore the exploitation of workers. This State, the Minister and her Department are responsible for ignoring the exploitation of workers by not having sufficient inspectors to impose full compliance with the national minimum wage legislation, inadequate as it is, and by not having sufficient health and safety inspectors on building sites and other work places, with the result that workers lose their lives, as we have seen tragically. That is not the choice which is open to the Government in this instance.This legislation is not to end the exploitation of workers from abroad. If the Minister is seriously worried or concerned about that, then she should provide more resources for workplaces and insist on health and safety legislation, proper work rates, etc. It is a question of having compassion and humanity for that not very large number of people who are marginalised in our society and who, as a result of this scare tactic by the Government, will be driven further down.I object most strongly to the use of the term, "responsibility to our own people."  That is the catch-cry of the xenophobe and of some of her colleagues – Fianna Fáil backbenchers who the Minister, I believe, rebuked for comments along these lines when they were directed against asylum seekers and immigrants at various times in recent years. They had the audacity to illustrate problems in housing, as the Minister mentioned  housing here. For the Minister's information, it is the speculators who support Fianna Fáil and her party who created the massive housing crisis by doubling, trebling and quadrupling the price of a home and a plot of land on which to build a home in the short space of four or five years and for no good reason except to make a massive profit – to profiteer most outrageously.Landlords charge the most outrageous rents which the Minister's Government has not lifted a finger to control. I hope she will come back and answer these points because everything I have said is true. There is the most outrageous racketeering in the private rented sector in every community and even those way out of the city centres. Let us tackle the real problems for those the Minister calls "our own people" because of the massive economic pressure they are put under in this regard. I say no; I do not condone exploitation. I have stood against it all my life as a fighter for working class people. To give the choice to starve or worse to unfortunate people and those who are extremely marginalised is not what an Irish Government should do in present or any circumstances.

In page 5, subsection (10), lines 11 to 14, to delete paragraphs (a) and (b) and substitute the following:"(a) who has filed an application under section 8 of the Refugee Act 1996 which is still pending determination, where the application has been pending for less than six months,”.The original intention behind this amendment was to reaffirm the right to work of all refugees as outlined in section 3 of the Refugee Act 1996, to extend the right to work to all asylum applicants whose applications have been in the process for more than six months and to reserve restrictions to eligibility to work permits to those asylum applicants whose applications have been in the process for less than six months. Sinn Féin calls for this and we hope that this right to work can be positively and specifically recognised in the more substantive employment permit legislation which will, I hope, come before the House in the weeks to come.As a result of the very short time between publication of this Bill and the deadline for filing amendments, due to it being rammed or guillotined through the House with all Stages taken within a few short hours, this amendment was, unfortunately, misformulated and does not accurately reflect the original intent.

In page 6, subsection (2), line 14, after "Republic" where it secondly occurs to insert "and any other state which, after the passing of  this Act, becomes party to an instrument whereby it accedes to membership of the European Union".Everybody taking part in this debate warmly welcomed the accession of the ten countries. There were different views during the Nice treaty referenda and full discussions about the impact of the treaty. The major difficulty that many people had – a majority of the people rejected the Nice treaty – lay with governance and the fact that many citizens felt that small countries such as ours, and the bulk of the sister countries now joining us, would be gravely disadvantaged by the changes rushed through in the Nice treaty.Nonetheless, accession is happening. This amendment seeks to grant the same freedom to work across the Community to the other countries which will join the EU. I discussed at length this morning the path on which Romania and Bulgaria are embarked and the fact that, almost certainly, in a few years they will join the EU after the ten accession countries. The Union will become one of 27 states.My party believes in the positive principles of European union and of peoples working together in peace and harmony across wide territories. I am one who feels that those principles could be applied to the whole planet, not just to Europe. We hear already of agreements with Croatia and Macedonia and of relationships with the former states of Yugoslavia which were torn apart by a crazy dictatorship in Belgrade and a sectarian Government. A Deputy made reference to the migrations of Turkish workers, who only recently, at third generation, were allowed to become German citizens. Issues will also, I hope, arise with regard to the liberation and rights of the Kurdish people of Turkey who are currently seriously repressed. This Bill might be able to give the same warm welcome to the people and workers of these areas in the years to come.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	403	The Treaty of Accession negotiated between the EU member states and the ten countries due to accede to the Union in 2004 provides that member states shall apply their own national measures regarding labour market access for at least the first two years following accession in respect of the nationals of eight of those countries – all except Malta and Cyprus who will have full accession from day one. Ireland's national measures consist of granting labour market access to the nationals of the eight states once accession takes place.The purpose of section 3 of the Bill is to give legislative effect to these measures by providing for an exemption from the requirement for an employment permit for the nationals of these states should they wish to take up employment in the State. This section has regard to the parties to the Treaty of Accession. The acceptance of the proposed amendment would not only mean  including states not covered by the Treaty of Accession but would also make reference to instruments that do not yet exist, the provisions of which may be entirely different to those contained in the current accession treaty. Accordingly, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.

In page 6, lines 15 to 21, to delete subsection (3) and substitute the following:"(3) If the labour market is experiencing or is likely to experience a disturbance, then, notwithstanding subsection (1), the Minister may, on the advice of the National Economic and Social Forum and the National Economic and Social Council, and with the agreement of the Houses of the Oireachtas, during the transitional period, make an order providing that section 2 shall apply to a national of a state to which this section applies during a specified period or periods within the transitional period and if he or she does so, that section shall apply in accordance with the order.”.I have proposed this amendment because I am uncomfortable with the power that has been given to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in section 3(3). The decision to make an order of the kind referred to in my amendment should not be based solely on the opinion of any Minister, but should be taken following consultation with a large group of people. The social partners, including the National Economic and Social Forum and the National Economic and Social Council, trade unions, employers' representatives and the Oireachtas should be consulted. The advice of such bodies should be sought on these matters. The process of consultation should not only involve representative organisations, but also the public representatives in this Parliament. Such a system would be more democratic and fair than the provision in this Bill, which vests all the authority in a Minister's opinion.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	406	I originally intended to recommend the deletion of section 3 on Report Stage, given that a seven-year transition period is in place. At the very least, I intended to propose to add the word "significant" before the word "disturbance" in section 3(3).I said this morning that I wanted the Minister to extrapolate on the circumstances that might give rise to a reimposition of the section 2  requirement for the citizens of eight accession countries to have a work permit. In light of the fact that the accession states are being warmly welcomed into the EU, nothing should be done to damage the positive relationship we want to have with them in the years to come. My Green Party colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan, drew attention to the other side of this issue this morning when he asked about the possible measures that may be introduced in other countries that fear that there might be a reversal. I appreciate that it is difficult to imagine how such a reversal could take place, but I understand that the ownership of land by people from the existing 15 member states, particularly those from neighbouring countries, is a big issue in the debates on the EU membership referendums in Poland and the Czech Republic. The ten accession states may desire to impose restrictions.What informed the thinking of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in relation to this matter? It is obvious that it is being introduced as a safeguard, but I mentioned this morning that fears have been expressed in relation to substitution in labour markets, especially in areas of grave disadvantage. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has made huge efforts to support programmes in the social economy, but they are not enough. The plug has been pulled, or almost pulled, on many of our programmes. While huge efforts are being made, we have to work out a balanced approach. I would like to know what informed the Minister's thinking in this regard? Why is this section of the Bill needed?

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	410	The House can take it as read that there would be widespread consultation in the unlikely event of control measures being introduced, or work permits being needed by the citizens of the countries in question once more. I do not envisage that these provisions will be used  and I hope I am right in that regard. It would be foolish, however, not to put in place a provision such as that in section 3(3), which was described by Deputy Coveney as "prudent". Other member states in the same position as Ireland have made similar provisions – we have had to introduce special legislation to give us the power to reintroduce the permit requirement. Ireland is one of six countries that have agreed to give the citizens of the accession states the right to work without a permit from the date of accession. Nine countries have not agreed to do so – some of them have decided not to make such an allowance and others have not yet made a decision. The other five countries in the same position as Ireland have taken legislative steps to provide for the power to reintroduce an authorisation or a permit process, should the need arise.Only in unforeseen circumstances that I cannot envisage, perhaps involving mass unemployment and huge disruption in the labour market, would a reversal of work permit policy in relation to the accession states be necessary. The Government does not envisage that such circumstances will arise. It would be foolish, however, in the context of the introduction of this legislation, not to provide for the remote possibility that circumstances will change.

Certain countries have made specific property purchase arrangements. Property can be freely purchased by citizens of existing member states in some accession countries, but there are longer delays in other states. There are different regulations in different places. When I was in Hungary earlier this week, I met representatives of about 12 Irish companies that have either a sales and marketing office in that country or are manufacturing there. I am aware that there is a great deal of investment in some of the applicant countries and there are no difficulties in that regard.Deputy Broughan is right to point out that there are specific concerns in Poland and elsewhere. Deputies will be aware that the recent referendum on EU membership in Malta was carried by a narrow majority of about 3%. A similar referendum will take place in Hungary on 12 April next. These issues are being debated in the accession states, most of which, if not all, have the power to make regulations to prevent the citizens of the existing member states from making investments, purchasing property or working there.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	414	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."The Local Government Bill 2003 should be viewed as another step in the process of local government renewal which has been moving progressively forward over recent years. It is a short Bill. Its primary effect will be to end the dual mandate from the next local elections in 2004 and to continue the current long-standing arrangements for the election of the cathaoirligh of county and city councils.The Bill must be looked at against the broader canvas of the developing roles both of the national Parliament and local government, and the distinctive but complementary roles of each now reflected in the Constitution. Local government is a separate and distinct element of our democratic system and the Bill recognises that fact.As I have said from the outset in the Seanad, the Bill is clearly not a comprehensive overhaul of local government, nor have I ever attempted to represent it as such. I ask Members of this House not to view it in isolation, but as an element in an ongoing agenda of change for local government. Indeed I regard it as simply a starting point.The ending of the dual mandate has been advocated by a broad range of interests for a considerable time. The Barrington report in 1990 recommended that simultaneous membership of local government and the national Parliament should end. Bodies such as the General Council of  County Councils, the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland and the National Youth Council have voiced support for the ending of the dual mandate. The second report of the Commission on the Status of Women recommended the ending of the dual mandate and saw it as helping to open up wider opportunity for women to enter local government. This is to be encouraged, not just as a gender issue but in terms of the diversity of views, roles and knowledge it would bring to local government given that currently only about 16% of councillors are female.The ending of the dual mandate will bring about substantial change and together with the normal turnover at election time will help pave the way for an influx of new entrants to local government. The Bill is therefore the culmination of a long process which has been moving progressively in this direction for well over a decade.The Local Government Act 1991 took the first step by disqualifying Ministers and Ministers of State from local authority membership. The next step was the Local Government Act 1994, which disqualified the Ceann Comhairle, Cathaoirleach of the Seanad and MEPs from local authority membership. In addition, that Act provided that from the 1999 local elections onwards Members of the Oireachtas who were councillors could not hold the position of cathaoirleach or leas-chathaoirleach of a local authority. Indeed the White Paper, Better Local Government, published in 1996 committed that Government to consider further action after the 1999 local elections.However we have now reached the stage where 12 years after the first legislative steps were taken, the dual mandate will be brought to a close by this Bill in about a year's time. In this context it is worth noting that the ending of the dual mandate has been the official policy of almost all political parties in this House. The main Opposition parties supported the ending of the dual mandate the last time such legislation was before this House. The ending of the dual mandate will allow local government to develop its own separate role within our democracy for the first time since the foundation of the State. No longer will the conduct of council business be subject to such external constraints as parliamentary timetables, nor should it be.The ending of the dual mandate is also a recognition of the growth in the range and complexity of local government business over the last decade. A range of issues dealt with by local authorities on a daily basis include planning, roads, traffic, housing, environmental, amenity and recreational services, together with a renewed emphasis on community development and social inclusion. To understand the implications of this for local elected members, all one must do is consider the manner in which policy-making and implementation has changed to become more inclusive and transparent, which demands a far greater level of  interaction with local sectoral, community and other groups.A still further dimension for councillors is the range of other bodies on which they sit and bring a democratically-grounded community perspective to bear. This extensive list includes health boards, county enterprise boards, tourism bodies, Leader groups, port companies, local partnerships, regional authorities and assemblies, vocational education committees and county development boards.In parallel, at national level, the parliamentary committee system has continued to develop and provide the opportunity for members to have a much fuller role in the consideration of legislation and in the overview of Government policy generally. The demands on time have increased correspondingly. This is a trend which will undoubtedly intensify as Parliament evolves still further in tune with the key role of the Oireachtas which, under the Constitution, is charged with the sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State and where the duration of parliamentary and committee sessions may well extend further in line with those of other states. The leader of Fine Gael said so today.

I am dealing with a principle of public life, not a point on a legal pinhead.Against this background, how can anyone in all conscience claim there are not difficulties in simultaneously fulfilling both national and local roles satisfactorily, a task which can only become acutely more difficult in the years ahead? I believe, therefore, that a key step in supporting our democratic system, both nationally and locally, is the ending of the dual mandate and that it will bring substantial benefits to both. That being said, I understand it is a wrench for someone with many dedicated years of public service to choose to leave and perhaps more so at local level. Service to the local community, however, is not contingent on local authority membership. We must remember that Members of this House are democratically elected as public representatives to serve their country and their local communities and, in fairness, that is recognised by the public. A role in representing the local electorate and in acting as a strong advocate on local issues is not dependent on maintaining a dual mandate. Therefore, while the emphasis may change somewhat, people's role in the local community will remain very relevant. I have no doubt that in  future, Oireachtas Members will continue to play their part to the full on behalf of their local areas.

These moves and others in prospect need time to bed down. As I have said already, the Bill should be viewed as another significant step in the continued development of the local government system, building on progress to date. A major independent review of local government funding will shortly get under way. Measures to improve local authority performance and the development of the role of the elected council are also a priority. The review of the strategic policy committees, which are well under way, will also feed into this process.Over the lifetime of this Government, it is my aim to carry forward a major change agenda for local government. Change which recognises its key role as the central player in bringing together the various initiatives for social, cultural and economic development at local level and which provides a framework within which the role of elected members and the cathaoirleach can be considered and further developed – change to underpin the democratic roots of local government and with an emphasis on efficiency and effectiveness.I now want to take a more detailed look at the provisions of the Bill. Section 1 defines the principal Act as the Local Government Act 2001. Section 2 inserts a new section 13A in the principal Act, the effect of which is to disqualify Oireachtas Members from being elected, co-opted or from being a member of a local authority. Section 13 of the 2001 Act already contains similar provisions which currently and in the same way disqualify Ministers, Ministers of State, the Ceann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, MEPs, EU office holders, judges, gardaí, civil servants and others.Section 3 is a new section which was inserted by way of official amendment in the Seanad, about which I will say a few words. It requires the making of regulations in relation to local authorities and their dealings with Oireachtas Members. These will entitle Oireachtas Members to be supplied with notice of meetings, agendas and minutes of meetings as well as specified reports and other documentation.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	434	That is not sufficient.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	435	The reality is that the vast majority of Deputies have a harmonious working relationship that does not need legislation to underpin it.Additionally, the section requires that regulations will also include provisions for other matters such as correspondence, access to information and communication generally between local authorities and Oireachtas Members. This has been welcomed by everyone in the House to whom I have spoken. The amendment brought forward in the Seanad was in response to concerns expressed by Members of both Houses and across all political parties. A key change is that regulations, which have force of law, rather than guidelines, as originally envisaged, now apply. Members will appreciate, therefore, that I have gone a long way to address the concerns expressed. Given the wide range of local government activities, it is normal that local authorities, in common with other public bodies, are from time to time approached by Oireachtas Members in relation to policy matters or the cases of individual constituents. The section will help secure their representational role in this regard. No doubt, in carrying out their role in this House, they will continue to raise matters of local importance.I have no doubt that as time progresses in the years beyond the ending of the dual mandate, the roles of local and national representatives will evolve still further, to a point where the focus on local government matters is likely to be of much less significance to Members of both Houses operating within a fully developed committee system – a fact which will be recognised by the public. For the present, I am meeting what I accept as the real concerns which have been expressed and I am happy to do so.Finally, I should emphasise that all local authority customers, be they elected members or members of the public, are entitled to expect a high standard of customer service. Sustaining Progress, the recent social partnership agreement, commits the Government and the social partners to the further development of a public service which is focused on the needs of its customers. For the local government sector, it indicates, inter alia, that the focus will continue to be on serving the customer better and further enhancing local democracy.Section 4 of the Bill provides for various amendments to the Local Government Act 2001. These are consequential on the substantive changes to the Act made by the Bill affecting the dual mandate and direct election of cathaoirligh. The discontinuation of the arrangements for direct election of cathaoirligh of county and city councils is effected by section 7 of the Bill by way of the repeal of Chapter 3 of Part 5 of the Local Government Act 2001.

However, the amendment to section 167 of the 2001 Act clarifies that specified provisions of the new ethics regime, introduced by that Act, will apply to all local authority employees. I hope that will be welcomed by all Members. These provisions relate to a duty to maintain proper standards of integrity and a prohibition on seeking or accepting rewards arising from official duties and a code of conduct.Section 5 amends section 97 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, to insert a minor amendment omitted by the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2002. Section 6 amends the local elections regulations of 1995. These amendments arise primarily from section 14 of the Local Government Act 2001, which prohibits multiple membership of local authorities apart from membership of a county and town council.The effect of the amendments is to apply the same arrangements as those already in place for many years and which deal with the election of the same person to a number of different local electoral areas within the same local authority. A person so elected must choose one and a casual vacancy then arises in the other electoral areas. Similar arrangements now apply for persons elected to a number of different local authorities.The primary effect of section 7 is to repeal the provisions of the 2001 Act relating to the direct election of county and city cathaoirligh. Section 8, the last section, contains a standard provision for the Short Title and collective citation. I commend the Bill to the House.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	438	Ireland is one of the most centralised states in Europe. As the term suggests, local government should serve the people locally and not simply control them. Unfortunately, local government reform is one of the most hackneyed expressions in Irish politics. The Bill is another major disappointment for those of us who want to see real change and reform.The Government advises that the proposals in the Bill are part of a major reform package for local government. This is not the case. Even the Title does local government a disservice. It could hardly be considered to be reforming legislation.While dealing with the abolition of the dual mandate, the Bill allows the Government to execute a major U-turn on the question of directly elected lord mayors and mayors. I attended a public meeting in Ringsend last night which protested against a local matter about which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should be well aware. Some of those I met made the effective point that local authorities should be constituted to serve the people. Instead, they are controlled by central Government and it in turn tends to control people's way and quality of life. This is a major problem with the current systems of local government. The  frustrations of the public, which I share, are understandable.The Bill abjectly fails to convince me that it is even an attempt at serious reform of local government. It must be rejected. It is totally inadequate, it may be unconstitutional, it does a major U-turn on the question of directly elected mayors, it does nothing for the funding crisis facing local authorities and it is far too vague on the future relationship between Members of the Oireachtas and local authorities in their constituencies.The 1991 Barrington report outlined four basic reasons for local government reform in Ireland. These include the need to develop the democratic process, to deal with the problems associated with a centralised government, to further regional, local and community development and to make the best possible use of our resources. The Bill make no meaningful attempt to address these aspects.Most European countries have modernised the local democratic systems over the past 30 years but, unfortunately, Ireland has not followed that trend. The country has a centralised democratic system. My party leader, Deputy Kenny, a Mayo man, sees at first hand the negative impact of over-centralisation on the west. He recently presented a preliminary internal discussion paper to Fine Gael public representatives. It outlines how power can be given back to the people and how devolution and decentralisation can happen.In a democracy, power and authority should not be wielded against the people. They make the systems and they should have their say. It is only right and fair that democratic power be devolved as close to the people as possible. Those who wield power and make decisions should be answerable and accountable to the people. This is not the case at present.In recent times, the Government has further eroded the powers of local councillors. For example, the Protection of the Environment Bill removes their rights to set refuse charges and to make waste management plans. It is now time to reverse this trend and to give people, through their locally elected councillors, a real say in how their areas should be developed.Fiddling with the current situation, as this Bill proposes, is not good enough. Thousands of my party activists throughout the country are debating the discussion paper circulated by our leader. Their aim is to ensure that local government is more democratically accountable. Ireland is one of the few democracies in Europe where most local authority powers and functions are delegated to a non-elected official by the national Parliament. An effective local reform package would evolve from this national debate, ensuring that power is devolved to elected public representatives rather than appointed officials. Throughout the country we are discussing issues such as the establishment of the position of executive chairmen, to be directly elected by the people every five years, whose powers will be delegated by elected councillors and not by the Oireachtas,  as is currently the case in respect of county managers.It is also critical that the position of county manager be examined and, if necessary, be re-designated, preferably by the elected councillors and the executive chairman.

#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	441	Additionally, a major overhaul of the administrative structures within local authorities must be examined. Any real reform package must consider bringing the community care facility and social welfare functions under the jurisdiction of local authorities. Industrial development, enterprise and tourism promotion functions should also be considered in the context of local government structures. Such action could mean real local government reform and not just tinkering on the edge of the current system.Prior to the last general election, I conducted a local survey, the results of which indicated that personal safety, including local and community policing, was a major issue of concern to the local residents who responded. The question of community policing functions should come under the jurisdiction of local authorities. This must be given serious consideration. General policing could be community based by leaving the solution of major crime to specialist national units. It is an issue that must be examined in detail.In the context of local government reform we must also examine the functions of harbour boards, regional fishery boards and FÁS training. The role of the National Building Agency and its relationship with the local authorities must be re-examined. We must reverse the policy that has existed since the foundation of the State of building high density local authority estates, thereby creating the social divide that has been copperfastened by recent legislation.Neighbouring local authorities must co-ordinate their efforts with each other to establish housing landbanks to provide services and to make housing sites available to individuals and developers. This could substantially increase the level of house construction. These changes must go hand in hand with regulations to prevent undue profiteering by individuals who would acquire publicly funded sites. Local authorities must be given powers to have a greater role in promoting the voluntary housing sector.The importance of town councils as democratically elected bodies must be recognised in a greater way through enhanced and additional powers. We must look at the duties and powers of the town council chief executive. Again, the elected council and not the Oireachtas should allocate those powers to the chief executive. The Minister, in consultation with the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland and other bodies, should undertake a review of the role of town councils.Any such review must examine the implications of having a directly elected mayor or cathaoirleach for town councils and the devolution of some county council functions to town councils.On the question of finance to which the Minister referred, I urge that the financing of local authorities be examined further but do not expect the Minister to suggest any solutions or proposals until after the local elections. We know that no local authority can provide its services without funding, and in the context of a major and real review of local government, services should be funded in a more realistic way. The level of funding to local authorities should be advised to Government by a new national local authority finance agency which would be established by the Government in consultation with the General Council of County Councils and the Association of the Municipal Authorities of Ireland.I realise that some of the suggestions made for discussion are radical and would have far-reaching implications. They would require that new budgetary arrangements be put in place as part of the social welfare, health, training, enterprise, justice and marine budgets and these would have to be devolved to local authorities and the level of allocation of resources assessed in a realistic way.The implications of these actions may be pretty enormous. However, if we are serious about real local government reform that will include devolution and decentralisation rolled into one, we must be radical because time is running out on local government and there must be action now, not later. Otherwise, local authorities and council members will continue to be effectively downgraded by the Government and relegated in the estimation of the people.We are facing local elections in mid-2004 and, if the ongoing erosion of local authority powers continues, less than half the people will vote. How can we convince them to vote if they see local government as having a diminishing role?The Kenny document reflects broadly the recommendations of the Barrington report which, in the main, has gathered dust since its publication in 1991. It dealt in a broad way with strategy. It dealt with a major programme of devolution from the centre to a new and revitalised local government system, with the structure of local government based on three levels – regional, county and sub-county, with implementation through a policy statement by Government as to the future role of local government and its development, with the financing of local authorities and stated there should be a link between spending and raising money to promote the responsibility and accountability of local authorities.

#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	443	With the advent of the tribunal sys tem in recent years, the image of local councillors and local councils has unfortunately been badly tarnished. It is only by major reform of local government and the introduction of devolution, decentralisation, responsibility and accountability that the image and effectiveness of local government can be restored. It is time to make a new democratic agreement with the people, through far-reaching reforms. It is only then that the public will take local councillors and local councils seriously again.As stated, the Bill is unsatisfactory as it does not set out in adequate terms the manner in which Members of the Oireachtas can deal with matters of local interest for their constituents. It is essential for Members to have access to their local authorities in regard to local issues. I am still waiting for the Minister to give us more detail on how he proposes to deal with this issue in a satisfactory way. What I have heard does not convince me. Having promised to examine how to provide greater access for Members to local authority decisions, agendas and meetings, I thought he would have come up with something of greater detail but that has not happened.Members must have the right to regular briefing sessions with their city or county managers. This would have advantages for everyone. Members would be briefed and brought up to date on what wa happening locally while managers and local authorities would have the opportunity to discuss with Members the issues they wanted raised at national level. What we have so far is vague on this issue and the Minister must set out in detail how he proposes to strengthen this aspect of the Bill.The suggestion that if a Member writes to a county manager, he or she may get an answer in a week, ten days or a number of weeks is not good enough. In my experience, even as a Minister of State at the then Department of Environment, agendas arrived irregularly, if at all. On one occasion – this is in the records of the Department – I was refused an agenda from a local authority in my functional area.The Bill should, therefore, contain a proposal guaranteeing that Members of the Oireachtas have the right to have their questions answered by county managers within a specified time in a system similar to that which operates in the Oireachtas. Members should also have the right to ask questions about local authorities in Dáil Éireann and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government should not refuse to answer questions about local authority matters. These proposals would redress in some way the democratic deficit inherent in this proposed legislation.

#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	450	This is a serious anomaly that must be addressed, perhaps not in this legislation but by the Minister for Health and Children.I have stated the Government has done a U-turn on its proposal to introduce a system of directly elected mayors. The proposal was introduced through legislation by the previous Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, without any real attempt at local government reform and firm responsibilities being set out for the directly elected mayor. The previous Minister should have carried out a thorough review of the role of county and city managers in order that the directly elected mayors were not just ceremonial. He said at the time:It is my intention also to promote another powerful impetus for change in the internal dynamics of local government through the direct election of a full-time cathaoirleach of cities and counties with a term of office for the five year life of the council. I am talking about a cathaoirleach who is directly answerable to the people and accountable to the elected council, who must work with the council to deliver on the full potential of the office which is highly visible and accountable, a person elected by the people who draws on powerful democratic legitimacy to speak and negotiate on behalf of the whole community with influence well beyond any formal powers and with the capacity to bring together the various elements of local governance.What has gone wrong? What has changed since? If the previous Minister saw fit to introduce directly elected mayors at the time, what has happened since? Why this U-turn? The Government has lost its nerve and is fearful of a backlash from the public because of the lies it told and deceptions it put about in the previous general election campaign.My party proposes that in 2004 the Lord Mayors of Cork and Dublin should be elected directly by the people for a five year term. They would be accountable to the people, accessible and visible, bring a modern government approach to the business of their cities, give stable leadership, put innovative new policy ideas on the agenda, be a voice for the people and speak up for their cities. Directly elected Lord Mayors would ensure their cities get their fair share and would represent them to the Government and EU institutions. Above all, they would not be subject to the Department of the Environment and Local Government and put their cities' interests first, even if the Minister did not like it.Mayors could have a role to play in fostering links with cities abroad. London is an example where the city mayor, although not always revered by his city residents or the media, is still an effective voice for the city and has introduced innovative ideas such as his initiative to improve public transport and lessen traffic jams. His motto is to stand for the principle of a city governing itself, a principle that every leader of a city or town should embrace.At this stage, there should have been a thorough examination of the responsibility of county managers in conjunction one on the introduction of directly elected mayors. If the Minister accepts my proposal for the direct election of Lords Mayor in the cities of Cork and Dublin, it should be done in an all-encompassing manner as part of a package of major local Government reform.There is no point in electing somebody into what is now a mainly ceremonial role for five years without also giving him or her real managerial responsibilities. There must be a clear definition and separation of authority between the executive powers of local authority managers and directly elected mayors. The so-called reform of local Government brought about in the most recent Local Government Act has not worked well. From my discussions with councillors throughout the country, I have learned that the workings of strategic policy committees, SPCs, and other committees, may be effective in some cases, but in many instances it can be disastrous.I am advocating that we have a real debate on local Government reform. This Bill, and the Protection of the Environment Bill 2003, which we will be discussing over the next number of weeks, are in conflict. The Protection of the Environment Bill takes away the power of local authority members and gives it to county managers. The Bill before us takes away the dual mandate with the intention of totally reforming local Government but, in fact, it is weakening it.As already stated, I cannot see where the reform is. The so-called better Government legislation is not working. In many cases, SPCs meet irregularly and they have also added another layer of bureaucracy to the existing systems. Under the current system, SPCs meet and make decisions which must then be referred to a meeting of the full council. They are then often  referred back to the SPCs for further discussion. This additional layer of bureaucracy is hindering progress within local authorities and is tying up both elected Members and administrators.The idea to introduce representatives from outside bodies is not working either. They see the SPCs as talking shops, with the real decisions being made at main council meetings. This situation is totally inadequate as there is no real reform of the local authority system. Most importantly, it does nothing to improve the way services are provided and delivered to the public.A person who contacts a local authority is usually connected to an answering machine or else the phones are off the hook. This happens even in the Minister's Department, although the system there is geared for voicemail. With the exception of the Minister, his secretaries and a few others, the Department does not operate a voicemail system. I cannot get through to an ordinary line in his Department and, as a result, I cannot access voicemail. I have submitted a question on that matter for next week. This is a symptom that has spread itself throughout the country.The service being delivered to the public is not what it should be. We even have local authorities and town and city halls closing to the public during lunch hour when people are out and could do their business. That is totally anti-consumer and anti-public.Unfortunately, this Bill does not deal with the manner in which powers, currently administered centrally, can be devolved to local authorities. Moreover, it is inadequate in that it does not deal with the future funding of local authorities which have become too dependent on central Government since the abolition of commercial rates.I would also like to point out that Members of the Oireachtas are not making their own case because of any financial rewards. They are not paid for sitting on local authorities. They continue to work there because they see the mix of local and national politics as totally rational. This mix provides a national platform for Deputies who wish to raise matters of vital local interest in the Parliament of this country and, in reverse, it brings to local authorities the vast experience that Members of the Oireachtas gain from being here. Therefore, the marriage of national political activities and local political activities is balanced and fair.The legislation, as published, is disappointing. I expected the ban on the dual mandate would be one part of a comprehensive and major local Government reform package aimed at strengthening the role of local authority members.I would also question the legal advice that the Government received concerning the constitutionality of this proposal. Will the Minister publish in full the Attorney General's opinion on this? There is a precedent for this because two weeks ago in the House the Taoiseach published the details of the Attorney General's advice in regard to the Shannon issue. I ask the Minister  now to make available the Attorney General's legal opinion on the constitutionality of the legislation.In the absence of knowledge of the legal advice that was available to the Government – with its U-turn on directly elected mayors – and in the absence also of a strong system for interaction between Members of the Oireachtas and local authorities, I certainly cannot support the Bill. I will bring forward amendments on Committee Stage to redress the democratic deficit inherent in these proposals.The Bill must be challenged. It is unfair as it prevents Members of the Oireachtas from being members of local authorities without putting any fair systems of communication in place. In no way does the Bill set out adequately how Members of the Oireachtas will continue to represent their constituents on local matters if the dual mandate is abolished.Statutory regulations, not guidelines, are needed to direct local authorities on how they conduct their business with Oireachtas Members. These regulations should be available to us before a vote in the House on the Bill. The regulations should be published with the Bill. Without seeing them, we cannot, as the saying goes, buy a pig in a poke.It is self-explanatory that the onus is on the Government, when seeking to abolish the dual mandate, to propose some reasonable alternative. This has not been done. We are now faced with the absurd situation where there is no real local government reform and where Members of the Oireachtas are being cut off from their local authorities. The Minister and his predecessors have paid lip service to strengthening the role of local government, but what have they really done? Instead of strengthening the role of local government, the proposals in the Bill, and in the recently published Environmental Protection Bill, erode their powers and give more powers to county or city managers. These proposals hit at the core of local democracy and, if not put right, will make the local elections of June 2004 a sham.

Indeed, we are the only party where all the newly elected councillors who became Deputies resigned their seats within a short period. That is an action from which other parties might learn. Both Deputies Sargent and Gormley were re-elected without having to stand as councillors. To clarify for the Minister, there has been a swap between the Labour Party, the Green Party, the Independents and Sinn Féin.As I mentioned, both of those Deputies, like a  number of Fianna Fáil Ministers, were successfully re-elected without having been councillors. A person does not have to be a councillor to run for election, but it seems that many of the Deputies in the House are scared out of their wits that if they lose the so-called local touch someone else will come and usurp their seat.

#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	461	The matter I wish to raise relates to prejudicial statements made by various people within the Colombian justice system and the political system.On 11 August 2001, three Irish men, Niall Connolly, James Monaghan and Martin McCauley were arrested at Bogota Airport. They were paraded before the world's media and the media around the world said they were guilty. They were held illegally for six months without being charged. In January 2002 two charges were brought against them. They were found guilty. The media stories all over the world were that these men were guilty and that there was all sorts of evidence against them. For those of us who travelled to Colombia for the trial, the reality is that little evidence has been produced against them.The Attorney General in Colombia has said  these men are guilty. A former President of that country, Mr. Pastrana, and The Washington Post said they were guilty. President Uribe, the present Colombian President has said they are guilty. General Tapias, the head of the armed forces, has said these men are guilty. Last week General Moro said they were guilty. The matter was raised in the Colombian Parliament and people alluded to this trial and said these men are not guilty.It is a basic tenet of international law that a person is entitled to the right to a fair trial. Clearly, in this situation these men are not being given a fair trial. We have a situation where this trial is not above board and where the prosecution service within Colombia is supposed to investigate the defence and the prosecution. The person involved in the prosecution never interviewed anyone on the defence side.On the first day of the trial, after 65 days of having been told that all the evidence was ready, many of us from Ireland as well as international observers were told no witnesses were available.There have been threats to the men, the lawyers and the observers who have attended the trial. Also there have been difficulties in accessing the lawyers. They have been moved willy-nilly to different jails around the country. The reality is that under the Colombian system, no jail is safe and on many occasions these men have suffered intolerable prison conditions.So far no evidence has been produced against the men. The evidence so far would appear to be based on half-truths, speculation and pure fantasy. In Modelo prison in which they are being held they are surrounded by 2,500 right wing paramilitaries. The section in which they are held is suitable for 14 people but holds 43 prisoners. Between 40 and 50 people have disappeared or have been killed in that prison. When one walks into the prison one can see bullet holes in the glass and walls. The reality is it is not safe and there has already been a grenade attack since the men were arrested.In Ireland a trial goes through in a certain period. The trial in Colombia has been stop gap. A trial started on 4 October 2002 for one day but no evidence was produced. It resumed on 16 October 2002, 3, 4 and 5 December 2002, 5 and 6 February 2003 and 4 March 2003. The reality is that there were five days of actual hearings during that period.In Modela prison where the men are held there is no natural sunlight. A complaint was made and they were moved, supposedly for their own safety, to another prison where they were allowed out in the sunlight but they were not allowed suntan lotion. Subsequently, the men's faces, arms, legs and heads were burned.It is clear from independent observers that these men are not getting a fair trial. They have been found guilty by the media and clearly anybody who is anybody within the Colombian system seems to think they are guilty.The Government should stand up for these  three Irish citizens. I accept that observers of ambassador status have been there but more could be done. We have had meetings with the UN, the Red Cross, the Ombudsman's office, human rights groups and all are concerned about the way this trial is proceeding. All are concerned about the men's safety, the threat to their lawyers and the safety of relatives visiting them. There are questions that need to be asked. Does the Irish Government show the same concerns as the human rights groups?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	462	I wish to respond to the motion before the House. I am conscious that Deputies Crowe and Finian McGrath have acted as observers in this case.The three men in question were arrested at Bogota Airport by military police on 11 August 2001. Following an initial inquiry, the investigating authorities determined that there was a case to answer and ordered the men's detention while a detailed investigation was carried out. The offences which they were alleged to have committed were using false documents and providing training for illicit activities. The men are currently being held at Modelo prison in Bogota. The trial of the men began in Bogota on 16 October 2002. There have been two further sessions since, in December 2002 and February of this year. A further hearing took place in the city of Medellin in March to hear the evidence of one of the prosecution witnesses. The next session of the trial is scheduled for 7 April. The hearings to date have been attended by Members of this House and the Seanad, and by international observers, including legal observers and human rights activists.On the Minister's instructions, the Department of Foreign Affairs has been following the case closely. As a signal of both our interest in the process and a strong desire to ensure that the men receive a fair trial, the Minister has designated the ambassador to Colombia as our official representative at the trial.The Department has provided consular assistance to the three men since their arrest. Officials from the Irish Embassy in Mexico, which is accredited to Colombia, have visited the men on 11 occasions. Through the embassy in London, the Department has actively assisted family members and those attending the trial sessions to obtain Colombian visas. Officials from the Department are in regular contact with the families of the men. The embassy to Colombia has also assisted the families of the men and visiting observers in organising prison visits, and meetings with high-ranking public officials in Colombia.The embassy has maintained close contact with the relevant Colombian authorities in relation to the conditions in which the men are being held. In all contacts with the Colombian authorities, they have emphasised the importance of ensuring that the men are held in a safe place, where they have reasonable living conditions and satisfactory  access to their legal advisers. The embassy has also stressed the importance of ensuring that the men receive a fair trial.The Minister for Foreign Affairs has reiterated and emphasised the above concerns to the Colombian Foreign Minister in meetings and in correspondence on several occasions. He has met with the Colombian Foreign Minister on three occasions, most recently in Athens on 28 March last, to discuss the case. He has requested the Colombian authorities to expedite the case to the greatest extent possible.The Taoiseach met former President Pastrana in Dublin in June 2002 and emphasised the importance of ensuring that the men receive a fair trial. Both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, have met with the families of the men. The Minister also met on 25 March last with a number of parliamentary and other observers who have been attending the trial, when he assured them that the men's right to a fair trial and their safety were of primary concern to him, and that these concerns had been conveyed on an ongoing basis to the Colombian Government at every level.I am aware that the observers and supporters of the men who have attended the trial have expressed serious concerns about statements made by senior Colombian figures that, in our jurisdiction, would be regarded as prejudicial to the interests of the three men. While it may not be uncommon in some jurisdictions for the media and others to speak about trials before they start and while they are going on, the Minister and the Department have expressed serious concern at these comments, and have made clear to the Colombian authorities our insistence that the men receive a fair trial.Moreover, and as I have already stated, in his meeting with the Colombian Foreign Minister last week, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, repeated our strong concern about such statements, emphasising that the men must be considered innocent until proven guilty, and that they should be judged solely on the evidence before the court. The Colombian authorities have responded that they also wish to ensure that the men have a fair trial. In addition, both the trial judge and the Colombian Vice President have given assurances to the trial observers that comments such as those made by certain public figures in respect of the trial would not affect the independence of the court. I assure the House that we will continue to emphasise in all contacts with the Colombian authorities the importance of the men's receiving, and their being seen to receive, a fair trial.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	463	Let us consider the following figures in respect of intellectual disability: 1,711 people are currently living at home in need of full-time residential service; 861 need a day service; 1,014 need a respite service; and 462 have  no service whatsoever. There are nearly 500 people with intellectual disabilities who have been inappropriately placed in psychiatric institutions. This is the European Year of Disabled People, but the Government, in a budget that accounted for more than €31 billion of income and more than €26 billion of current spending, has not allocated €1 to increase the places and expand the services of people with disabilities. This is a scandal and it is totally unacceptable.During the past six weeks or so, I have met parents of people with intellectual disabilities from different locations in the Fingal area regarding the future of services for the region, which has a population of nearly 500,000. Most of these parents or guardians, who are middle-aged or elderly, are deeply concerned at the prospect of a very bleak future for their children. Furthermore, many of them live in rural areas where there is no access to public transport.Prosper Fingal has been a huge success since it was established in 1978 and has developed a wide range of service options, both centre and community-based. Vocational training is an important element of the services provided and there are currently 38 adults, ten of whom will finish in September, availing of it. What will be available to them after vocational training? No funding from any source has been provided in the 2003 budget to provide a service for them. Having developed skills and knowledge over three to five years, they will have to return to the home environment for 24 hours per day where, more often than not, they will lose many of the social skills acquired, leading to immense domestic upheaval. This goes against the entire concept of training.Of the ten vacancies which will arise in vocational training, there will be at least 20 to 30 referrals from mainstream schools, St. Michael's House, family and carers and other sources. Due to the funding shortage, many of them will not get a place and waiting lists will become the norm.Transport is also an essential part of the service because of disability levels, wheelchair use, location, the lack of public transport and health issues. The previous transport arrangements have not been renewed by the health board and, accordingly, Prosper Fingal now has responsibility for providing it. Parents have informed me that the allocation from the health board is insufficient to provide an adequate service and some service users have been unable to attend the centre in recent weeks For others, the cutback in transport will result in their having to spend up to eight hours per day in a minibus given the requirement to pick up adults.We know that service providers throughout the country are being forced to tell parents of people with intellectual disabilities of school-leaving age that no service can be guaranteed for them this year. The Government's policy is moving away from a recognition of the philosophy that people with disabilities should not have to rely on charity or, in many cases, have to draw on their own limited resources.Prosper Fingal has drawn up a five year plan to provide 45 additional day places, one five bedroom respite facility, two residential houses and an additional centre and clinic support facility. On behalf of the people with disabilities and their parents and guardians in Fingal, I demand that the Minister and the health board acknowledge their duties and responsibilities and work with Prosper Fingal to ensure that the basic facilities outlined in its programme can be implemented on a planned basis. Under the 1953 Act, the Minister can make a decision in this regard.I do not wish to receive a response outlining what has been spent to date by the Government. I live in the real world and people with intellectual disabilities are demanding that their rights be acknowledged and that services be provided. Nothing else is acceptable. The ball is in the Minister's court and he has the responsibility and power to ensure that the basic necessities can be provided.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	464	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and affording me the opportunity to outline my position on it. He asked about savage cutbacks in funding and I am prepared to answer him.I am familiar with the Prosper Fingal service. I am not sure how many Ministers of State or chairpersons of health boards have visited the facility, but I have done so and I have considerable admiration for the work it is doing. It is a voluntary service provider offering day services, rehabilitation and vocational training places and non-residential based respite services to persons with an intellectual disability in north County Dublin. The Northern Area Health Board works in partnership with Prosper Fingal with regard to the planning and delivery of services. I congratulate all concerned with the delivery of these services.In 2002, Prosper Fingal received a revenue grant in the region of €1.762 million and a capital grant of €1.5 million towards the expansion and refurbishment of its day service and headquarters accommodation in Skerries. I understand that in January this year the contractor engaged by the Northern Area Health Board for the provision of transport services requested an increase in the budget of 30% for the ongoing provision of that service at the existing levels.Deputy Seán Ryan's information was incorrect. He first said that there was no money, then that there were no transport arrangements and finally that service users were unable to attend. A total of 32 clients attending day services at Prosper Fingal were receiving their transport from the contractor. The board was not in a position – and rightly so – to meet a 30% increase and the contractor was unwilling to negotiate a lower one. Following discussions between the board and Prosper Fingal, it was agreed that an additional €150,000 be made available in its 2003 budget to  provide a transport service from 1 April to 31 December for the client group in question.

I understand that the health board has put in place interim travel arrangements for the client group. If the Deputy is sending the blacks of this debate to anybody, I hope he will send out with the correct information along with the incorrect information he has provided.The Northern Area Health Board is in discussion with Prosper Fingal with respect to the annual allocation for 2003, but this has not yet been finalised. Given the current financial circumstances, it will be necessary to maintain grants to voluntary agencies at 2002 levels. The Deputy's statement about savage cutbacks is totally without foundation.

Between 1997 and 2002, an extra €188 million in revenue and €139 million in capital funding has been provided nationwide, making a total additional investment of €327 million for the maintenance and development of services to persons with intellectual disabilities and autism. This year, further additional funding of €13.3 million has been allocated to services for these people to meet the full-year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism.

Of this total amount, over €200 million has been built into the ongoing budget base.Only yesterday I heard a presentation from a senior official from a service provider who paid tribute to the good work, the commitment and funding allocated by the Fianna Fáil – Progressive Democrats Government and to what has been done in the area of intellectual disability in recent years.This funding has brought about significant and unprecedented developments in the services. Between 1997 and 2002, around 1,700 extra residential places have been provided, with most of these based in the community. This figure includes new residential respite places which were developed in 1997 and 1998.The Opposition parties had opportunities in the years between 1994 and 1997. If anyone has seen what was required to be done, had the com mitment and put the necessary funding in place it is the PD/Fianna Fáil Government. We have made an enormous contribution to what is now in place. We have provided base core funding and are ensuring that it remains.Between 1999 and 2002, about 465 dedicated respite places were also provided. In addition, the period from 1997 to 2002 saw the provision of around 2,950 new day places. I recognise that despite this significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular, even though the number of people in receipt of services, including full-time residential services, continues to increase.I assure the Deputy that my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in relation to service provision, including issues such as those raised by Deputy Ryan.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	471	I welcome the Amnesty International report, Mental Illness, the Neglected Quarter, which was published last month and which promotes the rights of the one in four Irish people affected by mental illness. I will cite from the report. The report states that Amnesty International is concerned at the inattention paid by the Government of the Republic of Ireland to a series of national and international reports critical of its failure to fully respect the human rights of people with mental illness. It further states that ultimate responsibility for compliance with international law lies with the Government, not with individual Departments, health boards, civil servants or service providers.The neglect down through the decades of the mental health services is one of the greatest disgraces of our society. The institutionalisation of the mental health services in Ireland has failed to live up to the World Health Organisation standards and there continues to be high admission rates to psychiatric hospitals, both voluntary and involuntary, due to the lack of community-based facilities.I will make three references to the 2001 report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals. The report states that the physical health examination of in-patients, as documented in in-patient records is often infrequent, desultory and superficial in nature. It recommends that the occurrence of sudden death of psychiatric in-patients due to asphyxia from inhalation of food and other materials should be investigated and taken care of and refers to suicides among psychiatric patients, which are not subject to any formal audit.The Government is in breach of Article 20 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child by placing children and juvenile offenders in adult psychiatric facilities. This has been referred to repeatedly by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals and is now highlighted by Amnesty International  as a breach of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.The total expenditure on mental health services has dropped in the past 15 years from 12% to 7.2% of the overall health budget. That shows the inattention over the past 15 years. One in four people have a psychiatric illness at a certain stage of their lives but the expenditure has almost halved in relation to total health expenditure.People with intellectual disabilities remain inappropriately accommodated in psychiatric institutions in violation of their human rights. We have repeatedly referred to this in this Chamber. As many as 18% of the child population under the age of 18 will experience significant mental health problems, yet services in Ireland for them are few, infrequent to access and there are long waiting lists. There is a lack of dedicated psychiatric services for adolescents, with most areas seriously short of adolescent psychiatric facilities, and some with none at all despite the fact that psychiatric disorders increase in prevalence in the adolescent years, with incidence of self-harm and suicide also increasing in those years.There are few specialised mental health teams and outreach services dedicated to the rising number of homeless in Ireland. The report notes that various sources put the proportion of homeless people suffering from mental illness at between 30% and 50%.There is no special psychiatric unit for prisoners – I am glad the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is here as well – and the only psychiatric hospital to accept prisoners is the Dublin Central Mental Hospital, which has insufficient beds for the demand, resulting in many mentally-ill patients in need of in-patient care never receiving a transfer.Within the mental health service clinical resources are concentrated in the least deprived rather than the most deprived areas. The most deprived areas have, subsequently, fewer acute beds, larger sector sizes and a greater consultant staffing rate. I refer to the Irish Psychiatric Association report, which was published two weeks ago.There is no special neuro-psychiatry service available for brain injury, brain disease or for those with psychiatric disorders as a result of a neurological disease. These patients do not receive any specialised treatment in this State.

#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	474	It is a wide-ranging report so my response will be wide-ranging.The report was launched on 10 February 2003. The report acknowledges the significant advances made in the provision of community psychiatry, nursing services, community residences, day hospitals and day centres since the publication of the landmark 1984 report, Planning for the Future.While I concur with some of the sentiments expressed by Deputy Neville, like most reasonable people in this House, I believe we have seen the former draconian accommodation of psychiatric patients change. We have seen the large high walls taken down and integration of services in the community leading to a better standard and quality of life for most of the people involved. I was particularly pleased to be associated with the adoption of the Planning for the Future document in 1985-86.I will address the issue of funding because the Deputy referred to it. In the period 1999-02, an additional €70.7 million was invested in mental health services. In the current year, additional revenue funding of €7.6 million will be provided for ongoing improvements in mental health services—
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	475	That is very small in the context of the overall health budget.

Substantial progress has already been made. The Deputy referred to a reduction in funding, but it may be a case of a change in where funding has been allocated. Much of the funding heretofore may have been allocated to psychiatric hospitals or to a psychiatric service, where now it may be going to a community-based service.

There are now 19 psychiatric units attached to general hospitals which are operational and a further two units will become available to their mental health services in the near future.In relation to community residences, there are approximately 400 community psychiatric residences in the country which provide over 3,000 places. This compares to 111 residences, providing less than 1,000 places in 1984. In relation to day hospitals-day centres, there are approximately 200 providing over 3,500 places. This com pares with approximately 1,200 places prior to Planning for the Future.The Amnesty report also acknowledges the funding which is being made available by Government to support groups and organisations such as Schizophrenia Ireland, Mental Health Ireland, GROW and Aware to heighten awareness and develop support services for service users and carers. In a concrete expression of the Government's commitment in the health strategy to develop advocacy services in mental health, €251,000 was provided by my Department for this purpose in 2002. This figure included €127,000 which was provided to the Irish Advocacy Network. An additional €50,000 has been provided to it for 2003.I particularly welcome the report's recommendation for a comprehensive review of the mental health services, which reflects a commitment in the health strategy, Quality and Fairness – A Health System for You, to the development of a new national policy framework on mental health. Work on this review is expected to begin in the coming months.The new Mental Health Commission, established in April of last year under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 2001, has an important role to play in improving the quality of our mental health services. The establishment of the commission was welcomed by Amnesty International in its report. The primary functions of the commission are to promote and foster high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services and to ensure that the interests of detained persons are protected. The Mental Health Commission is now working, along with officials from the Department of Health and Children, to put in place the structures required for its new role.

When it ended at 8.30 p.m., I left the Chamber and switched on  my mobile phone. I immediately received a call from a member of the Labour Party who was participating with a number of other party members in the anti-war protest outside the gates of Leinster House. The background noise was deafening as he informed me that the riot squad had arrived and was arresting people and dragging them away. He said that the situation was ugly and asked if I could come out to the Kildare Street entrance to the Dáil to try to help.I went outside and witnessed large numbers of uniformed gardaí linked together, separating and cordoning off the protesters into two groups. One group was on the lower side of Kildare Street outside the gates of Leinster House and on part of the road and footpath on Molesworth Street. The other group was positioned on the upper side of Kildare Street and Molesworth Street on the Buswell's Hotel side. A corridor had been created between the two groups and a large number of members of the public order squad was positioned along various parts of this corridor. I saw them moving through the uniformed gardaí, lifting and dragging protesters out of the crowd and taking them down Kildare Street.I spoke to a number of people in the protest – men and women, young and old – including the person who had telephoned me. Without exception, they stated that they had been engaged in a peaceful protest and that the arrival of the public order squad in riot gear had been provocative and that members of the latter had acted in a heavy-handed manner.I approached the officer in charge and asked if he would withdraw the public order squad as the situation appeared to be volatile. I further pointed out that most of the members of the public order squad appeared not to be wearing their identification numbers. On being questioned, the officer informed me that they were wearing overalls but did not explain why they were not wearing their identification numbers. When interviewed on RTE at lunchtime today, the Minister's reply to the same question was exceedingly lame. He said: "the riot gear doesn't make provision for numbers at the moment. It takes some time to do it."  He also said that he was having discussions with the Garda on the matter. This is not good enough.After the "Reclaim the Streets" march last May and the unacceptable behaviour of some gardaí who were not wearing any identification numbers – a number of them are now before the courts – surely the word should have gone out from the Minister's office that all units of the Garda should display their identification numbers when engaged in public order duty in future. The public representatives present and the organisers of the protest last night suggested to the officer in charge that the public order squad should withdraw and that the protesters would move into Molesworth Street and be addressed by their leaders. When this was done, good order was restored immediately.There is grave concern among the public about  what is happening in Iraq. Every citizen in this country is entitled to assemble and protest peacefully. When they do so, in the large numbers in which they are at present, against this unnecessary, illegal and unjust war, their views should be treated with respect by the forces of law and order.The line was crossed last night. I call on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to order an inquiry into the manner in which the Garda handled a peaceful protest outside Leinster House last night, to determine whether the Garda response was appropriate, to investigate the fact that none of the public order squad wore ID numbers and to state what measures are being taken to ensure that all members of the Garda Síochána wear appropriate ID when dealing with public order matters in future. It is ironic that, in light of the figures published today which show that we are dealing with a spiralling crime rate involving some 300 offences each day, so many gardaí could be found to deal with a peaceful protest last night.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	484	I thank Deputy Costello for sharing time. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should have come before the House this afternoon to answer specific and supplementary questions on the outrageous conduct of the Garda – which is answerable to him – against a peaceful anti-war protest last night. The Government hoped a full-scale riot would be provoked so that the anti-war movement could be discredited which would allow it to portray the anti-war organisations as violent rabble and frighten away the tens of thousands of ordinary people who have been on the streets in recent months protesting against the Government's policy of collusion with the atrocities that are happening in Iraq. The Government does not like to be exposed and it is hugely exposed on this issue. To the credit of all those at this peaceful protest, the response was utterly disciplined.Let us bring back centre stage the reasons for the anti-war protests, namely, the atrocities we witness on a daily basis—

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	489	It might be helpful if I outlined the circumstances surrounding last night's events as conveyed to me by the Garda authorities. An anti-war protest organised jointly by the Anti-War Movement and the NGO Alliance, as they call themselves, commenced at the Kildare Street entrance to Leinster House at about 7 p.m. yesterday evening. Initially, a small number of protesters gathered and were contained behind crowd control barriers in Molesworth Street. During the next hour another group of protesters gathered in Kildare Street opposite the National Library. A leader of the Anti-War Movement who was with these protesters was advised by the Garda that if any protesters tried to block the entrance to Leinster House, either by a sit-down protest or massing in front of it, the Garda would have to remove them. Shortly afterwards, this second group grew larger and were asked by the Garda to join the other protesters behind the crowd control barriers in Molesworth Street. They were unwilling to do so and were joined in Kildare Street by the first group of protesters. The crowd, which now numbered over 300, moved further up Kildare Street and stood directly in front of the entrance of Leinster House waving placards and chanting slogans. At about 8.15 p.m. the Garda had to clear a corridor through the crowd to enable a Member of this House to safely drive his car away. The crowd then staged a sit-down protest at the entrance gate to Leinster House.Additional gardaí, including members of the public order unit, were then called to the scene and proceeded to clear away the sit-down protesters who were carried to a gap in the crowd control barriers and released. The stewarding of the protest was ineffective. Many of the stewards took a leading role in resisting Garda efforts to clear a path through the crowd. A number of Members of this House had interaction with the protesters and the Garda found it necessary to remove Deputy Joe Higgins.The protest ended at 10.30 p.m. and those involved dispersed without further incident. The Government recognises that many have deeply felt opinions on the war in Iraq. It recognises, too, the right of the people concerned to protest peacefully and express their views. The Garda had gone to considerable lengths to ensure the protesters last night could express their views outside Leinster House peaceably. However, it defies all reason to suggest that they had any right to block access to or egress from Leinster House. To suggest otherwise is a recipe for anarchy. In the circumstances, the Garda moved to remove those causing an obstruction, using the minimum force necessary. There has been some adverse comment about the fact that the public order unit was used. That was an operational decision but the plain fact is that some of the protesters last night were causing public disorder.Under the Offences against the State Act 1939, it is unlawful to persist with a protest within the  vicinity of Leinster House when called on by a garda to desist. Members of the Garda public order unit do not have numbers on the special clothing which they wear. Both the Garda Commissioner and I have agreed that a means will be found to address this issue. However, in saying this I emphasise that there is no evidence that members of the unit behaved with anything other than complete propriety last night. Deputy Joe Higgins was happy to appear on the front of the newspapers being removed gently by the Garda Síochána—

There is not. We should be clear about one thing. Last night's incident need not have happened. The protesters were made aware that they would not be allowed to block the entrance to the Oireachtas. Had they stayed behind the crowd control barriers, as requested by the Garda, there would have been no difficulties whatsoever. They could have made their point without any Garda intervention but chose not to do so. If any individual has a complaint against the behaviour of the Garda, there are procedures for complaints to be investigated.

However there is no supplementary measure of this kind in the current scheme. Unlike the regulation governing the first REPS, the EU Council Regulation under which the new scheme is implemented includes no provision for a public access measure as part of the EU co-funded agri-environment programme. In an effort to secure the continued availability of public access as part of REPS, my Department made proposals to the European Commission for the inclusion of the measure in the new scheme as a state aid fully funded by the Exchequer. However the Commission indicated that a public access measure was not admissible under the regulation, even as a State aid.Farmers who are still in the first REPS and undertook supplementary measure 5 will continue to receive payment for it until the end of their existing agreements.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	513	The changes introduced to the milk quota regime in Ireland in 2000 have been extremely successful in achieving the overall objective of putting quota definitively in the hands of active producers, at the lowest possible cost. Due largely to these changes, in the last three years alone, about 460 million litres on 105 million gallons, of quota have been redistributed under milk quota restructuring schemes. This is more than the total quantity of quota restructured in the previous ten years and almost 10% of the national quota. Nearly 90% of the restructured quota has gone to the small and medium scale categories of producers.

I have responsibility for the labelling of certain specific foods. However, I have been concerned for some time about food labelling issues generally. As a result, in July last year, I established a food labelling group to examine issues surrounding food labelling in the context of consumer expectations and concerns. This group reported to me in December 2002. The recommendations of the group included the issues raised by the Deputy. I have recently agreed an action plan for the implementation of the recommendations of the group and, to this end an inter departmental-agency group is being set up to monitor the implementation of the action plan.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	517	I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 35, 40 and 48 together.Some months ago, in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland and the dairy industry itself, I commissioned a strategic study of the industry. The objective of the study was to examine the existing structure of the Irish dairy processing sector; identify market opportunities for dairy products; assess product options to exploit those opportunities and make recommendations on actions to improve the efficiency and long-term competitiveness of the industry.The study was undertaken by Prospectus and Promar International and the report was presented on 19 March. The report is a very extensive, thorough and useful piece of work which fully addresses the terms of reference set out for the consultants.It concludes that the future success and long-term survival of the sector is critically dependent on its ability to transform itself and deliver on the key strategies. The recommendations cover a range of areas and are designed to point the way to improve the international competitiveness, scale and cost efficiency of the industry and to increase the proportion of output away from commodity type products and into higher value added products.The commissioning and carrying out of a study is, of course, only an initial step. What is important is that appropriate action is taken to address the findings which I believe have been positively received. While much of the action to be taken will be for the industry itself, I and my Department will do whatever is necessary to assist in driving forward the recommendations of the report. As part of this, I have already met with Enterprise Ireland and will hold a series of meetings with co-operatives and with processors with a view to identifying the best way of achieving the objectives set out in the report.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	518	Officials of my Department have met with European Commission officials on at least two occasions since May 2002 at which consideration was given to the possibility of reclassifying the remaining 15% of County Monaghan as more severely handicapped.That part of County Monaghan currently designated as less severely handicapped did not satisfy the criteria for designation as more severely handicapped when the last reclassification took place. In the meetings with my officials to which I have referred the Commission officials indicated that any formal request now for further reclassification would inevitably lead the Commission to ask us to justify our current designation and classifications for all areas. As this could lead to the possibility of the current classification of disadvantaged areas being open to question the timing and nature of any further reclassification request would require very careful consideration.The measures in the CAP rural development plan including the disadvantaged areas compensatory allowances scheme are currently being evaluated. A report will be presented to the European Commission later this year. In that context I expect to have a further opportunity to raise the issue of reclassification with the Commission.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	519	As of 28 March 2003 there were 10,146 participants still in REPS 1 and 26,968 in REPS 2, making a total of 37,114. The CAP rural development plan projected that there would be 70,000 farmers in REPS by the end of the 2006. While participation levels are currently some way below what had been projected, I am confident that they can be increased significantly by the end of the programming period. Some time ago I announced a consultative process on REPS, open to all stakeholders, on which I plan to base a set of proposals to put to the European Commission. I am encouraged by the number and diversity of stakeholders who have made written submissions during the first phase of the exercise and I believe that it will lead to a better and more attractive scheme.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	522	The production of sugar in all member states of the European Union is regulated by the EU sugar regime. The EU regulation specifies a quota in respect of manufactured sugar for each member state and provides that the quota be allocated to the sugar manufacturing enterprises on the member states territory. In Ireland's case the quota is allocated to Irish Sugar Limited. It is a commercial matter for Irish Sugar Limited to place contracts with growers to deliver sugar beet sufficient to allow for the manufacture of the sugar quota. Difficulties concerning clauses in the contract, such as the under delivery clause, are matters for resolution between the company and the growers. While I have no direct involvement in this matter, I am aware that it has been the subject of discussions between Irish Sugar Limited and the growers' representatives.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	523	Despite the perception of a stress free lifestyle associated with rural life, farmers like  their urban and town counterparts experience many pressures and uncertainties associated with their work and income situation which can be compounded if the person is ill, living alone or in poor financial circumstances.I am particularly aware of the difficulties involved for farmers and their families in coping with the uncertainties associated with farming and in particular with the distress involved in cases of herd depopulation due to animal disease outbreak. In this regard, I launched a special free advisory service for farmers, operated by Teagasc, in July 2002, to provide advice on how to get back into business as soon as possible and where necessary to refer farmers to trained professional help. Teagasc advisers and district veterinary staff have received specific training to provide this service. Farmers who are experiencing difficulties in other areas of their business can avail of the expertise in Teagasc. I am aware that the Samaritans and the IFA launched an advertising campaign last year to help farmers suffering from stress and depression to overcome their reluctance to seek help.The Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council, FAWAC, which I established last year has recognised the desirability of ensuring that throughout the country there are structures in place which can address any real or potential problem cases and which draw on the sense of community and care for the wellbeing of both the people and animals involved. The objective is to provide throughout the country a framework within which problems can be spotted before they become critical or overwhelming. This will in turn facilitate timely, effective and sensitive intervention or the provision of assistance by, as appropriate, public agencies, neighbours and farming bodies and welfare groups.I believe that the sense of community which still prevails in rural Ireland can play a vital role in this regard, and can be even more effective when coupled with arrangements for dealing with such cases which are standardised, well understood and more responsive but not overly-formalisedThe revised national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS, launched by the Government in February 2002, includes a specific focus on addressing rural poverty and disadvantage but also has objectives relating to health and access to health services in rural areas. In relation to poverty, the general commitment set out in NAPS is to reduce the number of farm and non-farm rural dwellers who are consistently poor to below 2% and if possible to eliminate consistent poverty altogether. Provisional figures for 2001 show as in previous years a lower percentage of farm households suffering consistent poverty at the 60% poverty line than either non-farm rural or urban households, for example, 3.2% for farm households compared to 7.2% for non farm rural and 4.3% for urban households.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	524	I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 44 together.The position is that since 1 January 2002 some €1,485 billion has been paid to farmers under the various premia and compensatory allowance schemes of which €1,014 billion relates to payments under the 2002 schemes. This represents an increase of almost €140 million on the amount paid to the same date last year. Advance payments for the 2002 premia schemes were at an 80% level. Balancing payments are expected to commence later this month.Under new arrangements, introduced by the EU with effect from 1 January 2002, all bovine premia scheme applications must be processed at producer level rather than application level. This means that before a balancing payment can be made all applications under the special beef premium scheme, the suckler cow premium scheme and the slaughter premium scheme must be examined together to establish, in the case of the suckler cow premium and the special beef premium, if stocking density levels have been complied with. If there is non-compliance under any of the three schemes any resulting calculation must take into account the total number of eligible animals under each of the schemes.While the producer approach will cause a slight delay in balancing payments the overall effect will be that any penalties imposed will be more proportional than heretofore. This arises because the number of non-compliant animals are divided by all the eligible animals under the three schemes as distinct from the number of eligible animals for the individual scheme as was the case up to now. The new arrangements have also resulted in a significant reduction in the number of on-farm inspections under the bovine schemes.An additional factor impacting on the processing of the 2002 schemes and the timing of balancing payments is that the national quota for the special beef premium scheme has been exceeded with an increase in the number of animals submitted for the premium in late December 2002.

Under the Musk Rats Act, 1933 (Application to Mink) Order 1965 the keeping of mink is prohibited except under licence from my Department. Licences are issued under this legislation only if the applicant, following an inspection carried out by officials from my Department, is found to be compliant with a number of key conditions. Among the conditions is that the premises where mink are kept must be constructed to prevent the mink escaping and that licence holders must inform the Department if any mink escape.Licensed fur farms are also inspected by my Department to assess compliance with the Council of Europe recommendations concerning fur animals and Council Directive 98/58/EC concerning the protection of animals kept for farming purposes. These inspections have found that the licensed fur farms have been operating in compliance with current legislation. Inspections have also found that the slaughter methods employed by the licensed fur farms are permitted under the Sixth Schedule of the European Communities (Protection of Animals at Time of Slaughter) Regulations 1995.The Deputy will be aware of the recent deliberate release of mink by the Animal Liberation Front from a licensed mink farm. This illegal action must be condemned, as mink are not a native species and pose a danger to wildlife, fisheries and certain farm animals.I have no plans to ban fur farming in Ireland. My Department will continue to keep in close contact with the fur industry and to monitor the operation of the licensed fur farms.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	528	This issue arose in the context of the discussions on the report of the food labelling group.  With the exception of a number of primary foodstuffs including beef and poultry meat there is no compulsory requirement, under EU law, to declare origin of food sold in retail outlets and there is no requirement for any information on origin to be given in relation to the food service sector. There was full agreement in the group that consumers had a right to information on the origin of the meat they cook in their homes or eat out. The differences within the group on the issue rested with how origin should be defined. The trade representatives, by and large wanted to define origin as EU-Non-EU while the consumer representatives and the main producer representative wanted it defined as country.While the group could not agree on how origin should be defined, there was unanimous agreement that further research was necessary to establish consumers' wishes in this area. I have asked the consumer liaison panel to draw up a strategy for consumer research to establish the concerns of consumers in relation to food labelling generally. That strategy will include the issues of origin. When the panel report back to me, I will then arrange to have the research commissioned based on the strategy drawn up by them.

FAWAC had already identified a number of areas which it feels are worthy of particular attention and had made these part of it initial work programme. The members of FAWAC had some time ago recognised the merit in strengthening localised arrangements throughout the country, involving farming bodies, local animal welfare organisations and the Department at local level, for identifying and alleviating welfare problems on individual farms before they became critical. Work on this aspect, to which farming bodies and animal welfare organisations had already made particularly positive contributions, is already well in hand although not yet concluded. It will be for FAWAC itself in the first instance to settle the detail of the proposed framework, after which it will be announced. I am conscious that the chairman and members of  FAWAC are committed to completing their work on this item at the earliest possible date. Since setting it up I have had every confidence that FAWAC could make an early and meaningful contribution in a number of areas and I believe that the work which FAWAC is now doing on this particular issue can greatly strengthen existing arrangements throughout the country and help all concerned to avoid cases of the kind which we have seen from time to time over the past few years and in very recent times.It is important to state that in the vast majority of cases Irish farms are well run and animals well cared for. However, there will be isolated cases where particular circumstances can bring about real animal welfare difficulties on farms. The most important thing that we can do in these instances is to try and spot the difficulties at an early stage and do what is necessary, in conjunction with the farmer, to help alleviate the situation. I believe that the sense of community which still prevails in rural Ireland can play a vital role in this regard, and can be even more effective when coupled with arrangements for dealing with such cases which are standardised, well understood and more responsive but not overly-formalised. It is important that we all encourage any farmer who might have an emerging problem on the farm to seek outside assistance as early as possible.

On 7 May last, I altered the qualification criteria provided for in the scheme by removing the upper income ceiling of 150 income units, IUs, applicable to applicants under the scheme. The removal of this ceiling not only ensured that the maximum number of young farmers could benefit from this important scheme, but also had the effect of greatly simplifying the application procedure involved.I am pleased to be able to report that there has been a significant increase in the number of applications received under the scheme as a result of the changes referred to above. I have no plans at present to make any further changes to the scheme.

The following tables, compiled from data supplied by that office, set out the information requested by the Deputy. In relation to the tables the following points should be noted: The data for 2002 has only recently been compiled by the CSO. While every effort is made to ensure accuracy, these returns may stand to be adjusted marginally as data is rechecked. In certain cases the record of import may include the re-import of Irish prod ucts that were originally the subject of an export from this country; The information available for imports from member states of the European Union, EU, does not differentiate between imports originating in the EU country and those originating from third countries that may already be in free circulation within the Community.On a more general point, it should be noted that under EU harmonised rules, imports into the European Union from third countries must have been sourced in premises and in countries which are approved by the European Commission and which are subject to veterinary audits by the EUs Food and Veterinary Office. In addition, such imports are subject to checks on import laid down in harmonised rules prescribed at European level, and must be accompanied by veterinary health certification from the authorities in the country of export.Imports of Beef – EU Countries

In recent years however, I have made ex gratia funding available to a number of appropriate bodies involved in the delivery of animal care and welfare services throughout the country, having regard to resources available to me from within the Department's Vote at end-year. In December 2002 grants totalling €500,000 were awarded to 67 organisations to assist them in their activities. The organisations concerned had approached the Department seeking assistance.Details of the organisations that have been approved for funding and the amounts for each organisation are detailed in the table which will be circulated in the Official Report. The grants given to animal welfare bodies in 2002 bring to €2.914 million the assistance given by my Department to animal welfare bodies throughout the country since 1995.A grant of €6,689 was paid to the Cats Protection Association of Ireland in December 2002 under the end-of-year exercise in the context of the resources available in my Department's Vote at that time. I will consider any requests for aid in respect of this year from cat protection organisations in the light of resources that are available and having regard to any competing claims for grant assistance, which may be submitted by other welfare bodies many of whom deal with various categories of animals, including cats towards the end of the year.I should point out that a formal statutory framework for cat control is already provided for under the Control of Dogs Act 1986, which is administered by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. That Act provides for the introduction of regulations in relation to cats, which would allow the local authority to take possession of unwanted cats. Section 33 of the Act would enable the Minister to make grants towards the expenses of a local authority or to any person concerned with the provision of homes or shelters for stray or unwanted cats or with the welfare of cats.

My Department operates measures, including the farm retirement scheme and the installation aid scheme, to encourage the transfer of land. It is also the case that priority is given to young farmers across a range of different measures.The Commission's proposals for the mid-term review of Agenda 2000 are currently being examined at official level by various committees in Brussels and will also continue to be discussed in the Council over the coming months. The outcome of the negotiations, or the impact of that outcome, on particular sections of the farming community, cannot be predicted at this stage. However, Ireland has pointed out potential difficulties with the proposals in so far as young farmers and farmers wishing to enter the early retirement scheme are concerned. The main difficulty for young farmers is in relation to the proposal to decouple direct payments and to establish a single farm payment to replace most of the existing CAP premia. Those entering farming for the first time after December 2000 may be at a disadvantage when compared with other farmers who were farming for all of the proposed three-year reference period, 2000-2002, for the establishment of entitlements for the proposed single decoupled payment. The same concerns about establishing entitlements arise in relation to the operation of the early retirement scheme, both for those farmers who have already retired and for those contemplating retirement.

Where there are restrictions due to BSE, every effort has, and will continue to be made at political, diplomatic and technical level to have them removed. As a consequence of these efforts, Egypt, which had been our largest market for beef, lifted the ban on Irish beef imports in October 2001 and the resumption of exports is now a commercial matter for the industry. Furthermore, following contacts between the Irish and Russian authorities restrictions on the supply of beef from certain counties were lifted and this has substantially improved access to that market for Irish beef. Intensive efforts are continuing in relation to other important markets for Irish beef such as the Gulf states, South Africa and Indonesia.All markets to which Irish pigmeat has traditionally been exported are currently open. Japan and Korea were reopened in 2002 following protracted negotiations aimed at lifting the bans imposed because of foot and mouth disease. Other markets such as Hong Kong, South Africa, USA and Russia were re-opened before the end of 2001. My Department is engaged in attempting to negotiate access to new markets such as China and Australia. The extent to which such countries are willing to engage in such negotiations or to accept product varies, as do the procedures to be followed in each case. I am conscious of the importance to the pig industry here of having access to as wide a range of markets as possible and to this end my Department, along with Bord Bia, will continue to pursue this issue with all countries offering realistic prospects for trade.As regards lamb, as the EU is a deficit area and a net importer of lamb, export to non-EU countries does not arise. Most of our trade is with France which takes 80% of our exports.

The main stakeholders will be consulted as appropriate during this process. It is proposed to include all Bord Glas activities including support for producers in the new Bill. Bord Bia's statutory function is the marketing of Irish food and livestock at home and abroad. Bord Glas has a similar function in relation to edible horticultural produce on the home market and in relation to amenity horticulture both at home and abroad, and also has the function of developing the production of these sectors.It is considered that the range of expertise available to a merged body would build on the strong track record of both bodies in developing for the future and that this would be of benefit to the horticulture and amenity horticulture sector. It is proposed to provide in the legislation for a sub-board with responsibility for horticulture including amenity horticulture and this will be examined in more detail at the drawing up of heads of a Bill.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	537	The BSE control and eradication measures in Ireland are among the most comprehensive in the world and are designed to protect public and animal health, to eradicate the diseases and to protect trade. The value of these measures can be seen in the positive underlying trend in relation to BSE. In the period from January to March 2003, the number of cases was 69 compared with 118 in the corresponding period in 2002 which represents a reduction of 42%.In addition, the age profile of cases detected continues to increase. In 2002 some 2% of cases were identified in animals less than six years old at the time of diagnosis, compared with 16% in 2001 and 40% in 2000. To date in 2003, no cases have been confirmed in animals under six years of age. The increasing age profile of animals in which the disease is confirmed is a positive indication that the enhanced controls introduced in 1996 and 1997 are having the desired effect and that the incidence of BSE will continue to decline as older animals leave the system.These positive trends have not, however, given rise to any complacency. It is necessary that we will continue to insist on the strict application of measures to control and eradicate BSE. Most of these measures, such as compulsory notification, the ban on meat and bone meal, active surveillance for BSE in factories and knackeries, the ban on permitting specified risk materials to enter the human food or animal feed chains and the slaughter of cohorts and progeny of BSE-infected animals are now required by EU law although a number of them were being applied in Ireland long before they became compulsory at EU level. Others, such as whole herd depopulation, are optional and based on national rules.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	543	I am most conscious of the role that research and development plays in the continued development of agriculture. To this end my Department directly administers the research stimulus fund and the food institutional research measure. Public funding is also provided to the university sector for research in agriculture and food. In addition, my Department also maintains farms and laboratories, which carry out research and trials relating to animal and crop production and food safety. Funding is provided to Teagasc for its research, extension and education services. The Teagasc extension services play a crucial role in the adoption of the results of research into  farm practice. In a similar manner, the results of food research carried out under FIRM are made available to industry through the RELAY dissemination project.However, public good research will not on its own drive an economically viable and competitive agri-food industry. In the food area companies themselves also need to be involved. Sales and profitability are positively linked to in-company research. Competitiveness is an important issue for Irish agriculture. While many farming sectors are subject to some form of quantitative restrictions on output there is a very strong need to focus on yielding the maximum possible returns from the marketplace. It is for these reasons that work in the area of competitiveness and productivity is particularly important. A study by Professor Gerry Boyle, The Competitiveness of Irish Agriculture, was initiated under the research stimulus fund to improve our understanding in this area. I am also looking forward to other work on competitiveness that has been commissioned from Teagasc and from Professor Alan Matthews of Trinity College Dublin.As to the future of the sector, I established the high level independent Agri-Food 2010 committee in June 1999 to propose a strategy for the development of the Irish agriculture and food sectors. In August 2000, the Agri-Food 2010 plan of action was published setting out the Government's response to the committee's report. The measures in the plan of action responded to the issues raised in the Agri-Food 2010 report in a comprehensive and programmatic way. Over 90% of the action points have either been completed or have seen substantial action taken. Further monitoring of these action points will be carried out in future as laid out in the Department's statement of strategy.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	544	I have had the matter of an increase in export refunds for beef exports to Russia to compensate for the dollar decline against the euro raised at EU level recently. The EU Commission, while keeping the matter under review, was not disposed to increasing the refund at present because of the current level of buoyancy in the beef trade. In particular it was pointed out that applications for export licences remains strong, reflecting industry's capacity to export at current refund rates.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	545	While the production of commodity products has been the mainstay of the Irish food industry, it is generally accepted there has been an over reliance on this sector. The Agri-Food 2010 report highlighted the need for Irish food companies to move further along the value added route and increase their penetration of high value market segments. The report identified the prepared consumer foods, food ingredients, functional foods and the high value speciality sectors as presenting the best growth opportunities. In the marketplace itself consumer trends and needs are constantly evolving and changing.Changing household structures and lifestyles have led to an increased demand for more convenience foods and the food industry must position itself to meet these changes and demands. Indeed there is clear evidence that this is so as export statistics for 2002 demonstrate. The prepared consumer foods sector is the fastest growing sector in the Irish food industry with exports increasing by 10% in 2002 to €1.8 billion. The Food Agency Co-operation Council, established under the aegis of my Department to promote the fullest possible co-operation between the agencies involved in the food industry, has been proactive in this area and has recently launched a comprehensive, user-friendly guide to market-led new product development in the food and drink industry. This publication provides guidance in relation to new product development best practice. It is also a useful directory on state services available in this area. The guide will be promulgated widely to the food industry.In addition, my Department, in co-operation with the relevant State agencies, is working closely with the food industry to encourage increased production of value added and ready to eat meals. Significant funding is being provided under the national development plan to improve the competitiveness, market orientation and innovative capability of the food industry through capital investment, marketing and promotion and research measures.

Before being exported these animals had completed all the necessary tests to comply with EU veterinary requirements for intra-community trade. The parent herd in Roscommon subsequently broke down with brucellosis in December 2002 and the appropriate authorities in the UK were notified accordingly. Two of the exported animals aborted in February 2003 on a farm in Scotland. There is regular contact between my Department and the relevant authorities in the UK on animal health issues.

In recognition of the pivotal role that research and development plays in the development of the agri-food industry, significant funding is provided  by Government to Teagasc for its research, advisory and education services.Investment in research and development is one of the key priorities in the national development plan initiatives for the food industry and considerable progress has been made to date. Under the food institutional research measure, which is administered by my Department, up to the end of 2002 a total of 77 projects have been awarded funding totalling €37 million to third level institutions and Teagasc. With regard to the in-company research and development element of the measure, administered by the development agencies, a total of €13.6 million has been committed under the plan in the same period. I am satisfied that this level of funding and funding mechanisms for research and development in the food industry will help ensure that Irish products can compete on international markets.

They do not have to opt for either a simplified system or census system for determining eligibility as in previous years. Instead, eligibility will be determined by my Department which will use the cattle movement monitoring system, CMMS, in the calculation of stocking density.Application for the arable aid scheme can only be made on the area aid application form. Similarly, application for the disadvantaged areas compensatory allowances scheme must also be made on the area aid application form.Declarations of forage area for the purposes of obtaining suckler cow premium, special beef premium and extensification premium must be made on the area aid application form. Separate application forms must be used to declare the animals being entered for the suckler cow and special beef premium schemes. In the case of the suckler cow premium scheme application forms for 2003 were issued in December 2002 to farmers who normally participate in the scheme. The application period is 2 January 2003 to 27 June 2003 and applications should be lodged in the local offices of my Department.Application forms for the 2003 special beef premium scheme were issued to farmers in late 2002. The application period runs throughout the year. Applications should be lodged in the special beef premium unit, Department of Agriculture and Food, Portlaoise, County Laois.

My Department's preference is that a new herd number be issued to the partnership, rather than transferring all the animals to the existing number of the named keeper. The issue of a new herd number helps clearly define that the partnership is a new entity that combines the herds of the partners rather than the take over of one by another. Where new numbers are issued to partnerships, the partners' old numbers are made dormant.While all the bovine enterprises of partners must be pooled, there are certain circumstances in which a second herd number may be issued to the partnership at the discretion of the district veterinary office and in the interest of disease eradication programmes.Currently, only one REPS application may be made by a partnership and all of the land farmed by the partnership must be included in it. In the consultation process on REPS which is currently under way my Department has received a submission concerning this matter, and it will be considered when proposals for amendments to REPS are being formulated for submission to the European Commission.

The CPSU has divided the country into four regions and the industrial action rotates between the regions on a weekly basis.My Department does not accept that the union has a valid basis for industrial action and contends that the action is contrary to the current social partnership agreement, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and its successor, Sustaining Progress.My Department met with CPSU representatives yesterday but, unfortunately, no basis for a settlement emerged. Following this meeting my Department was advised that with effect from this morning, CPSU members would be picketing the offices which are the subject of industrial action for this week – Limerick, Mayo, Galway and Kerry. I regret any inconvenience caused to the farming and agri-food sector.

Grant aid of €1.4 million under the national development plan is being provided this year for the development of the commercial horticulture sector. This follows on the grant aid of €3.582 million, which was paid for developments carried out over the first two years of the scheme in 2001-02. The 2003 scheme was launched on 6 February 2003, and will cover the period up to 31 December 2003. The closing date was 28 March 2003. Aid under this scheme is provided for capital investment in specialised plant and equipment in commercial horticulture. The terms of the scheme do not provide for grant aid for the replacement of fruit trees.

The fact that the effect of any overshoot would fall on producers who applied for over 50 animals was part of the decision to raise the total eligible number of applications from 90 to 180. The scale of the overshoot is the result of a surge of applications submitted to my Department in late December 2002. This followed the early publication of a confidential draft legal text of the Commission proposals for the mid-term review, which included 2002 as one of three reference years for the purposes of establishing entitlements to the single direct payment. I have raised the matter with the European Commission with a view to finding a means of minimising the impact on farmers.

This disease has affected poultry flocks in an area in the central province of Gelderland in the Netherlands. Avian influenza is a highly contagious poultry disease that can pose a serious threat to the poultry industry. In view of the high mortality and the rapid spread of the  infection, the Netherlands took immediate national action including banning all movements of live poultry and hatching eggs within the Netherlands and prohibiting their dispatch to other member states and third countries.The European Commission after consultation with the Dutch authorities took safeguard measures to support the Dutch national measures and imposed a ban on the export from the Netherlands of live poultry and hatching eggs to other member states. These measures have been most recently prolonged until 10 April 2003.

In 2001, total mushroom output was 68,000 tonnes with an estimated farm gate value of €128 million. This represented an all-time high for the sector.While some growers have left the industry, mushroom output has been maintained by growers who expanded and invested in new equipment, such as environmental controls and new growing systems. Funding available under the NDP has assisted producers in this regard while the development of producer organisations under the EU grant scheme has been of great benefit to producers of mushrooms. The producer organisation scheme enables producers to benefit from their combined strength in producing and marketing a high quality product. Currently, there are 14 mushroom producers organisations in existence and nine of these were in receipt of grant aid of the order of €1.94 million in 2001. Their total marketed production in that year was €114.41million.To help the sector adapt to the changing market situation, the two state agencies under my aegis, Bord Bia and An Bord Glas, have jointly commissioned a study which will examine the structure and competitiveness of the sector over the whole production-supply chain. This study will be completed by early summer.

In Ireland three private bodies are currently approved to carry out the functions of inspection and certification under EU regulations for organic crops and crop produce. My Department is considering arrangements for the inspection of the organic livestock sector and is in continuing discussions with these three bodies on the matter.

Biocides are being regulated for the first time in Ireland under EU Directive 98/8 as transposed by S.I. No. 625 of 2001, so there is limited information with respect to the range and number of biocidal products sold in Ireland. As a transitional measure and with a view to determining the number of biocidal products sold in this country my Department decided to oblige companies, marketing biocidal products, to notify this information to the pesticide control service for the purpose of establishing such a register. This register will be established in early 2004. There have been no prosecutions by my Department for the illegal sale or use of pesticides-biocides since the 1 January 2003.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	562	My Department has carried out investigations into the two cases of BSE in animals born in 1999. Both of these cases were identified on farms in the same general area and were born within a week of each other. Both were about 45 months of age at the time of detection, well above the age threshold for testing in meat plants, and both were detected long before they could have entered the food chain.While factors have been identified in each case, including the identification of illegal knackeries in the vicinity of both farms, which may have contributed to the occurrence of the disease, I do not believe that there is evidence of any systematic breakdown in BSE controls. In fact, the pattern of cases would indicate that controls are working effectively. Appropriate follow-up actions are being taken in relation to the illegal knackeries.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	563	Since mid-2002, under EU safeguard arrangements, Ireland has implemented a sampling programme to test poultry imported from certain third countries for the presence of nitrofurans, which are a group of banned antibiotics. One positive consignment has been detected to date under the programme and the consignment  concerned was not allowed to enter the food chain. More recently, as the Deputy is probably aware, nitrofuran residues have been discovered by the Portuguese authorities in domestically produced poultry resulting in the affected farms being restricted.Arising from this and also linked with the recent development of more effective laboratory methods for the detection of these substances, the European Commission has asked all member states to upgrade their existing monitoring arrangements to the new standard. Arrangements have already been made here to comply with this request by including testing to the upgraded standard in the 2003 national residue plan.

My objective in the negotiations will be to preserve the benefits to Irish agriculture and to rural communities achieved under the Agenda 2000 Agreement.The 2001 national farm survey produced by Teagasc provided an estimate of average direct payments made to farmers according to their farm income category. The results show that approximately 36% of payments went to the 20% of farmers with the highest farm income.

In 2002, over 700,000 animals were tested for BSE and of these over 600,000 were in the over 30 months category. A total of 333 BSE cases were confirmed in that year. Of these, 221 were detected through active surveillance, and 34 were in the over 30 months category.The purpose of the control programme is to protect human health by maintaining high standards of food safety, to safeguard the economically important beef industry and in due course to eradicate the disease from the national herd.

However, as a result of concerns expressed by consumers on this and other issues, I established a food labelling group to examine issues surrounding food labelling. This group reported to me in December 2002 and this specific issue was raised in the context of the group's recommendations. I have recently agreed a strategy for the implementation of the recommendations of the group and, to this end, an interdepartmental-agency committee is being set up to monitor the functioning of the strategy.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	568	The most recent EU Dairy Management Committee meeting was held on 27 March 2003. The EU Commission did not propose any change in the levels of export refunds at that meeting. A number of factors affecting world markets make it difficult to arrive at reliable assumptions about short-term market conditions and in the circumstances, the Commission proposed that refund levels should remain at their current rate for the present. However, a 16% increase in the export refund rate for skim milk powder was agreed at the meeting of 13 February 2003.The aid to private storage scheme for butter was reopened from 1 March 2003 and intervention for SMP reopened on the same date. To date, 1357 tonnes of SMP has been purchased into storage in this country. Both of these measures create a valuable outlet on the internal market and contribute positively to market stability, particularly in periods of excess supply. The market for milk products has stabilised in recent times following the difficulties experienced last year but I will continue to carefully monitor market developments to ensure that the EU's market support mechanisms are fully utilised.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	569	The Commission staff working paper refers to "a strong commitment to organic farming on the part of regional and national governments by way of the agri-environment programmes". Ireland's agri-environment programme, the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, provides substantial financial support to farmers both during conversion to organic farming and subsequently once they have achieved organic status. Under REPS, organic farmers can avail of a supplementary payment on top of the basic payment. During the conversion period, an organic farmer can receive up to €13,280 a year. Once organic status is achieved, a farmer may receive up to €9,680. Organic farmers have received more than €20 million in REPS payments since the scheme was introduced in  1994. I am satisfied that the support provided through REPS is one of the major inducements to Irish farmers to consider the organic option.I have previously indicated my support for the development of a European action plan for organic food and farming and I welcome the publication of the Commission staff working paper.

The monitoring programme is then carried out by the pesticide control service. The programme aims to ensure that consumers are not exposed to unacceptable residues of pesticides in food. The programme is also used to ensure that plant protection products are applied to crops according to good agricultural practice, GAP.The protection of the consumer from unacceptable levels of pesticide residues in food, is a high priority of my Department. In the past number of years additional resources have been assigned to this work. The number of samples analysed in 2002, at 968, was 51% greater than the number analysed in 2001. The monitoring programme agreed for 2003 requires that 1,300 samples be analysed for up to 89 different pesticides and metabolites. This is a further increase of 34% over the 2002 programme. The pesticide laboratory of my Department was the first laboratory in Ireland to be accredited for this work to the ISO 17025 standard.My Department, in consultation with the FSAI, will continue to provide the highest possible level of protection to the consumer by controlling pesticide residues in food and is committed to further strengthening the monitoring programme.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	571	While I do not wish to comment on the  specific poll, which was commissioned by the Irish Farmers' Association, I accept that 2002 was a difficult year for farmers. Aggregate farm income fell by 8.9% in 2002 to €2,381million, following increases of 4.2% in 2001 and 8.6% in 2000. The fall was caused by a combination of unprecedented bad weather, a drop in beef slaughtering from their high levels in 2001 and lower market returns in areas such as dairying. The agricultural sector is facing an uncertain and challenging period. It is understandable, given the economic downturn both nationally and internationally and the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the negotiations of the mid-term CAP review and the WTO, that farmers are concerned about the future.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	572	It is my policy and that of the Government that Irish beef should be free to enter any market where exporters consider there are commercial possibilities. Where there are restrictions due to BSE, every effort has, and will continue to be made at political, diplomatic and technical level to have them removed. As a consequence of these efforts, the Egyptian market re-opened late 2001 although trade has not yet resumed in commercial quantities. Following my representations to Commissioner Fischler last September, the EU increased export refunds by up to 30% on beef exported to Egypt. However, for the most part, the non-resumption of trade is due to the poor price available in Egypt compared to that currently obtained in the UK. There are some technical issues in relation to the type of cuts acceptable and these issues are being followed up with the Egyptian authorities. Greater flexibility on this issue would make the Egyptian market more commercially attractive.As a result of ongoing contacts between the Irish and Russian authorities restrictions on the supply of beef from certain counties were lifted and this has substantially improved access to that market for Irish beef. Intensive efforts are continuing in relation to other important markets for Irish beef such as the Gulf states, South Africa and Indonesia.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	573	While the organic sector in Ireland is small it has grown over recent years. Sales of organic food are estimated to be worth over €30 million a year. Currently there are some 1,000 organic operators registered with my Department, and approximately 30,000 hectares of land are being farmed to organic standards. While this represents less than 1% of agricultural land, it is a fourfold increase on the area farmed organically in the mid 1990s.The Government is committed to the further development of the organic sector and have provided substantial funding to advance it. Organic farmers can draw attractive financial support through the rural environment protection scheme. While in conversion to organic farming they can receive up to €13,280 a year in REPS, and after they have gained full organic status they can continue to draw up to €9,680 annually. Organic farmers have received more than €20 million in REPS payments since the scheme was introduced in 1994.Further financial support is provided through the scheme of grant aid for the development of the organic sector, which offers 40% grant assistance for both on-farm and off-farm capital investment in equipment and facilities for the production, preparation, grading, packing, storage and distribution of organic produce. For on-farm investment projects grant assistance is available up to a maximum of €50,790, while off-farm investment projects may receive up to a maximum of €253,948.While these financial supports make a major contribution to the organic sector, all stakeholders have a part to play in its further development. I accepted a recommendation of the AgriFood 2010 committee and established an organic development committee, which produced its report in April 2002. The committee has estimated that a target of 3% of land area in organic farming by 2006 is achievable. It has also made a number of recommendations to develop the organic sector in Ireland, including the setting up a national steering group. The steering group has already met twice and has established an organic market development group and a partnership expert working group.

However, ongoing work throughout 2001 on the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001, which transposed into Irish law the provisions of Council Directive 97/ 81/ EC of 15 December 1997 concerning the framework agreement on part-time work concluded by UNICE, CEEP and the ETUC, delayed somewhat detailed consideration, with the social partners and relevant Departments, of the provisions of the transposing legislation. These consultations took place during 2002.My Department has drawn up the heads of a Bill aimed at transposing this directive into Irish law and these heads are currently with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government for the drafting of an appropriate Bill. I hope to have the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Bill 2003 published by the end of April and to have it enacted as soon as possible thereafter.One of the main provisions of the proposed Bill is to provide that abuse arising from the use of successive fixed-term employment contracts will be outlawed and whereby the contracts of fixed-term employees will automatically become permanent after a certain amount of time and after a certain number of renewals of these contracts.

As regards those public bodies under the aegis of my Department which are not currently the subject of a separate designation, my Department's information indicates that there are no cases where an initial decision to refuse access to deliberative material was subsequently overturned or varied on appeal.

Where, under these sections, and in the judgment of the decision maker the public interest is not on balance better served by granting rather than refusing the request, the decision maker is obliged to refuse access to the relevant records.The matter of release of records which have been withheld on the basis of application of the public interest test, therefore, only arises if the initial decision is appealed by the requester. In such cases, the Act provides that the initial decision may be overturned or varied, either on internal appeal, or on subsequent appeal to the Information Commissioner.It should be noted that the reasons for varying or overturning a decision can be complex and more than one reason can apply in each specific case. However, according to my Department's information, there are two cases where an initial decision was overturned or varied on internal appeal, the reasons for which relate principally to one of the issues raised by the Deputy. There are no records of cases overturned or varied by the Information Commissioner in this instance.

In this instance, I am informed that the Defence Forces press office responded directly to a request from RTE to provide technical analysis in the event of war in Iraq. Such analysis began on Wednesday 19 March and is confined to the provision of technical military commentary by officers of the Permanent Defence Force on particular strategic and tactical military aspects of the present situation in Iraq. Given the obvious sensitivities associated with the developing situation, this participation of military personnel will be kept under review.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	587	I have no proposals to allocate milk quota to producers in particular areas of the country for free. Under the milk quota restructuring scheme, which operates each year in co-operative or dairy collection areas, producers who wish to increase their quotas may, subject to certain conditions, purchase additional quota from the restructuring pool. The maximum price at which quota may be sold and bought is set by the Minister on a national basis and has been reduced very significantly over recent years. Co-operatives or dairies can set a price that is lower than that maximum. I understand that considerable quantities of quota have been available under this scheme over the years in the collection area which includes the areas referred to by the Deputy. In addition, a scheme operates each year for the free allocation of milk quota on a permanent basis, from the national reserve to producers who have suffered extreme hardship in the context of the milk quota system. Allocations are based on the recommendation of the milk quota appeals tribunal, which assesses applications on the basis of objective criteria. The scheme for the 2003-04 quota year has not yet been drawn up but  it will be announced in the usual way around the end of the summer.

An application was submitted by the wife of the person named in relation to this quota. As the conditions of the scheme were not satisfied, however, an allocation was not made. An appeals procedure exists in relation to this scheme and the person named has submitted an appeal. The assessment of appeals will be based on recommendations from the milk quota appeals tribunal. When the appeals process is completed, each appellant will be notified of the outcome.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	589	Section 20 of the Freedom of Information Act provides that decision-makers may refuse access to records if they are satisfied that the deliberative process is ongoing and that, in their opinion, the granting of the request would be contrary to the public interest. Such records would not be released by my Department if it were considered contrary to the public interest to do so. To date, no requests refused by my Department under section 20 of the Act have been released on appeal to the Information Commissioner.

It appears from a preliminary examination of files, however, that there were no cases where a declaration of the existence of a record obtained in confidence or commercially sensitive was made which was considered by my Department to be contrary to the public interest. The Freedom of Information Act requires decision-makers to refuse access to certain records obtained in confidence or commercially sensitive, under sections 26 and 27 respectively, unless they believe that the public interest would, on balance, be better served by granting than by refusing to grant the request. Records satisfying the conditions laid down in sections 26 or 27 of the Act would not be released, therefore, if a decision maker believed that the public interest would not, on balance, be better served by granting rather than refusing the request.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	594	Measures to facilitate the development of the meat sector are set out in the agri-food plan of action. The strategy for the development of the beef and lamb sectors aims to ensure that they achieve their full potential, thereby maximising their contribution to the national economy. Action will be taken on a range of fronts to address competitiveness at production and processing levels and to adopt a comprehensive strategic marketing focus. The main marketing focus for beef involves moving up the value chain at EU level, through increased penetration at retail level in the UK, increasing exports to other core continental markets, targeting growth in European developing markets and developing niche opportunities. An important element of the marketing strategy is to broaden the spread of third country markets.

I have made €120 million available this year to Teagasc for the provision of services, including research and development, to the agri-food sector. I have no doubt that this level of funding, along with Teagasc's own resources, will enable the provision of these services to continue.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	597	It is my policy and that of the Govern ment that Irish beef should be free to enter any market where exporters consider there are commercial possibilities. Every effort continues to be made at political, diplomatic and technical level to achieve that objective. This strategy not only involves my own Department but the Department of Foreign Affairs as well as An Bord Bia which is the body charged with the promotion of Irish beef and other food products worldwide. The primary commercial task of identifying and exploiting markets remains a matter for the industry itself. Equally, where markets have been re-opened, it is for the industry to avail of the re-opening and to fully exploit any opportunities arising as a result.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	598	It is my policy and that of the Government that Irish beef should have unrestricted access to any market where exporters consider there are commercial possibilities. Every effort has and will continue to be made at political, diplomatic and technical levels to have all potential markets open to Irish beef exporters. Although the Egyptian market re-opened in late 2001, trade has not yet resumed in commercial quantities. My Department is in contact with the Egyptian authorities on a number of technical issues. Following my representations to Commissioner Fischler last September, the EU increased export refunds by up to 30% on beef exported to Egypt. As a result of ongoing contacts between the Irish and Russian authorities, restrictions on the supply of beef from certain counties were lifted and this has substantially improved access to that market for Irish beef. Intensive efforts continue in relation to other important markets for Irish beef such as the Gulf states, South Africa and Indonesia.An Bord Bia is the State body charged with promoting the sale of Irish beef and other food products worldwide and with underpinning the marketing endeavours of our food companies. It regularly participates in trade fairs in a variety of countries while undertaking promotion campaigns in selected markets. From my Department's perspective, the marketing of beef is very much concerned with providing the necessary guarantees in relation to the safety of the product. The quality of the controls in place in the beef sector are such that we are in a position to provide consumers with the maximum possible guarantees about the safety of Irish beef.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	599	I have availed of every opportunity to further the cause of the Irish food industry through promotional events, policy development and various other fora whether formal or informal at national and international level. I have been active in supporting An Bord Bia in its role of promoting Irish food both at home and abroad. An Bord Bia implements a wide range of specialist marketing and promotion activities to enhance Ireland's international profile as a producer of quality food and drink products. The board has seen a marked increase in its budget since 2000 and 14 additional staff have been appointed. This, coupled with sound strategic planning, targeted market analysis and close partnership with food companies, will ensure development of a food industry that is competitive and capable in an increasingly challenging market.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	600	The marketing of Irish lamb in existing and new markets is primarily the responsibility of the industry. It is supported in its efforts by ongoing and comprehensive promotion by An Bord Bia. My Department and I and the Department of Foreign Affairs support the campaigns of An Bord Bia in whatever way possible in various markets. France remains the principal export market and obviously promotion and marketing efforts focus to a very large extent there. Other EU markets such as the UK, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Spain and Portugal also provide outlets for Irish lamb and are the location of ongoing efforts by An Bord Bia. The domestic market is also extremely important and An Bord Bia is undertaking a number of promotional initiatives in the home market in 2003 to increase the consumption of lamb.EU production is in deficit and therefore the development of third country markets is not a priority under current conditions. The focus, therefore, is on EU markets. Returns to Irish producers remain strong at present and the outlook for 2003 is for production and exports to stabilise at 2002 levels.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	601	While member states are prohibited under the Single Market rules from compelling retailers to give preferential treatment to domestically produced goods, I have no reason to believe that Irish manufacturers receive less favourable treatment than their competitors. The solid overall performance of the food industry in 2002, with exports increasing by 1.5% on 2001 to €6.2 billion, is proof of this. The industry now accounts for half of all exports by Irish owned companies and almost 9% of Ireland's total exports. The domestic market for Irish food is valued at approximately €7 billion.The retail channel represents one of the most important routes to market for Irish producers. The extent to which the industry can maintain and expand its market position will be contingent on its ability to maintain a competitive edge and remain vigilant to consumer demands and trends. My Department, in co-operation with the relevant state agencies, will continue to assist the industry to establish new markets for Irish food produce and to consolidate our presence in existing markets. Significant funding is being provided to the food sector under the national development plan to improve competitiveness, market orientation and innovative capability. These initiatives cover capital investment, marketing and promotion and research measures and are expected to increase sales of food and drink products by €2.5 billion by the end of 2006.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	602	With consumption in EU markets now recovering following the last BSE crisis there is potential for Irish beef exports to those markets to continue to increase. The UK market in particular as a destination for Irish beef has seen huge growth during the past two years and is likely to remain strong this year also. Last year, for example, exports to the UK amounted to some 250,000 tonnes. Markets in France, the Netherlands, Italy and Sweden also remain strong. After the UK, Russia is the most important market for Irish beef having taken some 83,000 tonnes in 2002. At this stage it is anticipated that exports there in 2003 will continue to perform strongly. The Egyptian market, which re-opened in late 2001, is a destination of considerable potential for Irish beef and has taken very high volumes in the past. The Gulf states also offer considerable potential and enormous efforts are being made to lift the bans which currently apply there. As part of these efforts, my Department, working with the Department of Foreign Affairs and An Bord Bia, hosted a con ference on food safety and consumer protection in the beef sector in Dublin last October. The conference was aimed specifically at important markets in the Gulf region. It was attended by experts from the Gulf Co-operation Council's food safety committee, representing Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and it afforded visiting experts from Gulf states the opportunity to assess the level and effectiveness of Ireland's BSE controls. Reaction to the conference was very positive. We maintain ongoing contact with the South African, Philippines and Indonesian authorities at technical and diplomatic level with a view to having those markets reopened to Irish beef. Furthermore, in 2002, my Department hosted veterinary delegations from South Africa and the Philippines aimed at demonstrating the efficiency of our BSE controls. We are following up on these potential markets for Irish beef.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	603	Approximately 80% of exported Irish dairy products are consigned to other EU countries and these destinations will undoubtedly continue to offer the greatest potential. EU enlargement has paved the way for another 106 million consumers to join this already large market and the increased trading opportunities this provides will further increase the importance of the internal EU market for Irish exporters.Some months ago, in association with Enterprise Ireland and the industry itself, I commissioned a strategic study of the Irish dairy processing sector. Part of the terms of reference for that study was to identify market opportunities for dairy products. The results of this study were presented on 19 March. In their report, the consultants we tasked have identified opportunities for Ireland in the developed EU markets, the developing eastern European markets, the Middle East, North Africa and the Americas. They have also suggested the type of product portfolio required for these markets. While action to be taken in response to the recommendations of that report will be for the industry itself, my Department and I will do whatever is necessary to assist in driving forward those recommendations. As part of our efforts, I have already met with Enterprise Ireland and will hold a series of meetings with co-operatives and processors with a view to identifying the best way of achieving the objectives set out in the report.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	604	Responsibility for exotic animals is shared by a number of Departments. The Department of the Environment and Local Government is responsible for matters relating to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, CITES, and is also the competent authority in relation to the transposition and implementation of Council Directive 1999/22/EC of 29 March 1999 which concerns the keeping of wild animals in zoos. One of the measures to be taken by member states under this directive is to prevent the escape of animals in order to avoid possible ecological threats to indigenous species and to prevent the intrusion of outside pets and vermin. The Office of Public Works has responsibility for Dublin Zoo.The area where my Department has a responsibility in relation to exotic animals is in respect of compliance with animal health regulations concerning veterinary certification at time of import and export. Provided there is compliance with veterinary rules, there can be no restriction on inter-Community trade in exotic animals. The interdepartmental group on exotic animals last met in September 1999. This is due in large measure to the fact that my Department has in the intervening period had to accord a higher priority to more pressing animal health and welfare matters. It has had to focus available resources and effort on a range of planned and unplanned issues which have arisen in this area. I hope that my Department and the other interested parties can return to the matter of exotic animals in the near future.With regard to the suggested legislation on the keeping of exotic and dangerous wild animals drafted by the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, it should be noted that the situation with regard to the keeping of animals in zoos is now subject to the provisions of Council Directive 1999/22/EC of 29 March 1999. The Department of the Environment and Local Government is currently transposing this directive into Irish law.

To date, 366 of these cases have been settled and 64 remain to be finalised. Of the cases not yet finalised, six are being dealt with by the revenue prosecution division. Currently, three of these cases are before the courts. One person pleaded guilty and their case is adjourned for sentencing. The other two cases were referred to the Circuit Court for trial. The Director of Public Prosecutions has given directions for a prosecution in another case and the remaining two cases are under ongoing investigation with a view to prosecution.To date, Revenue has collected €44.57 million in tax, interest and penalties in respect of these cases. This sum is made up of €37.83 million in settled cases and €6.74 million in respect of payments on account in cases still under investigation. As part of a further review of its records by the financial institution concerned, a supplementary list containing 22 new cases was received by the Revenue Commissioners in April 2001. Of these, 15 involve relatively small sums and are unlikely to involve substantial tax evasion. All additional cases are being investigated as appropriate.Aggregate results of the ongoing investigation have been published each year since 1998 in the annual reports of the Revenue Commissioners. In addition, details of individual settlements with the commissioners have also been published where they were in excess of the statutory requirement for publication; over €12,700.

The certificate of tax credits which issued to the taxpayer on 24 January 2003 included the married person's tax credit and standard rate cut-off point. A temporary replacement certificate of tax credits, effective from the date of issue, is in the process of being issued. This will replace the married tax credit and standard rate cut-off point with those appropriate to a single person.The inspector has written to the taxpayer requesting him to complete a return of income for 2002. The inspector has also asked the taxpayer to indicate whether any dependent child or children reside with him for any part of the year. If that is the case, the taxpayer may be entitled to claim the one-parent family tax credit. The inspector has sent the relevant claim form to the taxpayer. The inspector has also requested the taxpayer to forward details of any maintenance payments he may be making to his former wife. When the inspector receives the requested information, he will revise the taxpayer's tax credits as necessary and issue a revised certificate effective from 1 January 2003.

As the Act requires a decision maker to refuse access where the public interest test favours non release, there should be no instance where records are released where the balance of public interest favoured non release.It is, however, assumed that the questions are meant to relate to instances where access to records were initially refused primarily under sections 19, 20, 24, 26 or 27 of the Act, but on a further consideration of the public interest were later released, or part released, at internal review or on appeal to the Information Commissioner. In this regard it must be recognised that, in making their decision, an internal reviewer or the Information Commissioner normally takes a range of factors into consideration, including passage of time and the appropriateness of the exemption or exemptions used, not just the public interest consideration on its own. Consequently, it is difficult to say with any precision the number of instances where further records were released at internal review or by the Information Commissioner solely on the basis of a reconsideration of the public interest test.

The content covers all the strands of the curriculum, living things, energy and forces, materials and environmental care. Four weeks intensive training has been provided for science trainers and the in-career development programme for teachers is now under way.The primary science curriculum will be introduced to primary schools in the 2003-04 school year, when it is expected that most schools will begin to implement it. While many schools may have already informally begun to implement the curriculum, my Department does not have the details requested by the Deputy in relation to these schools. When the curriculum is formally implemented the time allocated to science will be within the allocation of the three hours per week period given to SESE.

The timing of when the project can be progressed will depend on the capital allocation for 2004 and future years.

In the case of the teacher referred to by the Deputy, it is a matter for the employer, City of Limerick VEC, to ensure that this allowance of paid leave has been applied correctly in this case.It is open to any teacher who, while actually serving as a teacher, has become incapable from infirmity of body or mind of discharging the duties of a teacher, and where such infirmity is likely to be permanent, to make application for the payment of a disability pension. The granting of a disability pension, in the case of a teacher employed by a vocational education committee, is subject to the formal approval of the relevant vocational education committee based on the report of a medical examiner appointed by that VEC.The terms and conditions of employment of teachers are the subject of agreements at the Teachers Conciliation Council, which is comprised of representatives of teacher unions, school management bodies, my Department, the Department of Finance and an independent chairperson. Agreed terms and conditions are, as I indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 110 of 6 March last, of general application to all teachers and it would be wholly inappropriate for me to interfere in this process.

However, a report has been presented to my Department by the Centre for Management Organisation and Development, CMOD, of the Department of Finance who recently undertook a review of the education centre network. This report contains a wide range of recommendations, including the closure of three full-time centres – Kildare, Kilkenny, and Sligo – and all part-time centres, excluding the Gaeltacht part-time centres.The CMOD review and the wide range of recommendations made in it are being considered in my Department at present and decisions regarding the recommendations contained in the review will be taken following a thorough consideration of all the relevant issues and following full consultation with the Association of Teachers-Education Centres in Ireland, ATECI. In this regard, an invitation has been extended to ATECI to get the consultation process under way at an early date.

The 1997 Act sets out the basis for application of exemptions to records relating to records of the Government, security, defence, international relations, information contained in confidence, commercially sensitive information and the deliberative process. Decisions on the application of those exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act 1997 and on how relevant public interest tests should be applied are made by designated decision makers to whom the powers of heads of Departments have been generally delegated.Where a particular exemption was applied, this would occur only after the decision maker concluded that the application of any relevant public interest test did not outweigh invoking the exemption. The numbers of FOI requests refused under the relevant sections of the Act are not available in this Department.

Such teachers are also eligible for posts as resource teachers for children with special needs in mainstream schools, but are not eligible for learning support posts in mainstream schools.Teachers with the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year full time course in the Association Montessori Internationale college, Mount St. Mary's, Milltown, Dublin 14, and teachers trained in St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, Montessori who have successfully completed the full-time course of at least three years' duration which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, may be granted such recognition. These conditions are set out in circular 25/00, recognition of teacher qualifications for the purpose of teaching in national schools.

This is necessary so as to avoid the use of the same test material, which could have the effect of invalidating the results, given the closeness of time between both assessments.The NEPS hopes, therefore, to be in a position to review this case during the summer term 2003. The child's family will be kept informed of developments. Meanwhile, it would be helpful if the name of the school now attended by the child could be supplied to the NEPS.

This funding was to support investment of some €87 million in the period 2000-06.The measure is aimed at accelerated development of the seafood processing sector to create a competitive value-added capability of scale to the highest quality and technological standards. It is designed to assist in developing a growing and sustainable sector through encouraging competitiveness, by adding value and through promoting quality and optimum utilisation of raw material supplies and capacity. Government grants support capital investment for industry led initiatives in the areas of produce innovation, enhanced value added and increased production where feasible. The programme is soundly based on the independent study of the sector carried out by Indecon economic consultants and PricewaterhouseCoopers, in close consultation with the industry.In 2002, a total of 21 processing companies were grant aided involving grant aid of €2.12 million. The projects were assessed by the Processing Investment Projects Approvals Board, which includes representatives from BIM, Údarás na Gaeltachta, Enterprise Ireland, the Southern and Eastern Regional Assembly and the Border, Midland and Western Regional Assembly. A total of €1.5 million has been allocated under this measure for 2003. Arrangements are in place to have the projects assessed by the PIPAB.

Section 19 provides exemptions to records of the Government, which includes committees appointed by the Government with a specified membership. The section does not provide for the application of a public interest test, except in so far as it relates to the disclosure of the existence of a record. Access to the records of Government is generally refused under the provisions of the Act.The Act sets out the basis for application of exemptions to records relating to security, defence, international relations, information contained in confidence, commercially sensitive information and the deliberative process. Decisions on the application of those exemptions under the Act and on how relevant public interest tests should be applied are made by designated decision makers to whom the powers of heads of Departments have been generally delegated. Where a particular exemption was applied, this would occur only after the decision maker concluded that the application of any relevant public interest test did not outweigh invoking the exemption.The numbers of FOI requests refused under the relevant sections of the Act are not available in this Department. There was one instance in which such a decision to refuse access has been overturned by the Information Commissioner, where the reason for given by the commissioner related to the application of the public interest test. Information would generally not be available in relation to instances where a decision maker had concluded that application of a public interest test warranted not invoking a potential exemption and releasing a record. Decision makers usually record only grounds on which records are not being released.

The BreastCheck clinical unit in the western area will  be at University College Hospital Galway with two associated mobile units. The area of coverage is counties Galway, Sligo, Roscommon, Donegal, Mayo, Leitrim, Clare and Tipperary North Riding. The BreastCheck clinical unit in the southern area will be located at South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital with three associated mobile units. Counties covered include Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Waterford and Tipperary South Riding.Under the extension, approximately 130,000 women in the target population 50 to 64 years of age will be eligible for screening. The programme expects to diagnose approximately 400 cancers per annum among this population.I do not anticipate additional revenue requirements for this programme this year. As regards capital costs, discussions are ongoing involving officials of my Department, BreastCheck and relevant health agencies.

The ERHA has proposed the development of a range of services for older persons on the site which includes a 50 bed community unit, a 25 bed secondary rehabilitation unit, a new day care centre, sheltered housing and ten single self-contained apartments.A draft developmental control plan and planning briefs for proposed services have been undertaken and are being examined by officials in my Department in conjunction with the ERHA. These include proposals to refurbish the old nurses' home which are now well advanced. Funding for the development of services for older people on the site is being considered by the ERHA and my Department in the context of progressing capital projects for the authority in future and in line with funding resources available under the national development plan.My Department will continue to liaise closely with the ERHA with a view to progressing matters as quickly as possible.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	641	I propose to take Questions Nos. 187 and 188 together.I presume the Deputy is referring to the drugs payment scheme which replaced the drugs refund scheme and the drugs cost subsidisation scheme in 1999. A common list of reimbursable medicines was introduced for the general medical services scheme, GMS, and the drug payment scheme, DPS. This list ensures equity between the GMS and DPS on the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. The common list is subject to ongoing review and amendment on a monthly basis as new products become available and deletions are notified.For an item to be included in the common list it must comply with a published list of criteria. These include authorisation status where appropriate, price and, in certain cases, the intended use of the product. In addition, the product should ordinarily be supplied to the public only by medical prescription and should not be advertised or promoted to the public.Aero-chambers are not included in the common list as they do not comply with current pricing criteria. However, the Deputy will be pleased to learn that both volumatic and babyhaler spacer devices are included in the common list.A medical card holder who experiences financial difficulty in obtaining items not covered on the common list should approach the relevant health board for assistance.

I understand that the Deputy has a copy of this letter. I reiterate that it is not the remit of the Department or the health board to investigate the reason a GMS doctor asks to have a person removed from their client list. According to the provisions of the GMS contract, doctors are free to so decide.

This funding is in addition to the significant revenue investment, amounting to €188 million, which has been made in these services since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base.The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, more than 900 new residential, 380 new respite and around 2,000 new day places for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism.In particular, €14.6 million has been invested in health-related support services for children with autism or an intellectual disability nationally between 1998 and 2002. A further €4 million has been allocated to these services in 2003. This includes diagnostic and assessment services, early intervention, home support and outreach support to children of schoolgoing age.Despite this significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular, even though the numbers of people in receipt of services, including full time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition, people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	644	I propose to take Questions Nos. 191 to 195, inclusive, together.Since the commencement of the Act my Department has received in excess of 3,000 requests for access to records. Applying the provisions of the Act, it has been possible to release records in 1,400 of these cases. Many of the refusals relate to records not held by the Department or to records covered by legal professional privilege, commercial sensitivity, and Cabinet confidentiality. Up to December 2002, 41 decisions in all have been appealed to the Information Commissioner, of which less than a quarter have led to the release of additional records.The Deputy asks for examples where disclosures under the Act have proved injurious to the public interest and whether these disclosures were made by my Department or the Information Commissioner. It is not the practice to monitor the outcome of specific disclosures under the Act and such an assessment would present many difficulties. However, I am not aware of any case where disclosure by either office has had a significant negative impact on the public interest.

These state that the creation of new forms of life for experimental purposes or the deliberate and intentional destruction of human life already formed is professional misconduct. I am conscious of concerns about the absence of a statutory framework to regulate this area. With a view to addressing these concerns in a comprehensive and informed way, and following a Government decision on the matter, I established the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction in March 2000 with the following terms of reference:To prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all areas of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy in this area.When completed, the commission's report will provide the basis for informing public debate prior to the finalisation of any policy proposals. Given the complexity of the issues under examination, it is difficult to be definitive about when the work of the commission will be completed. I am, however, satisfied that it is working as expeditiously as is feasible.In relation to EU-funded programmes, the following sets out the position with regard to both the sixth framework research programme for the EU, FP6, which will run from 2002 to 2006, and EU aid for policies and actions on reproductive and sexual health and rights in developing countries.

The objective of the directive is to set out a general framework and safety rules for vitamins and minerals in the EU and to ensure that these products are appropriately labelled so that consumers can make informed choices.Drafting of national legislation to give effect to the directive is under way. This drafting process has included consultations between the Department of Health and Children, the Irish Medicines Board and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, and my Department has also had contact with the Irish Health Trade Association and the Irish Association of Health Stores. The Department of Health and Children intends to implement this directive by the due date which is 31 July next.

It should be pointed out that a much smaller proportion of military en route flights fly through domestic airspace with the permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs while a smaller proportion again land at Irish airports.The total revenue raised by the IAA in respect of en route, terminal and communications charges to civil flights in total Irish controlled airspace was €77.3 million in 2001, €84.0 million in 2002 and €13.8 million in respect of January and February 2003.

No. 182 of 1997). Article 17 of these regulations provides that where the appropriate traffic sign is provided at the entrance to a road, the driver of a vehicle, the unladen weight of which exceeds the weight specified on the sign, is prohibited from proceeding beyond the sign except where it is necessary for the vehicle to enter a road solely for the purpose of gaining access to or egress from premises accessible only from that road. The application of such restrictions is a matter for each local authority.The application of that restriction is not limited to particular periods of the day. However, a request to introduce such a time based provision has recently been received by my Department from Dublin City Council and is being considered.

She failed to attend for interview on two occasions in December 2001 and January 2002 and her application for refugee status was subsequently refused. The applicant was informed by letter of 29 September 2002 that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of her. A person served with such a notice of intent is afforded three options – to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the deportation order or to make representations in writing within 15 working days of the sending to him or her of the notice of intent. She did not avail of any of the options and failed to reply to the correspondence.The applicant's case was examined under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (Prohibition of Refoulement). A deportation order was signed in respect of her on 30 October 2002. She was informed of this decision by letter of 29 November 2002. In the meantime, representations have been made in respect of this person which will require a further assessment of her case. This will take place as soon as possible and the person concerned will be informed of the outcome.

My Department's involvement relates primarily to the provision of funds to local authorities for individual projects, within the allocation available in the public capital programme. The detailed administration of any relevant project, including certification that it complies with the terms of the scheme, is the responsibility of the local authority, in this instance Cork County Council.A grant of €266,646 has been approved in this case, with €186,614 of this amount having been drawn down to date. It is understood from Cork County Council that formal application for payment of the balance, €80,032, will shortly be lodged. It is also understood that the project may be eligible for additional funding under the scheme and this is being considered by the council in consultation with the housing body concerned.

Accordingly, there should have been no instances where records relating to the deliberative processes of the Department were released by my Department where the public interest was not on balance better served by granting rather than refusing the request and my Department is not aware of any such instance.

Accordingly, there should have been no instances where such records were released by my Department and my Department is not aware of any such instance.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	670	Sections 26 and 27 of the Freedom of information Act 1997 provide that information obtained in confidence and commercially sensitive information, respectively, may not be released unless, in the opinion of the public body, the public interest would, on balance, be better served by granting than refusing the request, and consultation has taken place with the third party, who has a right of appeal to the Information Commissioner where it is proposed to release such information. Accordingly, there should have been no instances where information obtained in confidence or commercially sensitive information was released by my Department where the public interest was not on balance better served by granting rather than refusing the request and my Department is not aware of any such instance.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-03 00:00:00	Prelude	671	Communications between Ministers in relation to a matter which has been submitted to Government may be exempt records under the Freedom of Information Act 1997. This would be the case if they were deemed to come within the provisions of section 19 of the Act, i.e. they were records that were submitted or were proposed to be submitted to Government and were created for that purpose or contained information for a member of the Government for use solely for the purpose of the transaction of Government business at a Government meeting. It would also arise if they came within the scope of any of the other exemption sections of the Act – for example, relate to the deliberative process of the public body, contain commercially sensitive information, etc. – some of which contain a public interest test. Such communications would, accordingly, only be released by my Department only if they were not exempt records or if they came within the scope of an exemption where a public interest test applies and the public interest in releasing the records was considered greater than the public interest in withholding them.It is not feasible to provide details of cases where communications between Ministers on a matter which has been submitted to Government have been released by my Department. To do so would involve reviewing all FOI cases since April 1998 to check whether any inter-ministerial correspondence was among the records released and whether, if any such correspondence was released, it related to a matter which was submitted to the Government. It would then be necessary to examine all such correspondence and seek to apply retrospectively the criteria referred to in the question. This would not be a practicable exercise at this remove.
