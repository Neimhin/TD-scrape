#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	0	Every murder here does us down as a people.  I am appalled at the news this morning that a young Swiss student, having come to Ireland last weekend, has been murdered in Galway.  I hope the public responds to the call for assistance from gardaí so that the perpetrator of this latest murder is brought to justice.  It does us all down to have such unfortunate and tragic events foisted upon us.This week, 11 October is a critical date because it is the date by which arrangements must be made for approval for slots into Heathrow Airport.  We have had many conversations with and heard much waffle from Government on the consequences of the decision of Aer Lingus to move its Heathrow slots from Shannon to Belfast.  If Aer Lingus does not submit a request for Shannon-Heathrow slots by Friday, to be approved at a conference in Toronto sometime in mid-November, then the decision stands.  Words of Government are supposed to mean something and a Government is supposed to stand by what it says.  The Government retains a shareholding of 25.4% in Aer Lingus for a particular purpose that the Taoiseach identified as defending strategic interests of this country.  Those strategic interests were identified as Shannon-Heathrow, Cork-Heathrow and Dublin-Heathrow.  Can the Taoiseach explain how the strategic interest of Shannon is protected by the removal of the slot from Shannon Airport to Heathrow?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I join Deputy Kenny and, I am sure, everybody in the House in conveying deepest sympathies to the family of Manuela Riedo.  It was a callous murder of a girl who had only recently arrived in Ireland.  The Garda Síochána has launched a major murder investigation and whatever resources are necessary to apprehend the killer will be made available.The decision at the beginning of August, on which the Government has made several statements outlining its position, to withdraw the Shannon-Heathrow service from January 2008 was a commercial decision on the part of Aer Lingus and the company has reiterated that it will not change that decision.  The Government is conscious that this will create difficulties for the region and several members have met all the relevant organisations from Shannon.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	5	As the Deputy knows, the senior officials group has put forward a programme, on which we are working, to address the obvious implications for Shannon, and the Government admits there are implications.  Those implications have perhaps, at times, been broadened out in a way with which we do not agree but there are negative impacts for tourism and business people wishing to travel.  We have published the report of the senior officials group, on which we all worked, and we will endeavour to do all we can to ensure connectivity for the business people in Shannon.  The commercial decision, however, has been made and while protections are afforded to the Government by its shareholding, those protections do not extend to its forcing Aer Lingus to make a decision it believes is not in its interest.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	6	This represents the hypocrisy of Government.  The Taoiseach promised a White Paper, before the sale of Aer Lingus, to deal with the regional strategic objectives and he has been completely blindsided in this matter.  A major decision such as this, commercial or otherwise, would not have gone ahead without the tacit approval of Government.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	8	It would certainly not have gone ahead without reference to the board.  When discussions took place about the development of an all-Ireland economy I am quite sure they referred to this issue, at least in some form.The Taoiseach has not answered the question as to how the removal of the Shannon-Heathrow slots protects the strategic interests his Government specifically outlined as the reason for retaining a shareholding of 25.4%.  The Government recognises that this is not just a local whinge, nor that it is an issue confined to the mid-west.  Substantial business interests have made the point clearly that the removal of the slots will not be a major catalyst for moving out of the region.  However, it will certainly be a serious contributory factor and if anything were to happen to the transatlantic routes the Taoiseach will be faced with a very serious problem.I listened to the Minister for Transport and the Marine on the radio the other morning.  He made the point that the reason for appointing two further board members is to ensure the board of Aer Lingus takes full cognisance of Government policy.  Government policy is to protect the strategic interests of Shannon, Cork and Dublin but the Government has not done that.  Does the Taoiseach accept that the original failure of Government to appoint two members to the Aer Lingus board was negligent in the extreme and meant that the commercial decision of which he speaks was taken by Aer Lingus without the full cognisance and understanding of Government policy?

The position in law is that it is not possible for Government to intervene directly to restore the Shannon-Heathrow service and it is not open to the Government to reverse the Aer Lingus decision.  That is the position.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	16	That is the legal position.  It is the law that shareholders cannot overturn management decisions.  It is no good having a debate about what is legally and factually incorrect.Deputy Kenny has asked his questions and he does not need help from other Members.  Clearly there are negative impacts arising from a loss of connectivity.  Deputy Kenny asked how this coincides with regional assistance.  The Government made it clear that it does not.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, and I made this point on 7 August in the first few days after the decision.  The Shannon Airport Authority and the Government are actively engaging with carriers about new services to and from Shannon, including Shannon-Heathrow.  It has recently published a new hub airport incentive scheme.  Aer Lingus has confirmed that it is committed to serving the transatlantic market to and from Shannon.  That is an important decision and one we support.  Through a new link up with a US carrier JetBlue access to and from Shannon will be possible via 50 airports in the US, Mexico and the Caribbean.  New direct services to Ireland are possible under the open skies policy.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	21	Yes, from Shannon. Experience suggests that 50% of North American visitors can be expected to include a trip to the mid-west region.  Other initiatives can be taken.  Deputy Kenny is right that this has created concerns for the business and tourism communities, however we have met all the interested parties and we are acutely concerned about them.  We are trying our best, if it is possible — but I cannot guarantee certainty — to assist them.

Last weekend British Midland indicated that it does not intend to run a service from Shannon to Heathrow.  I would like the Taoiseach to tell us the name of the proposed carrier that will offer a service from Shannon to Heathrow.  As I understand it, it was either British Midland or Aer Lingus and if British Midland will not provide the service, then the only way in which a service from Shannon to Heathrow can be provided is if Aer Lingus changes its position.We have deteriorating industrial relations in Aer Lingus.  If the suspension of pilots continues, inevitably it will result in an effect on the services being provided to the travelling public.The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, announced at the weekend that he intends to appoint two additional directors to the board of Aer Lingus, and these people could and should have been appointed at a much earlier stage.  Will the Taoiseach answer these three questions?  How is it proposed to provide a service from Shannon to Heathrow?  The people in the regions of the mid-west and west were led to believe by Government spokespersons and Deputies to bear with the process and that it would be all right on the night, that something would be fixed up and some alternative service would be put in place to service the Shannon-Heathrow route.  It is time we were told the plan for services from Shannon to Heathrow and not from Shannon to anywhere else.  How seriously is the Government taking the deteriorating industrial relations situation in Aer Lingus?  Does the Taoiseach intend to use the powers open to him or the relevant Minister under section 38 of the Industrial Relations Act to ask either the Labour Relations Commission or the Labour Court to intervene in that dispute?  Can the Taoiseach explain why the Government left the board of Aer Lingus under-representated by the State at a critical period when Aer Lingus was making critical decisions that affect our strategic interests?

The interests of the business organisations relate to connectivity from London to other destinations.  It is not about getting to London as there are flights to Luton, Gatwick and Stansted.   Ryanair has announced its intention of increasing its daily flight numbers so there are seven flights per day from Shannon to London and the——

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I am answering the question.  The business groups are not arguing about Heathrow, it is the issue of connectivity.  Clearly we would prefer a direct flight from Shannon to Heathrow.  In response to the Deputy's question on how we plan to do that, we are assisting the Shannon Airport Authority in a range of discussions, but no company is involved.  I do not want to create a grey area on whether we are about to sign up, because we are not.  We will do our best to ensure we sign up somebody but it may not be possible.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	33	In terms of industrial relations, obviously the Government takes a keen interest in any major company with industrial relations difficulties.  I have urged both sides to co-operate with each other as it is in their own strategic interests, and their own jobs.  The Labour Relations Commission stated this morning that it is available to help, and whether it is necessary to bring in another party or they are best to do it themselves, they have difficulties to resolve which are best resolved in direct negotiations.On the question of whether the appointment of two board members would have made a difference, the management made its decision and it would not have made a difference.  We have made a number of good appointments to the board; we have appointed international figures in the past year or so and it is our intention to continue to appoint people who can play an important role in the future success of Aer Lingus.

That is a disgraceful abandonment of regional policy and of the people of the west and mid-west.  It is an abandonment of the country's strategic interests as they relate to Aer Lingus.In his reply to the question about the appointment of the board the Taoiseach said the decision was a management one.  What is a board of directors for, if not to supervise what management is doing, make it accountable and direct it where direction is required?  If direction was not required on this type of issue where does a board of directors give direction?  I cannot think of an issue more strategic to the interests of the country or of the company than the decision made in respect of Shannon.  The strategic nature of the decision was flagged by Deputy Cullen, then Minister for Transport, when he identified it as the kind of strategic issue which the State would use its 25% shareholding to protect.  The Government did not even appoint a sufficient number of directors to protect the State's interests and the strategic interests of the country when the company was making this decision.  The Government abandoned its responsibility for the people and the country's strategic interests in relation to Aer Lingus.  The Taoiseach has confirmed that this morning.People who are planning to book an Aer Lingus flight need to hear something more definite about the plans to settle the current industrial relations difficulties in the company than we heard this morning.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	68	The Taoiseach said recently that membership of Fianna Fáil does not disqualify persons from being appointed to State boards.  Was Mr. Joseph Burke re-appointed to the chairmanship of Dublin Port on the basis of his friendship with the Taoiseach or on the basis of merit and experience?  His company specialised in refurbishing public houses and employed 16 people in north Dublin.  The High Court was told the building company had substantial debts.  It is no fault of anyone that a business venture fails.  Was his re-appointment made on the basis of merit or because he was a friend of the Taoiseach?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	69	Mr. Burke, as a member and chairman of the board for many years, has carried out a hugely successful reform of the port company and is recognised as having done so across all political persuasions.  His appointment is made on the basis of the knowledge, expertise and experience he brings to the job.  These are the qualities a person should bring to a board.  There are many Fine Gael and Labour Party people on boards.  Most of the people I have appointed in my Department have a political orientation but are not from my party.  They are all appointed on the same criteria.  Mr. Burke's appointment was made on the basis of his knowledge and expertise.  The improvements in the industrial relations situation and productivity in the company and the changes he has made over many years stand up to scrutiny by anyone.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	70	What is the position regarding Oireachtas membership of the National Economic and Social Forum?  Have changes been made or are changes intended in line with the recent general election result?  The technical group was represented by the former Deputy Jerry Cowley, who was not re-elected to the Dáil, and the Progressive Democrats representative was the late Senator Kate Walsh.What is the method of selection?  Is it made on a ratio basis?Have the NESF vacancies been addressed since the general election result?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	71	Changes will have to be made in respect of membership of the NESF to reflect current Oireachtas representation.  As I understand it, that is happening or is about to happen.  It was agreed earlier this year that the existing 15 Oireachtas nominees to NESF would be reappointed pending the general election following which the position would be revisited.  I understand the Whip's office will shortly be in touch with the parties to seek fresh nominations for the Oireachtas strand.  It must be changed based on current Oireachtas representation.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	72	The Taoiseach said that membership of the NESF must change and that changes are pending.  Is he directly involved in deciding who will fill the vacancies?  The Taoiseach indicated that representatives from Fine Gael and the Labour Party will be on boards.  Is he willing to consider the appointment of a Sinn Féin representative to the board of NESF as reconstituted following the general election result?  There are vacancies on that board.  What methodology is used in the selection of appointees?  Does the Taoiseach take a direct hand in the selection and, if so, when does he expect to address this matter?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	73	The formula used is based on party representation in the House.  Fifteen Members of the House are appointed to the board and it is a straight mathematical division.  I have not worked out the new formula though I have included the old one in the reply.  I will examine with the Whip's office what this means for Sinn Féin.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	74	I suppose if it is based on a formula of numbers — the Taoiseach is a man of great skill with numbers and accountancy — that suggests that perhaps we would not have automatic entitlement to one of the 15 positions.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will be good enough to consider the contribution we could make.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	75	I will consider that.  To the best of my knowledge, the Technical Group was represented on the previous board, as were the Progressive Democrats and the Independents.  I will look at the formula.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	76	What changes, if any, have been made since the reformation of the Fianna Fáil Government, with the participation on this occasion of the Green Party, following the general election?  Is it the case, as the Taoiseach previously stated publicly, that those selected by him for appointment to boards are his friends?  Has there been any move towards the method proposed in March by the Green Party in its Appointments to Public Bodies Bill 2007, which called for an independent and transparent method of appointments to State boards?  I have read the programme for Government and cannot find reference therein to any change in the method by which appointments will be made to State boards.  Will the Taoiseach say if there has been any change in the method of appointment to State boards and what concession, if any, has been made in respect of the proposals contained in the Green Party's Bill introduced in the House in March of this year?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	77	The Deputy is, of course, misrepresenting my view.  I have stated many times that it is no longer easy to get people to serve on State boards, given the commitment required of them, much of the time free gratis and often for very small amounts.  Appointments are based on a person's experience, expertise, willingness to serve and commitment to the organisation in which they are involved.  Most appointments to organisations that come within the remit of my Department are nominees from the social partners.  Appointments to organisations such as the National Statistics Board and the Law Reform Commission are limited to people with particular expertise in these areas.There are no proposals or procedures in place to establish an independent system to examine or scrutinise appointments.  Ministers and Departments try, to the best of their ability, to select the right people for positions.  As I stated many times, people are no longer queueing up, as they did in the past, to participate on State boards.  The current situation is different, given the legal position, governance arrangements and the commitment required.  A limited number of people have the time or the commitment to get involved.  That is a fact of life.  We continue to manage to obtain suitable people but doing so is not near as easy as it was ten or 20 years ago.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	78	What understanding exists between the parties in government with regard to the making of appointments to State boards?  Is there an arrangement by which the smaller parties in government can make or recommend nominees for appointment to these boards?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	79	What normally happens — this has been the case for many years — is that the relevant Department makes a nomination and that is agreed by Government.  Legislation in respect of semi-State companies provides that a Minister may make a nomination which is then agreed by Government, and that is what happens.  Consideration will be given to a suitable nomination by any member of Government.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	80	Is there an understanding or agreement in terms of allocations, ratios, proportions and so on between the parties in government with regard to the making of appointments to State boards?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	81	No.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	82	There is no agreement.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	83	There is no agreement in respect of allocations, ratios and so on.  The Deputy is implying that the bigger party gets X and the smaller party gets Y, but there is no such arrangement.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	84	Will the Taoiseach confirm that neither the Green Party nor the Progressive Democrats will be consulted in advance in respect of appointments by Fianna Fáil Ministers to State boards and that they will have absolutely no say in that matter?  Will he tell the House what vacancies currently exist on State boards? Will he also list those vacancies and tell us when it is intended to fill them?  Will the Taoiseach clarify the question asked earlier, namely, why he forgot to appoint two directors to Aer Lingus?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	85	I do not wish to be unhelpful to Deputy Shatter but I am answering questions in respect of boards which come under the aegis of my Department.  The Government makes appointments to State boards as provided for in legislation.  There is consultation with Government in respect of nominations by Ministers, but ultimately the decision is made by the Minister.  Much depends on what is provided for in the relevant legislation.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	86	The Taoiseach did not respond to my question regarding what vacancies currently exist on State boards.  I think the Chief Whip is falling for the Taoiseach.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	87	He is falling off the job.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	88	We are anxious not to have a Dublin South constituency accident if by-elections are to be avoided.Will the Taoiseach list what positions are currently vacant on State boards?  In the context of the Taoiseach's expression of concern in respect of the difficulty of finding suitable people to sit on boards because of the governance provisions and the time commitment, does the Government plan to review the remuneration payable to members appointed to State boards?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I do not think there is such a proposal, but the Deputy would need to table a question to each Minister in respect of vacancies on State boards that come under the remit of their Departments.  I have outlined in my reply the position in respect of my Department.I have made the point several times that significant issues arise in respect of membership of State boards in terms of time, legal positions and governance arrangements.  Most members of State boards are also members of several audit committees and other committees.  The situation is unlike it was years ago.  Given the volume of legislation enacted in the past 15 years and the practices arising therefrom, it is no longer considered a great plus to be a member of a State board.  A limited number of people are prepared to give the time and effort required for State boards.  It is for this reason that people of all political persuasions and none are represented on State boards and that is good.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	90	Does the Taoiseach know what positions are currently vacant on State boards?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	91	Is the Deputy referring to my Department?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	92	No, on boards in general.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	93	I have no idea.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	94	The Taoiseach has no idea what vacancies exist even in his own Department.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	95	I know of the situation in my Department; that is the subject of these questions.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	96	Which positions are vacant?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	97	The board of the NESF needs to be reappointed.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	98	The Taoiseach will be aware of requests from the self-catering industry for representation on the board of Fáilte Ireland.  This industry is an important part of the sector but because its members are so dispersed throughout the country they have very little influence or voice while big decisions are being made about the future of that sector.  The industry has made its case to the Taoiseach and the line Minister for representation on the board.  Will the Taoiseach use his influence to ensure they are represented when the vacancy arises?

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	109	The Taoiseach in his reply mentioned that because of recent legislation it is becoming more difficult to find good people to serve on State boards.  Is he suggesting that the legislation should be changed.  Surely it is most important to find well qualified, good people to serve on boards and if this is being prevented by something in the legislation does he propose a change in the legislation?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	110	No.  Issues of governance and the responsibilities and obligations of directors are the same in the private as in the public sector, as the Deputy will be aware.  That means that because of the time commitment, people are not prepared to be members of boards unless they can give the time to do the work to the best of their ability and to participate in committees such as audit committees.  The duties and responsibilities of board members are demanding.  I talk to many of the key people on State boards on a regular basis and many will say that the time commitment is very high.  This is evident in boards in many areas, particularly in the key commercial semi-State sector.  Members of such boards do not want to be reappointed.  They serve their term which they regard as their duty to the State and they then move on.  It is a time commitment.Many boards hold weekly meetings.  I referred earlier to the board of Aer Lingus, some members of which are from the United States so they must travel over for meetings.  They put in a considerable effort and the same applies for members of other boards.  When membership of a sub-committee is taken into account, such people could have to devote as much as one day a week.  That is acceptable if a person is not too busy, but it is a significant commitment for an individual who is a member of one of the key commercial State boards.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	111	I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 6, inclusive, together.The code of conduct for office holders was drawn up by the Government pursuant to section 10(2) of the Standards in Public Office Act 2001, following consultation with the Standards in Public Office Commission, and published in July 2003.Deputies will be aware that changes are to be made to the ethics framework upon the enactment of the Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill 2007, which is due to be discussed before the Dáil in the current session.  I intend to carry out a review of the code, in consultation with the Standards in Public Office Commission, as soon as the amending legislation has been enacted.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	112	Is a copy of the code of conduct available in the Oireachtas Library for Members to read the rules of the code as they currently obtain?I note the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, apologised to a lady in Limerick for remarks he made.  I am sure the Taoiseach accepts that this is the proper response from the Minister who therefore must have said something akin to what was reported.  We have dealt with the motion of confidence in the Taoiseach and he has had some exposure to more forensic questioning than I have an opportunity to ask him in the House.The regulations and rules are different now.  When the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance, persons known to him made financial contributions to him.  Even now does the Taoiseach accept that, as Minister for Finance, the highest ranking Minister besides the Taoiseach, the acceptance of this kind of contribution was wrong?  Does he accept that such conduct was completely unbecoming for a serving Minister, despite whatever pressures they may experience?  I ask the Taoiseach to comment, given that we are at a remove from the glare of intense coverage that was recently applied to him?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	113	If a copy of the code of conduct is not in the Oireachtas Library, it is not a secret document.  The code applies to office holders, namely the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, Ministers and Ministers of State, the Chair and Deputy Chair of the Dáil and the Seanad.  It is a public document and I think there is a copy in the Oireachtas Library.With regard to the other question which I have been asked a number of times, this issue arose in 1995 when the new legislation was enacted and in 1997 and 2001.  I would have been required under the law to declare those issues and I would have had no difficulty doing so.  To be frank, I would not have lodged those moneys into what is the busiest bank in the main street of the capital of the country, one of the busiest branches of Allied Irish Bank, if I thought there was anything wrong in doing so.  There would be a million ways for somebody who wanted to do something wrong.  I was totally up-front in what I did because I saw nothing wrong and that is the reason I lodged the money into my bank account.I have already admitted that, with regard to the Manchester money, it may have been unwise at the time.  Even now, until this legislation is changed, the receipt of money from personal friends is not in any way wrong, illegal, unjust or improper.  I received the money on the basis of loans that I would repay and not on the basis that the money was a gift that I would never repay.  I received it at a time of difficulty, during a short period in 1994-95 and that was the basis for repayment, which is what I did.  It was not a question of receiving money from some dodgy source or somebody with whom I was not acquainted.  These are people with whom I have been associated for 30 years.  They are friends and not even political friends.  Some of them have been friends of mine since our school days.  The Deputy has asked a fair question, but I do not regard what I did as wrong.  If the Deputy asked whether I would have been better off if I did not accept the money, I would agree.  Having been dealing with the issue for seven and a half years, I agree it would have been better, but I do not regard it as something that was wrong of me to do.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	114	The Taoiseach speaks of school friends making personal loans or making moneys available.  I am not sure if he used the term, "dodgy people" or "dodgy issues".
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	115	It was not something that could in any way be considered dodgy.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	116	That is fine.  One of those people who made a contribution, Mr. O'Connor, made it on the basis that it was for the Fianna Fáil Party.  He said publicly he was not a personal friend of the Taoiseach.  How does that tie in with the other school friends who made personal contributions to the Taoiseach?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	117	This is public evidence so I have no difficulty answering the question.  I was clearly told that what Mr. O'Connor gave to another friend of mine was for me.  Twelve years later, however, he has said it was not.  I believe I know why that has happened, given the way it was paid.  However, the only thing ever said to me was that it was given for me.

The former Minister of State and Deputy, Mr. Tom Parlon, got a top job with the Construction Industry Federation following the recent general election.  As a Minister of State he had access to privileged information, not least with regard to the decentralisation programme.  He was also responsible for the Office of Public Works.I am not suggesting that Mr. Parlon did anything wrong.  However, the code of conduct states that former office holders "should be careful to avoid any real or apparent conflict of interest with the office they formerly occupied".  It is no secret that this Government has had a special relationship with the construction industry down through the years——

In the context of Mr. Parlon's example, does the Taoiseach believe that the code of conduct and the sections I have cited need to be re-examined and strengthened?  What sanctions, if any, exist for former office holders who act in breach of the code of conduct?  Is it a voluntary matter that office holders accede to the terms of the code of conduct or are there sanctions that can be brought to bear?  Will the Taoiseach outline what, if any, procedure exists?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	121	I have answered that question many times.  The code of conduct does not stand in isolation.  It is part of the wider ethics framework established by the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 and the Standards in Public Office Act 2001.  Section 10(7) of the Standards in Public Office Act binds office holders to have regard to and be guided by the code.  The code is linked directly to the powers of the two legislative measures.  The reason for the existence of the code was to lay out the terms of the legislation in straightforward, layman's English.  That is what it does.The code cannot impose any new requirements that are not already set out in the legislation; it cannot go beyond what the law provides.  It mainly attempts to provide guidance at a level of detail that would be difficult to express in legislation.  It can be, and has been, used by the Standards in Public Office Commission as a guide when a complaint is made under section 4 of the Act as to how the complaint should be investigated.  The code, therefore, is tied into the legislation and into the operation of the Standards in Public Office Commission.  Complaints can be made about breaches of the ethics Acts under section 4.With regard to the Deputy's question, I do not wish to discuss the specific details regarding a single individual but a review of the code is under way.  This issue arises regularly after every election, or at least has done after the last three elections.  What is the position of a person who has left politics and goes straight into another position outside the House?  There is reference to this in either the code or the Cabinet handbook; I cannot recall which.  It advises people to be careful.  It is a little vague in my view.  I would prefer a cut and dried requirement.Is there a preferable period for such a move?  In some countries there is no specified period while in others there is a fixed period.  In our system it is open to interpretation.  The interpretation is then used to criticise the individual, one way or another.  From the point of view of an individual who leaves the House, it would be better if the code provided that the individual cannot do X, Y or Z for three or six months.  If one goes beyond that, how is a person supposed to live?  It is unfair.  It would be better if the position was clarified.  It is unsatisfactory that an individual can be made to feel they did something wrong, which is part of this country's culture anyway.  I would prefer if the matter was cut and dried, and it stated that the person cannot do X, Y or Z for a certain period.

Indeed, the Taoiseach might send me a copy of the Cabinet handbook.  I have never seen it but it is worth examining as well.  What method will be employed in the review of the code of conduct?  The Taoiseach said a review is under way.  Who is conducting it?  Is there is a timeframe within which they will report?  Will the recommendations made be brought before the House for further scrutiny and debate and for the input of Members of the Oireachtas?  Does the Taoiseach have a role in the review?  Given his comments today, is it not important that the Taoiseach's view on the importance of certainty in this area should be placed in the code of conduct?  What steps will the Taoiseach take, following this matter being raised this morning?Earlier this morning the Taoiseach said, in response to Deputy Kenny, that the Deputy was "dead right" and that the Taoiseach wished that things were otherwise.  With regard to former Deputy Parlon's case and with no implication of wrong doing, does the Taoiseach agree that, given the portfolio Mr. Parlon held and the post he took up with such speed following the general election, he might have been better advised to wait for a reasonable period of time?  We accept that people, following their years of service in this institution, have the right to a future in employment.  However, standards must be set and the code of conduct must reflect them.  I agree with the Taoiseach that certainty should be enshrined therein.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	123	I will not give my views on individual cases.  If one does that with one and not with others, it is unfair.  The review will be carried out by the Cabinet secretariat.  Obviously, I will have a say in that and I will raise the issue I raised today.  The Cabinet secretariat will do the review in consultation with the Standards in Public Office Commission.I feel strongly about this matter because it is raised regularly.  When a Member of the House leaves the House it is unfair for them to be treated differently from leaving any other job.  The Dáil has turned over 34% of its Members in the last four or five elections.  They should not be tainted.  Several questions are raised every time about whether something is outside a fixed period.  People must live, particularly younger Members who leave the House and who have young families and must get on with another career.  If there is to be a rule, I do not think that it should be that they should be careful, look at it or take it into account.  How does one do so?  Any Member of the House, office holders or non-office holders, will have met and associated with people.  Is it the case that when they enter the House, they cannot do this or that?I have looked at what happens in other jurisdictions because the issue was raised several times during the past ten years.  Either they do nothing and the person is entitled to do whatever he or she likes the following day or they have a fixed period.  Our position is that the onus is put on a Member that they should be careful about this, that and the other and I do not think this is practical.

This is a long-standing precedent and in the case of former Deputy Parlon I allowed the questions because it was in the public domain prior to this and no impropriety was being suggested on the part of former Deputy Parlon.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	125	The net point with regard to the former Minister of State, Mr. Parlon, is that had he been a senior civil servant in the OPW who transferred to a job directly connected with his previous job of overseeing considerable volumes of capital State expenditure in construction projects, under the code of ethics he would have been required to contact either the Secretary General of the Department or the appointments board for advice on what is a conflict of interest.Did the former Minister of State advise the Government, the Secretary General to the Government or the Secretary General of his former Department that he was undertaking a position which could give rise to the perception of a conflict of interest if not an actual one?  The rule for senior civil servants, which we debated at length here, is that unless they are advised it is all right they must wait 12 months.  People on all sides of the House agreed, in the context of generous departure and retirement arrangements for senior civil servants and Members of the House, that not allowing a buffer period of time to elapse is wrong and sends out the wrong message.  One day one looks after the job in Government of spending hundreds of millions on construction contracts and the next day one changes hats and does the same job for the Construction Industry Federation.  If we have a good rule for senior civil servants, why do we not have it for people such as the former Minister of State?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	126	It is a point to be considered in the review.  It is not there at present.  In my experience, I have not seen any former civil servants being advised that they should not take up positions.  Members will note they all move on very quickly and the best of luck to them.  The answer to the question whether the former Minister of State Mr. Parlon asked me or the Government is "no".  He had no obligation to do so.  There is no procedure or rule that he had to do so.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	127	In the context of ethics and the code of conduct as it stands at present, would the Taoiseach feel comfortable if the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, met a group of people informally either in or outside Ireland to talk to them about the economy, how the State is doing and where he sees the economy going during the next 12 months and at the end of the meeting the group had a whip-around and gave him €10,000 which he took away as a personal gift?  Would the Taoiseach be comfortable if any other Minister so behaved?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	128	He would follow the ethics issue of the day.

If the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, or any Minister sat down today with a group of people, gave them a briefing on the economy for more than an hour and they had a whip-around — not for his political campaigning or purposes, not a political donation, but because they decided he was a nice guy and needed a few bob — and gave him €10,000, would the Taoiseach be comfortable with this behaviour?  Would he expect a Minister in his Government to retain those funds for his or her own purposes?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	130	A Minister today must abide by the code and legislation and obviously one cannot do that.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	134	I accept that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, Deputy O'Rourke and anyone else would now follow the code of conduct and the legislation.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	135	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 11, inclusive, together.I received the final report by the Commission of Investigation into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974 from the sole member, Mr. Patrick MacEntee, SC QC, on 12 March last.  Under the Commissions of Investigation Act, I was obliged to consider certain legal issues prior to publication.  As such, I sought advice from the Attorney General, who considered these issues and advised that the report should be published in full.  Accordingly, I brought the report to the Cabinet and published it on 4 April.  The Government has considered the findings of the report carefully.Although they relate to a difficult period in the past, Mr. MacEntee's findings with regard to shortcomings and omissions are a matter of serious concern.  It should also be acknowledged that he found considerable improvements in administrative practice since that time.  A full review has now been carried out of all systems and procedures in the relevant Departments and agencies to ensure that the failures found by Mr. MacEntee do not occur in the future.In chapter 11 of his report, Mr. MacEntee stated that for legal reasons he was unable to report on one significant aspect of his terms of reference specifically relating to why the Garda Síochána did not follow up on a lead they had regarding a man who stayed in the Four Courts Hotel.  Following dissolution of the commission of inquiry, the relevant confidential information remained subject to legal privilege.  Its archive was transferred to my Department, where it is in secure storage.Based on the legal advice of the Attorney General on this point, the Government decided to seek voluntary withdrawal of claims of privilege from those agencies, both here and in Britain, which provided the confidential material to the commission so that it could be shared with the relevant authorities in this State.  Agreement has now been obtained from all those agencies and my Department has forwarded this documentation to the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Garda Síochána for appropriate consideration.Deputies are aware that I and my officials have consistently raised these issues with the British authorities, including at Prime Minister level, and will continue to do so.  I recognise that victims' issues and dealing with the past are difficult, but it is important that we find a way to resolve this and allow people move on with their lives.The total amount spent by the commission of investigation is €2,632,702.  This amount breaks down as follows: €1,756,533 on legal costs; €351,410 on support staff; and €524,759 on set-up and administrative costs of the offices of the commission.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	136	Is the Taoiseach aware of how unhappy the Justice for the Forgotten group is at the fact there was little discussion or substantive investigation into what is contained in the report with reference to the man in the Four Courts Hotel?  Is he aware that any evidence available to the State was made available in this regard?  Will the Taoiseach comment on whether it is a State security matter?The subcommittee which dealt with the Barron report last November recommended an Oireachtas debate should take place on collusion referred to in the report.  Obviously, it would have been preferable if that debate had taken place before the election but that did not happen for whatever reason.  Is that a matter to which the Taoiseach will give consideration in the future?In regard to his comments about continual interaction with the British authorities, a matter we have raised on many occasions, is the Taoiseach happy that they have supplied all the information they can in respect of this matter?  Has he spoken to the Prime Minister, Mr. Brown, since his appointment as British Prime Minister, on the issue of whether there are outstanding documents or material that could be provided by the British authorities in order to bring this matter to a final conclusion?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	137	In relation to the man who stayed in the Four Courts Hotel, I have, as outlined in my reply, forwarded the relevant material to the appropriate authorities for their consideration.  Regarding Justice for the Forgotten, there have been comprehensive examinations and all the work regarding Mr. Justice Hamilton, Mr. Justice Barron's report, the commission of investigation and the examinations here in the House has been completed to the best of everybody's ability.It was only recently that I saw that information regarding the issue I mentioned in the reply.  I will give my own political view on it; I do not want to get into the legal realms.  I do not think we should look at it with enormous interest.  In my estimation, it is not very substantive.  That is purely my political view; it is for others to offer a legal view.  Obviously, I cannot say what it is — given what it is — but I had not seen it in previous work when it was finished.  I have just seen it in recent times but it is no more substantive than many other things I have seen in these reports.  I do not know whether it is of any relevance at all, but that is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Politically, I do not think it is of huge interest because we are talking about a period 34 years ago.  If there are any leads on these issues, they are not there.If the Deputy asked if I believe that all the information that is available in the British establishment has been given to us, I certainly would not answer "yes" to that question.  If the Deputy asked whether we have we all the information we are going to get from the British authorities, I would answer "yes" to that question.  After the considerable efforts of Mr. Justice Hamilton, Mr. Justice Barron and Mr. MacEntee, we are unlikely to see any further information.  With the help of numerous Secretaries of State they did ultimately change their position and gave far more information than they were giving in the first place.  They moved substantially from their position.  Any other information is probably in the hands of MI5 or MI6 and I do not see how we will get it.

The Taoiseach has not responded to the earlier question from Deputy Kenny.  Will he be specific on when that debate will be accommodated?  I have raised this matter over the summer recess and since then with the Chief Whip, who can confirm that is the case.  I believe the matter needs to be accommodated with some urgency.Having read the MacEntee report, does the Taoiseach hold the view that the Government and Garda response at the time raises very serious questions?  I have heard him articulate his concerns on this whole area and I am of the view that gross incompetence is not enough to explain what happened, given the seriousness of the failure to properly investigate and the disappearance and destruction of records pertaining to the tragic events of 17 May 1974.  What action does the Taoiseach propose to take in this regard, given that I have heard him articulate on a number of occasions his particular concern in relation to that whole area of the investigation or, more correctly, the failure to properly investigate all that pertained to that issue?Following the appointment of the new British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, has the Taoiseach raised with him the failure of the British Government to properly co-operate with the series of inquiries by Mr. Justice Hamilton, Mr. Justice Barron and Mr. MacEntee?  Has the Taoiseach acquainted him with the extent of the failure of the British authorities to properly co-operate with a commission appointed by this Parliament and its failure to co-operate throughout which has not only impeded but stunted the potential of those commissions of inquiry toproperly get to the full detail that must be available?Has the Taoiseach had the opportunity to raise with Mr. Brown the other pressing issues under the umbrella of collusion, for example, the murder of Pat Finucane, which the Dáil has unanimously agreed warrants a full inquiry?Having met the family of the late councillor Eddie Fullerton of Buncrana and Donegal councils, has he any intent to initiate a full public inquiry with cross-jurisdictional application into that particular murder?

The Justice for the Forgotten group is particularly anxious that this debate should take place.  What are the plans in that regard?Last week, the Garda Commissioner announced that he was establishing a cold case type arrangement within the Garda to re-open and examine approximately 200 unsolved murders.  Will the Dublin-Monaghan bombings come within the remit of that cold case arrangement and be subject to re-examination by the Garda on that basis?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	141	Obviously, issues around the Finucane and other cases are continually raised with the British Government.  At a meeting just before the summer I raised these issues with the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown.There is no substantive discussion on collusion in the MacEntee report.  It was the clear view of the Oireachtas committee that the issue of collusion could only be properly addressed by an appropriate inquiry in the UK.  As regards a Dáil debate, I have always had serious concerns about a number of atrocities that happened in the State during the 1970s, including the Dublin-Monaghan bombings.  That is why I asked the late Mr. Justice Hamilton in the first place and then Mr. Justice Barron to look at all of these incidents.  As the House will be aware, the Oireachtas joint committee report which dealt with these issues made some stark findings and painted a very disturbing picture.  As I said when I published the MacEntee report, I fully support the call for a debate in the Dáil and Seanad and I am happy to do that whenever the House agrees to do it.In regard to the other issues raised by Deputy Ó Caoláin, in the context of all the reports including the MacEntee report about that period, as I said in my reply, findings in regard to shortcomings and omissions are a matter of serious concern.  The situation has improved.  We have asked the Garda to ensure these kinds of issues never happen again, where whole files and records went missing.  Deputy Ó Caoláin has alluded to what I said many times before.  I cannot and never will understand how a file on something like the Dublin-Monaghan bombings which happened in May 1974 was closed in August 1974.  All I can do is ensure that the procedures in place now, and for some years, will never allow for the lack of records and recording of procedures to happen again and that any of the recommendations made by the late Mr. Justice Hamilton, Mr. Justice Barron or Mr. MacEntee are implemented.  They throw considerable light on the circumstances of the time and are helpful to the families.  They do not solve everything as we know, regrettably.  I believe we have done a good service in the last number of years in all these reports which have really now come to a conclusion.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	143	I convey my sincere condolences and those of my Fianna Fáil colleagues to Seán Keegan's wife Mary and his children, Marie, Nan, Nuala, Tom and Gearóid on the sad loss of our former colleague and a loyal servant of the people of Westmeath.  Seán was a stalwart of our party, on the county council, in the Seanad and here in the Dáil.  He was a committed republican and a politician who took great pride in representing the people of Westmeath here in our National Parliament.As many of his friends in this House will know, Seán came from a patriotic family with a strong background in public service.  Seán's father had been active in the War of Independence and Seán himself developed a strong association with many of the founders of the Fianna Fáil party, who had a prominent role in the quest for national self-determination.  In his political life Seán was first elected to Westmeath County Council in 1955 at a time when Eamon de Valera still led Fianna Fáil.  In 1965, Seán contested his first general election at the behest of Seán Lemass.  Seán and I both entered the Dáil on the same day in 1977.  By that stage, Seán was however a veteran of our parliamentary party having been elected to the Seanad in a by-election in 1970.I remember Seán in this period as a person who was unfailingly courteous and helpful to new Members of the Oireachtas.  He was always anxious to speak at our parliamentary party meetings.  He always had a contribution to make about issues and particularly issues to do with rural Ireland and the midlands.  Throughout our shared time in Leinster House, Seán was a dedicated, hardworking and patriotic Deputy.  He viewed it as a privilege to represent the people of his constituency of Longford-Westmeath.  As a Deputy, he gave tangible effect to his patriotism by working diligently to improve the quality of life in his community and more importantly for less well off people in his community.  He was very honoured to say that he strongly supported them.In his time, Seán gave committed service to Fianna Fáil, which we remember today on this side of the House, to people of all persuasions in Westmeath and to the country.  He will be sadly missed by his wife Mary, his five children, his wider family and friends.  I met Seán during the course of the general election campaign this year.  Even though his health was declining he was very anxious to be out and about in support of the democratic process.  From this side of the House we will remember him as a loyal and faithful servant who served in both Houses of the Oireachtas, who served at local government level, and who was a diligent and active person about politics throughout the country but particularly in his native constituency.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	144	I join the Taoiseach in extending the commiserations of the Fine Gael Party to all Seán Keegan's Fianna Fáil colleagues, and particularly to his wife Mary and family members who are here.  Many people in the current Dáil will not remember Seán Keegan.  When we look back through the Dáil records and see the names of those who served in this House from whatever part of the country or whatever party, sometimes the names do not jump out at us because of the service of years gone by.  From this side of the House someone who passes away and who was a staunch member of the Fine Gael Party would be referred to as a true blue, which has connotations from different years.  It could always be said of the late Seán Keegan that he was a true Fianna Fáil supporter, absolutely rigid in his belief about Fianna Fáil's core values in what it stood for.  He was never afraid to express those views and if one got him primed up at the right time one would get a demonstration of the defence of Fianna Fáil in all circumstances.I recall Seán Keegan, both as a Senator and as a Deputy.  As in all Dáileanna there are particular characters who stand out.  I recall, as I am sure his wife, Mary, will recall, the white suit in which he occasionally left Kilbeggan when coming to the Dáil.  He attended a meeting of the joint committee on secondary legislation in Brussels, on which I was also a young recruit.  The topic under discussion was the 50-mile limit and fishing rights, about which the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, will know.  The senior official of the Commission was giving a presentation on a fishing problem which lasted for approximately two and a half hours, in the course of which several instalments of tea and strong coffee were brought in.  The director presenting the case for fishing rights was dunking his teabag in his cup for ten minutes.  In absolute exasperation the late Seán Keegan said: "Look, as far as I can see the only fishing you've ever done is in that cup in front of you".  He said to me when leaving that room: "When we're away from Ireland, we have to stick together".  Irrespective of the depth of feeling he had for his party he still recognised what needed to be done for his country.Those who have given the length of service that Seán Keegan gave from 1955 until 1982 will recognise it is a long period of public service.  I recall in 1977, as Deputy O'Rourke will, that it was Deputy Seán Keegan's surplus that elected former Deputy Albert Reynolds to the House in the first instance and all that flowed from that.  I commiserate with Mary Keegan and her children, Gearóid, Tom, Nan, Marie and Nuala and with the Fianna Fáil Party on losing a stalwart son.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.

For someone to have served through four decades as a public representative from the time of his election to Westmeath County Council in 1955 to his time in Dáil Éireann in the 1980s is a great personal achievement.  It is a great tribute to Seán Keegan to have enjoyed the support of the people of Longford-Westmeath over time.I did not know Seán Keegan, but I knew of him.  In the early part of my life as a trade union official I remember attending meetings in places like Burlington Klopman in Longford, with drainage workers in Mullingar and Ericsson in Athlone, and hearing people talk of Seán Keegan and what he had done to help them.  No greater tribute can be paid to a public representative than to be spoken of in such high terms by the people he or she represents.  Although I did not know him, Seán Keegan was always spoken of very highly by the people he represented.  I extend the sympathy of the Labour Party to Mary Keegan and her family on their personal loss.  I also extend our sympathy to Fianna Fáil on its political loss.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.

While I did not know Seán Keegan, from those remaining in the House who served with him I know he was very highly regarded and epitomised the very best qualities of public service and dedication to his country and his constituents.  He was a committed local politician who served the people of Westmeath diligently throughout his long career in local and national politics.  He served on Westmeath County Council, in Seánad Éireann and in this House following the 1977 election.  When he left the House in 1982, he remained active in local politics.   I would like to extend the Green Party's sympathies to Mary Keegan, her family, the Fianna Fáil Party and Seán's wide circle of friends and supporters.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.

On behalf of Sinn Féin Deputies and our Seánad representative, I also extend our sympathy to the Fianna Fáil Party on its loss of a long-serving colleague who clearly invested a considerable part of his life in the service of the party's development.  I did not have the pleasure of knowing the late Seán Keegan but I accept all the fine references to his time of service.  I extend our comhbhrón ó chroí don a clann uilig.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	148	I extend my sympathy on the very sad death of their dear Seán to Mary Keegan, her family and his extended family.  He contested the 1965 general election and he entered the Dáil in 1977.  He was a committed member of Westmeath County Council for a long number of years and he was a committed representative of the constituency, Longford-Westmeath, between 1977 and 1982.  I was elected to Westmeath County Council and I remember Seán best as the whip of our party.  He gave many wise advices to me and other new members who were straining at the leash because we wanted to get moving, we wanted to condemn everything and we wanted to be up and at it.  His wise advice was often heeded on reflection as being exactly what it was.  He continued long after he had retired from public life to be very active in the administration of our party at comhairle Dáil ceantair level.  His offered wise advice and was able to summarise issues that often cause great tension within political parties at local level.  He would always utter a remark that would lead a person away from conflict and lead to more reflective thinking about an issue.His greatest legacy is his wonderful family.  His wonderful wife, Mary, throughout his public and private life, was a source of huge comfort to him.  She is a woman of great dignity and bearing who carried many burdens but never spoke about them, particularly when Seán fell into ill-health, which he bravely bore.  She is a stalwart and she was such a help to him.  All the members of their family distinguished themselves in the calling they followed with strong personal character.  While it is correct to remember those who served in public life who have passed away, they are often remembered on a personal basis.  Seán and Mary Keegan's greatest achievement is the wonderful family they have and what they, in turn, have committed to the often public roles they perform.  Many of them remain strong within the Fianna Fáil organisation locally.  I offer my very sincere sympathy to the Keegan family and I hope these expressions of sympathy will be a source of comfort to them.
#PeterKellyFF	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-party	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-dob	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	149	I wish to express my sympathy to the late Seán Keegan's wife, Mary; his sons, Tom and Gearóid; his daughters, Marie, Nan and Nuala; his sisters, Dill, Bridie, Ita and Sisters Gemma and Teresa; his brother, Fr. Tom in Australia; his in-laws; and to all his other relatives and friends.  May he rest in peace.I would like to pay tribute to Seán Keegan, a fellow Fianna Fáil Deputy for Longford-Westmeath.  Seán was a committed republican and representative of the constituency in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  His father was very active in the War of Independence and Seán was extremely proud of his republican heritage.  He too believed passionately in Irish unity but believed it should be achieved  by peaceful means.  He was an active and dedicated local politician who served his constituents diligently and effectively.  No matter was too small or trivial for him and the numbers who attended his clinics were legendary because he was always available.  He was a hard working, honest, decent man.He served on Westmeath County Council for more than five decades, in the Seánad for seven years and in the Dáil for a further five years.  Whether as a councillor, Senator or Deputy or as president of the Westmeath comhairle Dáil ceantair, he was ever present at Fianna Fáil functions.  He was also a valued member of the Midland Health Board where his farming expertise was a major asset.  Seán was a sincere, loyal man who served his community to the highest standards.  He dedicated his life not only to public service but to his family.His wife, Mary, and his children are immensely proud of him and his achievements.  I offer them my condolences on their loss and I also offer my condolences to the people of Kilbeggan and Westmeath who have lost a true friend and advocate.  I always found him to be a very courteous, friendly man.  It was always a pleasure to meet Seán and his wife, Mary.  I have happy memories of him and I thank him and his family.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	150	I wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy on the death of the former Deputy and Senator, Seán Keegan, who represented my constituency.  I sincerely extend my condolences to his wife, Mary; his children, Gearóid, Tom, Nan, Marie and Nuala; his sisters; his brother, Father Tom, who lives in Australia; and the Fianna Fáil Party.  Seán was a representative of Longford-Westmeath during a political career that began in 1955.  He was elected chairman of Westmeath County Council in 1974-75; to the Seánad following a by-election in 1970; and to this House in 1977 when Fianna Fáil had a landslide victory.  It was not as good in terms of seat numbers as our result in the recent general election but, unfortunately, we did not get into government afterwards.However, I knew Seán well as a colleague on the old Midland Health Board.  I recall many incidents at board meetings.  Seán was also a lifelong member of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association.  One of the proposals he made to the health board when anti-social behaviour increased and law and order began to break down in a number midland towns was that all discos should close at midnight.  This did not go down well with many board members.  On another occasion a few years ago, I took a stance on the dismantling of health services in the midlands.  I was the only member ever expelled from a health board but when Seán left the room afterwards, he said to me that he admired me for the principled stance I had taken.  That will go with me to my grave because he was a man of principle.  He was a great advocate of law and order and his greatest passion, other than politics, was farming and country life.  He operated a successful farming business in Kilbeggan.  His family connections extend into County Longford, where his daughter, Nan, lives on the outskirts of Longford town.Sean was an extremely hard working representative for Longford-Westmeath.  Throughout his political life and beyond, he was always willing to help his constituents and neighbours and he had a long and distinguished association with many organisations throughout Westmeath.  He was a principled politician and that is how I will chiefly remember him.  He will be sadly missed by all who knew him within the community, which is lessened by his passing.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	178	It is.

We are the only country that will hold a referendum on the issue.  There are some controversial matters, not least the charter of fundamental rights and the proposal to opt out with regard to cross-border co-operation on crime.  Will the Taoiseach provide for a debate in this House prior to attending the summit?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	184	We are trying to deal with it.  Perhaps we will have a meeting on the issue before the December Council meeting.With regard to the opt-out proposal, I saw some references this morning that are not correct.  The current position is that justice and home affairs issues are dealt with through unanimity.  We are moving to a position of qualified majority voting, QMV.  Most issues will create no difficulty for us and we will have a part in those discussions.  Certain aspects are fundamental to our legal system, with some issues requiring the right to protect our national interest.Areas such as police co-operation and many other areas are not affected by this.  We do not intend to opt out on police co-operation and we will draft a declaration which will be part of the agreement, stating our position very clearly.  There is a misunderstanding of the British position, but I am not here to speak about that.  Our position will be set out in a clear declaration and there will be only limited areas on QMV.  It is not a broad position.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	185	Could we use the emergency brake for those?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	186	I negotiated the emergency brake and I know precisely what it does and does not do.  The emergency brake would not cover those issues.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	188	Every second issue would require the use of the emergency brake and that was not its intention.  On qualified majority voting, with the British having put forward their position — which the Deputy knows is different from that in 2004 — we have to protect our position.  In a limited number of areas where QMV would operate and which would be against the Irish interest, we would have to opt out.  In the vast majority of cases I do not see any requirement to opt out.

#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	192	Apart from the issues of QMV, the advantage of having a Dáil debate would be to address further fundamental issues of accountability.  For example, the House would benefit from knowing the role of the Dáil and Seanad in light of the treaty in terms of accountability and the deficit which exists, for example, on common foreign and security policy.The Taoiseach referenced the European affairs committee.  In the previous Dáil, the chair of the European affairs committee was in a different position from the chair of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs with regard to the sharing of information.  I also suggest there is a continuing debate in the European Parliament on accountability.There is also the matter of international foreign policy where the European Union adopts a common position.  There are no mechanisms of initiation, scrutiny or reporting back in that regard.  The advantage of a debate is to at least be able to hear such proposals as might emerge in the context of the new treaty.  It is deeply damaging to the European debate and the preparations for it.  There is what is referred to as a "double deficit" in the current foreign security policy, which is a treble deficit if we consider the failure of our committee structure here to be able to adequately access decisions which are, after all, being taken.The Taoiseach is not misleading the House when he is speaking about governments.  The decisions have been taken by the executive in an intergovernmental context without adequate accountability back to participating parliaments.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	193	Does the Taoiseach not agree that this is a classical democratic deficit in the way European matters are dealt with in that he will proceed to final discussions on this and essentially sign us up to opting out in the justice and security areas without a detailed debate in this House or a statement from the Government setting out clearly the reason for the approach being taken?  Does he also agree that in the interest of future debate on this treaty, there should be substantial transparency with regard to why this State enters into arrangements subject to a referendum taking place?Does he agree the absence of such debate means that not only is there a democratic deficit in that no Member will in advance of the next summit contribute to the discussion, but the public will not be informed on the basis upon which the Government is approaching what is a very important issue?The Taoiseach should consider that this matter should be urgently debated in this House, if not tomorrow then next week.  He should also acknowledge the huge importance of this country co-operating with all other European Union states in the fight against the drug barons operating across the length and breadth of the EU, who are using this State as an entry point for importing drugs into the rest of Europe.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	194	The reason this side of the House is so anxious to have statements or a debate on this issue is that there is much confusion about the fundamental difference between the constitutional treaty we were happy to sign up to and supported, and the reform treaty now being proposed.  This particularly relates to requiring Ireland to be able to opt out.There is also a contradiction in the Taoiseach's statement today as he indicated he does not wish to use the emergency brake procedure, which he created in many ways, on a daily basis.  At the same time he has stated that circumstances will be rare in which we may wish to opt out.  There is confusion and a great deal of concern.There is much concern in Brussels, where our MEPs work on a weekly basis, about the approach Ireland is taking here as it is a departure from the approach adopted in the past, which has been pro-European Union.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	195	I have been in touch with people involved in this in other countries and there is a total understanding of the Irish position so it is not correct that there is great concern.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	198	The Deputy, having asked a question, does not listen to the answer.  That is a bad habit.  The difference is that the British changed their position from the 2004 position.  Decisions made in the Justice and Home Affairs Council were for many years based on unanimity.  Differences exist not only in our common law systems but also in the way we look at legal positions and how such positions are adopted.  With the British opting out, we were obliged to accept that we might find ourselves in an extremely weak position in particular areas where QMV would operate.  It should not affect many areas but we must recognise that legal issues might arise that could be particularly unique or that could represent a serious change for our system.Reference was made to 25 out of the 27 member states.  The position in this regard is that 25 of the 27 member states have different legal systems.All we are doing is that in certain areas where the Council would otherwise arrive at a decision on the basis of unanimity, we will opt out under QMV.  There are not many areas where that——

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	200	The suggestion regarding the European prosecutor is totally at variance with our legal system.  That is one example but there are others.  As Deputy Jim O'Keeffe is well aware, that would affect our common travel position.  As already stated, however, not many areas will be affected.  We must have that protection in place because otherwise the country would be placed at a disadvantage in a serious way regarding the limited cases to which I refer.  There is total understanding in that regard.  If the position were otherwise, people would be far more puzzled.We have decided to stand firmly with others countries in respect of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  I will arrange a briefing for any relevant Opposition spokespersons.  We gave careful consideration to this matter and spoke to many legal people in respect of it, including the Attorney General and a great range of——

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	202	The Government has a clear view on this issue.  We are of the opinion that the best course of action is to make a declaration.  We will prepare the latter in the coming days and I will outline its contents next week when our deliberations on this matter are complete.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	203	I do not think the Taoiseach answered my question.  I was merely seeking a debate on the matter and not just a briefing of the spokespersons or an outlining of the contents of the declaration.  There is no Joint Committee on European Affairs in place and, as such, Oireachtas scrutiny is absent.  The Executive is to travel to Brussels at the end of next week where it will either sign up or not sign up to the new reform treaty.  We are not sure of what will be the exact details and we will not have an opportunity to debate the declaration that will be drafted for the Taoiseach in the coming days.  Why not engage in a full debate on the issue in the House next week?  Ireland is the only country that will be holding a referendum on the new European reform treaty and it would be foolish for the Government to sign up to it without first hearing the views of Members.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	204	I agree with the previous speaker.  Will the Taoiseach not acknowledge that it is completely unsatisfactory that a private briefing, away from the public gaze, will be provided by a civil servant to a few select Members?  Does he agree that in any democratic society with a parliamentary system such as that which obtains here, it is only appropriate that matters of this nature be dealt with and debated openly in Parliament?  Does he further agree that adopting such a process would make an important contribution in the context of the future public debate that will take place on asking the people to approve the treaty by way of referendum?  Is he of the view that it is damaging to deal with matters of this significance behind closed doors?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	205	I must look to the Leader of the Opposition in this regard.  I replied to a question from a member of his party.  If Deputy Kenny makes a request to me, I will consider it.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	206	The Taoiseach can take it that I will make a request for a formal debate, which could probably be held on Tuesday next.  There seems to be a particular attitude or perception emanating from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The former Minister, Mr. McDowell, had a particular view of the common law versus the civil law and for that reason he was stringently opposed to opting in and wanted to opt out.  This perception appears again to be emanating from the Department, whereas the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, is clearly of the opinion, shared by the Department of Foreign Affairs, that Ireland should opt in.As the Taoiseach is aware, the emergency brake, which operates in a small number of cases, must be referred to the Council, where consensus is required.  We will seek a formal debate, in respect of which the Whips may agree the details.  I take it the Government will not sign off completely on anything until Members on all sides have had the opportunity to express their opinions and views on what is an important issue for the people.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	207	As stated at the outset, the Government made a decision to prepare a declaration and it will do so.  That declaration is consistent with our position throughout but it takes account of the changed circumstances, particularly in the context of what the UK Government decided at the June European Council meeting.  There is no divergence of opinion among the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Foreign Affairs, the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, or anyone else.  We engaged in a comprehensive examination of what is the right thing to do regarding the reform treaty in order to ensure we will not find ourselves in a position where, in the limited circumstances where it arises, decisions that would not be in the interests of this country or its legal system would be made on the basis of unanimity.  We are also of the view that, on foot of the decision made by Britain, there should be an alternative available.  That is the only change.We decided not to follow what others are doing in respect of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the context of opting out.  We are remaining completely in as regards the charter.This matter has been considered at great length by many people.  A debate on it will be required at the forthcoming Council and I have no difficulty with this because I want the support of the House on it as we move towards a referendum.

I have discovered, however, that a request for specific funding for the project in question is on the Minister's desk awaiting a decision.  The Ceann Comhairle will not be surprised if I impose upon his courtesy tomorrow and seek to raise the matter again.The second issue to which I wish to refer relates to the designated land (housing development) Bill.  I seem to have obtained the notion from some quarter that this legislation might be published before Christmas.  It is promised for 2008.  Will the Taoiseach provide some indication as to its progress and whether its publication date has been brought forward?

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	220	On Thursday last I tried to establish which Minister is responsible for legislation relating to the sea fisheries sector and received an ambiguous reply from the Tánaiste.  Last week a ministerial order regarding safety on fishing boats was issued by the Minister for Transport and the Marine.  On the section of the Order Paper relating to upcoming legislation, the only Bill relating to fisheries is listed in connection with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  We have a Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is taking control of coastal management.  There is a great amount of confusion within the fishing industry as regards which Department has responsibility for the sea fisheries sector.The answer I got last week from the Tánaiste was that it is the responsibility of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, which would seem to be the case if one also looks at its website.  However, could we receive some clarity on this point so that, for a start, the Opposition spokespersons know for which areas they have responsibility but, more important, we know which Ministers are responsible for upcoming legislation?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	221	There are different aspects to this brief.  In response to Deputy Coveney's question, the Minister responsible for sea fisheries is the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  However, there are other aspects which are dealt with by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, while the issue of safety is dealt with by the Department of Transport and the Marine.

That would be borne out by the evidence on the list for upcoming legislation where there is only one piece of sea fisheries legislation, which comes under the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  It would be helpful if we could receive some clarity in writing on it.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	224	I move: "That Second Stage be taken now."
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	225	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."Charitable organisations impact on the lives of almost everyone in Irish society.  So many people work in charitable organisations, fund raise for charitable organisations, donate to charitable causes or are beneficiaries of charitable organisations.  The value of charitable organisations and charitable work cannot be emphasised enough, be it in Ireland or abroad.  People in Ireland are very favourably disposed to charitable organisations and are renowned as being among the most generous supporters of charitable causes to be found anywhere in the world.Yet most people in Ireland are probably not aware that the charities sector in Ireland is largely unregulated.  No charities legislation has been enacted in over 30 years.  There is no body with the specific purpose of supervising the sector or the statutory powers to maintain a register of charitable organisations.  As a consequence, there has been a dearth of reliable information on the number of active charitable organisations, what their financial worth is or how they spend their funds.Much examination of and research into the charities sector and the need for regulatory reform has been undertaken over the past 20 years.  This includes the Costello and Burton reports in 1990 and 1996, respectively; the 2002 Law Society report; and the Arthur Cox-led review in 2002.All this time, the charities sector, as a traditionally largely cash based, voluntary enterprise, has been left vulnerable to potential abuse by unscrupulous individuals and organisations.  It is a testament to the commitment and integrity of charitable trustees that incidents of such abuse have been few and far between over the years.  Nonetheless, it could be argued that it might take only one major such scandal to undermine public confidence.  This would result in a fall off in donations to charities generally, which, ultimately, would affect those who benefit from the superb work these organisations carry out.  For this reason, quality regulation of the sector will be of huge benefit both to the charitable organisations and to the donating public.In this context, the Government is committed to protecting both charitable organisations and the public interest by reforming the law to ensure accountability and to protect against abuse of charitable status and fraud through the Bill we have before us here today. The Bill, together with the Charities Acts of 1961 and 1973 and the Street and House to House Collections Act 1962, as amended, will provide for a composite regulatory framework for charitable organisations.  There will be a combination of new legislative provisions and retention of existing charities legislation, with updating, where appropriate.Key aspects of the Bill will provide for a definition of "charitable purpose" for the first time in primary legislation; a new regulatory authority to secure compliance by charities with their legal obligations and also to encourage better administration of charities; a register of charities in which all charities operating in the State must register; annual activity reports by charities to the new authority; updating the law relating to fundraising, particularly in respect of collections by way of direct debits and similar non-cash methods; a charity appeals tribunal; dissolution of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland upon establishment of the new authority and the transfer at that stage of its functions to the authority; transfer to the authority of all jurisdictions previously vested in the Attorney General by statute or common law in respect of charities; administrative co-operation by the authority with statutory bodies on relevant regulatory and law enforcement matters, both inside and outside the State; consultative panels to assist the authority in its work and to ensure effective consultation with stakeholders; and a review of the operation of the Bill after fiveyears.Ba mhaith liom aghaidh a thabhairt ar chodanna éagsúla an Bhille agus mionchuntas níos mó a thabhairt ar na cuspóirí atá i gceist le gach ceann acu sin.  Ar ndóigh, níl i gceist go dtabharfaí mion-chur síos ar an méid atá i ngach uile alt.  Tugann an meabhrán míniúcháin, mar a foilsíodh leis an mBille, eolas níos mine faoi na forálacha sin.  Beidh deis ag Comhaltaí, ar ndóigh, mionscrúdú a dhéanamh ar na forálacha deréir mar a théann an Bille chun cinn sa Teachseo.The Bill is divided into seven parts, comprising 85 sections and two Schedules.  As well as fairly standard provisions such as commencement, regulations, offences, repeals, etc., Part 1 of the Bill contains a number of key new provisions.  In section 2 on interpretation, certain words and terms used in the Bill are defined.  Of particular interest is the definition of a "charitable organisation" and, conversely, "excluded bodies" for the purposes of the Bill.  The latter includes political parties, chambers of commerce, trades unions or employers' representative organisations and terrorist or other unlawful organisations.  Sporting bodies, as defined under the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, for which a separate tax exemption regime exists, will also be "excluded bodies". This will ensure congruence with the approach adopted by the Revenue Commissioners in determining what constitutes a charity for the purpose of granting charitable tax exemption.To be a "charitable organisation", a body must be engaged exclusively in "charitable purposes".  Section 3 — Charitable Purpose —  defines "charitable purposes" for the first time in primary Irish legislation.  A purpose is regarded as charitable if its aim is the prevention or relief of poverty or economic hardship, the advancement of education, the advancement of religion or anyother "purpose that is of benefit to the community".The last category, "purpose that is of benefit to the community", is the broadest category.  Like the other three categories, it is founded on the original 17th century "Pemsel" categories, although the definition proposed in the Bill reflects contemporary interpretations.  There is a particular focus on community welfare and development, volunteerism and civic responsibility, promotion of health, the advancement of conflict resolution or reconciliation and the promotion of religious or racial harmony.  Other activities considered to be of benefit to the community include the protection of the natural environment; the prevention or relief of suffering of animals; the advancement of the arts, culture, heritage and sciences; and the integration into society of those who are disadvantaged.These purposes broadly reflect the categories used by the Revenue Commissioners in determining eligibility for certain tax exemptions and reliefs for charitable organisations.  It should be noted, however, that in section 7, determinations of eligibility for certain tax exemption on funds applied for charitable purposes by the Revenue Commissioners are expressly decoupled from determination of charitable status by the new Charities Regulatory Authority.  Such determinations will remain exclusively the function of the Revenue Commissioners.  It should also be noted that a purpose will only be defined as charitable if it confers a benefit to the public or a section thereof, although a gift for the purpose of the advancement of religion will automatically be considered of public benefit.Part 2 provides for the establishment of a new independent body, the Charities Regulatory Authority.  It outlines the functions of the authority and contains standard provisions relating to the staffing, finance and accountability of the body that are generally consistent with those normally applied to similar statutory bodies.  The authority will, in keeping with good regulatory practice, be in a position to engage with the sector on matters of importance.  It will also be empowered to co-operate with other regulatory and law enforcement agencies, both within and outside the jurisdiction.  The provisions of Schedule 1, which I will summarise later, will also apply to the authority.The key functions of the authority are listed in section 13.  The authority, although with strong regulatory and enforcement powers, will also have a supportive and advisory role for charitable organisations.  The latter role will be particularly important to smaller charitable organisations which constitute the majority of such organisations.The regulatory and enforcement role of the authority is aimed at increasing public confidence in the charities sector.  The authority will promote compliance by charitable organisations with their legal obligations and will be empowered to carry out investigations where breaches of the legislation are suspected.Provision is made for non-binding administrative co-operation on regulatory matters with other regulatory bodies and foreign statutory bodies on law enforcement.  The authority will also provide guidance to charitable organisations, encourage better administration of charitable trusts and will be able to engage with the sector through consultative panels.A major provision in section 13 is the authority's requirement to establish and maintain a register of charitable organisations that will be accessible to the general public.  This will have a significant positive impact on public confidence, as the public will henceforth be able to independently verify the bona fides of charitable organisations.Part 2 contains several standard provisions relating to the financial operations of the authority in sections 15 to 17, inclusive.  Sections 18 to 22, inclusive, deal with the chief executive, section 23, the appointment of employees by the authority, and section 25, the provision of a superannuation scheme.The Bill provides that the Office of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland will be dissolved on establishment of the authority.  Section 24 provides that staff employed in the office of the commissioners on the day before establishment day of the new authority will transfer to the new body on establishment day.  There are also standard but important provisions in section 24 which guarantee, save in accordance with a collective agreement negotiated with a recognised trade union, that the tenure, pay scales and other terms and conditions of employment, including superannuation benefits, of such employees shall be no less beneficial than those applicable immediately before establishment day.Sections 26 and 27 allow for co-operation and information-sharing in suspected offences between the new authority and the Garda Síochána, as well as with other regulatory and law enforcement agencies, including those based outside the State.  In a complementary manner, section 31 provides a basis for administrative co-operation by the authority with other relevant regulators.  Similarly, section 32 provides a basis for administrative co-operation with foreign statutory bodies on law enforcement matters.  The global fight against terrorism, including prevention of the misuse of charities for terrorist financing, provides a specific context for such administrative co-operation arrangements at international and EU levels.  The authority will be obliged to inform the Minister of any such arrangements under these sections.I gcomhréir le dea-chleachtais, foráiltear in alt go gcuirfidh an túdarás, i ngach tréimhse trí bliana, ráiteas straitéise os comhair an Aire don tréimhse trí bliana dár gcionn.  Leagfaidh an tAire, chomh luath agus atá sé indéanta tar éis do ráiteas straitéise a bheith curtha faoi bhráid, cóip den ráiteas sin os chomhair an Oireachtais.  Chomh maith leis sin, féachfaidh an t-údarás chuige go bhfoilseofar an ráiteas straitéise ar an Idirlíon.Section 29 contains standard provisions relating to the keeping and auditing of accounts and financial statements by the authority, which shall be subject to the scrutiny of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  After the accounts have been audited, as with the strategy statement, a copy of the accounts must be laid before the Oireachtas, as must any report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  An annual report on its performance during the preceding year must be provided by the authority to the Minister under section 30.  As with the strategy statement and accounts, the report must also be laid before the Oireachtas and published on the Internet.Is dóigh liom gur féidir a rá le fírinne go raibh leibhéal ard comh-chomhairliúcháin ann in ullmhú na reachtaíochta seo.  I gcomhréir leis sin, tá foráil sonrach sa Bhille féin maidir le próisis comhairliúcháin.  Mar a luadh níos túisce, tugtar suntas ar leith don údarás a bheith ag glacadh comhairle le páirtithe leasmhara a d'fhéadfadh éifeacht a bheith á himirt orthu agus a chuid feidhmeanna á ngníomhú ag an údarás.  Tá foráil ar leith in alt 33 do chomhairliúchán dá leithéid.  Leagtar amach in alt 34 na sonraí maidir le próiseas comhairliúcháin mar sin, a dhéanfar trí bhunú painéil comhairliúcháin ag an údarás le tearmaí tagartha sonracha leagtha síos ag an údarás féin.  Faoi alt 35, beidh cumhacht ag an Aire a iarraidh go mbunófar painéal comhairliúcháin ar leith.The Attorney General has had a role as the protector of charities, which can, inter alia, entail bringing legal proceedings in defence of charitable organisations, participating in proceedings brought by others, or carrying out certain roles under the Charities Act 1961.  With a new statutory authority in place with strong powers and a strong supportive and advisory ethos, it has been agreed that such a role would no longer be necessary.  Therefore, section 36 transfers all the functions relating to charitable organisations or charitable trusts that were previously vested in the Attorney General to the authority.  The former Attorney General, Mr. Rory Brady, SC, took a very proactive and hands-on role in the preparation of this legislation and I express our gratitude to him.In Part 3, which deals with the regulation of charitable organisations, certain responsibilities are placed on charitable organisations designed to ensure adherence to good administrative practices.  It should be noted there is a graduated approach so as not to place an unmanageable administrative burden, which may create undue difficulties for smaller charitable organisations in terms of compliance.  This approach is consistent with the proportionate regulation principle of better regulation.Charitable organisations, apart from charities that are bodies corporate and are already subject to the Companies Acts, will be required to maintain books of accounts.  They will have to produce to the authority on an annual basis such information as may be prescribed by regulations made by the Minister.  It is proposed that annual accounts will be subject either to audit, for larger organisations, or to independent examination for those organisations with an income or expenditure of less than €100,000 per annum.In the case of the latter, the authority will have a reserve power to request full audited accounts from any organisation, irrespective of its income or expenditure, where the authority considers it necessary.  It will be an offence for an organisation not to comply with these accounting requirements.  The authority will be empowered to appoint a person to audit the accounts of a charitable organisation that has not complied and recoup the costs of such an audit from the body in question.As well as accounting obligations, all registered charitable organisations will be obliged to provide annual activity reports to the authority.  In the case of organisations which are already obliged to provide annual reports to the Companies Registration Office, CRO, discussions between the Department and the CRO continue with the aim of ensuring dual reporting is avoided.  I expect to address this matter on Committee Stage through the introduction of appropriate amending provisions.In general, annual reports and accounts submitted to the authority will be made available for inspection by the public.  This will allow potential supporters of charitable causes the opportunity to make more informed choices as regards their donations.  I do not consider, however, that the same public interest applies to private charitable trusts that do not fundraise from the public.  It is not intended, therefore, that information provided by such organisations to the authority will be available to the public generally.  To do otherwise might serve to discourage involvement in philanthropy, which is not the intent of the legislation.Continuing with public confidence measures, section 48 outlines the circumstances under which a person ceases to be qualified to be a charity trustee.  These include, for example, where an individual is convicted of an indictable offence, or is adjudicated bankrupt.  The person disqualified may appeal to the High Court against such a disqualification.  The authority will maintain a register of persons who have ceased to be qualified for the position of charity trustee.  It will be an offence for a member of staff or a charity trustee of a charitable organisation to accept a direction from a person who, they are aware, is disqualified from being a charity trustee.  A person convicted of acting as a charity trustee when not qualified to do so, or who knowingly acts on the direction of a person not so qualified, will be personally liable for any debts arising to the organisation as a consequence of his or her actions.Part 3 provides that persons in specific categories of employment, such as auditors or trustees, for example, who have reasonable cause to believe that an offence under the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001, has been or is being committed within a particular charitable organisation, will be legally obliged to report this to the authority.  In any defamation proceedings that might arise, a defence of qualified legal privilege will apply to any report published by the authority relating to the state and conduct of the affairs of a charitable organisation.Persons who report suspected breaches of the legislation will not be regarded as having committed a breach of duty towards the organisation, unless such a report is made in bad faith.  This also applies to employees of the organisation.  There are specific provisions in place to ensure that an employee may not be penalised by his or her employer for notifying the authority in good faith of a suspected breach of the legislation within the organisation.It is important that a regulatory authority should have strong investigative powers and these are set out in Part 4, sections 57 to 67, of the Bill.  The authority may appoint an inspector to carry out investigations.  Charitable organisations will be obliged to co-operate with any investigation.  They will have to supply all documentation sought by an inspector or by the authority, with the exception of privileged information.  The authority will also be empowered to apply to the High Court for permission to enter and search premises.  Any report subsequently produced by the authority will be admissible as evidence in any related proceedings.As stated previously, the Bill is founded on the principle of reasonable and proportionate regulation and enforcement.  In this context, the authority will have the option, in certain circumstances, to take intermediate sanctions against an organisation rather than initiate full proceedings.  Such circumstances might include a situation where an organisation has failed to comply with its reporting or accounting obligations under the legislation.  Intermediate sanctions might include the removal of an organisation from the register until it complies fully with its obligations.In keeping with its role as protector of charities, the authority may, where it considers that a charitable organisation or its assets are at risk or in need of protection, apply to the High Court for an interim, interlocutory or permanent order to, for example, suspend, remove or even appoint a trustee where it is considered to be in the best interests of the organisation.In the case of a dispute over a decision of the authority, Part 5 provides for an extra-judicial appeals mechanism to be known as the charity appeals tribunal.  This again is in recognition of the fact that the majority of charitable organisations are small and with limited resources.  For these, access to the High Court might place a significant strain on resources.  This dispute resolution mechanism is intended to be accessible, affordable and user-friendly.Sections 68 to 72 contain the related provisions.  The five-person membership of the tribunal will reflect a balance between persons with a legal background and persons with expertise relating to charities.  Its proceedings will generally be in public and the Bill allows for the tribunal to establish its own procedures, subject to ministerial consent.  Decisions of the tribunal may be appealed to the High Court on a point of law.As I stated, it is proposed that the functions currently carried out by the Office of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland under the Charities Acts 1961 and 1973 will transfer in their entirety to the new authority on the establishment day.  Part 6, sections 73 to 78, contains standard provisions to ensure the smooth transfer of business from the board of commissioners to the incoming authority.The judicial and lay members of the Board of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests, selflessly and without remuneration, have provided an extremely valuable service free of charge to the citizens of the State over many years.  At this juncture, I would like to put on the record of the House my great appreciation for all the hard work and dedication of the members of the board.  It will be some time before the new authority is set up on a statutory footing.  I am confident that the board of commissioners will continue to fulfil its existing role during the interim period and will hand over its affairs to the new authority in due course in a smooth and orderly fashion.  I thank the members of the board of commissioners, under the chairmanship of the Honourable Mr. Justice Francis Murphy, for their professionalism to date in all these matters and again express my heartfelt appreciation for the commitment and dedication demonstrated by the commissioners in serving the public and the charities sector over many years.Fundraising is complex because of the wide range of methods it encompasses and the variety of organisations within the sector involved.  It has evolved considerably since the passing of the primary legislation on collections, the Street and House to House Collections Act 1962.  Part 7 of the Bill contains necessary updates and enhancements to that Act to reflect the modern face of fundraising.  For example, in 1962, the primary nature of fundraising was once-off cash-based collections.  The concept of collecting promises of money through direct debits or standing orders simply did not arise.  In 2007, this method of fundraising has become very prevalent.  It is of crucial importance to charities as it provides a steady and secure income for them, enabling them to plan their operations over a longer term and in a more strategic way.  Yet, until now, this non-cash method of fundraising has fallen outside the permit system operated by the Garda Síochána under the 1962 Act and thus is potentially open to abuse.  To address this, non-cash collections will be brought within a permit system for the first time, which will serve the interests of legitimate charitable organisations and offer reassurance to potential donors.The meaning of money has also been broadened beyond mere notes and coins.  Another development in the area of fundraising has been the practice of selling items for a specific price as part of the street collection process.  The 1962 definition of collection did not cover this practice, but this Bill will address this matter.The Bill will also tighten up particular elements of fundraising that, in hindsight, were perhaps not adequately dealt with in the 1962 Act.  For example, it will now be an offence for a person to make a misleading statement when applying for a collection permit.  Collection boxes will now have to be sealed and clearly marked to show the object to benefit from the collection and the registration number of the charitable organisation in question.  Penalties for breaches of the fundraising provisions of the legislation have been increased significantly from the 1962 levels.Methods of fundraising used by charities are constantly changing and evolving.  In this context, the regulation of the operational aspects of fundraising does not fit well within the rigid constraints imposed by primary legislation.  Principally for this reason, the preferred approach as regards the operational aspects of charitable fundraising is to regulate through agreed codes of good practice.  These codes are being developed at present with the financial support of my Department in partnership with the sector.  However, should this preferred approach fail to deliver a satisfactory outcome, section 85 allows the Minister a reserve power to make statutory regulations on fundraising.The above provisions, coupled with the power of the authority to require charities to provide information concerning their fundraising activities, for example in their applications for registration as well as in their annual accounts and annual returns, provide a strong though necessarily flexible regulatory regime for fundraising into the future.The first Schedule to the Bill contains provisions relating to the legal status of the authority, the appointment of members of the authority and the procedures to be followed by it.  The authority will have nine members, three of whom will have a legal background, and the remainder will include persons with experience of charitable work.  All will be appointed by the Minister, with the approval of the Government.  This Schedule sets out the processes relating to the appointment or removal of members of the authority.  It sets out how conflicts of interest are to be handled for members and members of staff of the authority.  It also allows the authority to establish committees to assist and advise the authority, or indeed to perform functions that might be delegated to it.As I touched upon earlier, Schedule 2 lists the legislation that is to be repealed by the Bill.  In essence, this only applies to certain sections of the Charities Act 1961.  These repeals are necessary given the proposed transfer of functions of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests to the new authority and, similarly, the transfer of charities-related functions formerly held by the Attorney General.Before I finish, I would like to refer to two issues that have been the subject of some public comment.  First, with regard to addressing in the legislation the question of advocacy towards a political objective by charitable organisations, practical issues arose concerning the protection of charitable status for certain bodies which do good work on the ground, such as those dealing with families of victims of homicide or victims of abuse.  It has also been argued that many charitable organisations legitimately engage in advocacy as a means to achieve their charitable purpose, though advocacy in itself is not their principal object.  Accordingly, it has been decided at this juncture not to provide for a specific provision in the Bill restricting advocacy by charities.With regard to the issue of legal forms for charities, Deputies will be aware that charities have the choice of a number of different legal forms, for example, unincorporated, such as a trust or an unincorporated association, or incorporated, such as a company, usually limited by guarantee.  The Law Reform Commission, in a report published late last year, recommended a new legal structure for charitable organisations, the charitable incorporated organisation, CIO.  This has not been included in the Bill, however, as the underlying purpose of this Bill is to ensure the accountability of the charities sector and to protect against abuse of charitable status and fraud.  It is not proposed to delay the regulation of the sector pending consideration of the separate, longer-term question of the CIO issue.I trust I have provided the House with a helpful overview of the intent and the content of the Charities Bill 2007.  I advise Deputies that I will introduce some amendments on Committee Stage.These will be mainly of a minor technical or drafting nature, although it is intended, as I have indicated, that there will be substantive additional provision to ensure that the potential for dual reporting to both the authority and the Companies Registration Office is minimised for charitable organisations that are currently subject to company law.  The Department is also considering a number of technical and other issues raised by the charities sector.The Charities Bill is a result of a lengthy process, involving extensive consultation across a wide and diverse sector.  The approach being adopted has been broadly welcomed by the sector and the public.  The input and support from representative bodies and charities practitioners has very much informed the content of the Bill.  I should like to formally express my appreciation to the sector for its contribution throughout the drafting and consultation process to date.  In passing, I want to pay tribute to my predecessor, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, who did a good deal of work as regards preparing this Bill.The Bill is a comprehensive document and represents a considerable achievement.  However, it can only be enhanced by well-intentioned debate and discussion.  In this context I am committed to engaging in a full debate and review of the draft legislation in its passage through the Houses.Finally, I recognise it is important to underpin civil society and I believe that charities deserve a proportionate, modern statutory framework.  I consider that this Bill, when enacted, will deliver a regulatory framework worthy of the sector,  I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to hearing the views of Deputies.

I have some reservations with which I shall be dealing on Committee Stage.  I have spoken in this Parliament for many years and believe fundamentally that whatever agency is set up by the Dáil, whether regulator or authority, must be accountable to this House — not to the Minister concerned, but to the House.  I shall table the appropriate amendment on Committee Stage, asserting that any Member of this House who wants to put an appropriate question to a regulator must be answered.  I am sick and tired, as a Member of this House of being fobbed off as regards the National Roads Authority, the HSE and many more agencies, when I question a particular Minister and am told that he or she has no responsibility for the body concerned.  My amendment will seek to ensure that when an authority is set up it is answerable to the House, not the Minister.  I trust the Minister of State will accept that amendment when it is tabled on Committee Stage.I want, first of all, to welcome the legislation.  We have talked about it for some 20 years.  Everyone who is involved in charities will welcome it.  In one way it is sad that we need charities in this country.  We should not need them if Governments were doing their job.  If the State provided the funding and we had a just society, we would not have wheelchair associations and different groups such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and others collecting money on the streets.  That is why charitable organisations are needed.I offer thanks to those who work in charitable organisations, people who participate in a voluntary capacity, who do not look for money but want to help their fellow human beings.  I am thankful for the community spirit that exists in this country.  The Irish are the most generous of peoples.  Anytime there was a crisis outside Ireland the Irish people have responded.  However, they do not like to be ripped off by people collecting money for charity who put it in their back pocket.  That is why I welcome this legislation.  I shall be glad to see that we have regulations, a permit system in place and that charities will have to be registered at the end of each year regardless of what moneys they collect.  The general public can check with the authority on how much a particular charity collected, how it was spent and where the money went.  The Irish people will welcome that.  They want to know that when they give their money for charity it is used for that purpose and not taken away by somebody else.Another matter that annoys me is that every weekend outside churches and supermarkets one sees people wearing yellow vests, with no identification, pressing tickets on people and asking them to sign up either through direct debit or cash to some charity or other.  One does not know what the charity is and nine times out of ten the identity of the person is not known.  That is why it is time that we had regulations for charity, to know who is collecting money and for what.  I welcome that aspect in the Bill.I know some charities are concerned about a few of the issues in the Bill.  There is a reference in the Bill as to whether a collection might be for a political purpose.  My colleague from the Labour Party will table an appropriate amendment in this regard.  It would be very wrong if legislation were to be introduced in the forthcoming budget which was unjust to the poor and a member of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, for example, who lobbied to have it set aside were to later decide to take part in politics.  That must be addressed in the Bill.  I know the Minister of State will deal with it as quickly as possible because it would be appalling if some bodies were debarred from being charities for the wrong reasons.  When that amendment is tabled I know the Minister of State will accept it.The heads of the Bill stated that a charitable purpose must include the advancement of human rights, social justice and social inclusion and citizenship, and the advancement of the effectiveness and efficiencies of charities.  Will the Minister of State say why that provision has been removed and whether it was necessary?  Charity is all about social justice and these charities fear that they will be affected if that provision is not reinserted.  I ask the Minister of State to accept the appropriate amendment on Committee Stage when it comes before him.As regards the Bill, people in the charities sector are concerned that when the regulator is in place, he or she must have a clear role.  I welcome the appointment of a regulator but the purpose of that office must be to regulate.  He or she must make clear what is expected from a particular charity, not what the regulator believes it should be doing.  Charities are concerned lest the regulator interferes with their day to day business, and that should not happen.Another issue, which the Minister of State touched on in his speech concerns State agencies that get tax relief for charity purposes.  There should be two registers, one for charities per se, and another for the State agencies.  Charities are for the benefit of the community and the public because they collect charitable moneys.  State agencies are obliged to carry out their roles, as regulated by the State and in accordance with the law of the land.  There are 25 State agencies which will be affected by the legislation and they should be in a different register from the charities.  I ask the Minister of State to look at that as well.The Bill has received a broad welcome.  For a long time we have been seeking this type of regulation to ensure that moneys collected by charities are spent wisely and used for the purposes raised.  As someone new to this portfolio I only started to learn about the charities Bill within the past 48 hours.  I compliment my colleagues, Deputies McGinley and Jim O'Keeffe, both of whom had a major role in this area in the past.  Both of these Deputies have strenuously pushed for this Bill to come before the House.It is important the authority is put in place and the legislation is implemented as quickly as possible.  It is also important the public has confidence that the money they give to charity is used for that purpose.  The authority must be strong, independent and fair to charities.  There are two types of charitable organisations.  There are the national organisations with significant staff and smaller organisations in communities with people out collecting.  They must also be protected by this Bill.  It is important that one is able to go up to a person collecting for charity and ask for what charity he or she is collecting, if one can see his or her badge and if he or she is registered and has a permit.It is important people can log on to the Internet, which most people can use, to see what has happened their money, how much has gone on administration and how much has been spent on the charity.  People are looking for accountability, which this Bill will provide.There are some concerns, one or two of which I mentioned.  A number of the organisations will speak to us before Committee Stage.  This Bill is about regulation.  We must regulate and have law and order in this field.  However, it is important we do not over-regulate the charities.  They are doing a job and are dependent on volunteers in some cases and on people to help and back them up.  It is important we give them the help and financial support they need.  I hope that when the authority is up and running the charities will not pay for it.  We hope the Government will pay for the staff and that the authority does not pass on the charges to the charities.  It is bad enough that these charities are in existence in the first place, that they must fight for people who are not being treated properly by the system and that they must collect money to put into the system, but it would be wrong if the charities found themselves paying for the authority and its staff.  I hope that is dealt with by the Government.There are over 19,000 community and voluntary groups in this country.  What they need is more help than regulation.  When the authority is given powers, its job must be to regulate and not to tell the charities how to run their businesses, which they must do themselves.  The role of the authority is to investigate charities if they are breaking the rules or if there is something wrong.  The people want to know that when they support charities the money is used for the intended purpose.Fine Gael welcomes the Bill.  Accountability to the Dáil is important.  I do not want to be a hypocrite so I must say that I am sick and tired of powers being taken from the Dáil and being given to regulators and organisations such as the Health Service Executive and of us having no say.  I will not call a vote on Second Stage but I will put this issue to a vote on Committee Stage.  I hope the Minister of State will accept an amendment that the authority will be accountable to the Dáil rather than the Minister of the day.I thank the people who have worked hard for charities and to promote social justice and ensure those who are not well off are looked after and not forgotten by society.  I hope the Minister of State will deal with some of their problems.  It is important people are allowed to campaign for social justice and that it is not regarded as political.  If an organisation wishes to support a political cause, it should be able to do so.  However, no political party, candidate or organisation that is outlawed in this country should be supported by a charity.Charities have always operated within the law.  However, there have been problems in charitable organisations with which we have not been able to deal, but with this regulation we will be able to deal with them.  The law will be on our side in ensuring people's money is protected.I welcome regulation but I will have a lot more to say on Committee Stage.  I am glad the Bill has come before the House.  I will raise issues on Committee Stage about which the charities are worried.  The public must have confidence when they give money.  I am glad to see that organisations will be registered and will have permits, that their accounts will be examined and that they will have to present them to the authority.  It is important the facility is there for the public to see where their money has been spent.I hope the Bill will be implemented and that the authority will be in place as quickly as possible.  I hope the charities will not pay for the authority but that the Government will do so.  I do not believe we need an authority and cannot understand why the Department cannot perform this function as there are enough civil servants.  A person in the Department should be appointed to perform this function.  However, since the Government is opting for an authority, it is fine provided it is accountable to the Dáil and not only to the Minister.I welcome the Bill and will have a lot more to say on Committee Stage.  The people involved in charitable organisations throughout this State are glad to see this Bill.  They want to see fair regulation and to be able to work with the authority rather than see it work against them.

It has been fascinating to listen to both of them.  Largely, there seems to be much common ground between them on this Bill.  This is a good Bill and it is important it is accepted as such.  What is even more important is that the democratic process applies here to ensure that what is a good Bill turns out to be an excellent one and, ultimately, an excellent charities Act.  It is 45 years since the last Charities Act and, therefore, this Bill is long overdue.  I recall Judge Declan Costello chairing a committee which produced a report in 1990 — 17 years ago — indicating the urgent need for reform.  I am glad that after this long period of gestation, the Bill has been produced.This is a detailed and complex Bill with, as the Minister of State mentioned, 85 sections and two Schedules, one of consequence.  I have a major suggestion to make in support of the points raised by Deputy Ring.  After the Bill was published, a detailed submission was made by the charities regulation study group.  It is largely supportive of the Bill but raised a raft of concerns, a lot of them minor, but some not so minor, in an effort to provide an input to ensure the final product is the best possible.The best way to handle this Bill is that after Second Stage — I have no doubt it will, in principle, have the support of all in this House — it should be referred to committee and that bodies such as the charities regulation study group and other interested parties should be invited before the Oireachtas committee to indicate their concerns about different aspects of it and their proposals on how the detail might be improved.  Only then should we proceed with Committee Stage.  If that is done, there is a very good chance we will end up with an outstanding charities Act.

Such orders are invoked as an interim protective measure to deal with immediate threats to monuments and have a finite duration of six months.  Upon their expiration, such orders may be renewed or alternative measures to protect the monument in the longer term may be put in place.On the basis of the advice available to me, I was satisfied there was a risk of damage to the national monument known as Rath Lugh, a hill-top enclosure in the townland of Lismullin, County Meath.  Given its archaeological importance, I placed a temporary preservation order on it on 28 September 2007.  Prior notification of my intention in this regard was sent to the registered owner of the lands on which the monument is located, Coillte Teoranta.  My Department will engage with Coillte in the coming weeks to consider how the monument can best be protected in the longer term.The site of the monument is delineated and defined on a map annexed to the order and is adjacent to, but outside, the lands on which the M3 motorway is to be constructed.In the exercise of my statutory functions in the protection of national monuments, I am concerned to ensure that the construction of the motorway does not damage the monument itself.  I am also anxious to ensure that construction works do not destabilise the esker or ridge on which the monument is located and thus have the effect of causing damage to the monument.  With this in mind, it is my intention to continue to monitor conditions in the vicinity of the site of the monument at Rath Lugh to ensure that no damage occurs thereto.  I have also asked my Department to commission a report from an independent company of geotechnical consultants on the stability of the esker and I await their report on this aspect of the matter.

This is the first chance I have had to do so.I asked the Minister whether the temporary preservation order he issued on 28 September would have any implications for the construction of the M3 motorway.  What is the position of the Minister and Green Party on the construction of the motorway in view of all the statements they made about it before the election last May?  Members of the Green Party, particularly Deputy Ciarán Cuffe, called for the construction of the motorway to be stopped.  Is the Minister in favour of the new motorway programme and has he further concerns over Rath Lugh that will further delay the project?

I also wish well the Labour Party spokespersons, Deputies Joanna Tuffy and Ciarán Lynch.My primary function as Minister responsible for heritage is to protect our archaeological heritage and this is what I intend to do.  On taking office, I said I would not only conduct an archaeological review but also err on the side of caution regarding archaeological heritage.  I appointed an expert on Tara, Professor Conor Newman, with whom Deputy Phil Hogan might be familiar.  Deputy Shane McEntee certainly knows him because they have spoken on many occasions.  Deputy McEntee knows Professor Newman has an exemplary record in respect of heritage in the area and the latter has spoken very highly of the Deputy.

He was part of the Discovery Programme for quite a long time and it was he who came to me to offer advice regarding Rath Lugh.Rath Lugh is on a quite large esker.  Professor Newman's immediate concern was that the construction works could undermine the esker despite its being outside the road take.  He also discovered that the national monument was probably closer to the road than had been anticipated.  I took this into account.  I was told by the Department that some of the growth on the esker itself could undermine the national monument and this is why I acted on the matter.The Deputy knows quite well that the decision on the M3 was taken in 2003.  My party was opposed to the motorway and this is a matter of historical record.  Some of my closest advisers attended the hearing.  Deputy Hogan knows well that I cannot, at this stage, do anything about the decision but I can do everything I can as Minister responsible for heritage, which title I take very seriously, to protect our archaeological heritage.  I listened very carefully to what Professor Conor Newman said about Lismullin and to the statements of the director of the National Museum of Ireland, Dr. Pat Wallace.  These two individuals were opposed to the siting of the road and share my concern over archaeological heritage.  That is why I am delighted they are on board and advising me.

Were the issues to which the Minister refers, including that of Rath Lugh, not flagged by the national monuments section of his Department while the route appraisal was being undertaken a long time ago?  Who marked out the site to allow the M3 to be constructed?  Who will take responsibility for the fact that the Minister must issue a temporary preservation order at the eleventh hour?

It was a central plank of the Deputy McEntee's by-election campaign.  The construction of a motorway is a matter for the National Roads Authority in the first instance.  The authority has said that, as far as it is concerned, there is no potential for damage to the national monument, but I, as Minister responsible for heritage, must act in the best interest of our archaeological heritage.  I said I would err on the side of caution and that is why I adopted the approach in question, with which most people interested in archaeology would agree.  This is what people have said to me and why I acted the way I did.

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	241	There are no plans to create a scheme of grant assistance for remediation of homes with radon levels that exceed the national reference level adopted by the Government in respect of houses.  The Government's approach, which is similar to that of the majority of EU member states, is that our efforts are better concentrated on increasing public awareness of the risks posed by radon in the home.The testing of houses for radon is a relatively straightforward and non-invasive process.  It is also inexpensive, costing approximately €50.  It would be difficult for a demand-led scheme of domestic radon grants to ensure appropriate and cost-effective targeting of remedial action.  Furthermore, such a scheme could require significant public expenditure and administrative resources.The Government, largely through the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, has for many years committed significant resources to assessing the extent of the radon problem throughout the country and increasing public awareness of radon and the health risks associated with prolonged exposure to high radon concentrations.  Householders, particularly those in high radon areas identified by the institute in its nationwide survey, have been strongly encouraged to have their homes tested for radon and to undertake remediation works where necessary.  There will continue to be a focus on enabling and encouraging householders to address monitoring and remedial requirements effectively and economically.  Details of the survey can be found on the institute's website.  The building regulations introduced by the Department in 1998 and updated in 2004 require all new buildings, including new houses, to incorporate radon protection measures at the time of construction.  Technical guidance on radon remediation techniques is available in a booklet issued by the Department, Radon in Buildings — Corrective Options, which is available on the Department's website.  The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has issued a guidance document, Understanding Radon Remediation — A Householder's Guide, which is available on the institute's website, as is a list of companies that can provide a radon remediation service and offer specific advice and recommendations.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	242	It is interesting the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, is now responsible for answering questions about radon.  This time last year, the former Minister, Deputy Roche, would have responded to a question about the matter.  When the Green Party was in opposition, it joined the Labour Party in calling for the introduction of radon remediation grants.  The answer that has just been given by the Minister of State is almost exactly the same as the response given by the former Minister, Deputy Roche, in June 2006.  Given that it has had a policy of introducing a radon remediation grant scheme similar to that introduced by Deputy Stagg of the Labour Party some years ago, has the Green Party engaged in any negotiations about this issue with Fianna Fáil?  Deputy Cuffe of the Green Party said a couple of years ago that "there is a moral imperative on the Government to assist those living in homes with high levels of radon".  He called for the reintroduction of radon remediation grants.  What is the current position?  Will the Government reintroduce the grant scheme I have mentioned?
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	243	There have been a number of studies on this matter.  A study that was conducted in a number of European countries pointed out, inter alia, that people who smoke or used to smoke are susceptible to increased levels of danger from radon.  As I said earlier, this phenomenon was partially addressed in the 1998 building regulations.  A cost-benefit analysis of the introduction of a grant scheme, which was conducted by the Danish Government a number of years ago, suggested that introducing such a scheme would by no means be the most effective means of dealing with this difficulty.  The Government has targeted its investment at ensuring people know about the dangers and can access a scheme of testing to enable them to establish whether they have radon problems in their houses.  Remediation measures are relatively inexpensive in many instances.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	244	I would like to hear the views of the Minister, Deputy Gormley, on this issue.  Given that his party has consistently called for the reintroduction of the radon remediation grant scheme, I would like to know if that remains his position now that he is Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The Minister of State mentioned that smokers are at risk, but radon does not affect smokers only.  I accept that smokers have a higher risk of contracting lung cancer if they live in a high radon area.  According to statistics from the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and the National Cancer Registry, radon causes up to 200 deaths from lung cancer in this country every year.  There is a real health risk associated with radon.  To put it in context, approximately 70 people die from cancer of the cervix and approximately 800 people are killed on the roads each year.  The Minister of State referred to a Danish study, but that is not a very good example because Denmark has a far smaller radon risk than Ireland.  Seven European countries have radon remediation grant schemes and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has said that such a scheme would be very effective in Ireland.  Is the Minister of State aware that a study conducted by the institute found that radon remediation measures were taken in just 10% of houses in which high radon levels had been identified?  The institute has argued that the main reason for the low take-up is that such facilities are too costly for householders.

We need to decide which scheme will produce the best results as we try to address these difficulties.  It is accepted that it is hugely important that we ensure people are aware of the risk of radon in the first instance.  We should tell them not only that a radon test can be conducted relatively inexpensively, but also that advice about remediation measures is available.  There is no consensus that radon remediation grant schemes have been successful in addressing the worst cases in those countries where they have been introduced.  Most of the evidence suggests that the opposite has been the case.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	248	An official report has recently been published in the Netherlands about the Nedap electronic voting system which is in operation there.  An official English translation of the report is not yet available.  The House will appreciate that I do not propose to comment until I have received the report and had an opportunity to consider it.  I understand the committee which prepared the report was established after last year's Dutch elections and that the Dutch Parliament will discuss the report in early December.  I am aware of reports of a recent court judgment in the Netherlands to the effect that electronic voting machines should not be used in a mayoral election in Utrecht.  I understand this decision was made on the basis of non-compliance with the legal certification procedures governing the use of the system in the Netherlands.  The case was initiated before the committee's report was published and the events are unrelated.  The House will recall that the final report of the Commission on Electronic Voting last year concluded that the voting equipment chosen for use in Ireland could be used subject to further work which was also recommended, such as the replacement of the election management software, the adaptation of the equipment and the undertaking of further end-to-end testing.  As I have indicated to the House, I am considering the next steps to be taken in the electronic voting and counting project.  I will take into account the commission's report, any relevant findings from the Netherlands, the need to maintain public confidence in the electoral process and the provisions in the programme for Government relating to electoral reform generally.

Is the Minister in favour of the electronic voting machines which were given a trial run in some constituencies a number of years ago and have been criticised by the Green Party over recent years?  The Minister's party suggested his predecessor as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, should resign if he continued to advocate the use of the machines.  The State has spent €60 million on electronic voting machines, including their storage.  It cannot even get the storage capacity right at Gormanston Aerodrome.  Will the Minister tell the House what he intends to do with the electronic voting machines, rather than hiding behind another Commission on Electronic Voting report?

I said when I was in Opposition that I was in favour of electronic voting, in principle.  I do not know Fine Gael's stance, in principle, on electronic voting.  We need to ascertain whether electronic voting is effective and whether we can gain public confidence in it.  I hope the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government can examine those matters, just as the Commission on Electronic Voting considered a number of issues in its report.  While the possibility of providing for a voter verifiable audit trail was outside the thrust of the commission's report, most of the submissions which were received related to it so it was addressed in some detail.  We have to examine whether we can give the public confidence in electronic voting, which is a matter that is being examined by the Department.  We have spent approximately €51.3 million on these machines.  That is a lot of money and I am not inclined to throw it away.  I would like to see electronic voting working and to see if we can modify those machines.  It would appear from the CEV report that they can be modified, but to what extent?  A crucial question for me is whether we can get added value.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	251	I think the Minister is trying to advocate something similar to what the Fianna Fáil Ministers did in the past — recycling the machines.  The Minister knows that the Irish and Dutch jurisdictions are saying that this particular type of machine will not provide confidence in our democratic system.  It will not ensure that the Irish people can vote and be confident that their intention may be verified.  In the light of the Irish and Dutch experiences and the commission report at his disposal, there is no need for further evidence or reports.  Will the Minister give an undertaking to the House that he will scrap these machines and start the process on electronic voting again?

The current scheme allows tenants who have been resident in a local authority house for a minimum period of one year to apply to their local authority to either purchase the dwelling outright or acquire it by way of shared ownership.  Initial eligibility for the scheme is also subject to purchasers not being in rent arrears.Certain categories of dwellings, including older persons dwellings, maisonettes and flats or apartments, are excluded from the scheme.  Local authorities also reserve the right to exclude certain houses from the scheme's remit for reasons of good estate management, structural condition or on the basis of proposals to carry out restorative work to the dwelling.The Government's statement on housing policy, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, published in February 2007, indicated that reforms are needed to the existing tenant purchase model to implement a more cost effective and equitable system, including the introduction of a scheme for the sale of local authority apartments to tenants under certain conditions and revised terms.A social housing miscellaneous provisions Bill, currently being drafted, is expected to be published in early 2008.  Work on addressing the complex legal issues relating to the tenant purchase of local authority apartments is being advanced in that context.

My question very clearly asks when the legislative framework will be put in place.  County and city managers across the country are prepared to move ahead with the scheme.  The legal difficulties to which the Minister of State referred were worked out as far back as 2005.  The city councils in both Dublin and Cork were part of a working group which considered topics such as sinking funds and the regulations on the freehold and title hold of selling these types of properties.  The Minister in the previous Government gave a commitment as far back as 2005 that the legislative framework would be put in place in that period.  What has happened in the ten years since 1997?

We must also take account of the advice from the Office of the Attorney General.  There are certain issues with which the officials from the Attorney General's office are not satisfied.  Officials from my Department are engaged in consultation with the Attorney General's office on this issue and it is hoped that this measure, among others, will be introduced early in 2008.  I cannot introduce a system that will be found wanting legally at the end of the day.  We want to make absolutely sure that, when it is introduced, it will stand up in law.

I would like to see the legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General, stating there is a blockage on this matter, and I ask the Minister of State to bring it before the House.  In the meantime, property prices have risen by 300% while people are waiting.  The tenants are getting older and they may not be able to secure a 20-year mortgage schedule.  It would have to be this length if one is to pay off the mortgage by the age of 65.Has the Minister of State considered putting in place a ministerial order that can fast-track this process while the legislative framework is being worked out?  If there are problems with the Attorney General's office, there is a ministerial provision that would allow this to happen.  Given that the Minister of State's predecessor indicated in 2005 that this issue would be finalised in the lifetime of that Government, it is completely unacceptable that we are now being told it will be finalised in 2008.

The Office of the Attorney General is not causing a blockage.  There are complex legal issues that must be overcome.  It is incumbent on the Attorney General and on my Department to ensure that, when the legislation is introduced, it will stand up to scrutiny.  We want to be absolutely certain that, when the legislation is introduced in 2008, it will be watertight.The first issue the Minister, Deputy Gormley, raised with me was that he had committed himself to the introduction of this Bill.  There is certainly no delay on our part.  We are anxious to make progress, but we must be satisfied that all the legal complexities are addressed.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	269	The Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to the establishment of an independent electoral commission which will take responsibility for a range of electoral matters including,  inter alia, the functions currently exercised by the Standards in Public Office Commission relating to election spending.  The electoral commission will also examine the issue of financing of the political system.  I will be developing appropriate proposals in regard to the establishment of the commission. In addition, the Agreed Programme for Government commits to publishing a Green Paper on local government reform.  One of the issues the Green Paper will address is the question of expenditure limits at local elections.  There are currently no such limits, although expenditure, as well as donations over a €635 threshold, must be disclosed.  I have set in train a process of public consultation prior to the preparation of the Green Paper and established a related consultative committee.  Work on the Green Paper should be completed by the end of this year with final proposals to be settled in a White Paper next year.I am satisfied that the proposals for the electoral commission, together with the initiatives which will emerge from the Green Paper, provide an appropriate framework to progress our extensive and complex agenda for electoral and local government reform.

Will the Minister ban corporate donations, for example?  The Green Party, in its election manifesto, promised to ensure adequate State funding of political parties based on electoral results and to ban corporate, institutional and foreign based donations.  Deputy Ciaran Cuffe told a press conference that ending corporate donations was a core principle of the Green Party.  What has happened to those undertakings?  The Minister now appears to be saying he will replace the Standards in Public Office Commission with another standards in public office commission.  He went on to speak about local government reform, which has nothing to do with my question.  What is the Green Party position regarding the legal reform of political donations and banning corporate donations?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	271	Deputy Tuffy appears to be obsessed with the Green Party.  I am anxious to get on with the business of government.It would be disappointing if Deputy Tuffy dismissed the electoral commission.  Its establishment will be a huge advance.  An electoral commission would deal with the issues she raises.  There is a problem regarding expenditure limits at local elections.  No limits currently exist.  Limits should exist at local elections.  I am sure Deputy Tuffy has seen candidates spend obscene amounts of money at local election time.  This needs to be addressed.  The best fora in which to address this issue are the electoral commission and the consultative committee on local government reform, which I have established.  I have invited a number of the Deputy's colleagues to take part in this process and three Labour Party people are on the consultative committee.  I am happy to facilitate the Labour Party in putting forward their ideas.  I believe they have constructive ideas and I congratulate the party on its initiatives when in government.  Deputy Tuffy will also see the Government taking an enlightened approach to this matter.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	272	The Minister is aware that Mr. Justice Smith, chairman of the Standards in Public Office Commission,  has called for increased transparency and greater scrutiny of party expenditure.  Are these measures part of the Government's legislative programme or are the organisers of the Galway tent safe in sending their deposits to book their space for next August?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	273	It is not only Mr. Justice Smith who calls for scrutiny and transparency.  The Warsaw-based Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights was invited by the Department of Foreign Affairs to observe this year's general election.  It concluded that the Electoral Act, which governs election spending, was rendered obsolete by its narrow scope.  I am aware of that.  Much spending takes place between elections.  By the time the election campaign is officially called many of the bigger spenders have spent considerable amounts of money.  That needs to be addressed.  The proper forum for this matter would be the electoral commission.It would be regrettable for Deputies to dismiss the electoral commission.  It offers huge scope for reform.  I have spoken to colleagues who have tried in the past and failed to establish an electoral commission.  It would be an enormous achievement to establish an electoral commission.  It would deal not only with funding but also with the question of the electoral register and other matters which need to be addressed.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	281	I do not object to an electoral commission.  The Standards in Public Office Commission does a fine job and if it were given the teeth to do more it could be very effective.  However, the electoral commission is not a Minister, and only the Minister can introduce legislation.  The banning of corporate donations is a core principle of his party.  What legislation will he introduce in the area of political donations?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	282	Deputy Tuffy is correct in saying the electoral commission is not a Minister.  Last evening I heard much talk about the establishment of quangos.  On the one hand she asks me to set up a national fire authority — I do not exclude that possibility — while on the other she seems to pour cold water on the idea of an electoral commission.  It involves the Minister giving away power to a commission but it is, nevertheless, a positive and constructive idea.  It will transform the face of Irish politics and address numerous issues, including the question of political donations.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	285	The needs of 14,686 households were met through the full range of social and affordable housing measures in 2006.  The total number of social housing units completed by local authorities and the voluntary and co-operative housing sector in the first six months of 2007, at 3,167 units, is up 33% on the first six months of 2006 and represents the strongest level of activity on the programme this decade.  In addition, 450 new units were acquired under the rental accommodation scheme.Funding has been provided in 2007 to meet the commitments in Towards 2016 to start or acquire 9,000 units of social housing.  This will be through a combination of local authority, voluntary and co-operative housing units and new supply under the rental accommodation scheme.  Good momentum is being made in achieving these targets, with 11,500 social housing units in progress at the end of June 2007While comprehensive information on the numbers applying for all affordable housing schemes is not collected by my Department, the indications are that demand for affordable housing remains strong in certain areas, particularly in the greater Dublin area and near other major urban centres.  In response, increased affordable housing activity is evident, supported in particular by the continued increase in momentum under Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2006.Following a 20% increase in overall affordable housing delivery in 2006, when over 3,200 units were provided, output in the first six months of 2007, at 1,192 homes, is up 5% on the corresponding period last year.  In excess of 5,000 units were in progress at the end of June 2007 and a strong focus on delivery continues to be maintained to gain further momentum towards the achievement of the 5,000 unit target for this year.  This is being supported by the work of the affordable homes partnership, which has a particular focus on initiatives to increase the supply of affordable housing in the greater Dublin area.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	286	The programme for Government promises that 90,000 homes will be built in the lifetime of the Government, an average of 18,000 houses per annum.  The figures given by the Minister of State are below that.  The All-Party Committee on the Constitution reported that local authorities could be empowered by legislation compulsorily to acquire land required for housing at an economic cost.  Does the Minister of State plan to act upon this report and free up property for the affordable housing sector?
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	287	The Minister does not intend to pursue that matter at present.  The matter has not been examined by me to date.  I have been, since taking up office, familiarising myself with the brief.  I will undertake to examine the matter and to report directly on it to the Deputy.In terms of the Government's overall strategy in this area, it is important to point out that the needs of some 140,000 households will be met through the housing programme during the lifetime of the NDP.  We are spending €21 billion on that programme.  Some €18 billion will be spent directly on housing and a further €5 billion has been allocated in respect of rent allowances, mortgage supplements and the rental allowance scheme, RAS.  All of this illustrates the Government's intention to honour its commitments to the housing sector during the lifetime of the development plan.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	288	Will the Minister of State agree the housing strategies of each local authority adopted some years ago are out of date?  Will he also agree that no impact is being made in respect of the number of people on waiting lists for local authority housing and that what is required is new thinking on the part of the Minister of State in the form of new proposals?  Is the Minister of State considering new proposals to deal with the escalating waiting lists for houses in each local authority area, many of which were not taken into account in the housing strategies agreed some years ago?

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	290	If anybody on the affordable housing list is listening to this debate it is because they are interested to hear how what is being said will affect them.  The affordable housing list is increasing.  This scheme was intended to facilitate those on low incomes to purchase affordable housing.  The cost of purchasing a home in many areas, even under the affordable housing scheme, is quite expensive.  The Minister of State said he will report back to the Chamber on this matter.However, as Deputy Phil Hogan stated, the issue of housing output needs to be examined.  Cork City Council and Cork County Council are operating two different systems in terms of administering and rolling out this scheme.  Some local authorities appear to have problems in terms of processing the affordable housing scheme resulting in backlogs.  Will the Minister of State address this issue?
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	291	Two questions were asked.  The Government has been innovative in terms of the provision of social and affordable housing.  A whole range of new mechanisms have been introduced to address the problem.  The introduction in early 2008 of the miscellaneous housing Bill will provide further initiatives including, incremental purchase by tenants of local authority houses.  Measures to address the problem include the affordable housing scheme, shared ownership scheme, the Part V option and, in the future, the incremental purchase option.Local authorities have, up to now, had indicative targets about which I am not happy.  We have now given them a three-year programme within which to produce houses in their respective areas.  We are underpinning those targets with funding and we will ensure those targets are met over the three year period.  This is the right way forward.  I was not happy that targets were not being met.  The three-year programme and the underpinning funding will ensure local authorities meet the targets set by them.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	292	Before proceeding with business I wish on my own behalf and behalf of the Members of Dáil Éireann to offer a céad míle fáilte, a most sincere welcome, to the Right Honourable Mr. William Hay, MLA, Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly.  I hope his visit will be fruitful and enjoyable.  You are very welcome.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	293	I propose to take Questions Nos. 95 and 142 together.The Planning and Development Act 2000 sets the statutory framework within which planning authorities must take in charge estates.  In addition to the legal framework, my Department has also issued comprehensive policy guidance on the taking in charge of estates.  In circular letter PD1/06, planning authorities were reminded of their responsibilities in this area and were asked as a priority to establish a policy on taking in charge to be approved by the members of the authority and reported on to those members on a regular basis or at least annually.In July 2006, my Department issued circular letter PD5/06 to planning authorities stating that conditions requiring management companies should not be attached to planning permission for traditional housing estates, namely, estates of houses with individual private gardens, except in very specific circumstances.  Such circumstances would include, for example, the maintenance of a particular service or shared facility that is provided for residents' use only, such as a playground.The circular acknowledged, however, that the question of who should be responsible for the maintenance of certain shared facilities in the newer type of mixed estate needed further examination.  Accordingly, my Department established a working group, representative of local authorities, architects, planners and consumer interests to consider this issue and other issues related to the taking in charge of estates.  The group considered the issue of responsibility for the maintenance of common shared facilities in residential estates including small open spaces, car parking and playgrounds.  It also looked at issues relating to the completion of estates and the taking in charge process.  The group has completed its work and has produced suggested draft policy guidance for my consideration.As indicated in previous replies to the House, I will carefully consider the draft policy guidance in the context of the new programme for Government commitments in this area, in order to determine the most effective course of action.  I expect this process to be completed shortly.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	294	I welcome the Minister's statement that the working group has completed its work and will shortly report on it to him.  Will the Minister acknowledge there is ongoing extortion in respect of this scheme which is being used by some people to gather money for themselves rather than as payment to maintain open spaces in apartment complexes?Will the Minister agree it is important legislation be introduced now to deal with this important issue rather than dealing with it by way of regulation in 2009, as recently indicated by him?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	295	I have spoken to Deputy Hogan's colleague, Deputy Varadkar, about this matter.  I know he is genuinely concerned about this. I am aware that as a councillor he experienced at  first hand many of the difficulties involved in dealing with management companies.I would like to reassure the Deputy that I received confirmation from my Department before coming into the Chamber that the working group has completed its work and that its report will be on my desk next week.  This is a serious issue on which we must move as swiftly as possible.  For this reason, I will use every ounce of my energy to ensure the matter is progressed as quickly as possible.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	296	I thank the Minister for his response.  On management companies, I have tabled a parliamentary question in respect of certain estates in my constituency.  This sector is completely unregulated and people are being charged on the double in terms of high prices for homes and between €500 and €800 in management fees, depending on whether they live in a house or an apartment.This is a serious issue.  There are huge delays in the taking in charge of housing estates by local authorities.  The management companies are extorting money from people for up to ten years in some instances.  Will the Minister ensure the taking in charge process will be improved upon?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	297	As I stated in reply to Deputy Hogan, this is a matter of great concern and I want to ensure is sorted out.  These difficulties arose, as the Deputy will be aware, in the context of the unprecedented building programme which took place here.  Estates were springing up like mushrooms all over the place, without, I acknowledge, proper facilities and where the management companies in place were exploitative in many cases.  This is a matter deserving of urgent attention and it will be on my desk next week.  The Deputy's colleague, Deputy Varadkar, has stopped me in the corridor on a number of occasions and I would be happy to talk to him about this matter.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	298	I have seen the newspaper report which appears to be the basis for this question.  The report makes it clear that the data includes the landfilling of unsegregated municipal waste which cannot be recycled.The most recent national waste report, published by the Environmental Protection Agency states that the recovery rate for municipal waste in 2005 was 34.6%.  This was almost four times the equivalent figure for 1998, which was 9%.  The recent media reports appear to suggest that waste management companies have reported even higher diversion rates to the EPA in respect of 2006 although this information is subject to analysis by the agency prior to publication.  The national waste report 2006 will be published in early 2008 by the EPA.  The ever-increasing recovery rates being reported by the agency would indicate that municipal waste presented for segregated collection by businesses and householders or collected through civic amenity sites is indeed being diverted from landfill.I fully recognise that despite the improved national recycling performance we need to continue to improve our performance.  The programme for Government commits us to establishing new ambitious waste management targets for maximum prevention, reuse and recycling with a view to ensuring that we match the best performance in the EU with the objective that only 10% or less is consigned to landfill as opposed to the current rate of 66%.  The programme also provides for a comprehensive review of waste management planning which I have directed my Department to initiate.  This review will ensure that our waste management plans reflect best international practice and that we have the policies and infrastructure to meet ambitious environmental objectives.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	299	The Minister is aware of the statistics which are referred to in the question but he has not stated the steps he intends taking.  Many of the companies involved in sending as much as 60% of waste to landfill are the big waste companies such as Oxygen, Thornton and Panda.  There is big money to be made by waste recycling companies who are enjoying huge profit margins as private companies are entitled to do.  This Minister is a member of the Green Party and his policy should be that of the polluter pays but the Government of which he is a member is actually paying these companies to pollute.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	300	A question, please, Deputy Tuffy.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	301	This means that our targets for climate change are being obstructed because we continue to send waste to landfill and produce methane gas.  How can a Green Party Minister stand over a policy which is basically paying private companies to pollute, especially when residents are doing the opposite?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	302	The story on which the Deputy bases her information is incorrect.  The issue is unsegregated waste.  It could be inferred from the newspaper article that 40% of waste is now being recycled.  It gave the impression that materials which could be recycled were going to landfill and this is not the case.  This is the crucial point which I bring to the Deputy's attention and which she needs to understand.On the question of the principle of the polluter pays, I accept this principle and it is a core issue for my party.  We were always brave enough, when it came to making these decisions at local authority level, to say that waste charges were needed.  The same cannot be said for the Deputy's party because I have direct experience of that where people——

Consistency is required because the principle of the polluter pays actually works.  We know now that more people are using the green bin.  The waste to which Deputy Tuffy and I are referring is waste that goes into the grey or black bin.

I refer to the issue of pyrites which is affecting hundreds, if not thousands, of homes.  What measures will he take to ensure a departmental task force is established immediately?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	310	I rise to support my colleague, Deputy Terence Flanagan.  I do not believe the Department has grasped the importance or serious nature of this issue with regard to what is extracted from quarries and what goes into landfill and also into the infill under the foundations of houses.  This is a significant issue affecting up to 30,000 homes.  A working group is required on this issue, a point I ask the Minister to consider.

I addressed this issue in some detail in an Adjournment debate when the matter was raised by Deputy Broughan.  I informed Deputy Broughan that I shared his concern.  I wish to establish as quickly as possible the location of the use of this pyrite and whether it was used in other areas.  It is an important matter but it is not related to this question.

He probably would not give this version if he were not the Minister.The newspapers were reporting on the report of the EPA about this issue.  Both the Minister and I know what goes into black bins and much of this is waste that could be recycled.  In some counties, 93% of the municipal waste is sent to landfill.  The residents do their part by segregating waste where the opportunity is provided to them but the Government, through the local authorities, is paying companies large sums of money to dump waste in landfill.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	316	I was stopped short in my reply to Deputy Tuffy.The black bag and the grey bin are very important.  I believe we can do much better with regard to unsegregated waste by investing in MBT, mechanical biological treatment of waste.  I had the opportunity to visit an excellent MBT plant in Austria.  An MBT plant should be located at every landfill site.  This is low technology rather than high technology.  The waste is sorted and treated and the amount of waste can be substantially reduced.  The most important point is that what goes into the landfill is then inert.  This procedure takes about 12 weeks to allow the waste become inert and for the water content to be sufficiently low to avoid leachate.  All metals can be removed.  The most important factor in order to comply with the landfill directive is to deal with the biological fraction of the waste stream.  That is why it is so important that brown bins be distributed.  The local authorities must do that.  It would make an enormous difference.

There is a problem in two areas.  One is apartment living and the other is with dispersed communities.  We must deal with that issue.  That is the reason I am setting up the review of waste management.  Those two areas must be addressed, and I hope we will find a solution.  However, the key to dealing with waste is having proper MBT facilities.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	319	The provision of affordable housing is a key priority for the Government and is a key element of the "Paths to home ownership" component of the Government's housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities.  Significant progress has been made in increasing delivery under the range of affordable housing mechanisms currently in place, including the shared ownership scheme, the 1999 affordable housing scheme, Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2006 and the affordable housing initiative.  In total, in excess of 3,200 affordable homes were delivered in 2006, an increase of 20% on the previous year.In the National Development Plan 2007-13, the Government has committed to the delivery of 40,000 affordable homes over the seven year period of the plan.  Under the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, a total of 17,000 of these are to be delivered over the three years 2007 to 2009.  My Department is working closely with local authorities and the Affordable Homes Partnership to achieve the significant increases in delivery required to meet these ambitious targets.  While the existing delivery mechanisms will be expected to contribute substantially to achieving the required output, the Affordable Homes Partnership, at my Department's request, has undertaken a study to examine how delivery from these mechanisms can be enhanced and to consider possible additional delivery mechanisms.  I expect to receive the final report from this study shortly.In addition, a low-cost site scheme is in place through which sites can be made available, at discounted prices, primarily to approved applicants on local authority housing lists, where it is considered this is an appropriate mechanism for meeting their accommodation requirements.  Decisions on the making available of sites under this scheme are a matter for individual local authorities.Apart from the various schemes designed to deliver affordable housing, certain ancillary supports are also available to support certain applicants to realise their home ownership aspirations.  Specifically, the mortgage allowance and rent subsidy schemes help lower income households access shared ownership and affordable housing by providing an annual subvention towards the repayment costs.

I wish to focus on the issue of affordable sites.  I made the Minister of State's predecessor aware of a huge difficulty with such sites.  Is this Minister of State aware that there is no basis in law for affordable sites?  This is causing a huge problem with lending institutions, given the issues of security and clawback on the site.  Will the Minister of State give a commitment to address the anomaly in the legislation with regard to affordable sites?  He must ensure the system currently in place for affordable houses is also put in place for affordable sites.  There is huge demand for affordable sites but the legal anomalies, which are not being addressed by the Department, are prohibiting local authorities from making such sites available.

Under the affordable housing initiative, the site subsidy is achieved.  The process is in place.  Under the 1999 affordable housing scheme, a site subsidy can be provided by the Department where necessary.  That subsidy is payable for the Dublin metropolitan area——

People were approved for affordable sites but then encountered the problem mentioned by Deputy Naughten.  It is everybody's ambition to own their own house.  I have put forward an idea in County Meath and there have been responses from builders as well as from the people who want to own a house.  Will the Minister re-examine the current housing situation?  In the counties of Meath, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth there are thousands of houses that cannot be sold.  In one estate, there are 40 such houses and nobody can bid on them.  Ten people per day join the affordable housing scheme in Meath.  Could the Department's officials examine the possibility of matching those people with the houses the builders cannot sell?  These people are only short of the affordable €30,000 site with the grant on it.  This idea would help the building industry.  There are 7,500 empty houses in Meath and 8,000 in Cavan.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	327	Obviously, what happened in 2005 and 2006 was unsustainable.  There was a frenzy, with people afraid they would not get on the property ladder.  They bought property and the amount of finance made available led to price inflation.  That could not be sustained.  From the point of view of people in the market at present, it is time the Construction Industry Federation learned again how to sell.  There will no longer be queues for houses.  There is good value for money in the market for individuals.People talk about interest rates increasing on eight occasions by 0.25%.  The last budget provided mortgage interest relief which equated to three of the ECB interest rate increases.  Stamp duty was removed for first time house purchasers and income tax was reduced.  In the intervening period the affordability of houses has gone from 29.9% to 24%.  There is far greater affordability.  People who are selling houses must realise that they are now in a different market.  They must go out and sell their houses, whether it is to auctioneers or customers, and not wait for the Government.  The Government will act in the interests of the consumer in the next budget through the promise of further mortgage reliefs.

There is a long waiting list for the few affordable houses available.  Local authorities are the housing authorities but they cannot perform their function because there is no land on which to build houses.  The only way of dealing with that is to consider establishing a housing authority.  There is an Affordable Homes Partnership but all it can do, which is causing enormous problems, is approach the owners of large houses who fail to get increased density through a development plan and suggest that they sell their houses for affordable housing, which is a contradiction of the development plan already made by the local authority.  We have total confusion.

This is where the inherent problem lies.  The Department does not take ownership of the primary legislation required in this area.  We have a successful affordable housing scheme which the Minister of State spoke about at length.  We need a legislative support for the same scheme.  My colleague from Meath spoke about what is happening there, in Roscommon and in other counties.  Local authorities can take the initiative but not without the Minister of State's support.

One place mentioned because no effort was made to provide housing there was Dún Laoghaire.  The funny thing is that when the affordable housing partnership made a suggestion for the possibility and delivery of 100 houses, the local authority in that area refused to zone the land.

The report is due to be given to me this week and we can discuss this matter in further detail at a later time.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	341	As I indicated in the reply to Questions Nos. 197 and 198 of 27 September 2007, the non-completion of any development in line with the planning permission for that development is unauthorised development, which is an offence under the Planning Acts.  Enforcement of planning control is a matter for the planning authorities, which have substantial enforcement powers and duties under the Planning Acts.Section 156 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides that a person who is convicted of carrying out unauthorised development or of not complying with an enforcement notice will be liable on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding €12.7 million or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or both.  In the case of a summary conviction, the person will be liable to a fine not exceeding €1,905 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or both.Section 156 also provides for substantial penalties for a person who, having been convicted of unauthorised development, continues the offence.  These are a maximum fine of €12,700 for each day on which the offence is continued or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or both on conviction on indictment, and on summary conviction a fine not exceeding €508 for each day on which the offence is continued or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or both.The substantial powers already given to planning authorities to deal with unauthorised development have been significantly strengthened in the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006.  This effectively reverses the burden of proof in the refusal of planning permission to a developer who has substantially failed to comply with a previous planning permission.  Under the amended provisions the authority may refuse permission in such a case and the developer will have to go to the High Court if he or she wishes to apply to have the decision annulled.  I am satisfied that planning authorities now have substantial powers to compel the completion of housing estates by developers in accordance with the terms of the planning permission.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	342	I thank the Minister for outlining the substantial powers of local authorities.  As the Minister correctly pointed out, these were strengthened under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act.  However, two things are evident, namely, there is no enforcement and local authorities fail to put enough money into the fund to have estates taken in charge.  Does the Minister's experience lead him to agree that the latter is because they do not want to be saddled with the costs of maintenance and other aspects of estates in local authority ownership?  It is not a question of a lack of power but the will of the local authority to take these estates in charge and deal with them.  They are not doing so.  Will the Minister instruct local authorities to take a more proactive approach to taking in charge estates and allocate more resources for this on an annual basis?

#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	355	Prior to the adjournment of this debate I stated my belief that this is a good Bill and I compliment the officials and others who helped put it together during the years since the Costello report in 1990.  It has been a long time in gestation.  I like the Bill, which has broad support from those involved in the sector.  We should use the goodwill of the House to ensure the Bill becomes an excellent Act and that the changes, tweaking and amendments required are fully considered and placed in the legislation.  That is why I strongly recommend to the Minister that when the Bill is on Committee Stage, those involved in the sector, the main organisations and the charity regulation study group which produced an excellent submission on the Bill, be invited to come before the Oireachtas committee to discuss their views and outline their concerns and proposals for change.  Those changes might be considered technical in some instances, in other instances they may be more than technical.  This is not something that is of peripheral concern or a consideration of minor importance because this is a huge sector.  According to the Trinity study last year, the sector, which probably also includes the community and voluntary sector, has a total economic value of €2,500 million.  That is an enormous sum of money.  It is estimated that more than 60,000 people work in the area as employees, professionals, semi-professionals, volunteers and part-time workers.  Given that it is a huge sector it is important that we get it right.  What is significant is that those involved at the coalface are unanimous in seeking change and want to see a good Bill in place.  They are actively working and encouraging all of us with an interest in the area to ensure the legislation is brought to a successful conclusion.According to the Revenue Commissioners, last month the total number of charitable bodies registered for tax exemption was 7,211.  This figure has increased from 5,800 in four years.  Therefore, it is a growth area.  Some 80% of these charities have a spend of less than a couple of hundred thousand euro and have to be taken into account.  Any regulatory framework has to keep an eye on smaller charities without stifling them.A good point was made by the Minister of State on the changing nature of fund-raising.  In the old days there were raffles, quizzes, garden fetes and so on but this has changed over the years.  The changes that have already taken place include more sponsored events, legacies, telethons, direct debits and the development of the philanthropy sector which is getting bigger by the year.  Fortunately as wealth increases I encourage this trend.  There are the university foundations and much of the funding for the third level sector comes from what would be technically a charitable source.  From that point of view, it is important that the regulatory framework is flexible.In many jurisdictions, attempts have been made to provide proportionate and appropriate regulation for fund-raising.  Many of those attempts have failed because they have been overly bureaucratic and too specific.  What is needed is a balance between an element of self-regulation, good codes of practice, and a good regulatory framework, that is flexible enough to allow for changes and new developments.  There is need for a decent input from the Oireachtas to help achieve that outcome.Looking at the specific points raised I do not intend to go through the submission from the study group.  The Minister of State is already aware of it and his officials will have studied it.  All I ask is that consideration is given to what appear to me to be legitimate points of concern.  That is the reason I would like to see these people come before the Oireachtas committee with a view to teasing out those points.  If there are responses from officialdom, lets us hear them and let us all work together to ensure a worthwhile outcome.There has been no adequate explanation as to why the promotion of human rights has been excluded but, apparently, it was included in the original draft.  Given what happened in Rangoon the week before last, if a group was raising money to help the human rights situation in Burma or in Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe, where people were similarly treated, it should be regarded as a worthy objective that would be approved in every way possible, particularly in light of the weak and rather lily-livered response of the West to the regimes that treat their people so disgracefully in both those countries.  That issue needs to be teased out fully.While all types of fundraising should require permits we should look again at how this issue is controlled.  The detail and the practical application need to be worked out.  The best system is probably through the regulator, the Garda and the sector.  Given the way it is shaping up, it appears the Garda will have to process a much greater number of applications and notifications every day.  As one who had a substantial interest in the work of the Garda Síochána during the past three years and an appreciation of what it was doing, we want the force to be more involved with core duties.  Dealing with applications of this kind would not be regarded as core duties.  My idea would be to lighten the workload as much as possible.  If we are inviting people to come before the Oireachtas committee, I would also like to hear the views of the Garda Commissioner and his officials who look after this area.  The fact that there are 28 different Garda divisions, all of which operate autonomously, needs to be dealt with.The intention is to ensure uniform regulation of public collections.  It has been mentioned to me that the application for a 12-month conditional non-cash permit, followed by notification to the Garda of an intention to exercise the permit and a requirement for further permission, will cause quite a number of problems.  The practical application of that approach needs to be teased out.  A possible solution is to set up a consultative panel, as provided for in the Bill, to work out the practical issues and not to try to lay down the specifics of every activity in legislation.There are a couple of issues about which I am concerned.  I endorse the comments of my colleague, Deputy Ring, in regard to fees.  I do not want the sector to have to pay fees out of moneys collected from a generous public to underpin a regulatory bureaucracy.  That would be going against the goodwill of people who support charities.  There is a provision in the Bill for dealing with this issue but there has been no clear explanation of how it will be implemented.  When replying, perhaps the Minister of State will give an indication of what he has in mind.There is another issue of concern to those who do not want over-interference from the Government.  Deputy Ring raised the issue of responsibility to the House.  I am in broad agreement with him in regard to the responsibility of Ministers to the Oireachtas.  On the other hand, if this is to be an independent authority, we have to look at section 14 which gives the Minister the entitlement to give written directions to the authority requiring it to comply with Government policies.  That is an issue I want teased out.Section 13 specifically states that the authority "shall be independent in the performance of its functions".  How can it be independent in the performance of its functions while at the same time being subject to compliance with Government directions?  This among many other issues needs to be teased out.I wish to refer to an island-wide approach.  Northern Ireland has new draft regulations and in the new era of North-South relations we should consider what is being done.  There may be a facility, perhaps through one of the new structures being established, to discuss the question of a common North-South approach.  At a minimum we should not ignore the draft Northern Ireland charities order of 2007.Let us work on making this landmark legislation.  Let us make sure that everybody is on board.  Let us have further consultation on it.  With a continued input of that nature from all sides we will end up with very good legislation indeed.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	356	I welcome this important and necessary legislation.  That it has taken so long to come before the House means that a dedicated staff put the Bill together and the two Ministers of State involved, Deputies Noel Ahern and Pat Carey, took care and attention to ensure that representatives of all charitable organisations had an opportunity to make submissions, which were considered when drafting the legislation.  Obviously not everyone is satisfied; it is never possible to achieve that.  However, I am sure that consideration could be given to Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's proposal to invite some of the groups to appear before the committee before the later Stages of the Bill.  With the present state of the committees I am not sure whether it is possible.  It might represent a new way to consider legislation in terms of combining all our assets.  We need all the possible assets for a Bill of this magnitude, which will play a major part in everybody's lives.We want the Bill to go through the House as quickly as possible and want to help in every way to ensure it is feasible.  Obviously the interesting interpretation of the Bill by the various charitable groups has led to a considerable amount of representations.  While it is the intention of us all to have the Bill brought to fruition as soon as possible we must also be very careful that all the concerns of the various interested bodies are investigated and determined.  Irish people are world renowned for their generosity, which can be noted on an almost daily basis by groups or families nationally or internationally expressing their thanks to the Irish people for the generosity that has helped them to alleviate a big or small tragedy that affected their loved ones or themselves.  Many tragic circumstances ranging from earthquakes, flooding, tsunamis right down to a house fire, which can be such a tragedy for a family, have seen the Irish people play their part.  As Deputy Jim O'Keeffe has said, a Trinity College research document has estimated the value of such generosity at €500 million for fundraising in Ireland, which is an unbelievable figure, with the voluntary sector in general generating €2.5 billion.  One can clearly see that we all agree to having the transparency provisions of the Bill approved and introduced as soon as possible.Charity affects everyone in this great country of ours and can be broken down into three different sectors — the donors, the employees in the sector and the recipients.  In too many instances recipients depend on the work of charitable organisations to have a better standard of living when the Government of the day has fallen down in its commitments to those less well off than we are.  A case in point is the wonderful work being carried out by the Women's Aid group, which provides a service to women who are battered, beaten and in many cases sexually assaulted by husbands, family members, loved ones etc., yet the phone service the organisation provided was under-funded by the Department of Health and Children and the HSE such that two of every five calls went unanswered.  This terrible tragedy that a woman in her darkest hour of torment could not access a friendly voice went on for more than three years before the HSE provided a paltry €70,000 to meet the cost of a telephone staff that could meet the demand.I highlight this example to show that many of these groups would do far better by working with the people for whom the funds are raised rather than running raffles or roulette tables and standing on street corners, etc.  In those instances the Government must consider providing funding.  The cake can only be divided out so much.  If, in cases where funding should be provided by the Government, money is being taken out of the cake by those trying to provide a service it means that other people will obviously lose out.This is only one of many cases that, sadly, we could mention where the Government has fallen down in its commitments to groups which end up dependent on the work of a charity to have a decent standard of living or integration into normal society which so many individuals and families crave.  The field workers or employees at the coalface are the flag-bearers of many charities that in many instances operate without Government funding.  This wonderful work that in so many cases is voluntary without personal gain raises one the often-asked questions of the effectiveness of charities to provide a service considering the administration costs vis-à-vis the value of what is happening at the coalface.We must ensure that these wonderful people, whom we see every day in so many segments of society, some of them unknown in the amount of work they do including organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and others, are not undermined by a lack of transparency regarding the financial transactions or workings of the charity in which they are involved.  The legislation should ensure that their positions are verified now that such organisations will be required to prepare accounts and be registered thereby ensuring that the ordinary person on the street can see that the money he or she gave was used effectively.Among the representations we have received, representatives of The Wheel have been very vocal and persuasive.  Its director of advocacy, Ivan Cooper, has done a considerable amount in helping us to make this case today and on Committee Stage.  Representatives of The Wheel asked one very important question on how we would handle spontaneous community fundraising, for example, in cases of a house fire, a personal family tragedy or a major tragedy in a particular area.  Having searched the Bill I do not see any provision for such funding.  While we will obviously review the matter on Committee Stage, I would like the Minister of State to indicate how it will be handled.  I do not know whether such spontaneous fundraising happens in the cities, but we certainly have it in rural Ireland.  I do not say this against the previous Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Noel Ahern, but the current Minister of State has the best of both worlds.  As he has a background in a rural community and now represents a densely populated part of the city, he knows what I am talking about.  He knows that spontaneity must not be dented by the legislation.  Amendments must be made to ensure transparency while ensuring the spontaneity associated with community involvement is not affected.The Bill sets out to address the many concerns expressed over the years by the public who are very concerned about the effectiveness of the many millions of euro they donate to thousands of charities in the State and who wonder about this.  For example, The Wheel states it has 760 charities on its books.  The legislation could cause major problems for these charities when it is enacted.  Deputy Ring is correct that charities should not have to bear a cost as a result of the legislation.  I cannot figure out how the departmental officials who drafted the Bill concluded that charities must make payments.  The word "charity" implies giving to those to whom an organisation's focus is directed.  A charity should not have to give to the State.  I cannot understand how a charity can be expected to maintain its operations while complying with the legislation.For example, under one of the Bill's provisions, if a charity does not provide its accounts up front and has to hire an external auditor to examine its books, it will have to pay the auditor's fees.  While legislation is required, we must not lose sight of a central issue — the charities that are run in many instances on a voluntary basis by people who perform above and beyond the call of duty to provide for the less well-off.  We must never deviate from that.  I have known the Minister of State for a long time and I hope he will examine this provision so that a scenario will not emerge where money will be taken from a charity by the Exchequer when it could be used for the benefit of those for whom it was collected.  The moneys raised by charities are donated for the specific purposes with which the charities are identified and not to be given to the Exchequer.  I hope that a major initiative will be taken by the Minister of State to overhaul this provision, which will be discussed again on Committee Stage.We have received many submissions and the Minister of State referred to the advocacy issue raised by Barnardos.  That organisation considers this a problem because it would affect fundraising and so on.  However, did the Minister of State say the provision will not be included in the legislation?
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	357	I will come back with a variety of responses.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	358	The Wheel also highlighted this issue and given that it represents 750 charities, this is a cause of major concern.  The Wheel believes that the statutory organisation should remain entitled to seek inclusion in the proposed register.  The Wheel is of the view that there is a need to protect the identity and independence of charities so that they are not all encompassed by the legislation.I refer to the Minister of State's contribution and his comments on costings resulting from the legislation.  The issue also arises in the context of the taxation of small charities.  I am involved in a small voluntary organisation in Castlemitchell, Athy, but because it is a limited company, we must submit accounts.  The company is run by an entirely voluntary group of directors and we try to attract small businesses to an old school that was given to the community.  An annual profit of approximately €3,500 is made but the auditor's fee for doing the accounts is similar and nullifies what we gain.A mechanism should be provided so that the accounts of smaller charities, in particular, could be verified in a way that will not result in a major cost to them.  If that happened, the legislation, which everybody agrees should be implemented, would be more humane.  The Jewell report also highlighted this issue.  Volunteers who run small charities, especially those in receipt of low levels of funding, say this proposal will increase their workload.  At a time when many volunteers are leaving such organisations, I wonders whether this proposed strict regime will further inhibit people from volunteering for charities and other organisations to the detriment of both rural and urban communities.  It is great to make provision in legislation to ensure accounts are submitted and audited so that everything is transparent.  However, if a number of charities cease to exist because people are no longer willing to volunteer and put their shoulders to the wheel to ensure the success of such organisations as a result of the red tape involved, it will be to the detriment of our society as we go forward.This intricate Bill raises many other issues and we will table many amendments on Committee and Report Stages.  Everybody wants it implemented and I hope we have a good, honest debate on Committee Stage.  I also hope the Minister of State will give a good hearing to the issues we have raised on this Stage and that he will accept a number of our amendments.When the Ceann Comhairle served as Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, he introduced a Bill relating to the Red Cross.  He proposed the establishment of an authority to oversee the Red Cross and I asked him to ensure the authority would be answerable to the House.  He took that on board and said he would include a provision ensuring the authority would have to answer questions posed by Members of this House.  Too many authorities have been established under various Acts which are not answerable to the Oireachtas.  When I raised this issue with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in the context of the authority overseeing the inland waterways at a committee meeting during the previous Dáil, he stated that even though a provision was not included in legislation to insist the body replied to questions from Oireachtas Members, he always insisted that a written reply should be given to Deputies who tabled parliamentary questions.All we seek is a secure mechanism whereby written replies will be provided to Deputies.  The Ceann Comhairle, who was then the Minister responsible, included a provision in a Bill relating to the Red Cross to ensure this would happen.  It is important, especially for Opposition spokespersons, that such a facility is in place.  One can be asked a question by a constituent at any time where the only means of obtaining the answer is through a parliamentary question.I look forward to Committee Stage of this Bill.  My colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, is particularly interested in aspects of the Bill, as are other Labour Party colleagues.  We will be positive in our contributions and will help in every way in ensuring this important legislation goes through the House as quickly as possible.

I wish him well in his term.I am grateful for the opportunity to address the House on this important Bill.  The updating of regulations relating to the diverse charities sector will create a framework for both national and local organisations involved in all areas of social, economic and civic life in the State.  Without such organisations, there would be a significant additional cost burden on the Exchequer.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, and his predecessor, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, for bringing this Bill forward.There are more than 19,000 community and voluntary organisations sustaining our civil society.  These bodies require support as well as regulation.  With two thirds of Irish adults — or more than 2 million people — engaging annually in the social, cultural and humanitarian activities offered by our community and voluntary sector, it is no surprise that the sector contributes more than €2.5 billion to the economy each year and employs more than 63,000 full-time and part-time staff.  In south Tipperary, I have been involved with many voluntary organisations such as voluntary housing schemes, community alert projects, the Ring a Link rural transport scheme, voluntary naoinraí and other child care projects, community employment schemes and many others.  I pay tribute to all these organisations, many of which rely on volunteers.I am conscious that many Deputies are or were previously involved in community and voluntary organisations throughout the State which operated with the benefit of charitable status conferred by the Revenue Commissioners.  This status has afforded several financial benefits to organisations with specific defined charitable objectives.  All these organisations enrich the life of local communities and frequently are established by forward looking volunteers where a need is identified by local people that has been neglected by the public sector.Under this legislation, charitable status will be dependent on an organisation having charitable purposes only and being for the public benefit rather than having any particular legal form.  Charitable purposes will be fully defined for the purposes of the law for the first time in primary legislation.  They encompass the prevention or poverty or relief of poverty or economic hardship; advancement of education; advancement of religion; and any other purpose that is of benefit to the community.Included in the latter category are the advancement of community welfare, including the relief of those in need by reason of youth, age, ill health or disability; advancement of community development, including rural or urban regeneration; promotion of civic responsibility or voluntary work in the community; promotion of health, including the prevention or sickness or relief of sickness, disease or human suffering; advancement of conflict resolution or reconciliation; promotion of religious or racial harmony and harmonious community relations; protection of the natural environment; prevention of suffering or relief of suffering of animals; advancement of the arts, culture, heritage or sciences; and the integration of those who are disadvantaged and the promotion of their full participation in society.The community and voluntary sector is estimated provide more than €2 billion to the economy, with more than 60,000 full and part-time staff and tens of thousands of volunteers, many of whom have distinct legal responsibilities in governing their organisations.  There was previously an ad hoc approach to different aspects of the work of charities.  It is important that this Bill will consolidate all these different aspects into one framework.  Society is changing and this should be reflected in how the State defines what charities are and how they are supported and regulated.  Much of the public discourse will be about ensuring fundraising aspects of charities are properly controlled, including eliminating financial improprieties and fraud.We must be careful to support rather than discourage spontaneous community fundraising.  There is uncertainty in terms of the implications of the Bill for people who organise or take part in spontaneous community fundraising in response to disasters, such as the tsunami crisis.  The Bill must clearly set out the registration exemptions that will apply in regard to permits in the case of exceptional, once-off community responses to urgent need.  If this is not done, there may be uncertainty around people's willingness to organise such responses for fear of falling foul of the law.  This would be a terrible additional consequence for those already affected by a tragedy.In Britain, the Charities Act 2006, which includes exemptions for local, short-term collections, could provide a model in this regard.  The relevant provisions in this legislation could be adapted to recognise the Garda as the relevant authority rather than the local authority as is the case in Britain.  Under this Act, a public charitable collection is exempt from registration requirements if it is a local, short-term collection, the promoters notify the local authority in whose area it is to be conducted within a certain timeframe of particulars relating to the collection, the appeal is local in character and the duration of the appeal does not exceed the prescribed period of time.The Bill we are discussing today should also be about enabling charities to work in an environment without unnecessary bureaucracy.  The provisions of the Bill should act as a help and not a hindrance to the broad range of work that only charities can undertake, which can involve public, private and voluntary resources.  I agree with my colleagues that no expense should be incurred by a charitable organisation under these new provisions other than perhaps a nominal fee for registration.We must protect the identity and independence of charities by ensuring that State agencies are not included in the register of charities.  Otherwise, there will be confusion in the public mind about the status of charities versus State agencies.  Charities are independent organisations established by members of the public in response to an identified need, the response being recognised as being for a charitable purpose and for the public benefit.  In the world of charities, it is the independence of the board and the way it is elected by volunteers that is important.  Charitable activity should be independent of State direction or control, yet there are many State bodies, such as the HSE, on the list of charities operated by the Revenue Commissioners.To avoid any confusion in the mind of the public between what is a charity and what is a statutory agency, State-owned or controlled entities should not be included in the register of charities.  Public bodies or organisations, the constitutions of which contain clauses that confer on Ministers powers to control appointments to their boards, should be excluded.  It is recognised, however, that State agencies that are included in the Revenue Commissioners' list of organisations eligible for charitable tax exemptions, such as the HSE, should continue to be eligible for relevant tax exemptions.  Perhaps a special tax exemption could be created for such bodies or agencies so they would not be required to seek inclusion in the register of charities to continue benefiting from these tax exemptions.On the definition of charities and charitable activities, I agree that the purpose should pertain to activities of benefit to the community.  I propose to the Minister to extend the range of activities in section 3(8) to include and explicitly mention the provision of social housing for disadvantaged groups.  A similar reform in the UK looks to establish a charities framework with social housing included as a charitable activity.There are over 500 voluntary housing associations in Ireland providing social housing approved by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  They provide up 20,000 homes for low-income families, the homeless, older people and people with disabilities.  Housing associations now provide up to 30% of all new social housing and in the recent national agreement, Towards 2016, the Government has agreed that housing associations would provide 6,000 new homes between 2007 and 2009.  Therefore housing associations are a significant part of the community and voluntary sector, with over €300 million in turnover from capital and revenue sources this year.The provision of social housing from approved bodies in the voluntary and co-operative housing sector is a significant charitable activity in Ireland.  Currently, voluntary housing associations work on a charitable level and must have approved status from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.

#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	364	I begin by congratulating the Minister of State on his recent appointment to the Department.  I congratulate him also on the presentation of this Charities Bill to the Dáil early in its lifetime.  I look forward to working with the Minister of State in the months and years ahead.The is an important Bill which the Green Party broadly supports.  It is long overdue and contains many features which both the Green Party and the voluntary sector have been calling for for a long time.  As a party which has championed the causes of the voluntary sector and been highly supportive of its role in the social partnership process, we are pleased the sector is broadly supportive of this Bill.I welcome the proposed establishment of a new regulatory authority for charities and the proposed creation of a register of charities for the first time.  The outlining of what legitimises a charitable cause's status is vital and it will, in addition to a regulatory authority and charity appeals tribunal, go a long way in ensuring Ireland remains free of fraudulent charities.  It will also ensure transparency and public accountability from the voluntary sector.Several other aspects of the Bill are vital.  The transferring of functions of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland to the new regulatory authority will make for sensible streamlining of the oversight of charities and advocacy groups, and the role envisaged for a clear consultative process between the new authority and stakeholders in the sector will do much to ensure good relations between the State, community and voluntary groups.There are, however, several aspects of this Bill which remain problematic and I look forward to working with the Minister to ensure that concerns with the legislation will be addressed as it passes through the legislative processes in the House.  The wording of the exclusion of organisations whose purpose is to advance a political cause causes a problem.  I accept the motive behind the wording may have been well intentioned but it is problematic for the clause excluding political groupings to include the word political "cause".  Many political causes taken up by charities have the sole aim of advancing such issues as human rights, civic participation or social justice.  These are ideals we all espouse in this House and the wording of this exclusion potentially endangers their inclusion.Linked with this issue are the omissions in section 3 of the Bill, which were contained in the heads of the Bill in April 2006.  Among the purposes spoken about by others that are of benefit to the community and were listed in theheads of Bill were the advancement of human rights, social inclusion and social justice, citizenship and the effectiveness and efficiency of charities.The Green Party shares the concerns of the voluntary sector that by not including these purposes in the legislation, it might diminish the standing it has in the eyes of the State and possibly result in the unintended exclusion of such organisations from the register, particularly vis-à-vis other purposes that are of benefit, and in turn public thinking.  The advancement of human rights, social inclusion and social justice are pursuits worthy of equal recognition to those listed in the relevant section.Several other aspects of the Bill must also be examined in forthcoming Stages because of the danger that the Bill, as it stands, may produce a bureaucratic culture in the area of charity management.  This in turn will run the risk of discouraging people from engaging in voluntary activities aimed at helping the community.The uncertainty surrounding the Bill's implications for spontaneous community fundraising must also be addressed.  People have spoken of the Asian tsunami some years back, which led to people spontaneously fundraising.  In Kilkenny, one of my constituents underwent multiple transplant operations and the people there responded in extraordinary style to fundraise for her.The issue of the regulatory authority's role in terms of facilitation alone or facilitation and supporting better administration, and the question of a graded approach to the annual reports and accounts — which charities will need to submit — must be examined.  It is important that what charities must do to comply is completely clear.  It is also vital that the Government recognises the need to consult charities and the voluntary sector if it is to bring them along in the journey towards greater accountability and transparency.  I have no doubt this will happen.The issue of the regulator being Exchequer-funded or partially funded by charities and community and voluntary organisations must also be addressed.  If we are going to establish a regulatory authority to monitor charities and voluntary groups we cannot ask such groups to pay for monitoring.  Another potential pitfall which must be examined is the matter of dual reporting by charities to the Companies Registration Office and to the charities regulator.  The explanatory memorandum of the Bill states that dual reporting is being examined in consultation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Companies Registration Office.  We await progress on this issue of minimising the burden of dual reporting in due course.The issue of fundraising permits and the active monitoring of organisations' and persons' use of them, particularly in terms of other groups being unable to run charity events because of dormant permit holders, may require attention in a future Bill.  I recognise it is a complicated matter but it is another issue where we must work hard to ensure the act of doing good for a community and the public is not stifled by a lack of imagination from lawmakers and enforcers.The issue of providing special legal structures for charities may also have to wait for another legislative day but the occasion of the Charities Bill's Second Reading provides us with a reminder that the legal constraints facing charities must be legislated for.  I am sure the Minister will agree it is important for the voluntary nature of the work of charities to be recognised in the Bill by making a clear distinction between statutory charities and voluntary sector charities.Why must these technicalities be addressed?  Greater accountability and transparency must not cause paper mills and bureaucratic headaches in every parish hall or sports club throughout the country.  When legislation similar to this was passed in England, a decline in the level of voluntary activity was observed.  We have strong levels of voluntary participation in Ireland and they are the lifeblood of our communities.Ireland has long been recognised as a generous, energetic fundraising nation.  In Carlow last week, a volunteering day for the local community was superbly attended by charities and voluntary fundraising groups.  Voluntary, charity and advocacy groups must not be overburdened by reports, accounts, procedures and codes.I welcome the Second Reading of the Charities Bill, which will ensure greater accountability and enhanced public trust in charities and community or voluntary organisations.  I look forward to working with the Minister in the coming months to resolve issues of concern in a positive and constructive manner.  As Edmund Burke once stated, stubborn resistance to innovation impedes progress.  This is an innovative Bill and it represents progress.

Ireland is unique within the European Union in that it does not have a charities register.  There is no legal obligation on organisations not registered as companies to publish their accounts.  I have had experience of people who masqueraded as bona fide charities and I agree that, in general, reform is necessary.  I support the reforming measures in the Bill.Where I may depart from my colleagues on this issue is in respect of the establishment of a new authority.  Why do we assume that matters would improve purely on the basis of the setting up of such an authority?  Why can we not equally assume that the Government has not been reforming in this area and simply has not done its job?  I am not convinced that a new authority is necessary.Reform is overdue, as are the specific reforming measures contained in the legislation.  On many occasions, however, we seem to view reform almost as a reason for making government bigger.  In my opinion, the act of creating an authority and a tribunal to accompany it is not, by its nature, reform, nor are developments of this nature always the solution.  I understand that if the legislation is passed, the Minister could, under statutory regulation, make policy in respect of charities.  Whenever a problem arises, in some instances the accepted response does not necessarily deal with the issues at hand, nor does it make government leaner, more streamlined or more efficient.  On foot of the fact that Ireland is a rich country and, by extension, has a rich Government, we tend to create new bodies or authorities or new managerial levels within organisations.  It emerged earlier today that in the HSE there is one manager for every six employees.I am not convinced that this reforming measure can be dealt with by the Department sponsoring this Bill.  When the legislation was first announced, the justification put forward in respect of the proposed authority was that no central body exists.  That does not necessarily mean that we should automatically have an authority or a regulator.  The explanatory memorandum to the Bill refers to an annual budget of €4 million being set aside.  The Minister of State did not indicate how this money would be provided.  He referred to different jurisdictions but did not identify any of them or outline any of the foreign models the Department has examined.  He also referred to people working in the Department who are dealing with charity-related issues.  There are obviously many individuals in the Department who have a great deal of experience in dealing with such matters.The explanatory memorandum to the Bill states that the "issue will be subject of further discussions with the Department of Finance at the appropriate time".  This is a problematic and vague statement.  It is similar to constructing something and then figuring out the cost after the fact.My interest was peaked when the Bill was published as a result of the comments made by the senior Minister at the Department, Deputy Ó Cuív, not two or five years ago or when he was a county councillor, but last week, in respect of the HSE.  Many Deputies might agree with him, particularly in light of their day-to-day dealings with the HSE.  The Minister stated: "I've always been sceptical of the model that divorces the running of all these agencies from Government control."  Now, however, his Department is putting forward an item of legislation that proposes the creation of a new agency.  Obviously the Minister is not that sceptical of the model because we are engaging with it today.  It is one thing to be outvoted or outnumbered in Cabinet in respect of a particular issue.  In fairness, the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, never held the post of Minister for Health and Children.  However, he is the line Minister responsible for dealing with this matter.  One cannot have it both ways and it was abject hypocrisy for him to make a statement such as that which he issued last week and then set about creating a new agency this week.Why could the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, not deal with this matter?  He has experience of charitable issues and why could he not deal with it within the Department.  The Minister of State has not provided an answer in this regard but he must do so.  He must also make it clear why his Department should not continue to deal with charitable issues rather than transferring responsibility for them to a new agency which will cost the Exchequer €4 million and which will ultimately cost charities a great deal of money because they will be taxed.  The establishment of agencies of this nature always leads to people and organisations being taxed.Let us be clear what the legislation does, particularly in the context of what the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, stated.  The Bill provides for the transfer of all jurisdictions issued in the Attorney General, by statute or common law, in respect of charities.  The authority's powers will be quite extensive and harsh.  It will, for example:. . . have the power to institute investigations; to call for documents and search records; to enter premises on foot of a search warrant; to impose sanctions, including intermediate sanctions; and to co-operate on an administrative basis with foreign statutory bodies on law enforcement matters. There will also be significant penalties in place for offences under the legislation.When I first read this, I thought I was looking at the terms of reference of the FBI.  However, when I re-examined it, I realised that the latter does not have unilateral power to impose sanctions.  There is, therefore, a difference of sorts.The Law Reform Commission issued a report on this matter in December 2005.  The Minister of State indicated that the report was issued last year.  That is not the case; it was published well over 18 months ago.  I am aware of this because I read it on the Internet last night.  The Law Reform Commission recommended the introduction of a new form of legal structure for charities.  It did not make any definite recommendation in respect of a regulator or a new authority.  The Minister of State glossed over those facts.  His Department has had a great deal of time to peruse the 55-page report the Law Reform Commission compiled.  That report contains some quite detailed recommendations and suggestions.  For example, it suggested an entirely different legal framework when it comes to charities.  A number of reports relating to this matter have been issued in the past 16 years and the Minister of State must explain why the Law Reform Commission's recommendations were not taken into account before the legislation was drafted.I welcome the reform elements of the legislation, which are long overdue.  Many charities have been the subject of fraud.  As already stated, we are making government bigger and when one takes that route, one must consider the necessity of what one is doing and the cost implications to the Exchequer.  It may be a bad example — most Deputies will understand from where I am coming in respect of it — but I was elected seven or eight years ago and I have seen government replicate and grow inordinately.  Even if one contacts a local authority engineer these days, the chances are that the project about which one is inquiring has been contracted out to a consultancy firm and is not being done in-house.  Government continues to grow and, in many cases, there is no good reason for this.We need to ask ourselves whether outsourcing government work or creating new bodies necessarily makes government better.  The Minister of State should provide a clear explanation as to why it is absolutely necessary to create a stand-alone authority such as that envisaged.  It was interesting to hear other Deputies almost pleading with the Minister of State to have replies issued to them when the new authority is established.  When we table questions relating to charitable organisations or charity in general in the future, the position is unclear as to whether we will receive replies.  We should not be doing this.  The Minister of State must explain why responsibility for this matter is being outsourced from the Government.  It is not as simple as introducing legislation and creating a new authority.  The Government has neglected this area and failed badly in respect of it for a long period.  The Minister of State knows it is not as simple as that.  He must explain why he, as Minister of State with jurisdiction over charitable issues, cannot do it within his own Department with his own staff and within his own budget.Deputy Jim O'Keeffe raised an interesting point when he discussed one section where the authority is described as independent and another section which states that the authority is subject to ministerial or Government direction.  The Minister of State must explain that because there is a real contradiction in respect of those two sections.I am glad my party has refrained from giving an absolute decision on this Bill.  We all welcome the reform measures within it.  However, before any support is given unconditionally to this Bill, the Minister of State must explain why he could not deal with this within his own Department with his own staff and budgets and why we continue to put these new authorities together.  It does not necessarily mean that Government will get better.  Sometimes it just means it will get bigger.

If somebody has to be in government, I am delighted that he is one of those people because he has shown commitment as an ordinary backbencher and chairperson of an Oireachtas committee.I welcome the purpose of this Bill, which is to enact a reform of the law relating to charities to ensure accountability and to protect against abuse of charitable status and fraud.  Some of the key aspects of this Bill provide for a definition of charitable purpose for the first time in primary legislation.  I welcome this development and I also welcome a register of charities, with which all charities operating in this State must register.  I welcome updating the law relating to fundraising, particularly in respect of collections by way of direct debits and similar non-cash methods.However, I do not welcome the creation of another quango, which was noted by my colleague, Deputy Deasy.  I am appalled that we seem to have lost faith in the Civil Service.  We have a very good Civil Service which, down through the years, accounted very well for every penny spent belonging to the public, which served successive Governments, irrespective of colour, and which answered questions in Parliament.People tell me they are shocked when they switch on their televisions to see an empty Chamber with nobody able to answer questions on certain issues.  Is it any wonder when every day of the week, we are handing away more and more power to unelected people?  Since I returned to the Dáil, not a day has passed but some issue is raised about the HSE.  It is stated that the HSE is doing this and that and when one asks a parliamentary question, one gets a nice letter back from the Minister telling one that she has no responsibility for it but will pass it on to the HSE.  The people did not elect the HSE, they elected the Minister and me, and they want answers.Every day we pass on responsibility to quangos, which is another nail in the coffin of democracy.  These are people who have been appointed and have had strong powers vested in them but who never have to answer to anybody.  I tabled a parliamentary question for written answer yesterday about how many civil servants were currently in the Department of Health and Children and I received a reply which stated that there are 592.92 whole-time staff employed in that Department.  I have yet to find out who the poor unfortunate referred to as ".92" is but that is another day's work.  What are 593 civil servants in the Department of Health and Children doing when everything has been handed over to the HSE?  Yesterday, we were told that there is one manager for every six employees in the HSE.This is about charities and volunteers who are mainly going out and collecting money but, most of all, it is about the public putting its hands in its pockets to support whatever cause it fancies or feels it should support.  When the public gives its money, it wants to be guaranteed that this money goes to that particular cause.  It does not want to be told that 25% of the money is going to this new regulatory authority to keep this new bureaucracy going.  It wants to see the money going to the causes it supports.  It does not want any more of this stuff.I have every confidence in the ability of the Minister of State and the officials over there in the pen advising him to carry out the functions of this legislation, which I support.  There is no need for this stuff.  If we must transfer some officials or civil servants from the Department of Health and Children who are no longer required because of the HSE to the Minister of State's Department, that is fine.

What we are doing here is crazy.  It would be far better to give the money the Minister of State is spending on setting up this regulatory authority to charities and let the Minister of State, the civil servants beside him and others in his Department deal with this issue.I am a member of the Lions Club, which organises a Christmas collection for hampers.  The response outside supermarkets is enormous when we ask people to put food into the basket.  The reason for this is that people see that they are giving a tin of beans or peas which is going to some unfortunate family to make Christmas a little better.  Ask them to give money and they will have doubts about it.  Ask them to give money where charities are subject to this nonsense and they will become sceptical.  I do not think this is good for the voluntary sector.We are then told that charities must produce audited accounts and keep records.  Maybe that is necessary to some extent but must the Lions Club of which I am a member keep accounts and have them audited?  Will we be able to carry out our annual collection?  All this seems to be going beyond what is really necessary.What we should be doing in this country is reviewing all the quangos we have to see whether we can bring as much as possible back into the Civil Service, get real value for money and let people come in here and answer questions.  I do not want to be writing to the chief executive of this new authority to find out about something when it is easier to table a parliamentary question, knowing that the Minister responsible is keeping an eye on what is happening.  We are told in various sections about a chief executive and his or her powers, including his or her power to employ people, the transfer of people from other agencies and a superannuation scheme, all this nonsense.I am sincere about this and am not making any political points because this is serious legislation.  By all means, let us have a register and proper accounting, and see that people can be assured that when they give money, it will go towards the right purpose, but let us not fall back into setting up another authority every time there is a problem.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	373	I thank the Minister of State for introducing this legislation and praise him and his predecessor, Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, who put in a considerable amount of work on the matter for a long time, for their diligence in this area.While the Bill is necessary on many fronts, I share some of the concerns raised by Opposition Members about the number of regulatory bodies to be established.  There will be a charities regulatory authority and charity appeals tribunal.  I note from the copy of the Minister's speech circulated in the Chamber that they are all spelled with capital letters.  I am always doubtful when I see bodies spelled with capital letters.  I take it they must be taken very seriously.  The charity appeals tribunal, which will be similar to the Small Claims Court, of which I approve, means an appeal can be quickly heard.  However, there is a further stream of capitalised terms in the speech such as the "Agreed Codes of Good Practice".This is fine and dandy and needed to be introduced into legislation.  There is no doubt that the charities sector, through no fault of the groups responsible for collecting, has run into some disrepute.  Whenever I encounter a charity collector outside my local Dunnes Stores on a Friday morning, I always ask to see his or her identification.  Some collectors are affronted and others are not.  While I am sure it is for a good cause, there are cases where one does not know.  Some collectors take up a position at the door to the shop, making it difficult and somewhat intimidatory when one is pushing a trolley.  I do not know if such encounters are covered by the Bill but I hope when the Minister of State replies he will address this point.I am glad the Minister of State is not increasing bureaucracy in the charities sector, an option which is exercising the Opposition.  Too much bureaucracy is not a good thing, something I would like to see in capital letters.  The over-bureaucratisation of an activity such as charity collections would be incorrect.Ireland has a great level of voluntary activity.  In Athlone, we recently established a hospice group, for which the level of support is enormous.  I hope the group, however, will not be caught up in form-filling and attending the regulatory authority.  A bureaucratic aspect will make it uncomfortable for some groups.  The Irish people have a strong generous streak.  After the Asian tsunami on St. Stephen's Day 2004, all Members will recall the swift manner in which people responded.  Being an island nation, the idea of such a ferocious flood may explain part of our generous response.Political parties have been excluded from the Bill, which is correct.  The Fine Gael and Labour parties will empathise with the tradition of church gate collections.  Each party has a specified Sunday, a licence is granted by the Garda and a party will have its collection.  I recall these collections since I was knee-high to a grasshopper.  Is the Minister of State aware that some bishops are objecting to collections for political parties outside their church gates?  I can understand their objections if the collection is on church grounds, as it is their property.  However, if it is on the footpath outside the church, it is not the bishops' but public property.  The collectors, with their tables and posters, are therefore fully entitled to be there.  Will the Minister of State address this at the conclusion of Second Stage?My nearest bishopric, much of which covers my constituency, was recently rapped by a well-known bishop on this matter.  While he was not convinced all charities should not be collecting, he was not impressed by the presence of political parties outside his churches.

At the time, the Catholic church was very involved in politics, something I am not on for at all — we have enough trouble as it is without that involvement.  The O'Connell collection was the first step on the march to democracy.  It meant people could affirm their allegiance to a political party and be proud of so doing at a place where most of the population was going for Sunday worship — perhaps that is not the case now as receipts from the national collection show.  I do not understand how today's church gate collection can be deemed offensive.  I believe it is an affirmative process and should be applauded for its involvement of people in politics.  I was dismayed that any bishop could take it upon himself to deem political party collections outside church gates as unworthy.

It did not come out as a blanket denunciation or order against church gate collections.  The Bishop of Ardagh and Clonmacnoise, whose bishopric is in my local area, has not broken his silence on this matter.  Members from political parties vow their allegiance to those parties.  Daniel O'Connell's Catholic rent of a penny a month established a tradition which still continues.  Why can we not carry on the 200-year old tradition of church gate collections?I will support this legislation and the Minister of State, as will all the Fianna Fáil Party.  However, I am concerned that with this legislation we might throw out the baby with the bathwater.  With the charities regulatory authority, the appeals mechanism, the agreed codes of practice and so forth, the process may become cumbersome and could daunt, say, a small GAA club in County Westmeath or County Longford grappling to raise some funds for a playing field or hall.I hope and trust that the common sense of the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, will ensure that it is not overwhelmingly obtuse for those who seek to make a case for charitable status.  On balance, the appeals mechanism is a good one.  When I was involved in consumer affairs we set up the Small Claims Court.  One constantly hears cases on the radio concerning people who have had a bad holiday, or got a bum steer as regards something they have purchased — involving small amounts of money, so that no solicitor is keen to get involved.  One can go into the Small Claims Court without a solicitor and make a case.  One can say, in effect, that one has purchased a carpet for €589 and that it is faulty, seek recompense and one's case will be heard.  More interestingly, the judge does not go on and on and neither does he or she wear a wig, but just gives a decision there and then and the claimant has redress.  That is very good, so I hope the appeals mechanism initiative will work out, as I believe it should.By and large Ireland has benefited.  A legislator might get four letters in a week from various organisations.  Quite rightly, they write to us looking for subscriptions towards what they are doing because we go to their doors and look for their votes.  They are fully entitled to write to us.  We get at least three or four imploring letters per week.  The legislator reflects on the case, the people involved, the worthiness of the cause and then decides how much to give.  I hear people giving out about this but I do not believe it is a cause for disquiet.  Rather, it should be followed up on and admired.  Sometimes when one attends a community meeting where funding is being sought, one hears the stock line "This country is awash with money and we are just seeking €400,000" or whatever.  When I hear the doleful economic forecasts, however, I resolve the next time I hear the country is awash with money to respond, "Oh no, it is not; so there is no point in caterwauling about it all the time and you must live within your budget".Well done to the Minister of State for following on from what his predecessor, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, had done.  I hope, at the end of the Second Stage debate, he will reply to my point about the political parties.  We do not intend to stay away from the churches.  However, I should like to know if we are entitled to be there so long as we are on the public path.  I can understand that one cannot be on church property.  If they get all shirty about it, there is nothing much one can do about that.  However, surely, one is entitled to be on the public path or roadway.Is there some way in which all this regulation cannot be put forward as a type of quasi-smothering of the enormous spirit of voluntarism which is so evident throughout the country?  It keeps many clubhouses going and many facilities in being in rural communities in particular.  People have hopes and aspirations and when a club in a small rural area unveils a plan to do something, that plan keeps its members coming.  They get someone to draw up a plan, and decide how to make money, with pub quizzes and all types of different activities.  I trust such initiatives will not be stifled by the bureaucratic nature of the regulatory authority.  I hope that whatever number of persons the Minister of State intends to appoint to the authority, six or nine, they will not decide to poke their noses into everything and cut out much of the good work that already is being done in Ireland.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	385	The purpose of this Bill is to enact a reform of the law relating to charities to ensure accountability and protect against abuse of charitable status and against fraud.  It will enhance public trust and confidence in charities and increase transparency in the sector.  An oft-quoted proverb regularly trotted out in reply to requests to people to part with money is, "Charity begins at home".  Perhaps it is misquoted, however, because the proverb in full is more explicit and generous and does not warrant abbreviation, namely: "Charity begins at home, but should not end there."That is a very different slant on matters and a hard hitting message for the complacent.  This is not to take from the hard working individuals and organisations whose efforts have been the backbone of charitable fundraising over many years.  Nonetheless, the legislature could be accused of extreme complacency.  This Bill is the first charity legislation in more than 40 years.  I believe the last legislation was in 1961.  The Charities Bill 2007 will introduce a definition of "charitable purposes" into Irish law and clearly define charity in all its guises and what its parameters are.There is a tendency in the study of social sciences, social policy and sociology to take refuge in a lack of definition.  For example, the concept of poverty is difficult to define.  This may be so in academic circles, but not so difficult for those experiencing it who are often at the mercy of a Government which appears to ignore the vulnerable in our society.  This Bill is welcome in that its purpose is to put in place a statutory definition of a charitable organisation and a charitable purpose for the first time in primary Irish legislation.  This, through the advancement of community care, will give a definition, too, to poverty or economic hardship.  The Bill's purpose is to enact a reform of the law relating to charities to ensure accountability, which is what we all want to see.  It will seek to protect against the abuse of charitable status and against fraud.At present, there is virtually no regulation for the 7,500 or so charities in the State.  Some prominent charities have been associated with fraud and scandal over the years and there has been no legal requirement until now to provide donors with financial information, aside from that demanded under company law.  This has militated against reputable charitable organisations, which have been tarred with the same brush as those seeking to defraud.  We are all aware of the dubious perception that to give to a relief programme is merely to provide expensive cars and other perks for aid workers.  Nothing could be further from the truth for those whose lives have been given over to the pursuit of the greater good and whose work from the smallest local efforts to the largest global aid projects have helped to lessen the suffering of the poor and afflicted.Indeed, many members of my family were members of religious orders and worked in various parts of the world.  I have granduncles who worked for charitable causes in Australia, South America and Africa and have uncles who gave their entire lives to serve communities in Africa and many other parts of the world.A 1999 survey found that only 50% of respondents perceived charities to be honest and almost one third were concerned about honesty and accountability.  Half those asked said they were tired of being asked to contribute to one charity or another.  Currently, anyone can set up a charity collecting money and is exempt from registering or filing annual reports.  This legislation will update that, which I very much welcome.Currently, there is no register of charities.  Even if charities wish to register, they cannot do so because there is no register of, or regulatory body for, charities.  Like my colleague, Deputy Barrett, I believe this should be in-house and worked on by Government.  There is a large number of quangos in this country.  As Deputy Barrett said, there is the Department of Health and Children versus the HSE and the National Roads Authority versus the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  There are quangos under the remit of every Department.  The people who elect us are fed up with what is taking place.  The national Parliament is handing over powers to bodies even though we have a fine Civil Service and fine parliamentarians who are well able to look after the interests and affairs of the country.What galls the public are the quangos and those faceless bureaucrats and their behaviour.  This issue comes up time and again at public meetings.  Faceless bureaucrats do not even answer the telephone.  Almost every quango has answering machines.  One never seems to meet anybody.  One can have an expensive telephone call as a result of being left holding for several hours.  It is time the Government addressed this issue.Human contact is very important for people.  Loneliness has crept into society.  People cannot get to speak to another human being at the other end of the telephone and must leave a message on an answering machine with their request.  This issue must be addressed urgently.We talk about volunteerism and looking after people in society.  One is not looking after people by having such a system in place.  It does not help society or foster comradeship and the neighbourliness to which we were accustomed over the years.  That type of system is not of benefit to Ireland.  We have always had a unique culture in which there was great interaction between people.  I would like this issue to be addressed in the not too distant future.Many people give to charities.  I read in a recent survey that the figure stands at 90% of the population, which is heartening.  However, these people do not know to where their money goes and if it ever gets to the people for whom it is intended.  There is the thorny question of how much goes on the salaries of professional fundraisers, leaving little after the overheads have been accounted for from the money which people have signed over in standing orders or donated in other ways.A major question in regard to funding must be confronted with running costs of approximately €4 million for a charities regulator.  Who is expected to meet this cost?  Will the already hard-pressed charities being forced to take on new financial obligations have to contribute to the cost of the new body?  If so, surely this flies in the face of charity.  I hope the Minister of State will address this issue when summing up.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	386	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and welcome the Minister of State and wish him well in his Ministry.  I welcome many of the proposals in this Bill.  Will the Minister of State explain why it was necessary to change the contents of the Bill from the heads as originally published?  There are many areas in which there are omissions.  I have heard it said that perhaps we are introducing this Bill now and leaving out the more contentious and difficult areas for the time being and that we will deal with them at a later stage.Many of the organisations which have welcomed the Bill have sought legislation to regulate and introduce transparency to charitable organisations and their fundraising methods for a long time.  Indeed, approximately 85 submissions were received in response to the initial request made.  Perhaps the Minister of State could consider the possibility of a single umbrella group representing the endless number of charities.  Many bodies are umbrella groups for a number of organisations.  It is important when dealing with this legislation and discussing how it will be applied to have a single agreed umbrella body for all charitable organisations.Many people in this country have been involved at local level in organisations or perhaps at national or international levels.  Many people have been involved in providing urgent responses, whether at local or national levels.  I fear that the duty and onus placed on the trustees of organisations is so great that it will result in some people withdrawing from supporting, or finding an alternative route to support, charities.  The intentions behind the legislation are welcome but if it has that effect, it will be counterproductive.  I hope that will not happen but I can give one instance where it may.  I refer to duty of care.  The Law Reform Commission report, Charitable Trusts and Legal Structures for Charities, states:In the consultation paper, the Commission considered the duty of care and standard of care required of charity trustees. The Commission was mindful of the need to ensure that the standard of care required was not set so high as to discourage individuals from becoming involved in voluntary activities, but at the same time would ensure that public confidence in the charity sector is maintained by providing that funds donated to a charity are properly applied for the purposes of the charity.The document further states:The proposed statutory duty of care which would apply to all charity trustees is framed as follows:A charity trustee must, in exercising functions in that capacity, act in the interests of the charity and must, in particular:(a) seek, in good faith, to ensure that the charity acts in a manner which is consistent with its purposes and(b) act with the care and diligence that it is reasonable to expect of a person who is managing the affairs of another personWe are heading into a minefield in this area.  If trustees or ordinary people in communities are to be subject to restrictions, impediments and onerous charges when raising funds for charities, their involvement would present a serious difficulty.Key aspects of the Bill will provide for a definition of "charitable purpose", a regulatory authority to secure compliance, a register of charities and dissolution of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland upon establishment of the new authority.  Many Members have queried how the regulatory authority can be independent if it is responsible to the Minister.  They also asked whether a response to a parliamentary question on a particular charity would be received from the Minister, the Minister's secretariat or the authority itself, as is now the case in respect of the HSE.The example of the HSE has been highlighted frequently.  It is necessary to reconsider this matter and the submissions that were made in the first instance that referred to the appointment of an ombudsman as an intermediary.  Doing so would be far less expensive than what is proposed and would be far more effective in that one person would have the supports to enable decision-making.  We must congratulate the current Ombudsman on the magnificent and effective way in which she carries out her work and produces answers effectively.  There is a need to reconsider the proposal to have another independent regulatory body.  I have heard many contributions on this from all sides of the House and I have a serious preference for having an ombudsman as an intermediary.I hope we will have the opportunity on Committee Stage to tease out many of the difficulties people have with the proposals, despite now having legislation that will give confidence to the public.  Transparency in respect of charities has been queried many times.  Transparency and other assurances are especially important when NGOs are dealing with overseas aid, which involves considerable public funds.Certain charities' fundraising methods give them an advantage over others.  For example, Trócaire, which has done tremendous work, makes collection boxes available during Lent through the church.  Charities should compete for funds in the same way as every other body, be it religious or secular.  I have no preference for any individual organisation because they are all doing fine work, but I ask the Minister to comment on the methods certain charities use to raise funds.I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Michael Kitt, who is a colleague in Galway East, and I wish him well in his Ministry.

He will be good for communities around Dublin and he has certainly been good to Finglas.  I am glad there was sufficient foresight to share him with the rest of the country.  I also congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Michael Kitt, on his promotion.  He has challenging times ahead but he has certainly set off in the right direction.I welcome this legislation, which has been in the pipeline for a long time.  Much preparation and consultation has been carried out with the various stakeholders and I am delighted to see it includes many important proposals concerning the organisation of charities.  Charity work in Ireland has a long history and many charities, such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, originated in the 1800s.  A number of Irish charities, including Trócaire, GOAL, Gorta and Concern, almost enjoy global status and I commend them on their hard work and success.There is a proliferation of small local voluntary organisations.  I read today that up to 63,000 people are employed in this sector in Ireland, both on a part-time and full-time basis.  In my constituency, Dublin South-East, a local group from the Grand Canal area, which is not too far from here, set up a committee to raise money for a special care unit for babies and recently presented a cheque for €34,000 to the National Maternity Hospital in Holles Street.  This is a great example of the civic-mindedness, generosity and teamwork that exists at community level in every town and village in Ireland.On foot of our long-standing tradition of charitable work, it is incumbent on the Government not only to provide relevant supports where appropriate, but also to provide a clear and stable regulatory framework for this growing field of work.  I am delighted the Charities Bill will do this and make it easier for volunteers to become involved in charity work in the future.As already outlined, key aspects of the Bill include the definition of "charitable purpose", a new regulatory authority, a register of charities, an annual activity report by charities to the new authority, a charity appeals tribunal and dissolution of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland.This Bill represents the Government's commitment to modernising the charity sector.  Everybody will agree that an element of modernising is required.  The Bill, together with the Charities Acts 1961 and 1973, will put in place a composite regulatory framework for charities.  Having contacted representatives of a number of charities to discuss the legislation with them, I assure the House that it has been broadly welcomed.  Most importantly, the Bill will serve to improve the public perception of charities.  A certain degree of cynicism about charities has developed over the years, possibly as a result of changed methods of collection, such as what I call plastic bag collections.  When plastic bags are posted through our letterboxes, the implication is that the clothes put in them will go to charities.  The bags are sometimes associated with businesses which have very little connection with charity.  I hope this Bill will clear up many of the negative feelings about charities which are inspired by such operations.  I accept that many legitimate charities operate in this manner, but businesses which imply they are charities are causing problems.This Bill will regulate against fraud and make it easier for charities to become established.  It allows for new fundraising methods, such as collection of promises of money by means of direct debit, to be used.  Those of us who walk through the city centre on a regular basis are familiar with the so-called "chuggers", or "charity muggers".  I am not comfortable with this type of collection by charities because its professional nature just does not feel right.  While I do not like it — it is almost aggressive at times — I accept that a case can be made for it.I would like to discuss two specific aspects of the Bill — the charities regulator and the definition of "charitable purpose".  It is proposed that a charities regulatory authority be established to act as an independent regulatory body for the charities sector.  The principal role of the authority will be to increase public confidence in charities through effective oversight of such organisations, to encourage better administration of charitable trusts and to provide guidance to charitable organisations, including through the development of codes of practice, which are extremely important.  The authority will also have the power to institute investigations, call for documents, search for records, impose sanctions and enforce penalties.  While it is important that there is a carrot, there also needs to be a stick.The authority will act as an excellent point of reference and support in overseeing the charities sector as a whole.  I would like to put forward some suggestions for consideration, however.  I agree with some speakers that we should be concerned about how the authority is run and who will run it.  Such matters will be teased out on Committee Stage.  If I had a choice, my preference would be for the authority to be run in-house.  The regulator should strengthen its independence.  We should bear in mind the costs of regulation and the burden of compliance costs, particularly for smaller organisations.  We cannot afford to impede the work of organisations like the one I mentioned in the Grand Canal Street area, which organises a fund for Holles Street Hospital.  We have to keep it simple and workable.  While the charities sector has become more professional, we do not want it to become over-managed.  We do not want regulation simply for the sake of it — we want effective regulation that will protect charities and donors.  I would like the regulator to be established as soon as possible — the sooner the better for everybody involvedI would also like to comment on the Bill's proposed definition of "charitable purpose".  I welcome the inclusion in this Bill of a definition, as it had previously been a matter solely for the Revenue Commissioners.  It has to be a good thing that "charitable purpose" is to be fully defined in primary legislation for the first time.  Section 3(1) of the Bill defines each of the following as a "charitable purpose":(a) the prevention or relief of poverty or economic hardship;(b) the advancement of education;(c) the advancement of religion;(d) any other purpose that is of benefit to the community.Like many representatives of charities and non-governmental organisations, I am concerned that the promotion of human rights is not explicitly mentioned in this definition, particularly in an age in which human rights abuses are reported in newspapers on a daily basis.  I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Kitt, to consider on Committee Stage the inclusion of a reference to "human rights" in the definition.  I will certainly support such a move on his part.Given that human rights are being abused in places like Burma, Darfur, Iraq and North Korea, it is vital that we protect charities which try to promote and protect human rights at home and abroad.  Having signed up to the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and many other international human rights treaties, Ireland should reflect its human rights policies in primary legislation.  If it can be done in Scottish and English legislation, why can it not be done in Irish legislation?  The protection of animal rights is mentioned in the Bill, but human rights are not.  I would like to seek clarification on this point.  I ask the Minister to address it.We need to support, rather than discourage, spontaneous community fundraising.  There is uncertainty about the implications of the Bill for people who organise or take part in such fundraising in response to disasters such as the tsunami crisis of 2004.  As I understand it, all charitable groups of all sizes will have to register with the proposed charities regulatory authority.  I am concerned that this provision could act as a deterrent to fundraising.  This legislation does not clearly set out the requirements or exceptions which will apply to permits in the case of exceptional one-off community responses to urgent needs.  If this matter is not clarified, people might not be willing to organise such responses because they might be afraid of falling foul of the law, which would be a terrible additional consequence for those who have already been affected by tragedy.  This aspect of the Bill should be considered further on Committee Stage and exemptions should be made for local, short-term collections.I welcome the Charities Bill 2007, which will put in place a much-needed framework for the organisation of charitable services in Ireland.  While that framework may need to be examined further, it is pleasing that the Bill recognises the long-standing and ever-growing tradition of voluntary work in Ireland.  This legislation will increase public confidence in charities and protect charities and donors.  We have to safeguard the independence and strength of the proposed charities regulatory authority.  We need to revise the Bill's definition of "charitable purpose" to include a reference to "human rights".  We should ensure we do not deter those who wish to engage in spontaneous fundraising such as that carried out to raise funds for the Giraffe incubator, to which I alluded earlier.  We also need to consider the role of voluntary advocacy groups.

I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution on the Charities Bill 2007, which I warmly welcome.  I will attempt not to try the patience of the Chair other than to mention that while listening to Deputy Barrett's excellent contribution, I thought for a moment I had strayed into a health debate.  I mean that in the nicest possible way.Like other speakers, I applaud the efforts of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, in his new position.  He is badly missed on our corridor — his office used to be on the same corridor as my office — since his promotion, with which I was delighted.  I am glad that Deputy Carey has been able to leave Finglas, as Deputy Andrews mentioned.  The new Minister of State has already been to Tallaght on two occasions, which is something that pleases me.  While his remit as Minister of State with responsibility for drugs policy is an important part of his job description, it is good that he is concentrating some of his energies on the community aspect of his portfolio.As someone who comes from a community work background, I have often said that I was not born a politician — I was a happy community worker before I strayed into politics after getting interested in various things.  I am happy to be a local politician in the south west of Dublin.  We should always remember our backgrounds in community work and it is good to be able to do so in a debate like this.  I acknowledge the presence of the recently appointed Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development, Deputy Michael Kitt, who is aware of my interest in his area of concern.  He has been given the hard task of succeeding my hard-working colleague in Dublin South-West, the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, whose work in that role I was always happy to support.I hope Opposition colleagues will support this Bill because it is good legislation.  I note the purpose of the Bill is to reform the laws currently relating to charities and to create a composite regulatory framework through a combination of new provisions and retention of old ones with updates where appropriate.Charitable purposes will be defined for the first time in primary legislation.  Discrimination of eligibility for certain tax exemption on funds applied for charitable purposes will, however, remain exclusively the function of the Revenue Commissioners.  The Bill will provide for the establishment of the charities regulatory authority which will have strong powers of investigation and co-operation with law enforcement, but it will also operate in a supportive manner, giving guidance where necessary.  The existing function of the board of the Commission for Charitable Donations and Bequests will transfer fully to the new authority when this is established.A key function of the new authority will be the establishment and maintenance of a register of charities in Ireland which is to be welcomed as there is no such register at present.  Registration will be mandatory for all charities operating in Ireland.  It will be an offence for a body not on the register to claim charitable status or to operate or fundraise in Ireland.  The legislation governing fundraising, which dates from 1962, will be updated to include the regulation of collections and promises of money, that is, collection by direct debit which have up to now been outside the permit system.Charitable organisations will be required to provide annual returns to the authority on activity and accounts information on a gradual basis, depending on the size of the organisation.  This information will be available to the public.  Aspects of the Bill relating to annual reporting and accounts by charities already subject to the Companies Act are under discussion with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Companies Registration Office to ensure that the potential for dual reporting is maintained.  The Bill sets out the circumstances in which a person ceases to be qualified to hold a position of charity trustee.  A register of disqualified persons will be available to the public.I noted with interest the remarks of my colleague, Deputy Chris Andrews.  It is appropriate that the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Kitt, is present.  I come from a generation which used to drop pennies into the box for the black babies — this description might not be allowed today.  As a very small child I was aware that I did not want to go to school without a penny for the black babies and this has formed my view about charities.I have been associated over the years with John O'Shea and Goal and their great work over the past 30 years as a result of my involvement with the community games.  I regarded it as good use of the goodwill of sports stars who were prepared to give their time, expertise and name to ensure that moneys were collected.  It should not be forgotten that charity begins at home, with many demands in all our communities.  Other colleagues have referred to their constituencies so I will mention Tallaght where I am always happy to offer practical support for the various charities in my constituency, including the children's hospital in Tallaght which I am keen to promote at every opportunity.I usually spend time on Tuesdays reading the  Tallaght Echo and the Tallaght Voice but I also read The Irish Times yesterday.  I refer to an excellent article by Ivan Cooper from The Wheel about this legislation.  It provides an insight into the legislation and is written in an easy to read style.  He made some valid points.  I am pleased The Wheel, like other organisations, welcomes the publication of the Charities Bill 2007.  It has noted that community and voluntary organisations working for charitable purposes have been urging the Government to regulate charities for many years.  The Wheel makes the point that a range of important issues will need to be addressed if the Bill is to provide a supportive regulation in order for charities to thrive and make their contribution so that Ireland is a better place in which to live.Ivan Cooper stated that what he describes as the long-awaited passage through the Oireachtas of this Bill is important in that the Bill when enacted will ensure that charities remain entitled to engage in all types of campaigning and different activities relating to furthering their legitimate charitable purposes.  He notes that working to promote human rights and social justice are explicitly named as charitable purposes.  He states that charities must also be financially supported to rise to the additional demands that working in a regulated environment will impose.  The Wheel makes the point that voluntary organisations must be able to plan if they are to be a source of innovation in public service delivery as per the Towards 2016 national agreement.I am pleased the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, is present.  He has a busy schedule dealing with the Government's drug programme, which is part of his remit.  I appreciate his work in that regard.  I have already acknowledged that he has visited Tallaght twice as Minister of State and I urge him to keep coming.  Deputy McGrath would also be very welcome in Tallaght.  I am pleased to see him in the House.  He is nearly as well known in Tallaght as I am through all his exploits.  I suspect he is probably one of the best known Deputies in the whole country.

The perception was that the public regarded proper accountability, transparency and credibility as being lacking in the operation of charities.  The perception was that some organisations were good, some were bad and some were using an inordinate amount of their income for administrative purposes,  that money generously donated by the public took a long time to reach the intended recipients and some money may never have reached the people in dire need of it.Ireland and the Irish people have always been generous in their contributions to charitable causes.  This is one of the positive virtues of this nation which is to be commended and no obstacle should be put in the way of maintaining this generosity due to a perception of a lack of transparency, accountability or trust.  It is important that a mechanism is provided on a statutory basis to ensure business is operated in a proper fashion.I am pleased there is a definition of what constitutes a charity, although I am not sure I agree with all the areas specified.  It is important to have a regulatory authority and a register of charities.  Most importantly, the charity must provide an annual report.  That is a key issue.  As with all bodies that are established on a statutory basis, it is essential that there is an appeals mechanism so charitable organisations which believe they have not been treated fairly by the regulatory authority have an opportunity to make their case to a higher and separate authority.The most important provision relates to the annual report.  The report should be a clear statement of audited accounts, what has happened in the course of the year, where and how the money was collected, how it was disbursed in terms of administration and what proportion was directed where it was intended to go.  That level of accountability and transparency will be an enormous benefit to the public.What will happen to the church gate collections?  Will we be able to continue to hold them?  Any form of political activity is specifically excluded from the Bill so I do not know how the Deputies who hold annual church gate collections will account for them.  Will they simply have to account to the parish priest or will they have to go to a higher forum?I am concerned about a matter which was brought to my attention by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.  Under section 3(8), the list of matters that are included in the broad definition of "benefit to the community" where that is the purpose of a charitable organisation, there is no express reference to the advancement or promotion of human rights, social justice, equality or diversity.  These are huge issues in Irish society and for new immigrants.  It is strange that human rights should be excluded.  There is surely no better charitable cause or benefit to the community.  The equality issues that are part and parcel of human existence and where difficulties occasionally arise should be specifically covered by the legislation.I am not sure what the situation of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties is under this legislation.  Will it be covered by the new definition of a benefit to the community?  Will Amnesty International be covered by it?  Will any of the bodies promoting the rights of migrants in the community be covered in terms of charitable status?  It would be a shame if they were excluded.  It would be appropriate to put down an amendment to section 3(8) to effect this change.  Section 3(8) states:In this section "purpose that is of benefit to the community" includes:(a) the advancement of community welfare including the relief of those in need by reason of youth, age, ill-health, or disability,The subsection covers a range of other areas, including the advancement of conflict resolution or reconciliation, the promotion of religious or racial harmony, protection of the natural environment, the advancement of arts, culture and so forth and the integration of those who are disadvantaged and the promotion of their full participation in society.  However, it does not specifically cover human or civil rights or equality issues.  These should be included.  That would be expected of us under the European Convention on Human Rights as well as under our broader international commitments under the United Nations Charter.I have reservations about the exclusion of all political issues and of groups whose principal object is to promote a political cause.  There are different views on that provision.  However, there should be an amendment to include human rights and civil liberties.  That would enormously improve the legislation.The legislation is welcome.  I hope the regulatory mechanisms do not become too bureaucratic but if the legislation provides the accountability and transparency that is intended, the House will have done a good day's work.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	394	I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, comhghairdeas mór and wish him well with his new portfolio.  He faces a huge challenge, although he has made a good start by getting out and about and meeting the groups involved.  Long may that closeness with the people at the coalface continue.  The Minister has been most sincere in that endeavour.  He has a huge area of responsibility, which is not unconnected with the spate of shootings and ludicrous murders that has been visited on Irish society in recent times.  The drugs problem lies behind those events.  It is a huge challenge.I am tempted to comment on the ludicrous suggestion that the Army should be deployed on the streets.  It conjures images of sandbags built up on the corners of roads, barbed wire and gun battles between the Army and the drugs gangs.  A better way of dealing with the issue would involve communities coming together with the agencies involved and the Garda to put these people off the streets long before it reaches the gun fight stage.  However, that can be discussed at another time.Sinn Féin welcomes the introduction of the Charities Bill.  The legislation has been long promised and is overdue.  Until now, the charities sector has been largely unregulated.  The Bill has been widely welcomed by community and voluntary organisations.  It is in the interest of these and other charitable organisations to have proper regulation of the sector.  Sinn Féin welcomes the proposed establishment of a charities regulatory authority and the fact that charities will be obliged to register.  This is vital to ensure accountability and to protect against abuse of the tax related exemptions granted to charities or fraud by those purporting to be charities.Prior to the introduction of the regulation proposed in the Bill, there were real concerns regarding the integrity of some charities and about how much of the money given to charities went to those for whom it was intended.  Sinn Féin believes it is vital that once the charities register is up and running, the Revenue Commissioners should make compliance with registration a condition for getting tax exemption status.  The Minister should clarify whether this will be the case.Regarding proposals to exclude from the register organisations which primarily promote political causes, concerns have been raised that this is both unworkable and unfair and will potentially result in some organisations being unfairly excluded as it is impossible to identify what constitutes a political cause.  This seems to be a valid concern when one considers the recent incident of the censoring by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland of Trócaire's campaign on gender equality.  A number of other diverse concerns are raised by groups likely to be affected and it is hoped these will be teased out on Committee Stage.In many cases, charities deliver services which should rightly be delivered by the State and fill gaps in the State's provision of social services.  While charities have a role in society, it is not acceptable for the Government to offload social services to the voluntary sector and charities.  The explosion of charities in recent years is a symptom of the increasing inequality in our society.  In many cases, the growth of charities facilitates the State in negating its role in the provision of housing services, the elimination of poverty and the provision of facilities for the elderly, young people and the disabled.Charities undertake ever more responsibility for services which should rightly be provided by the State.  However, charities still receive the majority of their funding from the State.  Estimates indicate that approximately 60% of income generated by the charities sector comes from the State.  In supporting the valuable work done by many of these organisations, we must recognise that they are no alternative to reforming the State.It is also a fact that charities or charitable organisations such as rotary clubs allow the wealthy to feel better about being wealthy in an unequal society.  They allow them to feel good about their benevolent gestures while feeling secure that these acts should be enough to prevent the disadvantaged from challenging the establishment and demanding their rights.  While recognising the good work that many of these groups do, we must not forget that it is the role of the State to concentrate its efforts on delivering many of these services for its citizens.Politicians and others who pride themselves on their support for various charitable organisations should better use their time and position to ensure the elimination of poverty and the delivery of proper services by the State.  The public should recognise the irony of any member of Government or Government party patronising charities which exist because the ideologically-driven policies pursued by the Government have brought about an increasingly unequal society.  We need a rights-based approach to eliminating the inequalities in society.I agree very much with the comments of a Catholic theologian carried in today's newspapers regarding those prominent individuals who engage in philanthropy while at the same time avoiding paying their fair share of tax by availing of tax exile status.  He is right when he states: "In a fair society, justice comes before charity."  Philanthropy is no replacement for the delivery of public and social services by the State nor for the implementation of Government polices to bring about the elimination of poverty.Another area I feel requires debate is that of tax relief for charitable donations.  However, this is a separate matter from the Bill.  I will conclude with a heading I saw in a newspaper many years ago which stated: "Damn your charity, we want justice."  Internationally, this is the cry of many people.  I hope a global effort is made to ensure that charity is no longer required but rather that justice will replace it.  I look forward to teasing out the issues involved in the Bill on Committee Stage and I hope the Government will take a practical approach to ensure it improves as legislation.  I welcome this process.

#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	397	I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Pat Carey, on his appointment as Minister of State and I wish him well in his new post.  He hit the ground running and did a tour of the country over the summer meeting various local drug task forces and community groups.  His is in a challenging portfolio and he has my full support in tackling those challenges.The Irish people have time and again been proven to be among the most generous in the world in terms of making donations to a broad range of charitable causes.  We are not slow to respond to the call for help whether it is providing foreign aid to Third World countries or helping to fundraise for local community projects.  All Deputies know of many examples of fundraising in their communities which help deliver real progress.  People may not know that this year as a Government we will provide more than €800 million in overseas aid.There has never been more fundraising in Ireland than there is today or more competition for our generosity.  Therefore, the introduction of the Bill is timely and appropriate.  I warmly welcome the introduction of the Charities Bill 2007, which for the first time will provide a comprehensive and composite regulatory framework for charities in Ireland.  It is important that the charities sector is regulated, so that bona fide charities can go about their work without a cloud of suspicion hanging over them.I wish to put on record my appreciation for the work of so many volunteers throughout Ireland who give up their time for charitable causes.  Whether it be standing at a church gate collection or carrying out essential administrative work, these volunteers are the backbone of the charitable sector in Ireland today and long may it continue.The principal benefit of the Bill is the accountability it will bring to the work of charitable organisations.  This will enhance public confidence and trust in the sector, and should address any concerns among the public about where their donations actually end up.  This is a key point.  Often the reluctance or unwillingness of people to give money to organisations is because they simply have no assurance of whether the money ends up going towards the intended beneficiary or how much of it does.The term "charity" has taken on a broad and disparate interpretation and I am pleased the Bill provides a definition of "charitable purposes" for the first time in primary legislation.  It is true the definition is broad and inclusive.  However, given the wide range of charitable activity in communities today, deciding whether the work of a particular group falls within the definition of "charitable purposes" will be a difficult task.Section 3 provides that "charitable purposes" includes "a purpose that is of benefit to the community" and it proceeds to provide a number of broad descriptions of what is of benefit to the community.  Aside from obvious charitable organisations such as GOAL, the Society of St. Vincent De Paul and the Simon Community, other groups which may be affected by the Bill also spring to mind such as senior citizens groups, groups associated with fundraising for hospitals, church renovation committees, community associations, youth clubs, Lions clubs, active retired groups and even residents' associations.Almost every voluntary or community group in the country carries out some element of fundraising as part of its work.  It will be a challenge to differentiate the groups for whom fundraising is their core business and those for whom it is merely ancillary to what they do.  We need to consider the extent to which this Bill is intended to regulate the thousands of community and voluntary groups throughout the country.  It might be worth considering the examination of whether fundraising is a group's principal activity.The establishment of the charities regulatory authority is a welcome initiative.  We need a specific authority to regulate this area.  However, as many Deputies stated, we cannot allow the authority to become a bureaucratic institution which deters and discourage charitable work.  I know the Minister is anxious that the new regulatory regime should not be viewed as an obstacle to the work of charities and I am delighted the new authority will have a supportive role and will not merely be a watchdog.Many community-based charities do not have substantial resources and we cannot impose onerous administrative requirements on them.  I am pleased the new authority will produce an annual report, which will be laid before this House, providing a degree of transparency across the charitable sector that we have not witnessed before.The register of charities will provide a central public register of charities in Ireland.  I hope this register will be accessible to the public in a practical way such as being placed on a website to be established by the regulatory authority.  At least the public will now have a benchmark to assess the bona fides of a charity which comes knocking on the door.I note taxation issues concerning charities will continue to remain a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  The commissioners already grant charitable tax exemption under the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and other statutes and the regulation introduced in the Charities Bill should assist the Revenue Commissioners in their adjudication of the charitable nature of each organisation applying for tax exemption.This Bill will especially enable us to gain a greater understanding and appreciation of the unincorporated charitable organisations which will also be required to submit an annual report to the regulatory authority or such other mechanism as the Minister or the authority will decide.  This requirement will act as a deterrent to bogus charities and protect against abuse of the goodwill of the public.  Incorporated charities are already subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts and the reporting requirements of the new authority will introduce a level playing field among all charities.  It is important that the reporting requirements are simple and straightforward and that the administration does not become an undue burden on charities.The Law Reform Commission has recommended a new legal structure for charitable organisations, the charitable incorporated organisation.  The Minister is correct in not delaying the regulation of the sector pending examination of the significant issues involved in this unified structure, recommended by the Law Reform Commission.Having read the briefing paper prepared by The Wheel, the national network that supports charities, to which Deputy O'Connor referred, it has made a valid point on the issue of spontaneous community fundraising.  We do not want a situation where the regulation of the charitable sector prevents this type of fundraising, which often takes place on the spur of the moment, immediately after a tragic event of some kind.  These groups are ad hoc and respond to an unforeseen need which has arisen in a community.  All Deputies will have experience of the obstacle on community activity that insurance has become.  We do not want regulation to become a similar obstacle to community fundraising.The Bill is warmly welcomed as it provides an appropriate and responsible regulatory environment for charities in Ireland today.  The new regime will enhance public trust and confidence in the charitable sector and will, hopefully, result in an even greater level of generosity to charities by the Irish people.  I look forward to discussing some of the details of the Bill in the weeks ahead.I commend the Minister on bringing forward the Bill and look forward to seeing its progression in the weeks ahead.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	398	I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this new legislation, the Charities Bill 2007.  I welcome and congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, on his recent promotion and wish him well in his new job.I welcome this important Bill as there has been a need for many years to regulate charities.  I am one of those who has been pushing this agenda.  Before going into the details of the legislation it is important to commend and thank the many worthwhile charities and voluntary groups in this country.  They have played and continue to play a leading part in Irish civic life.  It is essential that we all put this on the record and thank the voluntary workers in charities on the ground.  They are serving their country well and we commend and thank them for their efforts.However, charities have a duty to be honest and straight with the public.  They have to be accountable because in many cases they deal with vast amounts of money and public trust is a huge issue.  It is not acceptable to have charities with huge sums of money in their accounts.  This is public money collected from citizens of the State and it should be spent on the issues for which it was collected.  Politicians regularly get hammered on trust and accountability, and rightly so.  However, charities too have to step up to the mark.  Is it acceptable that some charities have huge sums of money in their accounts or own huge valuable properties while those they are supposed to help are often left behind?  I hear this regularly in my constituency.I speak as one who has been a voluntary worker for a number of charities over 20 years.  I entered politics through the voluntary and community sector.  I have seen situations about which I was not happy and it is up to everyone to be straight and honest with the public.  That is the reason I welcome the Bill today.  I ask some of our so-called rich kids to stop using charities as a cover-up to present a positive image to some of their activities.  It is time for the likes of Bono and Denis O'Brien to stay in Ireland and do their work here, pay their taxes like everyone else and stop using charities to bolster their egos.  If they are serious about making a contribution to Irish society, they should pay their taxes like everyone else and support our charities.  Let us look at Chuck Feeney who wants no reward and donates hundreds of millions to the poorest of the poor as well as giving major donations to education institutions here.  People like Chuck Feeney should be honoured by this country for his role in giving to Ireland and in the peace process.Let us have a proper honours system also for our own people.  It might reduce the sad scenes of Irish citizens accepting knighthoods or MBEs from the British.  Let us grow up and have our own awards and honours systems.  Chuck Feeney should be first on that list.  I am always saddened when Irish citizens accept honours from monarchists.  All democrats should back the call for a proper honours system for people who do great things for our people, the poor, the disadvantaged and our country.  The political parties should stop bickering, work together on this matter and support the introduction of a new honours system.I thank all Deputies and members of the public who donated money and sent text messages to me when I was involved in the charity, "You're a Star", three years ago.  We helped to raise more than €80,000 which went directly to a project for children with disability.  I thank and commend all my cross-party colleagues in the House who regularly donate money to worthwhile charities and causes.  The public who are often cynical about politicians should be aware of this reality.  Many Members make substantial donations regularly to charities.  I thank and commend my colleagues for their work on this issue.The purpose of the Bill is to enact a reform of the law relating to charities to ensure greater accountability and to protect against abuse of charitable status and fraud.  It will also enhance public trust and confidence in charities and increase transparency in the sector.  The key aspects of the Bill will provide for a definition of charitable purpose for the first time in primary legislation, establish a new regulatory authority to secure compliance by charities with their legal obligations and encourage better administration of charities, establish a register of charities in which all charities operating in the State must register, provide for annual activity reports by charities to the new authority and update the law relating to fundraising, particularly in relation to collections by way of direct debits and similar non-cash methods.  These key aspects of the legislation are positive and progressive developments.In regard to charities, the centre for non-profit management at Trinity College estimates that the voluntary sector generates an annual income of about €2.5 billion, with about €500 million of that coming from fundraising.  According to figures from Trinity College, approximately 60% of the income generated by charities comes from the State.  There are about 700 people directly employed as fundraisers.  Trust is a key issue with the public and the taxpayers.  There are many cases where rip-off merchants are involved and all this will be dealt with in the legislation.  That the not-for-profit sector accounted for 8% of Ireland's GDP would not be known to many people.  While big brand charities such as Oxfam, UNICEF, Goal and Concern are often most recognised by the public, many of the charities operating in Ireland are very small.  According to the research conducted by Trinity College, half of all responding organisations had an income of €40,000 or less in 2003.  The college's research showed that less than 10% of organisations earned an average income of €738,205 or more in 2003, while a further 10% earned an income of €1,300 or less.  It is clear there are huge as well as smaller charities.  Incidentally the smaller charities make a massive contribution also.Legislation will ensure clarity on accounts.  For the numerous charities in Ireland, the new Charities Bill will change the way they operate when it is passed into law.  One of the key changes will be the establishment of a charity regulatory authority, a regulatory body for charitable organisations.All new charities will now be required to apply to this body to be registered as a charitable organisation.  Existing charities will be given six months to register, which I welcome.  The registration process will require the charity to supply three years of accounts, the charity's constitution and details of how it intends to raise funds.Section 3 defines ‘'charitable purposes'' for the first time in primary legislation.  A purpose is regarded as charitable if its aim is the prevention or relief of poverty or economic hardship; the advancement of education; the advancement of religion; or any other purpose that is of benefit to the community."Purpose that is of benefit to the community'' includes the advancement of community welfare, including the relief of those in need by reason of youth, age, ill-health or disability.  It is very important that we support the organisations that campaign for people with disabilities.  It also includes the advancement of community development, including rural or urban regeneration and the promotion of civic responsibility or voluntary work in the community.  I commend all those involved in the voluntary sector and I send my best wishes to our team at the Special Olympics in China, who have done magnificent work in this area.  We should all support them.It also includes the promotion of health, including the prevention or relief of sickness, disease or human suffering and the advancement of conflict resolution or reconciliation.  I raised the issue of conflict resolution during my talks with the Taoiseach on my programme for government in my so-called deal.  I commend the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on the €25 million allocated to the fund to assist with resolving conflicts throughout the world.  Again Ireland is showing itself as a leading light in the area of conflict resolution.  This is also mentioned in the legislation."Purpose that is of benefit to the community'' also includes the protection of the natural environment; the prevention or relief of suffering of animals; the advancement of the arts, culture, heritage or sciences; and the integration of those who are disadvantaged, and the promotion of their full participation in society.  We have many voluntary groups in Dublin North-Central in Marino, Coolock, Artane, Beaumont, Clontarf, Raheny and Donnycarney that are doing excellent work.  They are a small band of people in their own community who do magnificent work.  I take this opportunity to thank those involved in voluntary groups including residents and sports groups who give of their time regularly.  We all know how valuable time is.  We all know there is a problem now with the idea of active citizenship and we need to give consideration to this area because of the great contribution of those people.  I commend the people in Dublin North-Central on the excellent work they do in the voluntary and community sector.It is important to focus on and prioritise the disadvantaged in our society, who will always be a priority for voluntary and community groups whether they are the sick, elderly, disabled or disadvantaged.  It is up to the State sector to complement the voluntary groups.  There are many examples in my constituency where a considerable amount of money is going into disadvantaged areas.  Many Deputies want to know what is in the deal with the Government.  These are all issues in the deal with the Government.  I want to ensure that Deputy Terence Flanagan knows that so that he can spread the word particularly in Raheny.  It is very important that we support the disadvantaged in our society.I welcome this progressive and sensible legislation that gives priority to charities.  It will also ensure that the public has trust that there will be honesty and accountability in dealing with charities.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	399	First, I wish to congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, on his new role.  I wish him well for the future.  I congratulate him on the publication of the Bill.It is estimated that there are more than 19,000 community and voluntary organisations working for charitable purposes in Ireland and that the sector contributes more than €2.5 billion to the economy each year.  The sector employs more than 63,000 full-time and part-time staff and is very important for the economy.  It is imperative that this industry is appropriately regulated, as charities themselves would be the first to admit.While I welcome the Bill's publication, it is necessary for the Government to support charities as promised in Towards 2016 by providing additional resources to assist the sector in meeting its obligations in a new regulatory environment.  The Bill will help to reform the law relating to charities in order to ensure accountability and to protect against abuse of charitable status and fraud.  We are all aware of many charities that are household names.  However, there are many other charities which I am not sure are even legal.  Adopting the Bill will enhance public trust and confidence in charities and increase transparency in the sector.  This Bill, along with the Charities Acts 1961 and 1973 and the Street and House to House Collections Act 1962, will provide a strong regulatory framework for charities.  The Bill will also streamline the many authorities that regulate a charity's work and will clarify the duties attaching to directors and trustees.Key aspects of the Bill that I welcome include: a definition for the first time of "charitable purpose"; the establishment of a charity appeals tribunal; a new regulatory authority to secure compliance by charities with their legal obligations and also to encourage better administration of charities; a register of charities in which all charities operating in the State must register; and that annual reports will need to be supplied by the charities to the new authority.The Bill, when enacted, should ensure that charities remain entitled to engage in all types of campaigning and advocacy work related to furthering their legitimate charity purposes and that working to promote human rights and social justice are specifically named as charitable purposes.  I welcome that the charities regulatory authority will have the power to institute investigations, to call for documents and search records of all charities, to enter premises on foot of a search warrant and to impose sanctions on Irish charities and foreign-based charities with administration bases in Ireland.  I also welcome the significant penalties for offences.At present, we have no central register of public charities and a key function of the regulatory authority will be the establishment and maintenance of a register of charitable organisations.  The public will have access to this and will be able to check the facts and figures of any charity about which they may be unsure.  It should ensure that we can eliminate all the bogus charities.  The authority will also have the power to remove from the register a body that has infringed the law.  It will be an offence for a body not to register, to claim it is a charity or to operate or raise funds.  No doubt the key purpose of the register is to promote transparency and the register will enable the public to confirm the bona fides of charities, thereby limiting the scope for fraud.  The Bill also provides that all charitable organisations will be required to make annual reports, which will be accessible to the public apart from those in respect of private trusts that are not funded by donations from the public, which is fair enough.Some of my concerns would include the funding for community and voluntary organisations.  We need a new framework for the statutory funding of voluntary organisations, which should provide multi-annual funding for the direct and indirect or hidden costs of running such organisations.  The funding should also be index-linked.  We also need to improve the tax incentives for donations to charities and voluntary organisations so that all donations are tax effective as opposed to the current system whereby only donations greater than €250 per year can be made in a tax-efficient manner.  Hopefully, the Minister of State will re-examine this issue.He also needs to put in place an infrastructure of support for the voluntary sector in Ireland similar to that provided by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to the business community.  This new support organisation should target the needs of voluntary organisations and provide training, advice and supports in the area of board management, governance, leadership, general management and financial management.I thank all those volunteers who give of their time freely and they should be commended on all the great work they do.  I was delighted to be involved in the Special Olympics.  It was one of the best things I did in my life.  One gets more back from giving than anything else.  We should all support and enable voluntary activity in Ireland to be conducted in a purposeful and strategic manner.  This will be achieved when community and voluntary organisations are funded appropriately, regulated sensitively and supported comprehensively.  I support this legislation and I ask the Minister of State to take note of my concerns.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	400	I congratulate the Minister of State who laboured long and hard before receiving his just reward on his appointment.  I have no doubt he will be successful, which will be to the benefit of the House and the State.I welcome the legislation, which has a great deal of merit because it proposes to put in place regulations to cater for various charities.  Many Members have mentioned the significant work carried out by charitable organisations.  Significant amounts are raised by voluntary groups at local and national level and they have done a great deal to alleviate the burden of the taxpayer as  much of the money is devoted to causes that ordinarily would be the responsibility of the Exchequer.  We should remind ourselves of this.  I hope the legislation does not replace the voluntary spirit among the public and recognises the necessity to ensure that continues.  It would be hugely negative if the spontaneity involved in volunteering for which the Irish have become famous is interfered with or if regulations inhibit or impede volunteerism.Notwithstanding that, the amounts raised by charities have increased and this has created temptation.  It is, therefore, important and right that regulations should be introduced.  Previous contributors referred to the establishment of another quango.  While I worry about how bureaucratic the system might become, I ask the Minister of State to ensure the minimum imposition results from the increased bureaucracy.  I do not have the greatest respect for bureaucracy because by its very amorphous nature, it tends to damp down the spontaneity and voluntary spirit that exists and it has usually done more damage and been more costly than if the status quo had pertained.Local spontaneous fundraising is usually for a good cause.  For example, if a house burns down and the family do not have insurance, people will rally round for such an extremely good cause and engage in instant action.  Benefit nights for families who have lost a member tragically are a regular occurrence.  I recognise the need for a statutory basis for the operation of charities but the Minister of State should be careful not to go overboard because if he does, people will be turned off and they will say if that is the way the Government wants it, then it should deal with these issues itself.  I refer to the issue of charitable tax status, which will generate interest in the future.  The definition of "charity" in the tax code is an important issue and I hope the bureaucrats do not decide when the regulatory system is established that local causes do not qualify for charitable status.  That represents my greatest fear.  I would like the Minister of State to take my concerns on board so that local spontaneous efforts to raise funds do not lose charitable tax status as these efforts will always be needed.Ireland has enjoyed a great deal from volunteers over the years and that has been a trait of our communities and individuals.  However, as we have become more affluent, the tendency has been to leave more voluntary activities to the statutory authorities.  For example, organisations are educating people as to what they can do most efficiently in regard to donations that have tax benefits.  Good charities write to people from time to time seeking donations for very good causes.  Occasionally, a charity highlights the tax status and benefits that could result from contributing to its cause.  When I read the explanation for this, I tend to be less helpful than if I had free rein to do my own thing.  Volunteering has two sides to it.  When one is asked to volunteer in whatever capacity, that should be at one's discretion.

#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	405	We should all welcome the opportunity to contribute to Bills that touch on something central to Irish life and which improve the quality of life of our people.  Irish charities have contributed a great deal throughout our history and their role is no less important today.  Many volunteers give of their time and income to charities and this should be encouraged above all else.  The legislation should mean people can contribute in a safe and fuss free manner.  We want charities to be as professional as possible but it is crucial that giving to charities does not become bogged down in paperwork and bureaucracy.  I am extremely concerned because when a new body or agency is established, it usually leads to more paperwork.  By its nature, involvement in charities means people give of their time voluntarily at nights and weekends.  It is important that, while checks and balances are needed, the legislation ensures the need for paperwork and bureaucracy is kept to a minimum.  Many changes introduced by legislation in the past have resulted in additional form filling and work.  When the Bill proceeds through its final Stages, I appeal for the bureaucracy and form filling to be kept to a minimum.  Otherwise, our work today and in coming weeks on this legislation will be of little use.There is some concern that the Bill will merely serve to set up yet another quango.  I would like more assurance from the Government that this will not be the case.  It is important that this House does not allow a quango to be established in this instance.  Unlike so many other State agencies, the charities regulatory authority should not be based in Dublin but elsewhere in the State.  Decentralisation is something we have all welcomed and supported, although we had hoped it would progress at a faster rate.

We have a long history of involvement with charities and voluntary organisations based in Third World countries.  I have visited some of these places and seen at first hand the impact of the contributions made by Irish people.  It is important that we, as the second wealthiest economy in the world, should lead the way in terms of assistance to developing countries.  Regulation in this regard is welcome, whether it involves flag days in schools, for example, or collections outside supermarkets.  It is important that we support the activities of volunteers whether they are based at home or abroad.  We must make it easier for the many people who engage in such wonderful work on an ongoing basis.

I also congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, on his appointment.  He will do an excellent job in steering this legislation through the House.This Bill provides for the dissolution of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland and the establishment of a charities regulatory authority.  The former was the body to which organisations had to present their requests to relinquish title on property and so forth.  The processing of documentation in such cases was a long and cumbersome process as a result of the backlog with which the commissioners had to contend.  I am aware of several cases where there have been lengthy delays in processing applications in regard to community and parish halls and facilities based in school campuses and diocesan properties.  It took a huge amount of time and effort on behalf of local communities to go through that process.Much has been said during this debate about the effort expended by voluntary workers in communities throughout the State.  I hope that an effort will made to streamline the bureaucracy involved for community organisations when the new regulatory authority assumes the powers of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland.  It will be very much welcome if the new body is easier to access and facilitates the speedier processing of documentation.I welcome the Bill, which provides clarity in regard to the regulation of charities.  It is useful to place such regulation on a statutory footing in terms of what organisations must do in regard to accounts and so on.  Every Member sees at first hand in his or her constituency the work that is done by charities.  Speakers have referred to once-off fundraising efforts in response to particular tragedies.  Other charities raise funds for community projects such as sporting facilities.  I acknowledge the fantastic work undertaken by volunteers throughout the State and in my own area in particular.  I have heard some people put forth innuendo to the effect that these volunteers must be enjoying some personal material gain from their activities.  The vast majority, however, give up their time for no payment and receive no material gain.All politicians have a duty to encourage people to become involved in voluntary organisations in their local communities.  As other speakers observed, there is much to be gained in terms of personal satisfaction in giving of one's time for charitable purposes.  There is a difficulty, however, particularly in some of the sporting organisations, in getting young people involved in the management and committee structure.  I and other Members frequently tell secondary school students about the importance of getting involved in their communities and seeking to effect change in so far as they can.  It is important to put forward one's point of view whether through a residents association, sporting organisation, political party and so on.  It is only by using one's voice that one can hope to have one's views acted upon.Some Members voiced concern about the establishment of another quango.  However, the purpose of this legislation is to impose order on the sector and to eradicate any quangos that may have developed.  The new authority will be easier to access and deal with and will provide a centralised regulatory framework.  The provisions in regard to how charities maintain their accounts will be helpful.

#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	423	As with previous speakers from last night, I firstly convey my sincere sympathies to the families of Brian Murray and Mark O'Shaughnessy, as well as to their fire fighting colleagues.  These men died tragically on Wednesday, 26 September while tackling a blaze in Bray, County Wicklow.  I also commend their families for appearing on the "Late Late Show" last Friday, as they must be praised for speaking out so soon after the loss of their loved ones and highlighting the need to reform fire services in this country.Five years ago, the Government ordered a review of the fire services, with one key recommendation from the review being the need to establish a national fire authority.  To date, nothing has happened in this regard and it is quite obvious we have not learned from the Stardust tragedy, despite similar recommendations coming from its investigations.Bray, like many other large urban centres, is a fast-growing town with a population in the region of 32,000.  What happened on that fateful morning in Bray could easily happen in any other town throughout the country.  The scenario is similar in Ennis, which has a population of approximately 25,000.  The fire service in Ennis station has a complement of 16 retained fire-fighters who must serve the greater area with a population of 60,000 people.Earlier this year, I highlighted the problems in my own constituency experienced by part-time fire-fighters.  They have state-of-the-art equipment, are extremely well trained and train on a regular basis.  I have seem them first-hand doing drills and dealing with mock accidents.Their being on-call and part-time means they cannot have another job.  The local authority refuses to sanction a full-time service because of the cost involved despite calls to Ennis fire station increasing by 20% over the past year.  In 2006, it dealt with 569 calls, 98 more than the previous year.  That is a very busy service, with an average of two calls per day.  Similar towns, such as Sligo and Dundalk, have a full-time service despite them not receiving as many calls.The time has come to reform the fire services.  We need a more professional approach from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government as fire-fighters not only carry out their traditional duties, but must also increase their role in educating the public with fire awareness and safety.  There should be visits to schools, as the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, stated last night, and there should be above all else more inspections of our nightclubs, where many young people congregate at night.  We do not want another Stardust tragedy.Our fire-fighters throughout the country serve our communities with distinction, putting themselves in dangerous situations to save lives.  Retained fire-fighters, no matter how alert, require five to seven minutes to mobilise, depending on traffic.  We are all aware of the gridlock on urban roads, so those five or seven minutes could make all the difference in saving a valuable life.The art of fire fighting has changed considerably recently.  Thankfully, chimney fires are on the decrease but the service must now deal with chemical spills and fires, fires in high-rise buildings and apartments, horrific car accidents resulting from speeding and anti-social behaviour problems such as bogus calls.  There were 100 bogus calls made in my own constituency of Clare last year.Only last week thugs set alight an industrial bin outside my constituency office.  The fire service was called to the scene but as the fire station in Ennis was already dealing with two fires, the Shannon service 22 km away had to deal with it.  If another serious incident occurred that morning, there would have been serious pressure on the fire services and the call-out time would have been increased.It was chilling to hear the words of the late Brian Murray's family recollecting how he predicted somebody would die before the end of the year unless there was a major overhaul of the fire services.  That speaks for itself.  We will always remember the bravery of the New York fire services on 11 September 2001 and we will remember the bravery of the two fire-fighters who lost their lives on that fateful morning of 26 September this year.  They have made the ultimate sacrifice and their bravery and courage will be remembered.Fine Gael will support and encourage reform of the fire services.  We ask the Minister not to leave the report on the fire services lie in dust like other reports.

I also extend sympathy to their colleagues in the fire service and the people of Bray.People working in the security forces — fire services, the Garda or Army — are too often taken for granted.  These personnel enter into dangerous situations and we must always remember they are someone's son, mother or daughter.The families and colleagues of these men, as well as the people of Bray, want more than kind words on this occasion.  These men were well trained and professional in their work.  Over a number of years we have prevaricated over the establishment of a fire authority recommended in the Farrell Grant Sparks report.  It is imperative this authority is established to ensure we have a national standard for training and operation.  In 2002, the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, stated in reply to a question about implementation of the recommendations of the report that "work to this end is continuing".We want a full-time service for Bray and similar towns around the country.  That is not too much to ask.  Such action is in the control of Wicklow County Council and I urge that body to provide such a service.  The Government can establish the fire authority.There should be an independent investigation of this affair apart from the current three.  The Garda will investigate this incident with regard to criminality, the Health and Safety Authority will probably consider the safety system in work and it is unfair to even ask Wicklow County Council to examine the incident because they are the employers of those in the fire service.Section 16 of the Fire Services Act 1981 gives the Minister the power to hold a sworn public inquiry and I call on the Minister, Deputy Gormley, to do this rather than wait for the outcome of reports which could take several months and will not establish the exact detail.  The least we owe the families, the fire services and the public is to establish exactly what happened.  The Minister has the power to do so under current legislation.  I call on him or a spokesperson to commit to this before 8.30 p.m. because it is an easy task.In this country the Garda Síochána has a Scott medal for bravery and the military has distinguished service medals.  The fire services only come under general auspices of the Bravery Act of the 1940s.  It is time we considered this matter.  The last fireman to die on duty in Wicklow was Paddy Dooley in 1970, who died in a well.  The only recognition he received was from authorities in Scotland.  I call on the Government to support this motion.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	425	As with all other speakers, I offer sympathy to the Murray and O'Shaughnessy families, as well as to the colleagues of the men, some of whom are probably in the Gallery this evening.I commend the Labour Party on bringing this motion forward but I am disappointed the Government has decided to divide the House on it.  The motion proposed by the Labour Party appears to be deliberately written in a manner making it easy for the Government to support it.  It is neither divisive nor political, nor is it asking for anything outrageous.  It seeks implementation of the key findings of a report commissioned by the Government in 2002 and is deliberately ambiguous in asking for a full-time fire service for areas with high populations or where the population has grown dramatically in a relatively short space of time.The Government has chosen to make a long amendment, which states very little, although it of course offers sympathy.  I would have thought that, considering the background to this motion and debate, it would have been an ideal opportunity for us as political parties and politicians in this House to accept a perfectly reasonable Opposition Private Members' motion for a change.My main argument is that we must recognise those working in the fire services, whether they are fighting fires or cutting corpses from crashed cars.  These people are heroes in many ways, working 24 hours a day depending on what time they are called.  The least we can do is ensure they receive top-class training and equipment in order to minimise the chances of losing their own lives or being severely injured in the course of duty.  We are not doing that at present.A fire-fighter from my constituency, whom I know well, telephoned me today and stated that the current fire appliance, as he calls it — we would term it a fire engine — at his station is over ten years old.  It was purchased from the UK where it had been decommissioned.  We are, therefore, buying equipment that has been rejected by fire services in England, transporting it to Ireland and expecting our part-time fire-fighters to use it in the line of duty.  That is not acceptable and the system needs to be changed.Unfortunately, the senior Minister is not present.  I appeal to those present to consider the motion tabled by the Labour Party and, in a gesture of solidarity, to accept it.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	426	With the agreement of the House, I propose to share time with Deputies Behan, Gogarty and Cuffe.  There may be a fourth Deputy with whom I will also be sharing time later.I welcome the opportunity to address the motion before the House.  As a Member representing the constituency of Wicklow and as a resident of Bray, I can inform the House that the fatal fire on 26 September has had a devastating effect on the entire community of Bray and on surrounding areas.  I join other Members in again expressing my deepest sympathy to the families of Mark O'Shaughnessy and Brian Murray and to the members of the fire service in County Wicklow on the loss of their colleagues.In the days following this terrible tragedy, I visited the fire stations at Bray and Greystones to get an understanding of the events that led to this sad loss of life.  When I spoke to fire service personnel, the depth of their loss, their courage and their dedication to the service and their community came through in equal measure.  In addition to the pain of their loss, I also detected pain at some of the comments that were made regarding the tragedy and the capacity of the retained fire services.Some media inquiries have been extraordinarily insensitive.  Deputy McManus indicated that she was asked to state whom she regarded as being responsible.  I commend her on the fact that she did not adopt that form of approach.  Nor has the Deputy attempted to play politics with this matter.  I received inquiries similar to those put to Deputy McManus as to who should be blamed.  My view is that this was an horrendous tragedy and inquiries must be carried out and a report issued with minimum delay.Nobody in Bray or Wicklow has any doubts about the skill, dedication, courage or capacity of retained fire service personnel.  These individuals are exemplary in every regard.  In addition to recording again my sincere condolences to the Murray and O'Shaughnessy families and the fire crews, I wish to acknowledge the service fire-fighters in Bray and others throughout the country provide in protecting the lives and property of citizens.As one would expect, many questions have arisen in the aftermath of this terrible tragedy.  Three investigations are under way and it is imperative that these be concluded as soon as possible.  No good will come from a protracted period of inquiry.  There have been calls for a fourth investigation, namely, an independent inquiry.  I have an open mind on this issue.  If such an examination would produce early results, it would be welcome.The fire service in Ireland has undergone immense change and development in recent years.  The challenges that fire service personnel face are changing on a daily basis, as are the dangers with which they are presented in answering those challenges.  The fire services change management programme 2005 introduced during my tenure at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government contains the roadmap setting out the approach to dealing with these challenges and the dangers that accompany them.  It focuses on four priority areas for action: enhanced safety and welfare of fire fighters — I regard this as the top priority; community fire safety — a previous speaker referred to the importance of the community fire service; a competency-based approach to recruitment and career progression; and the development of a risk-based approach to emergency cover.  The latter was covered in great length in the contributions of previous speakers.  All four areas are of vital and equal importance.The fire services change management programme finds its inspiration in the Farrell Grant Sparks report.  Progress is being achieved in the four priority areas to which I refer.  There has been some comment on the Farrell Grant Sparks report and its implementation.  It is not true, as has been suggested in some quarters, that nothing has happened since the report was published.  Action is under way on each of the four areas to which I refer.  As Members are aware, the first report on the implementation of the programme was published as recently as June of this year.The motion before the House calls for the establishment of a national authority for fire and civil protection-emergency services.  I fully accept the bona fides of those putting forward this call.  I suggest, however, that this is one area in respect of which we need to pause and consider.  Virtually not a day goes by in the House without Members raising questions regarding the wisdom of consigning significant areas of public policy implementation to bodies outside the immediate control of Ministers.  Sometimes such bodies are appointed to speed up the execution of public policy, whereas at other times the approach is adopted in order to remove sensitive areas of public policy from political interference.  The HSE was established with the former objective in mind and An Bord Pleanála was set up for the latter reason.Members on all sides regularly criticise the outcome of such assignment of responsibility to what are commonly called "quangos", a term I dislike.  It is said that we already have 600 such bodies in this country.  This represents a very significant removal of public policy from democratic answerability.  The first question we must ask in respect of this particular issue is whether it would be better to remove fire services and fire policy from direct democratic control.  I have my doubts in that regard.The second point that arises regarding the creation of yet another national authority relates to resources and whether it would be better to establish such an authority or invest the available funds in the fire service itself.  My view remains that all available funding should be channelled directly into the fire service — for the purchase of equipment and engines, providing training and developing community-based fire programmes — rather than into establishing yet another agency.The third and most pressing consideration at the time was to move from the talking stage to the implementation stage.  Members are correct that programmes and reports are often left lying around for years without any action being taken in respect of them.  If Government were, as a first step, to become involved in institutional change, this would inevitably delay progress on implementation in other key areas such as those relating to safety and welfare, the creation of a community-based approach, the implementation of a competency-based approach to recruitment and career progression, and the development of a risk-based approach to emergency cover.This is not to say that creation of a national authority should be ruled out for all time.  That is certainly not the case.  The decision made at the time was that the energy and resources should first be invested in the four key areas to which I refer.  Perhaps the most succinct expression of this point is to be found in a constructive response from a SIPTU representative who appeared on a programme broadcast by East Coast Radio last week.  The individual in question queried whether a group of ten or more people sitting around a table could really change anything.The question of a full-time or retained service was also raised and I want to again commend Deputy McManus for her measured comments on this matter.  As the Minister, Deputy Gormley, stated and as Deputy Timmins acknowledged, a decision on this matter must be taken by the local fire authority, Wicklow County Council.  This has always been the case.  I continue to support the concept of a full-time fire service for my home town.  What public representative would not do so?  While perusing my records yesterday in order to deal with a press query, I discovered that as long ago as 1997, when I was a member of Wicklow County Council, I submitted a proposal calling for a comprehensive study of the costs and benefits of a full-time service to be carried out.  I suggested at the time that if it was not possible, as a result of a lack of resources, to provide a full-time service for Bray and north-east Wicklow, the possibility of providing a sub-regional service should be considered whereby the service from Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown would be transferred into the area.  This proposition did not win support.I resurrected this possible approach in 2001 but, again, it was rejected.  On that occasion, the idea did not find favour in either Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown or Wicklow.  At present, Wicklow County Council has put a report on this matter out for public consultation.  It will come, as is appropriate, before council members again in the near future.  They will then be faced with the question that their counterparts in other local authorities have had to face regarding full-time fire services.  Unless we decide to change the basis on which we organise the fire services and decide to opt for a full national service, the basic decision in respect of this matter will remain with local councils.What happened in Bray two weeks ago was the most awful of events to befall a community, particularly one already bearing the scars of fire tragedies in the very recent past.  The loss to the families involved is incalculable.  No person in this House can begin to put a measure on the price those families have paid.  There are questions that must be answered about the Bray tragedy.  The sooner the reports are under way and completed, the better.  The results of those inquiries and the changes that are under way in the change management programme can then be factored into the changes that must be introduced in the Wicklow fire services.  When that happens, as was said last night, hopefully, some good will come from this awful tragedy.
#JoeBehan	unknown-#JoeBehan-party	unknown-#JoeBehan-dob	unknown-#JoeBehan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	427	I join with Members on all sides of this House in expressing my sincere and heartfelt sympathy to the families of Brian Murray and Mark O'Shaughnessy on their untimely and tragic deaths.  It is clear that Brian and Mark's selfless courage in giving up their lives in order to save others has struck a chord deep in the hearts of all people, whether they knew the men or not, and the attendance of so many people at their funerals spoke volumes for the respect, gratitude and esteem in which these two brave fire-fighters were held.I also agree wholeheartedly with the tributes paid in this House to the members of the emergency services in all their forms.  The well-being of society and our national community depends on the dedication and commitment of these brave and good women and men and we can never express our gratitude too often for their service to us all.  I acknowledge the presence in the Gallery of members of Brian and Mark's families, their friends and colleagues in the fire services, including Councillor John Byrne, who is a member of Wicklow County Council, and Margaret Cahill, whose sister and nephew died in another fire in Bray and who has led a long campaign to establish a full-time fire service in Bray.It is, as has been said previously, extremely appropriate that the members of Dáil Éireann debate the terrible tragedy which occurred in Bray on Wednesday, 26 September.  We, as representatives of the people, should reflect the people's views on this matter and should also formulate the appropriate response to this terrible event.  In that regard, I welcome this opportunity to express my views and acknowledge the spirit of the contributions made by Members on all sides of the House, particularly my constituency colleagues from the other parties.It is clear, having read the Opposition motion and the Government amendment, that what unites us is far greater than that which divides us.  We agree in our sincere expressions of sympathy to the bereaved families and colleagues of Brian Murray and Mark O'Shaughnessy.  We agree in our acknowledgement of the courageous and dedicated service of all members of the fire service, both full-time and retained, which is given to the public across the country.  We also agree that a number of independent investigations are necessary in order to inform us as to the likely cause or causes of the tragic fire on 26 September.  I, for one, totally respect the independence of the Health and Safety Authority and the Garda Síochána in this matter.There may not be full and total agreement on the extent to which the Farrell Grant Sparks report recommendations have been implemented, but I note the comments made by Deputy Liz McManus on local radio this morning when she acknowledged that at least some work has been done in implementing the recommendations.  The Minister of State, Deputy Roche, has outlined those here.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, in his speech to the House the previous evening committed himself to reviewing progress achieved to date in this matter and, furthermore, to consider all aspects in reaching his conclusions.I put on the record of this House my unflinching support for the provision of a full-time fire service for the Bray area.  I have attended the aftermath of fires in Bray, too numerous to mention, in the past 20 years and, on these occasions, I have sympathised with families who have lost loved ones in terrible circumstances.  I have committed myself to those families and I do so again tonight.  I will not rest until a full-time fire service is established in Bray and its environs.  The case for such a service is compelling and conclusive and the vast majority, if not all the people of Bray, agree with me on this issue.In this regard, as Deputy McManus generously acknowledged last night, when I was Cathaoirleach of Wicklow County Council, I requested that a feasibility study be drawn up by the council to establish the framework under which a full-time fire service could be provided.  This study is now complete.  It has gone on public display and many local people and campaigners have contributed their views.  The matter is now in the hands of Wicklow County Council and I urge councillors and council officials alike to work together to achieve that which we all wish to see achieved.An issue such as this should remain above party politics.  I agree that Dáil Éireann should, if possible, unite on the essential principles we wish to establish in response to the terrible tragedy in Bray and, accordingly, I appeal to all Members of this House to unite and support the Government amendment.  This is because it acknowledges the contribution made by Mark O'Shaughnessy and Brian Murray, indicates a willingness to implement necessary changes to the fire service on foot of the investigations into the fire and correctly acknowledges that the only organisation which can establish a full-time fire service in Bray is Wicklow County Council.  This is the correct response to the dreadful event of 26 September and I urge all Members to support it.  Go raibh maith agat.

I offer my sympathy and wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy which have been made inside and outside the House in respect of the sad deaths of Brian Murray and Mark O'Shaughnessy.This is one of those occasions where those of us who do not know people who die in tragedies are often deeply affected.  I remember speaking to Deputy McManus, if she does not mind me mentioning her, and telling her that I was struck by her interviews in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy and the manner in which it affected people.  I think she reflected the fact that it affected us all.Since the tragedy, I was struck by the courage and attitude of the families who have had to grieve in public, which I have no doubt must be very difficult, and yet have still focused on what they see as the campaign for what is right.  In that sense, we must not only support them but do what we can to facilitate the points of view they are expressing.I compliment Deputy Ciarán Lynch for his efforts in this regard because this is a very important debate and it is right that parliamentarians of all sides have an opportunity to pay tribute, not only to the fallen fire persons but to those in the fire services in Wicklow and throughout the country.  All of us should do that.  All of us who go to our beds at night and get up in the morning feel safe because we know the emergency services are there and their record around the country is excellent.In respect of the tragedy, I remember being struck by how terrible it must be for families to imagine people going to work as we all do every morning, breaking off their normal work to do heroic public service and not coming home.  I do not live in Wicklow and did not know the men involved but, as a public representative, I want to say how affected my community and I have been.I notice that colleagues have made brief reference to the situation in their own constituencies.  I do not want to talk much about my constituency but, like colleagues, I want to take the opportunity to record my appreciation for the emergency services in Dublin South-West and to put on record that in this debate, it is right that we all raise issues of concern to us with regard to the emergency services.  I noticed last night that colleagues did that.I have often made the point that there is only one fire station located in my constituency of Dublin South-West.  As the fire personnel in the Gallery know, there is only one fire station in South Dublin County Council's administrative area.  The local fire station is located in Belgard which was upgraded to a two-pump station in 2001.  Fire services in my area are provided by the city council.  This debate will continue but there are other issues relating to the fire services which I hope in future weeks we will debate.
#PaulNicholasGogartyGP	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-party	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-dob	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	431	I join my fellow parliamentarians in offering my sincere condolences to the families of Brian Murray and Mark O'Shaughnessy.  At this time, we think of all members of the fire services who have given their lives in carrying out their duties to the highest calibre.The efforts made by members of the fire services are often underestimated, usually going without recognition except when tragedy strikes.  The members of the fire service are there all the time, even carrying out extra duties.  For example in the Dublin Mid-West constituency, funding for a defibrillator was raised, largely through the idea of Deputy Billy Timmins.  Of their own volition, members of the fire services will train volunteers in the use of the defibrillator.  That is just one example of how they contribute to the community.I thank Deputy Ciarán Lynch and the Labour Party for the opportunity to speak on this motion.  It is a sombre time so I will not get into party politics.  I acknowledge the comments of the Minister, Deputy John Gormley, that it would be premature to do further work until the investigations under way are completed.  The Minister stated that any necessary changes arising from the investigations would be examined and acted upon by him.  I am not an expert in this area, but a family member was involved in a tragedy in a serious fire.I would like the original report on fire services, completed five years ago, to be implemented quicker than it has been.  I welcome the publication of an interim report in June 2007 and the fact that phase 1 of the programme has been completed.  This debate is necessary, not just in terms of paying respects, but also as a kick-start to a sometimes slow bureaucracy.There are some relevant issues pertaining to the Dublin Mid-West constituency, particularly in the new town being developed in Adamstown and Lucan, one of the fastest growing towns.  Despite this, Lucan does not have a fire station.  While a fire station was allocated to Adamstown, the local authority noted when An Bord Pleanála made its decision on the Adamstown project that there were no plans by Dublin Fire Brigade to construct a new fire station there but it was prudent to have one set aside.  Given that it is the city authority rather than the local authority that is in charge, I hope through this forum to put pressure on the fire services and Dublin City Council on the need for a fire station in Lucan, which has a population of over 36,000.  Adamstown, when completed, will add an extra 25,000 people to population.  With local traffic gridlock and road works on the M50, it is impossible for the fire services to reasonably carry out its role from Blanchardstown or Tallaght fire stations.  We are lucky a major tragedy has not yet happened.I raised the matter of the nearby part-time service in Leixlip, which covers Lucan, but there was a negative response from the fire service and other sources.  I understand the logic of each local authority having its responsibility but at the same time common sense dictates that if there is a fire station nearby to an area not properly served by one, it should be used until one is built.Many fire stations, including Blanchardstown and Tallaght, do not have equipment that can reach further than a seven-storey building.  Adamstown's proposed fire station will need equipment that can reach the proposed 13-storey buildings for the town project.
#CiaranCuffeGP	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-party	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-dob	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	432	Two weeks ago when I was in my office, I heard gasps of shock from next door when my colleague, Senator Déirdre de Búrca, heard the dark news from Little Bray.  The grief we felt can never match the loss of loved ones for a family.  As a child growing up off Ballyman Lane, Shankill, I could hear the sirens from Bray when the fire services were called out.  We always paused to pray and think of those who voluntarily gave their time to help others.  It is still the case in Bray that people voluntarily put their lives at risk for others and sometimes lives are lost.I agree with most of this Private Members' motion.  We must examine a national authority to co-ordinate fire and civil protection.  When I consider in my lifetime the expansion of Bray and Shankill, growing from several hundred people to 20,000, the location of a full-time service in the area must be examined.  The several inquiries under way must run their course.  After this we can examine what has been left out.The fire station in Kill Avenue is five miles away from Bray.  It is not far and we must examine how best existing resources are being used.  I do not believe county boundaries can be an absolute line in ensuring the right services are in the right place at the right time.From my previous occupation as an architect, I know much more can be done in fire safety for buildings.  The issuing of fire alarms has improved in recent years but I am not convinced enough has been done in ensuring compliance with building regulations.  We must revisit the issue of compliance, a matter which I raised in the Twenty-ninth Dáil.  New and older buildings must be inspected to ensure they reach a high level of fire protection.A feasibility study has been undertaken for County Wicklow but we must examine the expanding areas of Dublin with a view to providing the same if not a higher level of fire services than is being provided.Nothing can bring the two fire-fighters back.  There is an onerous responsibility on the shoulders of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley.  We will look carefully at the issues raised in the motion before the House.  We all grieve for those who were lost.  We have a huge responsibility that it is not an omission on our part to ensure the highest level of protection for those who work full time and voluntarily in our fire service.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	433	I wish to share time with Deputies Brian O'Shea, Willie Penrose, Jack Wall, Kathleen Lynch and Joanna Tuffy, with the permission of the House.I thank our party leader, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, and our spokesperson, Deputy Ciarán Lynch, for bringing this motion before the House.  The way a motion such as this comes before the House in Private Members' time is that the party debates what the most important issue of the time is.  We have such an opportunity about every three weeks.  On this occasion, Deputy Liz McManus pressed on us the necessity and importance of having this matter debated in the House.  I want to thank Deputy McManus for ensuring this issue received the priority it deserves, hence this debate tonight.I welcome the colleagues and families of the fallen firemen.  Along with others I want to express my sympathy to them on the tragedy that has occurred.  Perhaps it might be some consolation for them that here in the national Parliament the tragedy is now being debated and the issues raised by the firemen repeatedly before their death, and by their colleagues since and before, are now being discussed by the Dáil.  The tragedy therefore becomes a catalyst for good — and only good can come from our debating it here.  It is a very heavy price to pay for the causation of a debate in the House.  I repeatedly ask myself why we have to wait for a tragedy to move on what people directly involved, such as the firemen, constantly tell us is a requirement.I want to pay tribute to the existing fire service.  In my constituency it is entirely a retained or part-time service.  There is a station in Newbridge, Naas, Athy, Maynooth, Monasterevin and Leixlip.  We have 56 part-time firemen and four people, full-time, in charge.  There were 1,774 calls last year.  They cover a population of 186,000 60,000 homes, roughly.  We have industrial complexes, a university, high rise buildings and the service is simply not capable of providing the coverage that is required on a part-time basis.  There is an absolute necessity to ensure we have a full-time fire service, not just in Wicklow and neighbouring Kildare, but in the country generally.  A consultants' report has been before Government for a considerable time advocating that.What we are proposing in the Dáil this evening is straightforward.  We are proposing that Dáil Members support the call by their colleagues for an independent investigation into the death of the firefighters.  The motion regrets the failure of the Government to implement in full the recommendations of the Farrell Grant Sparks review of fire safety and fire services in Ireland submitted to the then Department of the Environment and Local Government in January 2002.  It calls for the establishment of a national authority for fire and civil protection emergency services.  That is one of the key recommendations of that review.  It calls, as well, for the establishment of full-time fire services in areas of high population such as Bray.The Government, comprising Fianna Fáil, the Green Party and the Progressive Democrats, is rejecting that call and proposing a meaningless collection of platitudes as an amendment.  I should not expect one word of that amendment to be different if the Green Party was not in office.  Deputy John Gormley, as the Green Party Minister responsible, might as well have been in Opposition for all the effect he had on what is before the House tonight.  Let us examine what the amendment contains to remind the House what is being suggested.  The Government's essential bottom line is that arrangements for the provision of fire services in all areas of the country are a matter for the relevant fire authorities, which expend an estimated €240 million per annum.  It is saying, in effect, that local authorities must provide the fire service.  This is not just a matter for local authorities, but a national issue that requires a decision at national level.  There must be funding provision at national level for full-time fire services in the local authorities.  Implementation at local level is a matter for local authorities but decisions and funding are required from Government at national level.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	434	I, too, want to extend my profound sympathy to the families and colleagues of Mr. Brian Murray and Mr. Mark O'Shaughnessy on the terrible tragedy that befell both those brave men, and to the members of the full-time and retained fire service across the country.I compliment my colleague, the Labour Party leader, Deputy Eamon Gilmore as well as Deputies Ciarán Lynch and Liz McManus for bringing this most important Private Members' motion before the Dáil.  The motion is essentially seeking two things, namely, the establishment of a national fire authority and full-time fire services in areas of high population such as Bray.  To a large extent these two issues are interlinked, but the national fire authority comes first because it will facilitate the effective development of the fire services.  As regards the establishment of the national authority, in his speech last night, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, stated that there were a number of differing views on the merits of a fire authority.  It would have helped the debate, I believe, had the Minister shared these differing views with the House, but effectively this major issue was side-stepped.  The Minister of State, Deputy Tony Killeen did not mention the national fire service at all in his speech.The final Farrell Grant Sparks report, Review of Fire Safety and Fire Services in Ireland, which was issued in January 2002, contained a recommendation on the setting up of a national fire authority.  Just prior to the general election in 2002, on 10 May, a letter issued on behalf of the Taoiseach stating: "Fianna Fáil believes that the report's recommendations constitute a balanced package of measures, which must be implemented without cherrypicking."  In May 2004, the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Martin Cullen, stated his belief in the need for a national fire authority that "provides leadership and direction and delivers an effective national response which local authorities working on their own cannot bring about".  Deputy Cullen stated he would bring firm proposals to Cabinet seeking the establishment of a new national fire authority.  This authority would be the over-arching body for fire services in Ireland.In December 2004 I tabled a Dáil question to the new Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Dick Roche, asking him whether the proportion of the €1 million set aside by his predecessor for setting up the national fire authority had been spent in 2004.  He informed me that other than the €19 million provided for fire service capital projects, no other money had been spent in 2004 on the implementation of the review.  Also on that date, I asked when the Minister intended to set up the national fire authority, but I got no direct answer to that question.  Again, when I asked the Minister in January 2007, about the proposals he had on setting up the national fire authority, he replied that his priority under the fire services change programme was not to pursue further institutional change at this time, but to use available resources to bring about direct improvements in these key areas.This is not a time for scoring political points, as  other Members have pointed out.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, said last night that the establishment of a national fire authority was considered prior to the launch of the changed programme and since the Bray tragedy has again been the subject of debate.  There is a real need, I believe, for a national fire authority.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has the power in this area, but responsibility rests with the local authorities.  The local authorities are at all times in the front line of fire services and any tragedies that may occur are disastrous.  The Department also controls the funding for all capital projects.  I understand some fire services still purchase secondhand vehicles, which have had a full life in the UK as frontline vehicles, just to keep their service operating.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	435	I compliment my colleague, Deputy Ciarán Lynch, our party leader, Deputy Gilmore, and Deputy McManus on tabling this important motion.  Like the whole population and all my fellow parliamentarians, I was shocked and saddened to learn of the deaths of Brian Murray and Mark O'Shaughnessy who died in the line of duty fighting a fire in Bray on 26 September last.  Like everyone in the House, I join in the expressions of heartfelt and deepest sympathy to the families and colleagues of these brave men who lost their lives protecting others, like ourselves, on that fateful day.  At a minimum, we owe it to these men and others who have lost their lives to act now and, in particular, to focus on the recommendations and, more particularly, the central recommendation of the Farrell Grant Sparks review of January 2002 which was the establishment of a national fire authority.  We must stop foot dragging, putting forward excuses and looking for more reports and analysis.  We must ensure an appropriate response is forthcoming.  It should be formulated now.I could not but be struck watching Mary Murray, who I understand is in the Visitors Gallery, on national television in the past week or so.  She gave an analysis, assessment and proposals in this regard which were to the point and profound.  If we took on board what she said — she was obviously acting on lots of information she gathered from her late husband and his colleagues — we would know how to tackle this problem.  There is no need for any further reports or analysis in this regard.I have seen at first hand the excellent emergency services working on our behalf throughout this country and I salute them.  We see their bravery, courage, dedication, commitment and discipline.  I refer to the fire and rescue services in my constituency, in particular, in County Westmeath.  Mullingar, Kilbeggan and Castlepollard are under the control of Westmeath County Council while the Athlone fire service is under that of Athlone Town Council.  The 50 personnel involved in these services have done tremendous work.  There are 430 to 440 fire incidents each year in the Mullingar area.  The same applies to Athlone.  There are approximately 200 or 300 such incidents each year in the Castlepollard-Kilbeggan areas.One of the issues that arises, and about which I have heard first hand from the firemen, is one which could be tackled tomorrow.  There are no standards or guidelines in respect of the extent of fire cover areas.  For example, Mullingar fire station services Kinnegad and up to the eastbound carriageway close to Enfield.  There has been a call by community groups and others for the provision of a new fire station in Kinnegad which, as most people know, has experienced a significant increase in population and which serves an ever-expanding hinterland.The Minister of State, Deputy Roche, made some interesting and thought provoking points on the establishment of quangos.  It is true the establishment of some quangos has diminished the role of this Parliament.  However, the same argument cannot be made in regard to a national fire authority.  Putting in place such an authority would ensure uniformity of standards throughout the country and would eliminate the situation that prevails in which there are rostered calls in some areas where the firemen involved are guaranteed they will be on call as opposed to some other areas where such a rostered system is not employed.The establishment of a national fire authority has the full support of all the chief fire officers in the country.  Let us stop the foot dragging and procrastination.  The Farrell Grant Sparks report was commissioned and came forward with a central recommendation.  As I said, there is no need for further reports or feasibility studies.  Let us do what is right now.We must acknowledge the invaluable and essential role played by the retained fire service and its role in fighting fires and protecting lives and property in their communities and further afield.  I have seen at first hand their arrival at the scene of accidents and how they often put their own lives at risk to protect and save our lives and the trauma with which they must deal.The thrust of the motion calls for the establishment of a national fire authority.  It would ensure maximum co-ordination and a uniformity of structure of training and service delivery throughout the country.  If funding is required, let central Government step into the breach.  As described by my colleague, Deputy Ciarán Lynch, a fireman's job is one of duty which is underpinned by the courage of going to work each day and having to deal with and manage dangerous and life-threatening situations.  We must commend the members of the full-time and retained fire service on their great work on behalf of us and the wider community.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	436	I, too, thank my colleagues, Deputies Ciarán Lynch, Gilmore and McManus, for tabling this motion.  It is an opportunity for us to speak on a very important matter but, unfortunately, the debate is tinged with great sadness due to the deaths of two heroic firemen in Bray.  Like Deputy Penrose, I was taken by Mrs. Murray's knowledge of the fire service and the need for improvements and changes when she spoke on almost all the news stations and some of the television stations.  It was obvious that knowledge was not learned overnight but in conversation with her late husband in the Murray household over a long time.  It was amazing to hear this woman make a simple plea to the Government on what was wrong and what would rectify the situation.This reminds me of when I was 14 years of age, which was neither today nor yesterday, when something similar happened in regard to the ambulance service in Kildare.  There was a very poor ambulance service at that time and there was a tragedy in which three people were killed.  Suddenly the Government, the local authority and everyone was interested in it, which brought about a momentum to make changes.  Unfortunately, the same circumstances apply in this case.We regularly see this Government, which is in its third term in office, create an authority to stymie debate in this House.  This is another instance in which it is using the same mechanism but in a different format.  It is saying the fire service does not come under the remit of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government but under that of local authorities and that we must fight for this in our own areas.  That is where a big mistake is being made.  Once again the Government is using flippant words to prevent the establishment of a national fire authority that would benefit communities which need a fire service.  It is time the Minister stood up and was counted.  This is another area in which Fianna Fáil has decided to protect funding.  It does not want to increase funding to the fire service to provide a much needed service which will become even greater as we move forward.Demographics show that many towns and cities are overcrowded with cars and vehicles which creates a problem for retained fire-fighters.  As Deputy Stagg rightly said, we are very proud of that service in County Kildare because it has never let us down, but it is under constant pressure due to the demographics of towns and villages.  We are looking more and more towards a full-time service.  In many cases, the difference between life and death is minutes.  The same is the case with the ambulance service.  Those vital first five or six minutes make all the difference.  The fire station is at the edge of my town and many of the retained fire-fighters work in the town.  It is difficult for them to get through the town to the fire station and those minutes mean so much to so many.Tonight represents a landmark for the Green Party.  It is a landmark for Deputy Gormley, as Minister, because it presents him with an opportunity to say something needs to be done and that his party will lead the charge and not allow Fianna Fáil to decide against putting a national authority in place.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	437	I thank Deputy Ciarán Lynch, Deputy Liz McManus and the Labour Party in general for affording me the opportunity to debate this issue, about which the entire country is talking.  It goes without saying that we extend our sympathy to the families of Brian Murray and Mark O'Shaughnessy.  A tragedy such as that which befell these two firefighters could happen to any one of our husbands, brothers or relations in the morning.Someone once said that if something is worth doing, and if it is established in one's head as the right thing to do, it becomes easy.  There were gestures of sympathy from the Government side but sympathy will not take us very far on this issue.  It is obvious from Mary Murray's many interviews that she is a woman of incredible courage.  Sympathy is well and good but she wants action and to ensure that the firefighters in the Visitors Gallery will not be put in the same position as their comrades who died.We must ask ourselves whether we consider a fire service essential and the answer ought to be "Yes".  Would we adopt the attitude to the fire service in respect of the health service or the education system?  Would we tell the people in Bray that because their rate base is not big enough to provide for a health service, they cannot have one?  Would we tell them that because there is not enough money in the town and its environs to provide primary and secondary schools, they cannot have them?  We would not because it would be outrageous and an act of lunacy, yet this is what we are saying about the fire service, which is essential.The last people we want to see at our doors are the garda and fireman, but when we need them and when they react on time with the equipment necessary to save our lives, they have our undying gratitude.  If we consider the fire service essential, as we ought to do, we cannot tell the people of Bray they cannot have it because they cannot afford it.  The Government must deal with this issue.  If it is a question of money, it must come up trumps.  The days of telling people they cannot have a service because they cannot afford it are long gone and the comrades of the two fallen men and their families will not stand by any longer and accept the existing service when they clearly know it is only the endeavours of those involved that have prevented tragedies in the past and will continue to do so in the future.  We must step up to the mark.Inequality of access to services must be prevented.  Women in the south have a greater chance of dying of cancer than anybody else because they do not have the same access to services as women in the rest of the country.  This is not good enough for us and, in the context of the fire service, it is most definitely not good enough for the people of Bray or the rest of the country.I call on the Government to recognise its responsibility to ensure the health and safety of the people.  If there are areas where the rate base is not sufficiently broad or strong to support essential services, the Government must step in and provide the necessary funding.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	438	I, too, sympathise with the Murray and O'Shaughnessy families.  It is very important that immediate action by the Government be the outcome of this debate.  The action should be as outlined in the Labour Party motion and include the implementation of the recommendations of the Farrell Grant Sparks review.   A national fire authority and full-time fire services should be established and there should be an independent investigation of the Bray fire tragedy.  As Deputy Jack Wall stated, it is very important that the existing momentum lead to change, beginning from now.The Farrell Grant Sparks review indicates that very impressive steps were taken by the consultants to ensure a broad and inclusive consultation process in the lead-up to its publication.  There were written submissions and e-mail feedback and 40 stakeholders were contacted.  Some 200 representative groups were invited to meetings of seven regional fora, and there were in excess of 160 meetings and consultations.  The model of consultation was very good and must have led to great expectations among those involved.  However, it must be very disillusioning for them to realise the recommendations of the report have not been implemented five years after its publication.The most important point of the report was the call for a national fire authority.  Let me address points Deputies made in this regard and the reference to a quango.  I was involved in local government and very protective of its powers.  The national fire authority would centralise functions that are currently dispersed, including those of the local fire safety authorities and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  It would very much retain the national and local government functions.  The idea behind the national fire authority is to inform local authorities about their functions.  Local authorities do not have the national standards required to ensure they carry out their role properly.The key recommendation of the report was that the authority be set up.  Page 93 recommends that the authority be announced and brought into being immediately, given the acceptance of the recommendations by the Minister.  I urge the immediate implementation of the recommendations, including the establishment of the national fire authority.

I extend my condolences to all those connected to the two men, including members of the fire service in Bray.I thank all the Deputies who contributed to this debate and commend them on their measured approach thereto.  Many points have been made by them on the provision of a fire service.  The House is agreed that the fire services provide a great public service.  The retained fire service is a highly trained, well-equipped and professional service.  Together with the full-time service personnel, the personnel in the retained service serve their communities in every part of this country with the utmost dedication.  I express the Government's gratitude to all of them tonight.I wish to address several issues raised in the debate.  I reiterate what the Minister said last night on the provision of a full-time fire service in Bray and elsewhere in the country.  Some Deputies suggested the Government was in some way ignoring this issue by passing responsibility for decisions on the type of service provided locally to local fire authorities.  The fact is that the provision of a fire service is the statutory responsibility of the relevant local fire authority.

When that project has been completed, it will help the fire authorities to carry out a risk analysis in their functional areas when determining the cover and resources which are needed.  I can assure the Opposition Deputies who have been calling for an independent investigation into the Bray tragedy that three investigations, being undertaken by the Garda Síochána, the Health and Safety Authority and Wicklow County Council, are under way.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, has asked the three authorities to make the findings of their investigations available to the Department.  He has stated categorically that he will consider any lessons learned from the outcomes of those investigations as he works to support and develop fire services in his role as Minister.  He is awaiting the outcome of the investigations.  A number of Deputies suggested during the course of this debate that successive Governments have not adhered to or implemented the recommendations of the report of the tribunal of inquiry into the 1981 Stardust fire and the 2002 Farrell Grant Sparks review of fire safety and services.

All of the recommendations made in the Stardust report received full and careful consideration and were either implemented or taken into account as fire safety policy was formulated and local authority fire services were developed in the intervening period.  Very significant improvements have been made in all areas of the fire service.  Investment has been made in infrastructure, equipment, more staff, better training, improved communications and in legislation.  Most of the recommendations made in the Farrell Grant Sparks review have been implemented.Last night, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, and the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, outlined the significant progress being made in each of the four areas being advanced under the fire services change programme, which has been put in place by the Government to implement the key fire safety and fire services recommendations of Farrell Grant Sparks.  The progress report that was prepared after phase 1 of the programme was published by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government last June and can be downloaded from the Department's website.The change programme needs to be considered in conjunction with the strengthened fire safety legislation of 2003.  The major emergency development programme, which was approved by the Government on foot of the review of the framework for major emergency management, was commissioned in late 2004.  The success of the capital investment programme has seen fire services infrastructure, including fire stations, fire appliance fleet, fire station equipment, communications and mobilisation facilities, brought on a par with the best international standards.  The management structure in local authority fire services has also been strengthened.  It is clear that many of the essential elements for the provision of an effective and modern fire emergency service are in place.  The Government believes that such important services, which are aimed at securing the safety of the public, can benefit from an continuing focus on appropriate modernisation initiatives.  The Government is committed to the process of change.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, said last night that he will consider all options before he reaches any conclusions on the next phase of the change programme.  The Government will continue to bring about real and substantive change so the fire service continues to be in line with international standards.

As someone who lives in Shankill, just two miles from Bray, I have close connections with the community in that town.  Therefore, I understand the real sense of shock that was felt in Bray and throughout the country at the untimely and tragic deaths of Brian Murray and Mark O'Shaughnessy while fighting a fire at a disused factory in the town two weeks ago.  Having spent many years as a trade union official representing full-time and retained firefighters, I appreciate the work that is done by firefighters.I hope the families of Brian Murray and Mark O'Shaughnessy will take some consolation from the genuinely warm tributes which were paid to both men during this debate over the past two nights.  While there may be differences in opinion among the various parties in the House about how to deal with the broader organisational issues which have been raised by the two deaths, every Deputy from every party acknowledges the heroism of the two men and the absolute dedication to duty they displayed, not just in responding to this fire but also to the many other fires and incidents they were called to deal with during their service with Bray fire brigade.Death is always tragic, but if there can ever be nobility in death, it is when people lay down their lives to save others.  Thankfully, the loss of fire brigade personnel while fighting fires has been a relatively rare phenomenon in this country.  Reliance on the fire brigade to deal with a simple chimney fire or to cope with the aftermath of a serious accident is something we take for granted.  Our society could not function without knowing there are brave men and women at the other end of a telephone who will respond at a moment's notice and come to our rescue.  As Deputy Kathleen Lynch said earlier, the fire service is an essential service.This is not the first time we have had a shocking fire tragedy in this country.  A fire at the Noyeks showrooms in Parnell Street in Dublin in March 1972 killed eight people.  The largely forgotten fire at the Central Hotel in Bundoran in August 1980 killed ten people, including five children.  Worst of all, and seared on the collective memory of anyone who lived through that period, was the shocking Stardust disaster that took the lives of 49 young people on St. Valentine's night 1981.  While we would have had many more such disasters were it not for the courage and commitment of members of the fire service, each of the fires I have mentioned raised questions about the adequacy of our fire service.  In each case, there were reviews, reports and recommendations, many of which were never implemented.The Noyeks fire was followed by the establishment of a working party by the then Minister for Local Government.  Large parts of the working party's report, which was published in 1975, were never implemented.  The Government established a formal tribunal of inquiry following the Stardust fire.  While the tribunal did not reach any conclusions about the origin of the fire that satisfied the relatives of those who died, Mr. Justice Keane produced a number of recommendations that were not implemented.  One of the key recommendations was that an inspectorate be established to oversee the fire service, but no such inspectorate exists, 26 years after the Stardust tragedy.The next major step in efforts to improve the fire service and learn from the lessons of past disasters was the decision in 2001 to ask a consultancy firm, Farrell Grant Sparks, to produce a report on this country's fire services.  The report promptly produced by the firm, Review of Fire Safety and Fire Services in Ireland, was submitted to the Department of the Environment and Local Government in January 2002.  It was not until February 2005, however, that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government announced the initiation of the fire services change programme, which was supposed to implement the Farrell Grant Sparks recommendations.  The Government refused to implement the key recommendation of that report — the proposal to establish a national fire authority — despite a commitment given during the 2002 general election campaign by the Taoiseach's programme manager that it would do so.  In a letter to which Deputy Brian O'Shea has already referred, sent on 10 May 2002 to the secretary of the chief fire officers' association, the Taoiseach's programme manager said:Fianna Fáil believes that the report's recommendations constitute a balanced package of measures which must be implemented without cherry-picking.  Fianna Fáil is committed to this course of action.The Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche and Deputy Behan, as well as the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, have again suggested that of course this is a responsibility for the local authorities.  The point is that the establishment of a full-time fire service for major centres such as Bray is inextricably bound up with the need to establish a national fire authority because at the end of the day, this comes down to a question of resources.I cannot put it more eloquently than the way in which the former Minister, Deputy Martin Cullen, put it on 5 May 2004, when he travelled to Wexford and addressed the annual conference of the chief fire officers' association.  I quote from his script:I believe in the need for a national fire authority that provides leadership and direction and delivers an effective national response that local authorities working on their own cannot bring about.  It is against this back drop that I will bring to Cabinet firm proposals to seek the establishment of a national fire authority.  The authority will be the over-arching body for fire services in Ireland.Those proposals were never brought to Cabinet or if they were, they were never acted upon and three years later, we have Ministers from that same Department now making the very opposite case.We must accept the need for fundamental change and reform in the fire service.  We must accept that a structure which evolved when Ireland was a very different country, largely agricultural, with relatively small numbers living in towns and cities, can no longer provide us with the level of safety and protection we need.  We must end the situation where, as one chief fire officer has put it, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, has all the power without any of the responsibility.  It can effectively walk away from any disaster and lay the blame at the doors of the local authority.  We now urgently need a national fire authority that would provide enhanced protection against fire, better training and equipment for all personnel and ensure a consistent level of service across the country.  We also need to accept that densely populated areas can no longer rely on part-time or retained fires services to provide the level of protection required.  This is not in any way to question the dedication or commitment of the part-time fire fighters who staff the retained fire service.  On the contrary, Brian Murray and Mark O'Shaughnessy and the other members of the retained fire service, showed exceptional commitment by ensuring that they were available, often 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to drop everything at a phone call and head off to fight a fire.  This they did, for what most of us would regard as a pittance by way of monetary return.In a modern society, speed of reaction is crucial to a fire alert.  The time it takes for a brigade to reach a fire can literally mean the difference between life and death.  The extra time of ten or 15 minutes it can take for part-time fire fighters to mobilise means simply that a retained fire service cannot respond with the same speed as a full-time service.  There is always a role for the retained service in support of the full-time service.In a little more than five minutes this House will make a decision on the motion.  The decision of this House as a result of the vote, is a vote on a motion that calls for action or a vote for a Government amendment that is about inaction, that is about more reports, that is about noting more progresses and more reviews and so on.  The Labour Party motion which is before the House tonight calls for two things — first, the establishment of a national fire authority and, second, the establishment of full-time services in large areas of population such as Bray.  We are calling for this because we do not want a repeat of what has happened in Bray and what has happened many times before.  We want to see the best possible fire service in this country to protect our people and to provide the highest level of safety for those who work in it.  There is no excuse for postponement.We are calling for no more tonight than what was contained in an official Government report, not once, but three times in the past two decades.  Each of those reports was produced as a result of fire tragedies.  We are calling for no more tonight than what the former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government himself said he would do three years ago, namely, establish a national fire authority.  The Government can shift the responsibility as often as it likes to the individual local authorities and the Minister of State can wash his hands of it as often as he likes by saying that the Government and the Department have no responsibility as this is a statutory function of the local authorities.  The reality is that given the way in which local authorities are financed and the resources that are required to ensure that we have high quality fire services, local authorities will not be able to establish full-time services in the areas in which they are required.  As regards the two requirements of a national fire authority and full-time services in the areas of large population concentration, this House has an opportunity tonight to make a decision to establish a national fire authority and to have full-time fire services in areas like Bray or to funk it once again, as was done after every major fire tragedy that has occurred in this country.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	455	In closing the debate this evening I refer to the opening remarks made last night that there was a narrative leading up to the events of 26 September this year which goes right back to the Stardust disaster of 1981.  As I said last night, an unfortunate and recurrent theme of that narrative is one in which the State has failed to strategically respond to these tragic situations and has instead become crisis-driven at best and has consistently failed to act upon its own recommendations, namely the Farrell Grant Sparks report and the Stardust tribunal report.Over the course of the debate, the House heard many accounts of how the fire service carries out its duties across the country and I thank all those who contributed to the debate.  In reviewing this commentary, it is clear that despite the exceptional job being done by both the full-time and retained fire services, many structural and day-to-day difficulties hinder them in carrying out their duties to the best of their ability.I refer to the two key aspects of this debate. Should there be an independent inquiry into the deaths of sub-officer Brian Murray and firefighter Mark O'Shaughnessy?  Is there a need to establish a national authority for fire and civil protection services?  The answer is yes.  Both those questions are inextricably linked to one another.  If an independent investigation of the Bray tragedy were to be carried out in the morning, it would show there is a need for a national fire authority.I refer to the comments of the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe.  The model of risk assessment proposed by the Minister of State is risk assessment contained within the local authority boundary areas.  A national fire authority would conduct risk assessment on a nation-wide basis and, as a result, the Dún Laoghaire fire brigade would have been in Bray because the local boundary would not have been a division.The national fire authority would provide a uniformity of structure, a uniformity of training and a uniformity of standards and what is most important, a uniformity of service delivery across the country.The Minister, Deputy Gormley's response to the motion, shows that he is unsure as to how to proceed and he demonstrated his uncertainty by his contribution to the debate.  The Government amendment to the Labour Party motion demonstrates no conviction, no direction and no political originality.  It is simply an attempt to mirror what happened during the tenure of the former Minister, Deputy Roche's, term in office when it is clear he changed the direction of how fire strategy was to be developed.  His predecessors in both Deputy Cullen and Deputy Dempsey, had a clear idea to implement in full the key recommendations and not the cherrypicked recommendations referred to by the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe.  The key recommendation of the establishment of a national fire authority was removed from the agenda.  It was unfortunate to hear the Minister, Deputy Gormley, say that tonight.This motion is an opportunity for the House to rise above the standard responses involved in Government and Opposition debate.  It is also an opportunity to demonstrate that the tragic events of 26 September in Bray have begun to set in motion the creation of the fire service that Ireland needs.  Most importantly, it is an opportunity to put in place the type of fire authority the brave personnel of our fire services deserve and our society requires.

#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	458	A Cheann Comhairle, I thank you for the opportunity to speak on an issue of great importance both for the implementation of the national health strategy and for the provision of health care services in the constituency of Dublin South-East.  First, I would like to focus on the facilities provided in St. Luke's Hospital in Rathgar.  As residents and patients alike know, plans have been under way since July 2005 to transfer the oncology services of St. Luke's Hospital to a centre of excellence in St. James's Hospital.  This decision was taken by the Minister based on the report, The Development of Radiation Oncology Services in Ireland.The decision was designed to ensure that radiation oncology is integrated with all other aspects of cancer care including surgery and medical oncology.  What this means in plain language is that cancer patients will receive all the treatment they need under the one roof, experts will be available in the one location, and all available technology and services will be on site.  It is known as multidisciplinary care and it makes sense.  It is in line with international best practice and it has been proven that patients have a 20% higher chance of survival if they are treated in specialist centres.  Patient survival is the objective of health care strategy and I therefore welcome the initiative.Members of the board of St. Luke's Hospital have also fully committed to supporting this decision.  They recognise that it is in line with international best practice and is designed to ensure optimal outcomes for patients.  They are fully behind it.  They have also ensured that the expertise and ethos of St. Luke's will be at the heart of the new arrangement in St. James's Hospital.However, two major points need further consideration in this debate.  First, there is a chronic shortage of step-down facilities in Dublin South-East and second, the site of St. Luke's is a unique place for respite and palliative care.  It provides a calm and tranquil setting in which to recuperate and undergo serious health treatment.  This should not be ignored.  Anybody who has been there will know there is a special quality about St. Luke's.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	459	Exactly.
#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	460	While we can sit in offices and work in laboratories and come up with the best ways to implement policy and assign treatment centres, we must also acknowledge the human aspect and the more subtle qualities of such a place.  We must respect that there is a tradition of palliative care on this site and that enormous work has been done through the years by people who wish to continue providing care on this site.  There has been investment in new radiotherapy treatment units or linear accelerators which will increase the treatment capacity of the hospital by up to 25%.  It may seem odd that new services are being provided in a centre whose cancer services are to be transferred.  However, the reason for this is to ensure the quality of service to cancer patients during the years that it will take to complete the transfer.  I welcome the investment of almost €13 million in coming years, which shows a commitment to cancer care and shows foresight.I understand no decisions have been made regarding the future of the St. Luke's site.  However, this is simply not good enough.  Residents, patients and doctors cannot hang in the balance without knowing their fate.  They deserve assurance that this site with its long tradition of providing health care will remain in the hands of the HSE and will become a step-down facility that will continue to serve the community.  If people like Kay Bradbury and the many community groups had not fought the case for the Meath Hospital, it would not be the successful health facility it is today.The Minister recently said that St Luke's Hospital would be used in the best interests of the health services.  The Minister must make a clear statement that this hospital will not be sold to private developers.  I urge the Minister not to engage in any coyness and end the uncertainty by confirming that the St. Luke's site will provide step down facilities which are chronically needed.  I do not want to be fobbed off with an ambiguous answer.

#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	463	I am speaking on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Harney, who is unavailable.  I thank the Deputy for raising this issue, which provides an opportunity to reaffirm the Government's commitment to services for older people.  The development of such services is a high priority.  This is reflected in the funding committed to services for older people in the 2006 and 2007 budgets.  In 2006, the Government funded the largest ever expansion in services for older people with a full year cost of €150 million.  In budget 2007, a full year package of €255 million has been allocated for services for older people.  This gives a total of more than €400 million added to services for older people over two years.  Government policy on older people is to support people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and, where this is not possible, to support access to quality long-term residential care.  This policy approach is renewed and developed in the latest partnership agreement, Towards 2016.While the main emphasis will continue to be on providing supports that help older people to remain in their own home for as long as possible, additional long-stay residential places will be required in the coming years to meet the needs of an ageing population.  Last year, the HSE, in conjunction with Prospectus, undertook a needs assessment of bed capacity requirements in the areas of long-stay, dementia specific and respite care beds.  This report was submitted to the Department of Health and Children in September 2006.  While the report indicates a small national surplus of long-stay beds, it also notes that this surplus masks the uneven distribution of beds between and within regions.  In particular, HSE Dublin north east and HSE south have an immediate requirement for additional beds.As part of the overall investment package for the development of services for older people, the Department and the HSE have prioritised the delivery of additional public continuing care beds through the development of community nursing units in large urban centres in both Dublin and Cork together with the expansion and the development of additional facilities across all regions.  The Department is in discussions with the HSE regarding the delivery of this additional capacity.  I understand the HSE has plans to provide additional step down-long stay facilities in the south Dublin area.  Locations are being identified in the context of the 2008 capital plan.The transfer of services from St. Luke's Hospital to new facilities at St. James's Hospital is not due to take place for a number of years.  In the meantime, two additional linear accelerators will be commissioned at St. Luke's in early 2008 and two replacement linear accelerators will be commissioned later in 2008.  These will provide much needed interim capacity pending the roll-out of the national plan for radiation oncology.  No decisions have been taken on the future use of the site and facilities at St. Luke's.  However, the Minister intends to ensure these resources are utilised in the best interest of the health services.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	464	I wish to share time with Deputy Seymour Crawford.I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for the opportunity to raise this matter.  There was rightly a great deal of concern over the past week about the loss of 2,000 jobs at Amgen in Cork.  However, this debate relates to a national industry employing 7,000 people, which is worth approximately €450 million to the economy.  It is not an option for these producers to relocate to Asia, eastern Europe or elsewhere.  These jobs are rooted in our economy and the people involved are crying out for help in a time of crisis.  There is a view that the pig market is cyclical and the latest trend is but another cycle.  However, the Cathaoirleach will appreciate, as he comes from a rural constituency, that only 500 pig producers remain in the State and many are refusing to service breeding stock because they envisage no future for the industry.  Slaughter weights are reducing in abattoirs to 95 kg.  These trends indicate a serious crisis in this industry and if action is not taken by the Minister shortly, it will not be around for much longer.I raised this issue by way of parliamentary question on today's Order Paper and I am appalled and alarmed by the Minister's response.  She stated: "I am aware of the issues... I appreciate the argument for pig meat prices but I do not get involved... The issue of labelling is one for the Department of Health and Children... Bord Bia will undertake a promotional campaign to increase consumption."  This is a case of Pontius Pilate washing their hands of the issue.  If her Department had been more proactive in making Herculex grain available, for example, she could have addressed the issue of access to cheaper feeds earlier.  If the national pig herd reduces much further, the industry will face issues relating to survival and economies of scales and other problems.I would like to make a number of practical proposals.  I acknowledge this is not an issue solely for Government because retailers also have a role to play, as they did in the UK regarding the liquid milk market.  Tesco realised there was a problem procuring liquid milk to fill its shelves and the company made deals with producers.  They asked them to stay in the industry, paid a premium for the milk and, as a consequence, the issue of scarcity of liquid milk was resolved.  Fine Gael believes the increasing cost base cannot be carried only by producers and it must be shared by retailers who must pay a reasonable price to primary producers, otherwise the industry will not survive.  I refer to the REPS 4 documentation and its references to pig manure as opposed to chemical fertilisers.  Surely at a time when we are trying to be more environmentally friendly, we should facilitate the use of pig manure as opposed to obliging farmers to source nitrogen through chemical fertilisers.  The Department needs to adopt a proactive approach on this documentation.The Department could take on these practical proposals.  This is a multifaceted problem and needs multiple approaches to resolve it, but a Minister who sits on her hands and says she is aware of the problem and the Department of Health and Children must address the labelling issue is not providing a sufficient response to an industry facing a crisis and job losses.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	465	I thank my colleague for sharing time to debate this vital issue for pig and poultry farmers in Cavan-Monaghan who are among the largest producers in the country.  They are a dying breed and they are under severe pressure.  They came under major pressure because of the nitrates directive and they were promised issues that arose would be addressed.  However, that did not happen and the smaller producers were forced out of business.  Those remaining in the industry are crying out for help to make sure clarification is provided on the right of producers to import feeds from wherever they can be obtained and to ensure they are not tied down by regulations that put them at a disadvantage to their competitors.  Pig meat and poultry meat is being imported without labels and is being sold as Irish produce.  There is no excuse for that.  I have raised this issue on many occasions, as has the Cathaoirleach, and it is time action was taken.  This is a job for the Government and not an individual Minister so that the livelihoods of producers and workers in this indigenous industry are preserved.
#MaryWallace	unknown-#MaryWallace-party	unknown-#MaryWallace-dob	unknown-#MaryWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	466	We fully appreciate this is a difficult time for pig producers.  The sector has enjoyed a period of relative stability in recent years and Irish producers have shown themselves to be exceptionally efficient with the result that a reasonable income has been achievable from pig farming.  There is, however, no doubt that the sector currently faces a major challenge with the risk that some producers may be faced with exiting the industry.In the past, pig producers have proven to be resilient in riding out the cyclical nature of the pig market whereby extreme fluctuations in price and output volumes were the norm, as recognised by Deputy Creed.  In addition to such fluctuations, producers have had to cope with the costs associated with environmental protection and animal welfare, while other factors include the ever-increasing labour and overhead charges.  We appreciate the conditions surrounding the availability and pricing of feed materials have changed dramatically over the past six months.  The pig industry traditionally required considerable imported consignments of high protein soya as well as wheat, but it is examining importing whole maize because of the price differential with wheat.Efforts to secure alternative supplies of wheat to compensate for the shortfall caused by poor weather conditions in the major wheat growing regions of the world are hampered by the increased demand from the bio-fuel industry, while the lack of synchronisation in the GM authorisation processes adopted by the United States and the EU is affecting efforts to use whole maize as a substitute for wheat.  This asynchronisation has caused United States exporters and EU importers to act with caution in view of the consequences of detecting traces of EU unauthorised GM events in imported consignments.  In addition to these factors, the cost of soya has been forced up because of consequential increased demand.In recognition of these pressures that are coming on animal feed prices, EU member states have agreed to suspend the obligation to set 10% of arable land aside.  The European Commission is also examining ways of synchronising the GM authorisation processes between the EU and the United States.  Recent statements by the European Food Safety Authority that it is in negotiations with the United States authorities to address this issue are to be welcomed.The Minister has met pig producers' representatives recently to discuss their difficulties and one of the issues of concern to them is the lack of country of origin labelling on pigmeat and the sale of imported meat under Irish brand names.  Draft legislation is with the Department of Health and Children which will require the origin of pig, poultry and sheepmeat to be shown on labels.  Public consultation on this proposal is taking place on the website of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland after which it will be necessary to seek the approval of the European Commission.  It is highly desirable that there be European-wide legislation on origin labelling of meat and the Minister has conveyed her views on this to the European Commission and my EU ministerial colleagues on numerous occasions.We have no role in setting the prices that retailers pay or charge for food.  There would of necessity be a correlation between the retail prices of the different meats and there would be little scope for significant increases in pork prices in isolation from other meats.  Demand for pork both here and in the EU as a whole is in line with normal seasonal patterns.  The Minister has asked Bord Bia to intensify its autumn pork and bacon campaign to ensure demand remains firm here in the coming months.The pig industry is an important element of Irish agriculture and the Government has demonstrated its support for the sector in many ways over the years, including via financial assistance towards farm waste management and welfare-friendly sow housing, overseas promotion drives, negotiation of new market outlets and the development of the pigmeat quality assurance scheme.The recent trend in prices paid to pig producers is upwards, with an increase of 7% in the recent months.  This contrasts with a slippage in the average EU price.  It is a matter of great importance that the Irish pig industry remains viable and prosperous into the future and that, at a minimum, current output levels are sustained.  This is vital from the point of view of the employment that is depending on indigenous pig production and processing as well as the sector's contribution to net export earnings.  Within the EU pigmeat and feed management frameworks, the Minister will continue to bear in mind the needs of the industry and its efforts to overcome current difficulties.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	467	In this calendar year alone, 160,000 fixed fines are due for processing in the District Court because they have not been paid.  In other words, 160,000 people are refusing to pay mandatory fines for speeding and other driving offences.  Unless we change our driving habits, the death toll on our roads will continue to rise.  The Government can take absolutely no satisfaction from today's report of a European survey showing that Ireland is 20th out of 29 countries in terms of tackling the issue of deaths on the roads.  Luxembourg has achieved a reduction of 47% in its rate of road deaths since 2001, while the figure for France is 42%.  Ireland, however, has achieved a reduction of only 10%.  Any reduction is welcome but this is not good enough.The Government is failing utterly to meet its target in this regard and is falling behind its European neighbours.  Indicative of this is the weakness at the heart of Government legislation which means that 50% to 60% of people upon whom a fixed penalty is imposed do not pay up within either 28 or 56 days.  This means the Garda had no choice but to issue 160,000 District Court summonses to fine defaulters throughout the State this year, clogging the court system in the process.  The Courts Service has brought this issue to the fore and has put forward a solution that will require the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to take legislative action.  He will have to take tough decisions to reduce the incidence of death on our roads.Next year there may be close to 250,000 defaulters because the Minister is increasing the capacity of the system to issue fixed penalty fines.  The operation of speed cameras will be privatised and there will be more of them.  More people will be caught and penalised and many of them will fail to pay the fine.  Approximately one quarter of the business of the District Court is taken up with processing these fines.  It will require modern technology and a Minister with initiative to deal with this issue.  We on this side of the House will be pleased to debate the issues with him and will fully support him in taking the necessary actions.The Courts Service has suggested that instead of the mandatory default court system, fines should be collected by a debt agency, which should also be notified when motorists' car tax comes up for renewal.  Another important issue highlighted by the Courts Service is the situation where of those people who go to court and are found guilty, a significant but unknown number do not bring their driving licence to court.  Even though they receive a fine, therefore, their licence is not endorsed and they do not receive penalty points.  The entire system is faulty and determined and effective action is required to remedy it.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	468	The Minister conveys his thanks to Deputy O'Dowd for raising this important matter.  He is very much aware of the additional strain this is placing on the courts system.  The current position in regard to the collection of fines has been under examination by senior officials of his Department for some time.  The focus of these efforts has been to increase payment compliance on first issue of a fixed charge summons and thus reduce the number of these offences that subsequently require listing  before the courts due to non-payment.In April of last year, 31 new offences were categorised as fixed charge penalties.  Additionally, legislation was introduced to increase incrementally the number of penalty points on conviction and increase the amount of the fine if not paid after 28 days.  This has had an effect in reducing the number of these cases which would otherwise have found their way before the courts.In addition to these legislative changes, a  pilot study was commissioned  by departmental officials to examine the feasibility of, as the Deputy suggests, handing over the collection of such fixed charge penalties to an external credit management agency.  As part of this pilot project, more than 5,000 cases going back over several years were selected, with a value in the region of €2 million.  These were passed over to an external credit management agency to effect payment.The process involved a  letter cycle consisting of three letters escalating in tone and severity over a seven week period from the date the account was received for collection.  These were sent to each of the 5,000 defaulters.  In between letters, the agency attempted to obtain contact telephone numbers for the debtors; this was done between letters one and three of the collection cycle.  Where these contact details were obtained, the defaulters were contacted and reminded of their obligations.  Any additional defaulter information gleaned by the agency as a result of the above activities was recorded in an on-line database.  The preliminary results of this pilot study were quite encouraging, with over 22% of cases being cleared up.The Minister would also like to inform the Deputy that officials are currently finalising their assessment of the pilot study with a view to establishing its introduction on a wider footing.  This assessment has not yet been fully completed but legal issues as well as procurement matters have emerged as areas requiring careful consideration.  Despite this, the Minister is of the opinion that there are very good grounds for introducing this system on a wider footing.Notwithstanding the issues raised by the Deputy, the Minister remains firmly of the view that the fixed-penalty system continues to have great merit in the tackling of the issues being faced by the courts and will increasingly have an impact in reducing the number of such cases appearing before the courts in future.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	469	I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Killeen, to the House to respond to this issue.On 6 March I raised on the Adjournment the urgent need for a fully-equipped modern fire station in Tallow, County Waterford.  The Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, who replied to the issue, stated he was fully aware of the needs in Waterford and he hoped to respond positively to the request in respect of Tallow as soon as resources allowed.  He indicated he was conscious of the need for a new station in Tallow and that the matter would be very much borne in mind under the new programme.I was delighted to read in the Dungarvan Observer of 16 June that pre-construction funding of €600,000 had been allocated by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for a new fire station in Tallow.  In answer to a Dáil question put down on 26 June to the new Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government regarding Lismore fire station, I was informed that the provision of a station in the wider west Waterford area would be considered under future programmes regarding the existing facilities, level of activity, proximity of other fire stations, fire authorities’ priorities and competing demands for available funds.The Minister, Deputy Gormley, further stated that his Department had written to the fire authority requesting an appraisal of fire cover in the wider west Waterford area given the proximity of Lismore, Tallow and Cappoquin fire stations.  There was also to be an outline of priorities for replacements in the county.Having received this reply I contacted Waterford County Council and asked for clarification.  I was informed that the letter was received by Waterford County Council on 1 June 2007, dated 30 May 2007, from the private secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  It reads "I have been asked by Mr. Dick Roche, T.D., Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to refer to your letter regarding the proposal from Waterford County Council for a new fire station in Tallow".I will skip a middle paragraph which relates to previous investments in County Waterford and move on to the final paragraph.  It reads:A formal proposal for the new station at Tallow has been submitted to my Department, along with proposals from competing demands for capital investment in fire services.  Under the programme the Tallow fire station project has been allocated pre-construction funds of €600,000.I sought clarification from the Minister's office in late July as to what the €600,000 towards the Tallow fire station was for.  I put down a parliamentary question on 26 September and I provided a copy of the letter from the private secretary to the Minister to the Waterford county secretary with my question.  The question was as follows: "To ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government the funding provided in his Department's capital works programme 2007 towards the Tallow fire station project".The reply avoided the question, stating the Department had recently requested Waterford County Council to prioritise projects it wished to progress under the fire services capital programme.  It further stated that the provision of Exchequer funding for a replacement fire station in Tallow will be considered under future capital programmes, having regard to County Waterford's priorities, the existing facilities at the station, the proximity of other stations and the competing demands from other fire authorities.I have one question for the Minister of State.  What is the status of the letter dated 30 May to Waterford County Council in regard to the pre-construction funds of €600,000 allocated to the Tallow fire station project?
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	470	Before I address the substance of the issue raised by Deputy O' Shea, and given that we have been debating the tragic events in Bray, I am sure the House will join me again in paying tribute to the dedication and selflessness shown by the two members of the fire service who so tragically died while dealing with the fire in Bray, County Wicklow, almost two weeks ago.  My sincere sympathy goes to the families and colleagues of the deceased, Mark O' Shaughnessy and Brian Murray, at this sad time.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a n-anamacha dílse.I also wish to express my appreciation for the very significant contribution which the fire services in this country, both retained and full time, have made and continue to make each day, in safeguarding our communities.The fire service capital programme is an annual programme and the 2007 programme has been fully allocated.  Although no funding was provided in 2007 for Tallow fire station, Waterford County Council may prioritise Tallow fire station in future years, if considered appropriate, in seeking funding from the Department.The first step in developing a project such as Tallow fire station under the programme is for the relevant local authority to prioritise it and apply to the Department for approval in principle.  Projects are appraised on a case-by-case basis.  To ensure effective project management after a given project is approved in principle, detailed cost plans and design plans, as well as draft contract documents, must be approved in advance of the project being put out to tender in line with public procurement provisions.  These steps are intended to ensure value for money is achieved and the best possible use of resources is obtained under the programme.  Typically, under the capital programme, sums are recouped by local authorities after construction has commenced.Approval in principle was granted in 2001 for a new fire station in Tallow.  Although it has not been possible to provide funding for this station as part of the 2007 fire services capital programme announced earlier this year, funding has been provided for various other priority projects which have been advanced in County Waterford since 2001.  These include replacement stations and extensions or upgrading works at stations in Ardmore, Cappoquin, Dungarvan, Dunmore East and Tramore.The Department has recently requested Waterford County Council to prioritise projects that the council wishes to progress under the fire services capital programme.  The provision of Exchequer funding for a replacement fire station in Tallow will be considered under future capital programmes having regard to Waterford County Council's priorities, the existing facilities at the station, the proximity of other stations, and the competing demands from other fire authorities for available funding.  I hope I have been able to clarify the matter for the Deputy.I was not aware of the question regarding the letter which Deputy Brian O'Shea has referred to mentioning the amount of €600,000.  I will seek to establish an answer to the question asked by the Deputy.

Any tenant who considers that the rent sought exceeds the market rate can refer the issue to the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) for resolution. It is a function of the PRTB to review the operation of the relevant legislation, particularly the provisions relating to rent, and to make recommendations regarding any amendments considered necessary.  There are no proposals currently to amend the provisions relating to rent levels.It is important to note also that, in certain circumstances, a provision allowing rent increases up to 5% above inflation, as suggested by the Deputy, could result in tenants being subject to increases in rents greater than underlying market levels.  Indeed, looking at the average increases over the most recent 5 year period, the regime proposed by the Deputy would have permitted rent increases significantly beyond those actually recorded.

In addition, information provided by returning officers to my Department indicates that the total annual storage costs incurred by them in respect of the electronic voting machines and ancillary equipment in 2006 was some €706,000, with figures for 2005 and 2004 amounting to some €696,000 and €658,000 respectively.Significant progress has been made in the transfer of the electronic voting equipment to centralised premises in Gormanston; arrangements are being made to transfer further such equipment to Gormanston.  It is not possible to detail conclusively at this stage the total costs which will be associated with the centralised storage arrangements.  Costs incurred in respect of the work to date amount to some €254,000.  Further costs will be incurred in relation to the completion of the centralised storage arrangements, including buy-out costs.The Government decision to proceed with the movement of the electronic voting equipment to centralised premises was made taking into account a range of factors, including costs of current and centralised arrangements and the likely benefits to be realised.

While I have no direct role in this, in principle I would very much welcome any arrangement between Bord na Móna and local groups to restore the natural and amenity value of harvested bogs as, for example, in the case of Lough Boora, County Offaly.  In this regard, it would be essential for the local group proposing this initiative to secure the full support of Bord na Mona, as owners of the bogs concerned.From enquiries made by my Department, I understand that the group concerned has yet formally to approach Bord na Móna for its support.  Furthermore, I understand that the Mount Dillon group of bogs is contracted to supply Lough Ree Power for at least another fifteen years and that the bogs may have a commercial life beyond that time.

The Government's approach to meeting Ireland's Kyoto Protocol commitment is set out in the National Climate Change Strategy 2007-2012, published in April 2007. This Strategy provides a framework for reducing emissions across all sectors of the economy and sets out a series of measures that, collectively, will reduce emissions by over 17 million tonnes each year over the period 2008-2012.The Agreed Programme for Government sets a challenging target of a 3% reduction per year on average in our greenhouse gas emissions over the lifetime of the Government. While my absolute priority is to ensure that Ireland meets its legally binding Kyoto Protocol commitments, progress in reducing Ireland's emissions can now be measured with reference to our international commitments under the Kyoto Protocol and to this Government's commitment to a 3% average annual reduction over the same period.  The target to which the Deputy refers is therefore already in place.In meeting these commitments, I will be aiming to introduce further measures to reduce national greenhouse gas emissions and minimise the requirement to supplement domestic action through the purchase of credits through the Kyoto Protocol flexible mechanisms.  This will leave Ireland better prepared to manage more demanding emissions reductions in the period to 2020 and beyond.

This was done in order to extend the franchise to individuals living in built up areas that form part of the towns but are outside of the towns' administrative boundaries.  These provisions do not prevent councillors making representations on behalf of constituents to the relevant local authority.It is also open to any local authority to initiate an application for a boundary alteration to have effect for all statutory functions.  A number of applications for town authority boundary alterations, to have effect for all purposes, have been determined and implemented in recent years.Irrespective of the precise location of the boundary between town and county, the Local Government Act 2001 has facilitated improved access, interaction, linkages and service provision for all towns and areas with their respective county councils.  A modernised legal framework and structures at local level are in place providing the necessary powers and flexibility to local authorities to work in partnership to co-ordinate the provision of integrated public services.In addition, in accordance with the Programme for Government, my Department will be publishing a Green Paper on local government reform in the coming months.  The Green Paper will examine a number of issues with the objective of making local government more transparent and responsive, including the provision of quality customer service to the public, and certain issues relating to town councils.  The reform process presents an opportunity to strengthen town and county structures nationally.As part of the reform process I will be giving consideration to Part 11 of the Local Government Act 2001 which provided for a Local Government Commission, but which has not been commenced.  It was envisaged that the proposed Commission would make formal recommendations on boundary changes between local authorities.

The monument fell, therefore, to be dealt with under the provisions of section 14A(4) of the National Monuments Act, 1930, as amended by the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 2004.   Following the report to my Department from the National Roads Authority of the discovery of the previously unknown National Monument and the required consultation with the Director of the National Museum, my predecessor issued directions on 12 June 2007 for the excavation of the National Monument. The unequivocal legal advice available to me is that without a material change in circumstances, I have no power to review the decision of my predecessor in this matter.Before directions were issued in this case, all of the available options, as specified by law, including the option of preservation in situ, were carefully considered.  The conclusion reached was that, because of the fragility of the features and the location of the site in a natural hollow, preservation in situ could not guarantee the actual preservation of the monument.  This view is shared by the Advisory Committee appointed on the advice of the Director of the National Museum to advise on the conduct of the archaeological works carried out under the directions. The only viable archaeological option was, therefore, preservation by record, which involves the full archaeological excavation and recording of the exposed features within the land-take of the motorway project.  This will ensure the recovery of all the archaeological evidence from the site and, in conjunction with subsequent scientific analysis, will provide valuable information on the site itself and its surroundings.

Such decisions are taken by local authorities, in the context of the regional waste management plans for which they have statutory responsibility, and by commercial enterprises in relation to private sector facilities, and are subject to the statutory planning and waste licence approval processes.However, my Department is aware that a private company has secured planning and licensing approval for a municipal waste incinerator at Carronstown, Co. Meath and a hazardous waste incinerator at Ringaskiddy, Co. Cork. In relation to the latter the company has indicated that approval for the treatment of municipal waste at this facility may be sought in the future.Applications by Dublin City Council, on behalf of the Dublin local authorities, for planning and licensing approval for a waste to energy facility at Poolbeg are, in the context of that region's statutory waste management plan, currently before An Bord Pleanala and the Environmental Protection Agency respectively. The other waste management regions in their respective waste management plans identify various approaches to the use of thermal treatment in waste management.

In accordance with EU procedures, all political decisions are subject to further legal and other processes — unrelated to the relevant political or policy decision — and subsequently come to the next available Council for formal approval which, in this case, was the Environment Council held on the 28 June.  That Environment Council gave formal approval to a whole range of decisions in addition to the item referred to in the question, including decisions on trade policy, fisheries and the EU budget.As Ireland had not opposed the substantive political and policy decision on this specific organic food labelling issue at the Agriculture Council, it would not have been appropriate to have opposed its formal adoption at the Environment Council, irrespective of the merits or otherwise of the proposal from a policy perspective.

Responsibility for enforcing the regulations rests with the relevant local authority.In September 2006 a comprehensive Action Programme to promote improvement in standards of private rented accommodation was announced, involving a range of measures including improved regulation, enforcement, funding and information.  Good progress is being made with this Programme, an important element of which is the updating of the existing standards regulations in consultation with relevant interests.  Submissions received in that regard are being considered and revised regulations should be available later this year.While there is no proposal currently to introduce a landlord licensing system, landlords are required, under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, to register tenancies with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB).  Failure to do so is an offence, subject, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding €3,000, or a term of up to six months in prison or both.  In addition, under the Finance Act 2006, landlords must register a tenancy with the Board in order to claim tax relief on qualifying mortgage interest and refurbishment expenditure against rental income.I believe that the registration system is operating well, with a very high number of tenancies currently registered, providing a valuable source of data for the purpose of enforcing the standards regulations as well as the PRTB's dispute resolution functions. It is a function of the PRTB to keep the operation of the legislation under review and to make recommendations regarding any amendments considered necessary.

The number of local authorities operating the system has increased significantly in the last three years and steps continue to be taken by the consultants who manage the system with a view to achieving full implementation at the earliest possible date.  Results were submitted by 66 local authorities in 2005, 61 in 2004 and 34 in 2003.  Further details regarding the implementation of the National Litter Pollution Monitoring System can be found on the website www.litter.ie.Actions against illegal waste activity are a matter for the local authorities and the Office of Environmental Enforcement and my Department does not compile information on the level of such activity or any particular initiatives.  I am satisfied that appropriate powers are available to these enforcement authorities.The 2005 report of the Office of Environmental Enforcement (OEE), The Nature and Extent of Unauthorised Waste Activity in Ireland, identified the unauthorised collection and fly-tipping of waste as one of the problem areas in regard to waste management which needed to be further tackled.  The report drew attention to the measures already being taken, including the appointment of over one hundred additional enforcement officers across the local authorities funded by my Department, and the stepped up enforcement activity generally being led by the OEE and the local authorities.  The OEE, through its Environmental Enforcement Network, monitors on a continual basis the enforcement activities in this area to ensure that the momentum to tackle illegal waste activity is maintained.

In addition, for the first time, the draft Regulations will provide for a mandatory minimum requirement for the use of renewable energy sources, such as solar heating or biomass systems.  Measures to ensure energy-efficient artificial lighting and heating systems, with effective controls; to provide for air tightness testing to limit air infiltration; to place a new emphasis on workmanship; and to require vendors to provide consumer information to buyers on the operation of their home's heating and energy control systems, are also included.  The intention is that the new rules will apply to all new planning applications for residential development after 1 July, 2008.  From 1 July, 2009, they will apply to all new homes that have not been substantially built at that stage.The Technical Guidance Document accompanying the draft Regulations includes a commitment to review and improve the Regulations to achieve a 60% reduction over current standards in 2010, with the ultimate aim of achieving a zero carbon standard for new houses.  It also advises that new homes should be future-proofed in order to be easily upgraded to higher energy and CO2 standards in the future.Consultants — the UCD Energy Research Group — have been retained by my Department to assist in the elaboration of proposals to achieve the 40% target.  Preliminary estimates supplied by the consultants suggest a cost in the order of €10,000, including VAT, per typical dwelling, of which some €6,500 relates to provisions to meet the requirements regarding renewables (in this case solar panels).  The balance of the cost arises from such items as insulation of all elements; higher quality windows; reduced thermal bridging; reduced air infiltration; higher efficiency boilers; and low energy lighting.  In accordance with Government requirements, a Regulatory Impact Assessment of the overall proposals which I have announced is now under way and the work undertaken by the consultants will feed into this.  I expect to have the Regulatory Impact Assessment completed by November, at which time I will arrange for it to be posted on my Department's Website.The draft Regulations are now the subject of a public consultation process, which will continue until 26 October, 2007.  I look forward to hearing the views of all stakeholders, which will be fully considered prior to finalising new Part L Building Regulations before the end of the year.The significance of these draft Regulations should not be under-estimated.  The proposed 40% improvement is the largest ever proposed in Ireland.  Moreover, for the first time ever, energy efficiency is linked directly to national climate change obligations via the setting of specific standards relating to CO2 emissions.Taken together, the measures provide for a step change in the approach to energy efficiency standards in new Irish homes.  They are aimed at ensuring that new housing stock in Ireland is built to the highest international standards, and will be cheaper to run, easier to maintain and have a much lower impact on the environment.I will be working closely on the implementation of these new measures with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, who has announced complementary measures to provide the necessary support to installers and the building industry to meet these challenging requirements.

In particular, the Act provides for 4-year tenancy cycles, and, once a tenancy has lasted 6 months, it can only be terminated during the remaining three and a half years of the cycle for a limited range of specific reasons set out in the Act. The Act also includes a number of requirements relating to termination of tenancies, including a significant increase in the length of notice — related to the duration of the tenancy — that landlords are required to give in order to terminate a tenancy.  Disputes or complaints in relation to these or other provisions of the Act can be brought to the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB).I understand that the security of tenure provisions in the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 are operating well, and there is no proposal currently for amendments to these provisions.  It is a function of the PRTB to keep the operation of the legislation under review and to make recommendations regarding any amendments considered necessary.

The Campaign has indicated that by this it means that "nobody will sleep rough; nobody will stay in emergency accommodation for longer than is absolutely necessary and nobody will become homeless because of a lack of appropriate services".The social partnership agreement Towards 2016 contains a commitment to the elimination of the long-term occupancy of emergency homeless accommodation by 2010.  This is well aligned with the goals of the Make Room campaign.  It should also be noted that the Homeless Agency, which is the partnership body which coordinates homeless services in Dublin, has already defined as its overarching goal the elimination of long-term homelessness and the need to sleep rough in Dublin by 2010.The Independent Review of Implementation of Homeless Strategies, published in February 2006, examined the implementation of the Government's Integrated and Preventative Homeless Strategies and concluded that they should be amalgamated and updated.  The Government has accepted the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Review and work is under way on the preparation of a revised and updated Strategy on Homelessness.  As part of this process, a National Homeless Consultative Committee, which includes representatives from homeless service providers (including a representative from the Make Room campaign), was established in April 2007 to provide input into the development of the revised homeless strategy and ongoing Government policy on addressing homelessness.Very significant resources are being made available to address the issue of homelessness at national level in a comprehensive and co-ordinated manner. Since 2000, the Government, through my Department and the Department of Health & Children, has provided over €450 million in capital and current funding nationally for the provision of accommodation and care related services for homeless persons.Nationally, through the work of the local homeless fora, there has been significant progress in reducing the numbers of homeless persons.  In the Housing Needs Assessment 2005, local authorities recorded a 46% fall in the numbers of homeless persons nationally, from 5,581 persons in 2002 to 3,031 persons in 2005.There is now a wide range of accommodation and services for homeless persons across the country — from emergency hostels, transitional accommodation programmes to outreach and resettlement services and long term supported accommodation.  A key task and a particular focus of attention in the future is to assist homeless persons who can live independently to move into mainstream long-term accommodation as soon as possible.  This will involve refocusing efforts on the provision of accommodation in the social, voluntary and private rented housing sectors, exploiting the significant potential of the Rental Accommodation Scheme in this area and ensuring the availability of appropriate outreach and resettlement support.

This sum is in addition to €20 million provided in my Department's Vote in 2006.Following the enactment of the Carbon Fund Act in March 2007, the National Treasury Management Agency is now statutorily designated as the Government's purchasing agent for the acquisition of carbon allowances. The Agency is developing a purchasing programme on foot of the Government commitment that the State will purchase up to 18.035 million allowances in partial fulfilment of the State's obligations pursuant to the Kyoto Protocol.  A national policy framework on the purchase of allowances, which is set out in Annex 3 to the National Climate Change Strategy 2007-2012, provides guidance for the Agency in this regard.In 2006, Ireland committed to investing €20m in the Multilateral Carbon Credit Fund offered by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and a further €20m in Funds offered by the World Bank, namely the Carbon Fund for Europe and the second tranche of the BioCarbon Fund.  No other commitments were made prior to the designation of the National Treasury Management Agency as purchasing agent.  I also refer to the reply to Question No. 102 on today's order paper.

In terms of wider interactions with stakeholders, the Minister of State for Housing, Urban Renewal and Developing Areas chairs the Housing Forum which provides social partners with an input to policy development.Sharing of best practice on housing policy and implementation also forms an important aspect of ongoing dialogue with Northern Ireland counterparts.  In addition, engagement with EU and UN structures provides an opportunity to exchange knowledge and forms an important component of evidence based policy development.My Department works jointly with local authorities across the full range of delivery mechanisms.  In addition, support for the implementation of programmes is provided by the work of a number of bodies which operate under the Department's aegis.  These include—The Private Residential Tenancies Board supporting the modernisation and development of the private rented sector;The Affordable Homes Partnership supporting the expanded affordable housing programme, particularly in the Greater Dublin Area;The National Building Agency assisting in the delivery of housing, including regeneration programmes;The Housing Finance Agency providing finance for local authorities and the voluntary and co-operative sector;The Dublin Docklands Development Authority progressing development, including housing, in the Dublin docklands area, working closely with Dublin City Council;The Centre for Housing Research undertaking research to inform policy and the development of best practice guidance and delivery of training to support housing practitioners.I am satisfied that these arrangements provide a robust framework for the development and implementation of effective housing policy.  Our approach has been responsive to housing need, reflected in both the level of overall housing output and a major expansion of social and affordable housing programmes.

I sought advice from the Attorney General as to the view that this section might not apply to domesticated deer. The Attorney General has confirmed that Section 26 provides for the licensing of hunting for deer by stag hounds irrespective of whether the deer are wild or captive-bred. That advice has addressed this concern in relation to the licensing of the hunt. I will be making a decision on the licence application shortly.

These measures are kept under continuous review in my Department.The tenancy agreement, which is the legal basis of the relationship between the local authority and its tenants, will generally contain provisions in relation to behaviour which is acceptable and that which is not. The local authority is empowered under section 62 of the Housing Act 1966, to initiate proceedings to secure an eviction where a tenant has breached the conditions of the tenancy agreement.The primary purpose of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 is to provide for a range of measures to assist local authorities in addressing problems arising on their estates from drug dealing and serious anti-social behaviour. The Act gives recognition to the role of local authorities in actively promoting the interests of tenants and other occupiers in their housing estates and also in working towards the avoidance, prevention and abatement of anti-social behaviour. One of the main provisions of the 1997 Act enables a local authority tenant, or the local authority itself in certain circumstances, to apply to the District Court for an excluding order against an individual member of the household who is believed to be engaging in anti-social behaviour. The measures contained in the 1997 Act are essential to ensure that local authorities have the capacity to take effective action in this area.In fulfilment of commitments in the housing policy statement — Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, I am reviewing the provisions of this Act with a view to strengthening their powers.The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 contains a number of provisions to address the issue of anti-social behaviour in private rented accommodation and also extends the local authority power to obtain excluding orders in respect of the occupants (other than the owner) of tenant purchased houses.  It also provided for the local authority power to refuse to sell a house under the Tenant Purchase Scheme to a person it has reason to believe may engage in anti-social behaviour to be extended to the Shared Ownership Scheme, the 1999 Affordable Housing Scheme and affordable houses deriving from Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.In addition, the Centre for Housing Research, which is funded by my Department and local authorities, has produced good practice guidelines on preventing and combating anti-social behaviour.  The Centre has also organised training courses for local authorities in this regard.  In this wider context, my Department has put in place a Housing Management Initiative scheme, which includes funding for programmes to improve estate management, tenant liaison and training initiatives, and also supports the activities of local authorities to tackle anti-social behaviour through the Sustainable Communities Fund.In relation to the activities of so-called boy racers, it is, of course, open to local authorities to consider introducing revised road layouts and traffic calming measures in estates to counter such activities.  In addition, I consider that close liaison between local authorities and An Garda Síochána is essential in addressing many types of anti-social behaviour, particularly in relation to the dangerous misuse of motor vehicles, given the criminal nature of such activities.  Moreover, the Joint Policing Committees, established on a pilot basis in 29 local authorities, provide an excellent forum for members of a local authority and the senior Garda officers responsible for policing the area, together with Oireachtas members and community and voluntary interests, to consult, discuss and make recommendations on matters affecting the policing of their community.  In particular, it is the function of the Joint Policing Committees to keep under review the levels and patterns of crime, disorder and anti-social behaviour in their area and the underlying and contributory factors.  Together with my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I am examining what lessons can be learned from the operation of the pilot and we intend to have Joint Policing Committees up and running in all local authority areas in 2008.

As part of the implementation of this policy, my Department has allocated funding of over €8 million to County and City Councils for the development of 167 new or refurbished playgrounds since 2004. Grant aid of approximately €4.1m in respect of over 80 playgrounds remains to be drawn down from my Department by local authorities.There has been no decision to withdraw funding from these schemes. The question of inviting further proposals from local authorities is being kept under review in the light of experience gained under the current schemes.

My Department does not collate statistical information in relation to the size of houses provided under the social housing programmes.The Government's commitment to an ambitious social housing programme in the years ahead is evident in the Programme for Government and in the housing policy statement Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities published in 2007.  Under the National Development Plan 2007-2013 (NDP), some €18 billion has been earmarked for housing programmes to meet the accommodation needs of some 140,000 households over the period of the plan, including the delivery of an ambitious programme to deliver 60,000 new units of social housing.  Under the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, 27,000 of these are to be delivered over the three years 2007 to 2009.Significant progress is already being made in expanding the social housing programme to meet these targets.  A total of 3,167 homes were completed or acquired by local authorities and the voluntary and co-operative housing sector in the period 1 January to 30 June 2007, representing an increase of 33% on the same period of 2006.  In addition, a further 450 new units were acquired under the Rental Accommodation Scheme.

The NDP provides the resources — some €18 billion in total — which will support increased output from social and affordable housing measures and result in the needs of some 140,000 new households being met in this period.These resources will be used to meet the needs of some 100,000 households by commencing/ acquiring 63,000 new social homes in the period 2007-2013, through a combination of local authority, voluntary and co-operative housing and new units for the Rental Accommodation Scheme.  Further households will benefit either as they transfer to the Rental Accommodation Scheme with their existing landlords or from naturally occurring vacancies. Over the period   2007 to 2009, sufficient resources will be made available to commence/acquire some 27,000 new units of social housing.In addition over the period of the NDP some 40,000 households will benefit from affordable housing.  17,000 of these will be delivered in the first three-year period, in line with the agreement in Towards 2016.To ensure that these programmes are delivered in a coherent and coordinated manner City and County Councils have put in place multi-annual Housing Action Plans which encompass delivery of social and affordable housing in their areas, including Town Councils.   Meetings are being held currently with local authorities, as part of the ongoing interaction on Housing Action Plans, to support delivery in the period from 2008 to 2010.

I will be developing appropriate proposals in this regard.In addition, the Agreed Programme for Government commits to publishing a Green Paper on local government reform.  One of the issues which the Green Paper will address is the question of expenditure limits at local elections.  There are currently no such limits, although expenditure, as well as donations over a €635 threshold, must be disclosed. I have set in train a process of public consultation prior to the preparation of the Green Paper and have established a related Consultative Committee. Work on the Green Paper should be completed by the end of this year with final proposals to be settled in a White Paper next year.I am satisfied that the proposals for the Electoral Commission, together with the initiatives which will emerge from the Green Paper, provide an appropriate framework to progress our extensive and complex agenda for electoral and local government reform.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	507	Development plans provide the over-arching strategic framework for sustainable development within their areas, with a view to ensuring that all development is sustainable in economic, social and environmental terms.  As such, the development plan must offer clear guidance on sustainable development policies and objectives, both national and local, which address the full range of sustainability issues involved, including climate change, waste management, transport, urban development, sustainable communities, use of natural resources and so on.It is imperative that the objectives and strategies set out in development plans are compatible with the Government's commitment to reducing energy consumption and modifying the impacts of climate change.  My Department has provided extensive guidance on development planning, in Development Plans — Guidelines for Planning Authorities, published in June 2007.  These state that development plans should be consistent with the objectives of national initiatives that will address energy and climate change issues such as the National Climate Change Strategy 2007-2012 (NCCS), which builds on the commitment to sustainable development set out in Towards 2016 and the National Development Plan 2007-2013.   They also emphasise that the objectives of the NCCS require implementation by all sectors of society, and that it is imperative that the objectives and strategies set out in development plans are compatible with the Government's commitment to reducing energy consumption and modifying the impacts of climate change.  Moreover, the conclusions in the EPA State of the Environment Report, and other evidence in relation to environmental quality and trends, should inform the drafting of development plans and be reflected, as appropriate, in their objectives and implementation.The Strategic Environmental Assessment carried out as part of the preparation and review of the development plan can help to bring environmental issues into sharper focus during the consultation phases, and should improve the overall sustainability of the plan-making process by facilitating the identification and appraisal of alternative plan strategies, by raising awareness of the environmental impacts of plans, and by encouraging the inclusion of measurable targets and indicators.In addition to the statutory requirements in relation to the planning code for development plans, and in keeping with Ireland's obligations on greenhouse gas emissions and the need to reduce carbon fuel energy consumption, I published, on 21 September 2007, draft regulations under Part L of the Building Regulations.  These draft Regulations provide for an average reduction of at least 40% in primary energy consumption and a 40% reduction in CO2 emissions.  Moreover, for the first time, the Regulations will introduce:a minimum requirement for the use of renewable energy sources;energy-efficient boilers;energy-efficient artificial lighting systems; andimproved airtightness of the building fabric. The draft Regulations provide for a commencement date of 1 July, 2008.The draft Regulations and associated Technical Guidance Document are now the subject of a public consultation process, which will continue to 26 October 2007.  All submissions received will be comprehensively assessed and given due consideration prior to finalising new Building Regulations before the end of the year.

The results of that assessment indicated that there were 43,684 households on local authority housing waiting lists.  More comprehensive data in relation to the 2005 assessment at an individual local authority level were published in the Annual Bulletin of Housing Statistics 2005, a copy of which is available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie.  The next statutory assessment of housing need will take place in March 2008.The Government is well placed to deliver on the commitments in Towards 2016 to start or acquire some 27,000 new homes for those in need of social housing over the next three years.   The total Exchequer provision for social housing in 2007 is almost €1.4 billion — an increase of 10% on the 2006 provision. The funding will support the commencement of a significant number of new social housing units, further progress under the regeneration programmes, as well as bringing to completion a large number of units under both the local authority and voluntary housing programmes.

Details of the revised framework of grant aid to assist older people and people with a disability were announced earlier this year as part of the Government's new Housing Policy Statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities.As part of the new framework, a revised grant scheme to be known as the Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability will be introduced on 1 November 2007, and will assist in the provision/adaptation of accommodation to meet the needs of people with a disability.  The maximum grant available under the revised scheme will be €30,000, covering up to 95% of the approved cost of works.    Under the revised framework, the grant level will increase annually in line with the building cost index, thus protecting its value into the future.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	514	Development plans provide the blueprint for the sustainable development of an area, including the co-ordinated provision of infrastructure and services.  Requirements for public open space and recreation space provision in connection with development proposals, particularly residential development, should be clearly set out in the development plan.Planning authorities must respond to the circumstances of their own local communities when formulating their development plans, and identify the appropriate facilities required.  Generally, appropriate policies and objectives for inclusion in plans will relate to allocation and reservation of land, setting appropriate development control standards and indicating provision of specific facilities.  Development contributions can also be sought by planning authorities to help pay for facilities servicing new developments including community and other recreational amenities.My Department has issued guidelines to planning authorities on preparing and managing development plans which emphasise the need for integrated provision of both infrastructure and supporting services to facilitate the development of sustainable communities, and provide for a better quality of life in working, home and leisure environments.Section 10(2)(d) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 requires a development plan to include objectives for "the integration of the planning and sustainable development of the area with the social, community and cultural requirements of the area and its population."  This objective allows for linkage to be made between the development plan and the County Development Board's strategy which is intended to bring the socio-economic and physical planning processes closer together.  The land use policies of the development plan should be informed by and reflect the socio-economic and cultural considerations of the strategy.Similarly, section 10(2)(l) of the Act requires a development plan to include objectives for "the provision, or facilitation of the provision, of services for the community including, in particular, schools, crèches and other education and childcare facilities." Community facilities falling within this mandatory objective can include places of worship, hospital and health centres, facilities for the elderly and persons with disabilities, facilities for children's play including playgrounds, skateboard parks and other facilities, libraries and community halls.The priority the Government attaches to achieving greater integration between planning, housing and infrastructure provision is also reflected in the assignment of specific responsibility for "developing areas" to Minister Batt O'Keeffe, Minister of State at my Department.

The current tentative list was compiled in 1992 by an internal Departmental committee, following a public consultation process, and formally submitted to UNECSO in accordance with the UNESCO World Heritage Convention. Georgian Dublin was not included in the tentative list at that time. My Department will be reviewing the tentative list of sites next year and Georgian Dublin can be considered in the context of that review.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	516	I propose to take Questions Nos. 149 and 156 together.The principal recommendation in the Ninth Progress Report of the All Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution (APOCC), on Private Property, was for the implementation of the central proposal of the 1973 majority "Kenny Report", a "designated area scheme" under which local authorities would be empowered to compulsorily acquire land for general development purposes, at its existing use value plus25%, rather than at open market value.  In the light of a range of substantive legal, practical and financial considerations, successive Governments since the 1970s have not proceeded with such a scheme, and I have no proposals to do so.However, the Government has approved the drafting of a Designated Land (Housing Development) Bill to provide for a "use it or lose it" scheme.  The General Scheme of the Bill provides for—powers for planning authorities to enter into a binding agreement with, or  impose requirements on, the owners of designated land in order to bring such land into housing development;an amended compensation mechanism whereby designated land, if not developed in agreement with, or in accordance with requirements imposed by, the relevant planning authority, could be compulsorily acquired at below market value; andas a possible alternative to compulsory acquisition, the imposition by planning authorities of an annual development incentive levy on designated land.€18 billion is being made available under the National Development Plan (NDP) to support expanded social and affordable housing programmes. As a result, it is estimated that the housing needs of some 140,000 households will be met over the life of the NDP. Activity under these programmes has increased significantly this year.  With some 4,350 units delivered, output of social and affordable housing for the first half of 2007 is up 24% on same period in 2006; this includes an increase of 51% in the delivery of housing units under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.The APOCC report recommended, inter alia, that—there should be a ‘one stop shop' planning procedure for strategic infrastructural projects,the right to compensation for the acquisition of property rights below a specified depth under the surface should be removed, andthe existence of land purchase options should be made public to achieve transparency in property markets generally.The Strategic Infrastructure Act 2006—introduced a streamlined planning consent procedure for strategic infrastructure developments, andamended the rules of compulsory acquisition to provide that the value of any land lying 10 metres or more below the surface shall be taken to be nil, unless it can be shown to be of greater value by a claimant.The General Scheme referred to above also provides for mandatory registration of, and the imposition of a levy on, land purchase options.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	518	Waste management services have traditionally been provided at a local level, with individual arrangements being locally determined and tailored to local circumstances.  The present legal framework, as determined by the Oireachtas, reflects this. In accordance with section 52 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, the determination of waste management charges, and any associated waiver schemes, is a matter for the relevant local authority, where it acts as the service provider. Similarly, where a private operator provides the collection service, it is a matter for that operator to determine charges.  My Department has completed a public consultation on issues surrounding the regulation of the waste management sector, including the need for any public service obligations in respect of collection services to certain households or in specific areas. The various submissions received and the issues raised will be considered further in the context of the review of waste management generally provided for in the Government's policy programme and which will shortly be initiated.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	519	The Litter Pollution Acts, 1997 to 2003, prohibit the leaving or throwing litter in a public place or in any place that is visible from a public place. This includes the creation of litter in the carrying on of a business, trade or activity or in the loading, transporting or handling of items. The legislation also places an onus on owners and occupiers of property to keep their properties litter free to the extent that they are public places or are visible from a public place. The Litter Acts do not stipulate a minimum quantity of refuse or other waste material in order for a breach of the legislation to occur in this regard; therefore, it is not necessary for a high density of refuse to be visible prior to action being taken by the relevant authorities.Local authorities are responsible for implementing the litter laws in their own areas.  In effect, this means they have responsibilities in relation to preventing and controlling litter, and they can take action against persons who break or ignore these laws. Gardaí also have the power to issue on-the-spot fines for litter offences.Separate legislative provisions also prohibit illegal dumping; section 32 of the Waste Management Acts 1996-2007 places a general duty on the holder of waste and provides that a person shall not hold, transport, recover or dispose of waste in a manner that causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution. Section 39 of the Waste Management Acts 1996-2007 provides that waste cannot be disposed of or recovered at a facility except in accordance with a licence issued by the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Waste Management (Permit) Regulations, 1998 provide that for certain specified activities, a waste permit issued by the local authority rather than a waste licence will be required.Section 10 of the Waste Management Acts 1996-2007 details the penalties for any person found guilty of offences under the Act. The penalties range from a minimum fine of €3,000 or 12 months imprisonment or both on summary conviction, to a maximum fine of €15 million or 10 years imprisonment or both in the case of conviction on indictment.   I am satisfied that the penalties and enforcement powers under existing litter legislation are adequate and appropriate, and there are no proposals to change the law along the lines mentioned in the question.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	520	I propose to take Questions Nos. 154 and 306 together.The Department has implemented a number of the important recommendations of the report: Review of Fire Safety and Fire Services in Ireland (Farrell Grant Sparks Report).  These include in particular the enactment of the Licensing of Indoor Events Act 2003, which addressed a number of legislative changes called for in the Review.  In addition, the high level of capital investment in the fire service has been continued and now stands in excess of €20 million per annum.  The Inter-Departmental Committee on Major Emergency Planning, chaired by the Department, completed a review of the Major Emergency Management Framework on which local authority, Health Service Executive and Garda Síochána Major Emergency Plans are based  and the updated Framework is being implemented.In February 2005, the previous Government announced a Fire Services Change Programme, 2005 to 2007, to implement key fire services and fire safety recommendations of the Farrell Grant Sparks Report.  This Programme set out the strategy for the future development of the fire service and included a number of priority measures addressing the development of community fire safety programmes, the development of a risk based approach to safety management, the introduction of a competency-based approach to recruitment, retention and career progression in the fire service and the enhancement of health, safety and welfare programmes within the fire service.  Work under the Change Programme was carried out by a dedicated Project Team, with a number of supporting structures, and all of the stakeholders participated fully in the process.  A report on progress achieved over the two year period was published in June 2007 and is available on my Department's website, www.environ.ie. I am reviewing the options for the next phase of the change programme having regard to the Farrell Grant Sparks recommendations and the need to continue to bring about real and substantive change so that the fire service is in line with international standards.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	521	My Department is progressing a wide range of policies and measures to ensure that the unprecedented rate of housing and related development in Ireland is planned for in a manner that supports the creation of sustainable communities within a high quality environment.  Apartment design in city centre locations, which prioritises a good quality of life for the occupants, can make a significant contribution to achieving sustainable communities and a compact urban environment, as envisaged under the National Spatial Strategy.To this end, my Department issued planning guidelines on Sustainable Urban Housing: Design Standards for Apartments on 18 September 2007 with the aim of promoting sustainable urban housing by ensuring that the design and layout of new apartments provide satisfactory accommodation for a variety of household types and sizes, including families with children.  The guidelines have a strong emphasis on family living and the minimum floor areas and other dimensions reflect this.  They pay particular attention to the needs of children — for play space, for quiet study areas and for places to store bikes and buggies.In addition to better internal layouts, apartment developments need to be located in neighbourhoods which, through good design, provide integrated services and access to public transport, schools, health services, crèches, shops and so on.  Together with the suite of other complementary guidance on sustainable residential development, these guidelines should facilitate the creation of sustainable integrated neighbourhoods in city centre and dockland locations.Under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, it is open to local authorities to earmark up to 20% of houses in new developments for affordable housing purposes.  This assists in ensuring that first-time buyers, at whom affordable housing is targeted, have opportunities to acquire homes at affordable prices in developments in city centre areas.Furthermore, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority carried out an Audit of Social Infrastructure in 2004 which identified a number of key requirements to encourage family living such as schools, larger apartments, play areas and community facilities.  These requirements have been addressed and taken into account in DDDA planning schemes.

The Government's approach to achieving this policy aim is that those who can afford to do so should provide for their own housing, with the aid where available of certain fiscal incentives or subsidies, and that those unable to access housing in this way should have access to social housing or income support to rent private housing.  Existing legislation and funding programmes support this strategy and have been effective in delivering increased outputs.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	523	As the targets in question relate to the period 2008-2012, there is no basis for asserting that there has been a failure to meet them.The National Climate Change Strategy, published in 2000, sets out indicative reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that would be achieved during the period covered by the Kyoto Protocol, 2008-2012, through the implementation of proposed measures.The National Climate Change Strategy 2007-2012, published in April 2007, confirms the measures by which Ireland will meet its commitments pursuant to the Kyoto Protocol. Measures put in place since the publication of the first National Climate Change Strategy in 2000 will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 8.6 million tonnes per annum. The new Strategy sets out an additional annual saving, of approximately 5 million tonnes, from a range of measures subsequently adopted by Government. When combined with Ireland's purchase of additional allowances through the Kyoto Protocol flexible mechanisms, annual emissions savings of over 17 million tonnes will be achieved during the 2008-2012 period.The new Strategy also sets out areas where further measures are being developed, and indicates the level of reductions in national greenhouse gas emissions that may be required on foot of EU targets for 2020.

These works have received planning approval in accordance with Part 8 of the planning and development regulations and works have commenced on this project.  It is envisaged that this work will be completed in 2008.I am advised that the retaining wall at Captain's Hill is a matter for the Local Authority and while it may be contributing to surface water drainage problems in the area, it is not a factor in flooding from the Rye River, which the aforementioned works are intended to address.

These studies will lead to the preparation of plans to manage the flood risks.  The studies referred to above, which are currently under way on the River Lee and the River Dodder are pilot studies to prepare for this national programme.

The terms agreed were approved by Kildare Co Council in January 07. The site is currently being used as a soccer pitch by a local sports club.The Commissioners will shortly complete the planning process which has been conducted under Part 9 of the Planning & Development Regulations, 2001.The Contract for Sale will be executed by the Commissioners as soon as a number of related issues are resolved. The key issue is obtaining vacant possession of the site. In this regard, the Commissioners have been informed recently by Kildare County Council that it is likely to be early in the new year before the site will be vacated by the soccer club. Another issue is the provision of a footbridge to provide safe pedestrian access to the railway station and Newbridge town. The Commissioners are  awaiting confirmation as to when a planning application for the construction of the bridge will be lodged by a private developer with Kildare County Council.As soon as the Commissioners are given a firm date for vacant possession of the site, and are satisfied that the construction of the footbridge will proceed, the Contract for Sale will be completed and the construction of the new headquarters building for the Department of Defence will commence.It is expected that the building will be ready for occupation approximately 18 months after the commencement date. The Commissioners are satisfied that all of the issues related to the site purchase and adjoining developments in the Station Road area are very close to being resolved.In the circumstances, the Commissioners have not been requested to provide temporary accommodation in Newbridge pending completion of the permanent headquarters building.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	533	As the Deputy will be aware, Contracts For Difference (CFDs) relate to taking a position on the future movement of a price, either up or down, of a share, a commodity or an index such as a stock market index. There is nothing inherently wrong in this, and appropriate use of derivative products such as these by sufficiently sophisticated investors can help to provide liquidity and depth to the market in Irish equities.At present, few Irish authorised investment firms actually write CFDs. Most investors who are dealing in these products do so with UK authorised entities. The investors may carry out these dealings through Irish stockbrokers or investment firms, who would act as introducing brokers. On the other hand, it cannot be excluded that they may deal through UK brokers or directly with the underwriter, in which circumstances, it is clear that, in practice, the specific oversight of this activity by the Irish Financial Regulator is limited.However, I would like to assure the Deputy that, financial CFDs will be regulated as from 1 November next under the new Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MIFID) regime as they are classified as "financial instruments" under Part 3 of Schedule 1 of S.I. No. 60 of 2007. Therefore, from that date, financial spread contracts, such as on specific shares, bonds or indices of shares, will become a regulated activity and firms providing this service will have to be authorised.Irish authorised firms will have to comply with all the requirements, including the rigorous client protection requirements, set down in S.I. No. 60 of 2007. Investment firms will have to categorise clients as either "retail" or "professional" investors. They will have to perform suitability and appropriateness tests for clients and potential clients, taking account of the knowledge and experience of the client, outlining the specific risks associated with particular types of financial instruments. Clearly, as they are regarded as a high risk activity, the specific risks associated with CFDs will have to be highlighted prominently.Spread betting on matters other than on financial instruments, e.g. on sporting events, is not covered by the MIFID or the transposing Regulations and thus will not be regulated under the new regime as from 1 November next.These financial instruments are now a widely established feature of market activity across several continents and can serve a useful purpose in the market. Since they are shortly to be formally regulated across the EU under the MIFID Directive, it would neither be feasible nor appropriate for Ireland to outlaw such activity.There are no firm statistics on the extent of CFDs in the Irish market available at present. However, when the new regime comes into force on 1 November next, under S.I. No. 60 of 2007, firms will have to comply with detailed reporting requirements for transactions and the Financial Regulator will be in a position to collect data on the incidence of FCD activity.

In that context agreement has been reached with the Civil Service unions representing general service staff that an assignment will not be made to a decentralising post until alternative arrangements have been identified for an existing post holder who does not wish to decentralise with it.The primary mechanism for placing Civil Servants who are in posts which are due to decentralise but wish to remain in Dublin is by way of bilateral transfer.  As staff who have applied to decentralise continue to be transferred into decentralising organisations, the posts they vacate become available to those wishing to remain in Dublin.  Further arrangements have been initiated for general service grades. The objective of these arrangements is to provide to the Public Appointments Service details of staff who wish to remain in Dublin at each grade level so that a proportion of vacancies arising in Dublin based posts may be filled by those staff.  The arrangements seek to balance the need to facilitate the effective achievement of the decentralisation programme with the business needs of departments and the aspirations of staff to be placed in appropriate posts in Dublin. To achieve this, they allow for prioritisation at certain times of staff in organisations who have an immediate need to be placed in Dublin posts due to the timing of the relocation of their current department or office.It is intended that the arrangements will continue over the full transition phase of the Programme and my department is monitoring them in co-operation with Departments and the relevant unions to ensure that they are operating efficiently.  Discussions are ongoing with the unions representing professional and technical staff in relation to individual organisations.The position in relation to the State Agencies is of course more complex. The Labour Court recommendation in relation to the dispute between FÁS and SIPTU provides a renewed opportunity for both unions and management to address the relevant issues.  As part of their recommendation, the Court states that it believes that the stated policy of effecting decentralisation on a voluntary basis could best be achieved if individuals who are unwilling to relocate are provided with realistic alternative career options, which take account of the proprietary rights and legitimate expectations which they have accrued in their current employments.  The Court goes on to say that it believes that the appropriate authorities should address the issues arising in the broader context of decentralisation of non-commercial State Bodies overall.  This aspect of the Labour Court finding is very much in line with the previously expressed view of the Decentralisation Implementation Group.In relation to the state bodies generally, it is now a matter, in the first instance, for each body together with its parent Department, to manage their approach to implementation taking account of the implications of the Labour Court recommendation.  My Department has written to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to establish how progress can be made on this aspect of the Labour Court recommendation.

The disability criteria for these concessions are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994. To get a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of these Regulations.I am aware of the difficulties experienced by various groups and individuals who would prefer a wider level of access across the scheme; and as Deputies are aware, there was an interdepartmental review of the topic, which explored these issues. However, given the scale and the scope of the scheme, any possible changes can only be made after careful consideration and with regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme and the available resources.  In this context, I consider any possible changes within the framework of the annual Budgetary process.

Arrangements to decentralise are proceeding in accordance with the OSI implementation plan and a site has been acquired by Office of Public Works Dungarvan for the OSI headquarters.   A schedule of accommodation based on OSI's space requirements has been prepared and supplied to the OPW.The latest statistical information to hand shows that applications to decentralise to Dungarvan have been made by forty-nine(49) civil and public servants as well as sixteen (16) existing OSI staff.  In addition seventy-six (76) staff have been assigned to Dungarvan as a result of recruitment or promotion. A further eleven (11) trainee recruits based in Dublin on two year contracts would also be obliged to transfer to Dungarvan if on completion of their two year contracts they secure full time positions with the OSI.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	542	The National Pensions Reserve Fund was established on 2 April 2001 under the provisions of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000. Section 18 of the Act provides for the payment from the Exchequer each year into the Fund of a sum equivalent to 1% of Gross National Product (GNP).  Under the provisions of the Act, €6,515 million was transferred from the Temporary Holding Fund for Pensions Liabilities to the National Pensions Reserve Fund in 2001. That amount included contribution amounts equivalent to 1% of GNP for the years 1999 and 2000, along with the proceeds of the sale of Telecom Éireann.The following table sets out (i) the amounts paid to the Fund from 2001 to 2006, (ii) the administrative expenses paid by the Fund for each of those years, (iii) the costs borne by the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) as Manager of the Fund — these are charged directly on the Central Fund in accordance with section 23 of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act — and (iv) the return on the Fund's investments as provided by the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission in their Annual Reports, adjusted for the change in the Consumer Price Index (the Commission calculates the Fund's performance in accordance with the Global Investment Performance Standards):Contribution from ExchequerAdministrative expenses (excluding costs borne by NTMA as Manager)Costs borne by NTMA as ManagerReturn adjusted for change in Consumer Price Index€€€%2001: from Temporary Holding Fund for Pensions Liabilities6,514,881,1762001971,984,499951,5981,940,000-0.4% (April-December)20021,034,500,0008,864,4602,488,942-20.720031,103,000,00014,080,0903,163,6679.220041,177,000,00018,295,1643,420,7757.120051,320,250,00023,813,8964,375,83817.120061,446,500,00028,858,2295,748,4008.42007 (to end-June)807,750,00016,000,0003,000,0004.4The market value of the Fund at the end of June 2007 was €21,032 million.Budget 2007 provides for the payment of €1,615,500,000 into the Fund from the Exchequer in 2007.

To be eligible to receive the mobility allowance applicants must satisfy the following conditions: be over 16 years and under 66 years — however, an allowance, once granted, will be continued after the age of 66 as long as the other criteria for eligibility are met. I currently have no proposals to amend this scheme.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	545	The main supports the Government makes available to parents to assist them with their child care costs are Child Benefit and the Early Childcare Supplement.  The latter payment, which is in recognition of the higher child care costs of pre-school children, is the responsibility of my Office, and it alone amounts to expenditure of over €400m in a full year.  These payments are universal and benefit all parents, regardless of their income, labour market status or the type of child care they choose and regardless of whether they live in urban or rural areas.  In addition to these universal supports, Government child care policy has also recognised the need to target additional supports towards disadvantaged families.Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP), which is co-funded under the EU Social Fund (ESF), targeted support was provided through the staffing support grant scheme whereby community based not-for-profit child care providers with a strong focus on disadvantage were awarded grant aid towards their staffing costs to allow them to operate reduced fees to disadvantaged parents.  Funding under this scheme was originally awarded for a limited period during which services were expected to move towards sustainability.  This funding was subsequently continued to the end of 2007, where it was considered necessary to enable services to continue to make their services accessible to disadvantaged parents.  This continuation funding was subject to the condition that tiered fee structures would be implemented by the services in question.As signalled at the launch of the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), the successor programme to the EOCP, a new scheme to support community child care services with a focus on disadvantage will be introduced on 1 January 2008 and will continue to complement the universal supports in place for all parents.  The Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) has been allocated €153 million over the next 3 years representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme.  Under the new scheme, services will be grant aided according to the service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  As part of their application for funding under the new scheme, services will be required to ask parents using their services to complete a simple declaration form which will be included in a return to my Office and on which basis the level of subvention for each service will be determined.  The subvention received by services will, in turn, be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.In practice, this will mean that parents with children in such services and in receipt of most social welfare payments (or participating in a scheme such as Community Employment which demonstrates an underlying entitlement to same) will see a €80 weekly subvention in respect of full day care (with pro-rata reductions in respect of shorter hour services).  Parents in receipt of Family Income Supplement (FIS) will see a €30 weekly subvention in respect of full day care (with pro-rata reductions).  A further subvention of €30 per week will be paid where the subvented child is a baby, in recognition of the higher costs associated with the care of children aged under 1 year.  Parents who do not qualify under either of these categories will be charged the cost price for their child care service, however, as community not-for-profit services will, generally, have availed of capital grant aid under the EOCP or NCIP removing the requirement to cover rent or a mortgage, and as the services are run on a not-for-profit basis, this should still be significantly below the market price.It is considered that the new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community child care services generally.  The scheme has been informed by and takes account of a number of enhancements recommended by the report of the Value for Money Review of the EOCP.  These include the fact that the subvention to services will be more responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage supported and the ceiling for funding, which existed under the previous scheme, is being removed.  Account will also be taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones, which at present are, in some cases, inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.The new scheme has clear advantages over its predecessor.  There is an increase in the level of funding available under it, and a majority of services will benefit from the changes it introduces.  Existing EOCP staffing grant recipients who enter the new scheme will continue to be funded at their current levels until July 2008.  My Office has engaged in a series of meetings with existing grant recipients to outline to them the details of the new scheme and to gather feedback from the services themselves.  A meeting with representatives of the City and County Childcare Committees has also taken place.Transitional arrangements have been made under which existing grant recipients will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1st July 2008.  This is to ensure that existing child care services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.  As signalled when I announced the new scheme in July this year, the transitional period between now and 1 July 2008 will also be used to monitor and review the impact it will have on individual groups, on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data which will be generated under the new grant application process.  If appropriate, any adjustments necessary to the scheme to secure the best outcomes for child care services and for disadvantaged parents and their children will be considered on the basis of these data and well in advance of the commencement of the new funding levels in July 2008.

The Group in question was approved a total of €220,000 staffing grant assistance under the scheme including €108,800 to cover the period to the end of December 2007.  The Group has also been approved a total of €22,297 in capital grant assistance under the EOCP.As signalled at the launch of the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), the successor programme to the EOCP, a new scheme to support community childcare services with a focus on disadvantage will be introduced on 1 January 2008.  The Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) has been allocated €153 million over the next 3 years representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme.

After 2010 the HSE will continue to increase capacity to ensure that these needs continue to be met.I fully support the appointment by the HSE of Prof. Tom Keane as Interim National Cancer Control Director.  Investment in cancer control will be based on the reform programme now being implemented by the HSE.  I consider it essential that the National Cancer Control Programme is delivered as rapidly as possible and I am particularly keen to see early progress in this regard.  I intend to chair regular review meetings involving the HSE and Prof. Keane to monitor delivery of the programme.  Progress will also be considered on an ongoing basis by the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Health & Children.

The health services have a key role to play working with communities and a range of other statutory and non-statutory interests in ensuring a co-ordinated and integrated response in such areas.I am also aware of the research study titled ‘Taking the First Steps to a Healthier Fettercairn' which was launched recently.  In this regard, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has indicated to my Department that it proposes to meet with the Fettercairn Community Health Project in order to discuss and progress activation of the report's recommendations on health services.The Programme for Government commits to ensuring that there is a primary care team serving every community, with particular reference to new and rapidly growing areas.  Five hundred new primary care teams will be funded by 2011.  Primary Care services are provided by a wide range of community based, directly employed health care professionals, and private contractors, such as GPs; Community Pharmacists; Dentists; Community Ophthalmic clinicians and Chiropodists/Podiatrists and their practice staff.  Funding totalling €32m has been provided in 2006 and 2007 for the establishment of 200 Primary Care Teams involving 600 new frontline professionals (300 per year).Under the Health Act 2004, the management and delivery of health and personal social services are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.  This includes operational responsibility for the selection and recruitment of general practitioners to provide services under the General Medical Services Scheme and also the selection of locations for Primary Care Teams.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement, including the number of staff employed in an administrative capacity.  In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of the Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.  The Executive is the appropriate body to consider the matter raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued to the Deputy.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	562	As the Deputy will be aware, health services in Ireland were, for many years, delivered through a combination of public, voluntary and private suppliers.  Eight Health Boards were established under the Health Act (1970) to provide health and personal social services for the population.  The Eastern Regional Health Authority (ERHA) was established on 1 March 2000, replacing the Eastern Health Board.  The ERHA comprised three area health boards which covered the same region as the former Eastern Health Board.Apart from the establishment of the ERHA in 2000, the system of delivery of health and personal social services remained unchanged for over thirty years, during which time the complexity of services and the degree of inter-working between different agencies and sectors had greatly increased.  The location of specialist and tertiary level services and the planning of new services had a regional rather than a national focus.  There were inequalities in the level of services provided in different health board areas and inconsistencies in the interpretation of eligibility for services.  Duplication of services in adjacent areas and lack of provision in other areas occurred.  Different and incompatible IT systems were developed in different health boards and in voluntary hospitals, making the sharing of information difficult or impossible. Administration costs in supporting what were, in effect, eleven different health boards were higher than necessary.  The decision was taken to develop a new health strategy to review the existing situation and plan for the future of the health system in Ireland.The Health Service Reform Programme, which was approved by Government in June 2003, outlined a range of reforms to help deliver a more responsive, adaptable health system that meets the needs of the population effectively and at an affordable cost.  The reform programme comprises a range of reforms to help modernise the health services to better meet the needs of patients. The reforms are designed to achieve a health service that provides high quality care, better value for money and improves health care management. The structural aspects of the Reform Programme emerged largely from the recommendations in the Prospectus and Brennan commission reports and reflected Government decisions in relation to reforming the other areas outlined as Frameworks for Change.Under the Health Act 2004, the health boards, Eastern Regional Health Authority and the area health boards were abolished and all staff, powers, functions and resources were transferred to the HSE.  The HSE is tasked with delivery of health and personal social services through a single national structure. The Health Service Executive (HSE) is a unitary system, a single organisation delivering health services nationwide. This unitary system allows for clear accountability structures and modern financial management systems to allow key decision makers in the health service to link activities with budgets and thus to evaluate the effectiveness of their decisions.The HSE is undertaking the task of unifying the formerly fragmented healthcare delivery into a single unitary system.  The HSE has recently launched its Transformation Programme based on six transformation priorities which include:developing integrated services across all stages of the care journey,configuring primary, community and continuing care services to deliver optimal and cost effective resultsconfiguring hospital services to deliver optimal and cost effective resultsimplementing a model to prevent and manage chronic illnessimplementing standards based performance measurement and management throughout the HSEensuring all staff engage in transforming health and social care.Some of these projects are already under way and most will have significant impact right across the organisation and will alter the way the HSE itself is organised.  Indeed, the HSE continues their dialogue with some unions regarding the final configuration of staffing structures.  All projects will be subjected to rigorous ongoing assessment, however, it is too early in the process to be definitive regarding overall financial savings emerging to-date.

I am committed to ensuring that the BreastCheck and Irish Cervical Screening Programmes are rolled out nationally as soon as possible.  That is why I established a National Cancer Screening Service in January this year.  This will maximise the expertise in both programmes, ensure improved efficiency and develop a single governance model for cancer screening.  BreastCheck will commence roll-out later this month and the Irish Cervical Screening Programme will commence roll-out in January 2008.As the Deputy may be aware, my Department does not have responsibility in relation to the provision of services to individuals. The Health Act 2004 provided for the creation of the Health Service Executive (HSE) which was established on 1 January 2005. Pursuant to the Act, the HSE has the responsibility to manage and deliver or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for all health related supports. Accordingly as the HSE is a separate legal entity, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

Under Section 45 of the Health Act, 1970 medical cards are provided for persons who, in the opinion of the HSE, are unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.In assessing eligibility, the HSE uses guidelines based on people's means, which includes their income, certain allowable outgoings and the effect of other factors which may impact on people's ability to meet the cost of GP services. There are also a number of income sources, including the Carer's Allowance, which are disregarded in assessing an applicant's income. Furthermore, people whose sole source of income is from social welfare or HSE allowances and benefits are allowed a medical card.The existing assessment arrangements will not be affected by provisions announced in Budget 2007 whereby people in receipt of a social welfare payment, who are also providing full time care and attention, will be able to retain their main welfare payment and receive another payment, the maximum of which, depending on their means, will be equivalent to a half rate Carer's Allowance.

Accordingly, in the case of works on non-national roads, costs associated with the proper and safe management of such works are a matter for local authorities to be funded from their own resources supplemented by State road grants provided by my Department.My Department provides grants to local authorities for works on non-national roads under a number of grant categories. The level of grants allocated to individual authorities is determined each year having regard to a number of factors including the total funds available in a particular year, eligibility criteria for the different grant schemes, road pavement conditions, length of road network, the need to prioritise projects and competing demands from other local authorities. In determining the annual non-national road grant allocations, the overall objective is to resource each local authority appropriately in relation to their ongoing and special needs.All non-national road grants for 2007 have now been committed and there are no additional funds at my disposal from which further grant allocations could be made at this time. Road grants for 2008 will be determined early in the New Year.Funding of works on national roads is a matter for the National Roads Authority.

The dire situation gives added urgency to the efforts being made by President Mbeki of South Africa and the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) to broker a political accommodation between the parties and an economic rescue plan which will respond to the catastrophic current situation.  We strongly support President Mbeki's efforts.  I believe that Zimbabwe's neighbours are best placed to keep up the necessary pressure on President Mugabe's government to alter the failed policies which have brought economic collapse and misery to its people.Ireland supports and looks forward to the EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon from 8-9 December 2007.  I believe that this Summit will be timely and important for strengthening Europe's overall relationship with Africa and reaffirming our tradition of mutual engagement.  The EU and Africa share an interest in working together to tackle the full spectrum of global challenges, including achieving the Millennium Development Goals, peace and security, human rights, migration, the environment, energy and trade.  There are also specific country situations on which we share common concerns.  The preparation of a Joint EU-Africa Strategy which will be adopted at the Lisbon Summit this December gives us an opportunity to define together how we can co-operate on these issues going forward.  The EU and the African Union will have to work together to find a formula for Zimbabwe's representation at the Lisbon Summit.  The question of how the situation in Zimbabwe might be addressed at the Summit is also under consideration.Ireland believes that it would be better if President Mugabe did not attend the Summit, and we have urged the Portuguese Presidency to explore creatively all other options for Zimbabwean representation.  For example, at EU-ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations) Summits, Burma/Myanmar has been represented by its Foreign Minister, although representation at Summits is usually at Head of State or Government level.  However, I am aware that many African countries feel strongly about this issue.  Likewise, many EU Member States do not wish the EU's relations with an entire continent to be held hostage to one country's problems. Invitations to the EU-Africa Summit have not yet been issued, and until all avenues have been explored it would be premature to comment further on how the issue will unfold.Partnership with Africa is a priority for the Government and a focus of Ireland's foreign policy.  This, as well as our deep concern about the sit Partnership with Africa is a priority for the Government and a focus of Ireland's foreign policy.  This, as well as our deep concern about the situation in Zimbabwe, will be fully weighed when the time comes to decide at what level to attend the Summit.

The Review is examining, among other things, how the programme has worked to date and what changes, if any, are required to ensure its effective and efficient delivery.  The Review is currently being finalised and following consideration of any recommendations in the review it is my intention to launch a new round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme.  When the Programme is re-opened, it will be open to all local authorities to submit applications under the terms that will apply.

The Arts Council's funding requirement for the year ahead will be addressed in the context of the 2008 Estimates.  In doing so, the Government must balance competing demands from every part of our economy and society.The Arts Council strategy Partnership for the Arts sets out a programme of work aimed at bringing the arts sector to a level of stability and sustainability.  The total cost of implementing the strategy in full is estimated at €272m over three years and my Department has been working towards providing the funding required for full implementation of the strategy.  To date (since 2005) the Department has provided funding of €162.3m.Funding for the Arts Council has increased from €47.67 million in 2002 to €80 million in 2007 — an increase of almost 68%.  These are significant amounts of money in any context.  This funding has transformed the arts, increasing access to and participation in the arts, and has provided an excellent platform for future development.  My policy on the arts is to promote and strengthen the arts in all its forms, increase access to and participation in the arts and make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life.The table below shows the funding provided to the Arts Council between 1997 and 2007.YearFunding (€m)% ChangeSupplementary EstimateTotal including Supplementary199726.4126.41199833.1425.533.14199935.557.335.55200045.0826.845.08200146.372.91.7748.14200247.672.847.67200344.10-7.544.10200452.519.02.0054.50200561.0016.25.2366.23200672.3118.510.0082.31200780.010.680.00

That is, an accumulated 30 minutes of physical activity per day for at least five days per week.  The research highlighted that more than three quarters of women do some recreational physical activity (principally walking, swimming or aerobics) but the majority do so with insufficient regularity or intensity of effort to meet the minimum standard.In order to address this problem, the Women in Sport programme has received significant Government funding since it was launched in 2005.  Through the Women in Sport programme, this Government supports the work of the Irish Sports Council in encouraging women — young and old alike — to become involved in sport as participants, players, officials and administrators.In relation to Forum on Female Participation in Sport, which is provided for in the Programme for Government, my Department will be liaising with the Irish Sports Council on this matter.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	600	The back to school clothing and footwear allowance (BSCFA) scheme provides a one-off payment to assist eligible families with the extra costs when their children start school each autumn.  The allowance is not intended to meet the full cost of school clothing and footwear but only to provide assistance towards these costs.  Lone parents or couples may qualify for payment of an allowance if they are in receipt of a social welfare payment or Health Service Executive (HSE) payment; are participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course; and have household income at or below certain set levels.Different income limits apply for single parents and couples across different social welfare schemes, for example in the BSCFA and Fuel Allowance schemes.  The rationale for the different income limits for lone parents and couples is to take account of the fact that there is an extra adult in the couple household who has to be provided for, and the income limit for couples reflects this.The income limits for the BSCFA scheme for 2007 are based on the maximum rate of State Pension (contributory) (under 80), plus the qualified adult allowance, plus €100 in the case of married and cohabiting couples; and the maximum rate of widow's/widower's contributory pension (under 80) plus €100 for Lone Parents, plus child dependant allowance in each case. Income Limits for 2007 are:CoupleLone Parent€€1 child470.80331.302 children492.80353.303 children514.80375.304 children536.80*397.30**The limit is increased by €22.00 for each additional child.Any changes to the current income limits for the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme would have cost implications and would have to be considered in a budget context and in the light of the resources available to me for improvements in social welfare generally.

The scheme is also available to customers under age 66 years who satisfy the conditions of the scheme.  There are currently some 350,000 customers in receipt of the household benefits scheme at an annual cost of €315 million, of which some 285,000 of these customers are aged 66 years and over.The free travel scheme is also a non-cash benefit which permits some 600,000 customers, of which 450,000 are aged over 66 years, to travel free on a range of transport services at an annual cost of €64 million.  The monetary value of the electricity allowance, natural gas allowance, telephone allowance and free travel pass to an individual customer depends on usage and may vary from customer to customer.The monetary values of each of the components of the household benefits on 1st January 2000-2007 are as follows:YearElectricity Allowance (Urban)Electricity Allowance (Rural)Natural Gas AllowanceTelephone AllowanceFree TV Licence€€€€€Jan 2000165.00169.00173.00226.0089.00Jan 2001165.00169.00173.00226.0089.00Jan 2002168.00173.00205.00260.00107.00Jan 2003274.00305.00205.00281.00150.00Jan 2004294.00327.00225.00296.00152.00Jan 2005339.00381.00250.00296.00152.00Jan 2006345.00386.00313.00296.00155.00Jan 2007490.00523.00490.00*296.00158.00*My Department increased the value of the telephone allowance in line with industry price increase effective from August 2007 to €311.00 per annum.For accounting purposes within my Department, the average value of a free travel pass is calculated using the total number of recipients at year end and the overall cost of the scheme in an individual year.

In many cases, services are shared between several scheme areas.  Accordingly, it is not possible to identify all the costs associated with administering the State contributory scheme.The further development of systems to support the Management Information Framework and the Annual Output Statement should facilitate the development of accounting arrangements, over time, which will enable expenditure to be linked more closely to services.  Estimated expenditure for my Department in 2007 is nearly €15,335 million of which administrative expenditure from Vote 38 and the Social Insurance Fund amounts to around €467.85 million. This represents 3% of total estimated expenditure.

Under the legislation a number of categories are specifically excluded from receiving assistance. These are people in full-time work, people in full-time education and people involved in trade disputes.The Dublin/Mid-Leinster Area of the HSE has advised that the person concerned was refused basic SWA in June 2007 as he failed, at the time, to provide credible evidence that he satisfied the habitual residence condition and also because he was unable to provide evidence of his sources of income.  The person concerned appealed the decision to the designated appeals officer of the Executive in July 2007.  His appeal was allowed in August 2007 subject to the provision of additional relevant information that would enable the Executive to make a decision regarding his application.The Community Welfare division of the Executive wrote to the person concerned in September 2007 requesting the provision of additional information in order to examine his application.

I met recently with representatives of the sector at which meeting this issue was discussed.While I appreciate the argument for increased pigmeat prices to compensate for higher input costs, the Deputy will be aware that I do not have a role in price setting. I am glad to see, however, that the recent trend in Irish producer prices is upwards with an increase of 7% in the past couple of months.The issue of labelling of pigmeat was also discussed at the meeting.The situation on this is that draft legislation is currently with the Department of Health and Children which will require the origin of pig, poultry and sheepmeat to be shown on its label. A public consultation on this proposal is currently taking place on the website of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland after which it will be necessary to seek the approval of the European Commission.I have also asked Bord Bia to intensify its autumn pork and bacon campaign.

The claw-back arrangements are non-mandatory. Claw-back arrangements were applied in respect of entitlements sold in 2006 and 2007 with a maximum rate of 30% claw-back in 2006 reduced to 15% in 2007.The total amount of money raised through claw-back proved negligible and did not justify the amount and cost of administration associated with the process. Therefore having consulted with the Single Payment Advisory Committee comprising members of the farming organizations, Teagasc and my Department, I decided earlier this year to abolish the claw-back on the sale of Single Payment entitlements. As a result, entitlements traded with or without land from 2008 will no longer be subject to claw-back.This will have the effect of simplifying the process of transferring entitlements for farmers and administrators alike.

The person named did however submit an application for an allocation of entitlements from the 2005 and 2006 Single Payment Scheme National Reserve.As indicated in reply to a previous question from the Deputy, the person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the 2005 Single Payment Scheme National Reserve under Categories A, B and D.Category A caters for farmers who inherited land or received land free of charge or for a nominal sum from a farmer who had retired or died by 16 May, 2005 and who had leased out his/her holding to a third party during the reference period 2000 to 2002.  The person named was deemed unsuccessful under this category as the leased land was not acquired free of charge or for a nominal fee.Category B caters for farmers who made an investment in production capacity in a farming sector for which a direct payment under Livestock Premia and/or Arable Aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000-2002.  Investments can include purchase or long term lease of land, purchase of suckler and/or ewe quota or other investments.  The person named applied in relation to investment in land and was deemed successful.A formal letter outlining my Department's decision on the National Reserve has issued to the person named and the relevant payment due has issued.Category D caters for farmers who inherited or purchased land and who commenced farming after 31 December, 2002 or who commenced farming in 2002 but who received no direct payments in respect of that scheme year.  The person named was deemed unsuccessful under this category as leased land was not eligible under this category in 2005.The person named submitted an appeal against this decision.  This appeal was forwarded to the Independent Single Payments Appeals Committee who have completed their review and they have upheld my Department's decision.  A letter outlining the decision of the Committee has issued to the person named.The person named also submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the 2006 Single Payment Scheme National Reserve under Category B.Category B in the 2006 National Reserve caters for farmers who commenced farming after 31 December, 2002 or who commenced farming in 2002 but who received no direct payments in respect of that scheme year.The person named has been deemed eligible under this category.

The most important of these include extent of the area in question, location, age of the trees, species and environmental considerations.The decision to issue felling licences is taken by my Department following assessment of each application by the Forest Service Inspector for the area concerned and following consultation with the Planning Section of the relevant local authority.  In addition, if considered relevant to the felling application in question, further consultations are carried out by my Department with bodies such as the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Regional Fisheries Boards on environmental and water quality considerations pertaining to the proposed felling site.The supply of false or misleading information in connection with an application for a felling licence is an offence under Section 64 of the 1946 Act, attracting both a fine and potentially imprisonment following summary conviction.  If a licence has already issued on the basis of such information, it may be suspended or terminated under the terms of the Act.A total of 569 and 632 felling licences were issued by my Department for the years 2005 and 2006 respectively.  The granting of planning permission by a local authority does not confer automatic entitlement to a felling licence.  Felling licence applications are assessed by my Department on their own merits.Information concerning the number of applications where planning permission has been granted but a felling licence has been refused is not captured.  In all cases, the decision to grant a licence is informed by the factors outlined above.  The existence of planning permission on a site is not a material factor in the assessment of an application.

On foot of that meeting technical staff from the Department carried out an assessment of the proposed Greenfield site.  The technical report raised a number of issues which need to be addressed by the school authorities and a reply is awaited.The long term projected staffing, on which the school's accommodation needs are based, is being considered in the Department at present.  Once the long term projection has been determined and agreed with the school authorities, the building  project will be considered in the context of the multi annual School Building and Modernisation programme.

The effect of a delegation order was that the SCA would act in place of my Department in instructing a legal team in defending and, where appropriate, settling claims made against the Minister for Education and Science.The decision to withdraw the Supreme Court appeal in the case referred to by the Deputy was taken by the State Claims Agency having regard to the facts of this particular case.  It is not the policy of my Department to comment on individual cases and I do not intend to diverge from that practice in this instance.

Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them, such as the school to which the Deputy refers in the question, may avail of the SCPA and have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly. The prioritisation of urgent cases for assessment is a matter for the school principal in the first instance.The Deputy may be aware that since NEPS was established, we have trebled the number of psychologists in the service. We are committed to increasing its staffing further, so that by 2009 there will be 200 NEPS psychologists.  In this regard recruitment of additional psychologists is currently ongoing and as appointments are made to particular NEPS regions, including the Dublin South West Area, the assignment of further schools to the NEPS service will be expanded.

This will, I believe, provide for a more coherent administrative system. The scheme, which will be underpinned by a new Student Support Bill, will facilitate consistency of application, improved client accessibility and timely delivery of grants.The Student Support Bill is at an advanced stage of preparation, and I hope to be in a position to publish it shortly.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	637	My Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students. These are the Higher Education Grants Scheme, the Vocational Education Committees' Scholarships Scheme, the Third Level Maintenance Grants Scheme for Trainees and the Maintenance Grants Scheme for Students attending Post Leaving Certificate Courses.The Higher Education Grants Scheme is administered by the Local Authorities.  The other three schemes are administered by the Vocational Education Committees.  Under the terms of the maintenance grants scheme grant assistance is awarded to students who meet the prescribed conditions of funding including those which relate to nationality, residency, means and previous academic attainment.The Nationality requirement as set out in the 2007 Grant schemes states:-Candidates must:hold E.U. Nationality; orhave Official Refugee Status; orhave been granted Humanitarian Leave to Remain in the State (prior to the Immigration Act 1999); orbe a person in respect of whom the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has granted permission to remain following a determination not to make a deportation order under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999; orhave permission to remain in the State by virtue of marriage to an Irish national residing in the State, or be the child of such person, not having EU nationality; orhave permission to remain in the State by virtue of marriage to a national of another EU Member State who is residing in the State and who is or has been employed, or self-employed, in the State, or be the child of such a person, not having EU nationality; orbe nationals of a member country of the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland.A non-EU national who has been granted permission to remain in the State on the basis of an Irish born child does not comply with the above conditions and is ineligible for grant assistance under the nationality requirement of the Schemes.  Likewise, those in the asylum seeking process, and their children, do not satisfy the nationality requirement of the Schemes.Any extension to the scope of the maintenance grants schemes can be considered only in the light of available resources and in the context of competing demands within the education sector.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	638	The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all children, including those with autism, receive an education appropriate to their needs.  With regard to specific provision for children with autism, the Government believes that as each child with autism is unique; such children should have access to a range of different interventions to meet their individual needs. Applied behavioural analysis, or ABA, is one of the methodologies used in special classes for children with autism.Advice received from international experts on autism, the National Educational Psychological Service and the inspectorate inform the Department of Education and Science's view that a range of approaches should be used, rather than just one. An analysis of research, including the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism, also supports this approach, and autism societies in other countries also caution against relying on just one intervention. By enabling children in special classes to have access to a range of methodologies, including ABA, the Government is doing what we are advised is in the best interests of such children.The use of ABA as part of the range of interventions is particularly useful for addressing behavioural issues. My Department therefore supports the use of ABA and training is provided for teachers in its use. It is important that children have access to a range of methods so their broader needs can be met. Whereas ABA helps to improve behaviour, other interventions, such as TEACCH and PECS, are important in developing children's communication skills.Children in special classes have the benefit of fully-qualified teachers trained in educating and developing children generally and who have access to additional training in autism-specific approaches, including ABA. The level of such training available to teachers has significantly improved in recent years and is a major priority for the Government. Children in special classes also have the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration into mainstream classes and of interaction with other pupils.In excess of 265 autism-specific classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level and the National Council for Special Education will continue to establish more such classes where the need arises.  At primary level there are a maximum of six children in each special class with a teacher and at least two special needs assistants (SNAs). Extra assistants are provided where the children need them. An individual child can have access to full-time support from an individual SNA if he or she needs one.My Department is currently funding an ABA pilot scheme which was established in the absence of this network of special classes in our schools. The Government is committed to long term funding for the centres participating in the scheme, subject to agreement on standards that will enable my department to support them as primary schools for children with autism. In terms of autism provision in other locations including Co. Mayo, we will continue to work to ensure that all children can have access to a broad programme, with provision for ABA as appropriate, in special classes.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	639	I understand the Deputy is asking about eligibility for a grant under the maintenance grant schemes rather than eligibility to attend a course.My Departments Maintenance Grants Schemes, which are assessed by the relevant Local Authority or the local VEC's, define a mature student to mean a person of not less than 23 years of age, on the 1st day of January in the year of entry to an approved course in an approved institution.Mature students may be categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his/her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.When assessing the means of students, other than Independent Mature Students, the Acts specify that the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit.  This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not an independent mature student.The condition relating to residency requires, in the case of a candidate under 23, the candidate's parents or guardians to have been resident in the administrative area of a Local Authority from 1st October of the previous year.  In the case of an ‘Independent Mature Candidate' the candidate himself/herself must have been resident in the administrative area of a Local Authority from 1st October of the previous year. The Scheme specifies that the Local Authorities have discretion to waive this requirement in exceptional circumstances.From the information provided by the Deputy it would appear that the student referred to is currently 22 years of age- DOB 16/09/1985 — and, therefore, does not qualify to be assessed as a mature student and must be assessed with reference to parental income and address.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	640	Under the terms of my Department's Post Primary School Transport Scheme, a pupil is eligible for transport if s/he resides 4.8 kilometres or more from her/his local post primary education centre.The scheme is not designed to facilitate parents who choose to send their children to a post-primary centre outside of the catchment area in which they reside. However, children who are fully eligible for transport to the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside, may apply for transport on a concessionary basis to a post-primary centre outside of their own catchment area — otherwise known as catchment boundary transport. These children can only be facilitated if spare seats are available on the bus after all other eligible children travelling to their local post-primary centre have been catered for. Such children have to make their own way to the nearest pick-up point within that catchment area.The Programme for Government includes a commitment to review the school transport scheme, including catchment boundaries.  My Department is currently considering how best to progress this task.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	645	The European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) (No. 2) Regulations 2006 (SI No. 656 of 2006) amended earlier regulations which transposed the European Directive (dated 29 April 2004) on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States.  As provided for in Regulation 3(2) the Regulations do not apply to non-EEA family members unless they were lawfully resident in another EU Member State and they are seeking to accompany the EU citizen to Ireland or to join the EU citizen in Ireland.  Consequently, non-EEA family members who do not satisfy the condition in Regulation 3(2) cannot benefit from the entitlements set out in the Regulations.In cases where the non-EEA spouse of an EU citizen does not qualify for the entitlements as a result of Regulation 3(2) it is not the result in every such case that the right to remain in the State is refused and the non-EEA national must leave.  Applicants who are refused under the above Free Movement Regulations may be entitled to permission to remain under national immigration measures and the outcome of each case depends on its particular circumstances.  The persons who are required to leave the State are those who do not have permission to be in the State under EU or national measures or who were already under an instruction to leave.  That requirement to leave the State does not arise from a technicality but relates to the unlawful presence of the person in the State.  The Deputy refers to cases of families who had a vote in the general election.  That would suggest that one of the family members is an Irish citizen (or possibly a British citizen) and if that is the case then there are other criteria apart from the above matters relating to any non-EEA family members of an Irish citizen who wish to remain in the State.

This represents an increase of 35 members over the 358 members in the Division on 31 August 2006.  The Deputy will appreciate that, as with any large organisation, on any given day,  the overall strength of the organisation may fluctuate due, for example, to  retirements, resignations etc. It is the responsibility of the Garda Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his or her Division taking everything into account.The following table shows the strength of Gardaí in the Carlow/Kildare Division broken down by Station as of 31 August 2006 and 31 August 2007:DistrictStation31/08/0631/08/07NaasNaas8899Celbridge2023Clane77Kill32Maynooth1513KildareKildare2929Robertstown34Kilcullen24Monasterevin35Rathangan24Carbury24Newbridge3533CarlowCarlow5769Leighlinbridge11Ballon11Myshall11Muinebheag77Athy1817Castledermot22BaltinglassBaltinglass2433Blessington1815Dunlavin11Hollywood11Donard11Shillelagh11Tinahely22Hacketstown22Rathvilly11Ballymore Eustace11Tullow99Ballytore11TOTAL358393There are four Community Gardaí stationed in Co.

As the nature of the Reserve is that participation is purely voluntary, Garda Reserve members have work, family and other commitments which they have to balance with their service in An Garda Síochána.An Garda Síochána and the PAS is offering maximum flexibility in order to accommodate those who wish to put themselves forward for service.  Recruitment is ongoing and new applications are accepted at any time.  It is open to those who have initially shown interest in becoming Garda Reserve members to renew that interest now, or at any stage in the future, and An Garda Síochána and the PAS will continue to facilitate those who are interested.  I have been informed that the PAS intend contacting people from Kildare again in the near future in order to arrange interviews for them in the coming months.There are currently five members of the Garda Reserve on Phase IV training who are due to qualify in November, 2007 and will be allocated to Carlow / Kildare Division — two to Naas and Blessington and one to Newbridge.A further two members of the Garda Reserve are on Phase II training and are due to qualify in December, 2007 and will also be allocated to Carlow / Kildare Division.

Operation Pentameter II was launched in London by the UK Home Secretary on 3 October 2007.   Officials from my Department and senior Garda officers have been participating in planning meetings since earlier this year and it is intended that An Garda Síochána will run complementary enforcement operations in this jurisdiction at the same time as the United Kingdom.The operation which is led by Gloucestershire Constabulary is a proactive and co-ordinated campaign of activity to tackle the trafficking in human beings for sexual exploitation throughout the common travel area of Ireland and the United Kingdom.  The sharing of intelligence between police in both jurisdictions is occurring on a regular basis, and co-operation in investigating suspected cases of human trafficking which impact on both the UK and Ireland is ongoing.Through Operation Pentameter, a significant level of cooperation has developed, particularly in the area of training, with input from the UK authorities into training courses run by staff from the Garda Training College.  An Garda Síochána is in the process of providing training, relating to human trafficking, to over one hundred officers to enable them to recognise the indicators of trafficking and, through intelligence-gathering, to enhance our knowledge-base surrounding this type of criminal activity.A senior officer at Detective Superintendent rank from An Garda Síochána has been appointed as a liaison officer with Operation Pentameter and he continues to meet with his counterparts in the UK on a regular basis with a view to ensuring that co-ordination of activity between the two jurisdictions in tackling human trafficking is in place.  Furthermore, a member of the Police Service Northern Ireland (PSNI) is also currently seconded to the Garda National Immigration Bureau in relation to this issue and this will maximise the co-operation between An Garda Síochána and the PSNI with regard to the problem of human trafficking.Operation Pentameter II is linked to a larger initiative on human trafficking being undertaken in a number of European countries including Ireland and this larger initiative will be launched in Brussels soon.As part of Operation Pentameter 1, a poster campaign was launched in both Ireland and the UK to encourage victims of human trafficking to report their plight to State authorities.  The undertaking of additional awareness raising initiatives in both the UK and Ireland during Operation Pentameter II has been discussed and plans are being formulated in this regard.Legislation providing for the criminalisation of trafficking in persons for the purpose of exploitation will be published in the very near future.  This legislation will criminalise trafficking in human beings as provided for in EU Council Framework Decision on combating trafficking in persons. The criminal law provisions in other international instruments, including the Council of Europe Convention on action against trafficking in human beings, are also being taken into account in the legislation.  The term "exploitation" in the Bill is defined as meaning sexual or labour exploitation or the removal of a person's organs for the purpose of transplanting into another person.The legislation will be the first in a series of measures to be rolled out over the next year and I intend to make a further public announcement in relation to the issue of human trafficking later on this week.  Because of the clandestine nature of the activity there are inherent difficulties in making an estimate of the kind sought by the Deputy but while there is no evidence of a substantial human trafficking problem in Ireland, the Government is determined that all necessary actions are taken to ensure that it does not become a significant problem in the future.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	652	Following the submission in 2004 of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, it was decided that the compilation and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from the Garda Síochána. The Garda Síochána Act, 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose. Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics since the third quarter of 2006. In addition, it has compiled and published a series of quarterly and annual statistics for the period starting with the first quarter of 2003. I understand that the CSO are examining how the crime statistics published might be expanded and made more comprehensive.  I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics sought by the Deputy directly to him.The Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990 sets out very strict provisions for the control of knives and offensive weapons.  The Act makes it an offence for any person, irrespective of age, to:possess any knife or any other article which has a blade or which is sharply pointed in any public place, without good reason or lawful authority;trespass with a knife or any article made for causing injury to or incapacitating a person, andproduce any article, capable of inflicting serious injury, in a manner likely to intimidate another person in the course of committing an offence or appearing to be about to commit an offence or in the course of a dispute or fight.Any person found guilty of such offences is liable on conviction to a fine or imprisonment for a term of up to five years or both.A person found guilty of murder through stabbing or otherwise is liable to the highest possible penalty of a mandatory penalty of life imprisonment.The legislative provisions dealing with offensive weapons, and any other measures which might be taken to counteract this problem, are kept under constant review by my Department.Prior to the commencement of the new sentences for a range of firearms offences provided for in the Criminal Justice Act 2006, an amnesty was granted for persons who were in possession of firearms and offensive weapons, including knives, to dispose of them.As the courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on penalties handed down by the courts.I have the power under the Garda Síochána Act to set policing priorities for the Garda Síochána, and I am in the course of determining these priorities for 2008.  One of the areas I intend to prioritise is targeting the use of knives in violent attacks.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	654	Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, was commenced on 1 January, 2007. Part 13 of the Act relating to anti-social behaviour by children was commenced on 1 March, 2007.  These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of An Garda Síochána, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and to the making of a behaviour order by the Children Court.I am informed by the Garda authorities that 202 behaviour warnings have issued to adults up to 31 August, 2007 and 59 behaviour warnings issued to children in the same period.I am further informed by the Garda authorities that there have been two formal good behaviour contracts, which are used only in the case of children, agreed up to 30 September, 2007.Some inaccurate conclusions have been drawn from the fact no ASBOs have yet been applied for by the Garda authorities. In setting up the regime, the intention was that behaviour warnings or good behaviour contracts would  address the problem behaviour. It is only if they fail that an ASBO will be applied for.

The application was refused as the applicant did not satisfy the continuous residency criteria of that scheme.My Department is currently appealing a number of matters related to the IBC/05 scheme, including the issue of continuous residency, to the Supreme Court.  The application in question may be considered further in the light of the findings of the Court.

Under these provisions, it is open to a local authority to initiate a proposal for the alteration of its boundaries. This involves preparation of a formal boundary alteration proposal by the authority concerned including financial, organisational and other implications, invitation of public submissions, and consultation with the other local authorities affected by the proposal, prior to submitting a formal application to the Minister.  I understand that Waterford City Council is developing a boundary alteration application under the above legislation.

In 2005, a building at Coole Park, Gort, Co Galway was destroyed by fire as a result of an electrical storm.  The building has not been rebuilt as alternative accommodation was available.  Some equipment has been stolen in the period. While some has been recovered with the cooperation of the Gardaí, items to the value of €14,000 had to be replaced.

While my Department approves the overall programmes, it is the responsibility of local authorities to prioritise and advance individual projects.  The overall programme proposed by Dublin City Council was approved by my Department on 24 April 2007.In progressing individual elements of programmes, local authorities must comply with certain project appraisal and assessment requirements.  In that context, Dublin City Council was asked by my Department on 30 July 2007 to prepare a cost benefit analysis for projects under their precinct improvement programme, including the flats complex in question.  In addition, my Department has raised concerns regarding some design elements of the proposed works.A response from Dublin City Council is awaited.

It has been widely sold for many years as an oxygenating plant for garden ponds and aquaria. However, it is now viewed as a major threat to Irish lakes and their associated wildlife since it became established in Lough Corrib in 2005.Section 52(6)(a) of the Wildlife Act 1976 (as amended) provides for regulations prohibiting the possession or introduction of any species of wild flora which may be detrimental to native species. Work is under way in my Department in preparing regulations as part of a range of measures being taken on an all-Ireland basis to address the threat posed by a number of invasive plant and animal species.

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	668	The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) carried out a nationwide survey of radon gas in domestic dwellings between 1992 and 1999.  The survey involved the measurement of radon for a 12-month period in a random selection of homes in each 10 km x 10 km grid square throughout the country.  The results of the survey were used to predict the percentage of houses in each grid square with radon concentrations in excess of 200 Becquerels per cubic metre (Bq/m3), which is the National Reference Level in respect of houses.  Grid squares where this percentage is greater than 10% are designated as High Radon Areas and such grid squares exist in every county.  The RPII's website, www.rpii.ie, contains a comprehensive map which shows the location of High Radon Areas throughout the country.  County radon maps and survey results can be viewed also on that website by clicking on the county by name.  The RPII has measured over 30,000 homes in Ireland since establishing its radon measurement programme in the early 1990s.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	669	Sludge is a waste water treatment by-product and the generation of methane gas for use as a fuel is a potentially beneficial feature of sludge treatment, in particular anaerobic digestion.  Sludge treatment facilities should not release methane into the environment in the course of normal operation, nor should methane gas be released from a well-operated and maintained waste water collection or treatment system.  The European Communities (Waste Water Treatment) (Prevention of Odours and Noise) Regulations 2005 require sanitary authorities to ensure that waste water treatment plants in their control are operated and maintained in a manner that does not cause a nuisance through odours or noise emissions.  The authorities are also required to maintain records of odour and noise incidences occurring in treatment plants and to provide details of any such incidences in their annual report to the Environmental Protection Agency.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	670	The Government's housing policy statement — Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities — and the National Development Plan 2007-2013 reflect the strong commitment to expand social and affordable housing provision contained in the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016.  The NDP provides the resources — €18 billion in total — which will support increased output from social and affordable housing measures and result in the needs of 140,000 new households being met in this period.  Within this, a significant programme of activity to assist house purchase is provided for.  In particular, over the period of the NDP, 40,000 households will benefit from affordable housing.  Some 17,000 of these will be delivered in the first three-year period, in line with the agreement in Towards 2016.   My Department is working closely with local authorities and the Affordable Homes Partnership to achieve the significant increase in delivery required to meet these ambitious targets.  In addition, NDP resources will be used to meet the needs of 100,000 households through a range of social housing measures.  Some 63,000 new social homes will be commenced or acquired in the 2007-13 period, through a combination of local authority, voluntary and co-operative housing and new units for the rental accommodation scheme.  Further households will benefit as they transfer to the rental accommodation scheme with their existing landlords or from naturally occurring vacancies.  Over the 2007-09 period, sufficient resources will be made available to commence or acquire 27,000 new units of social housing.  To ensure that these programmes are delivered in a coherent and co-ordinated manner, City and County Councils have put in place multi-annual Housing Action Plans which encompass delivery of social and affordable housing in their areas, including Town Councils.  Meetings are being held with local authorities, as part of the ongoing interaction on Housing Action Plans, to support delivery in the 2008-10 period.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	671	I propose to take Questions Nos. 320 and 321 together.Air quality assessment is the responsibility of the Environmental Protection Agency and air quality management is a matter for local authorities informed by air quality measurement data.  The EPA report, Air Quality in Ireland 2006, which was published earlier today, contains details of the monitoring and assessment of national air quality and incorporates data from all air quality monitoring stations operated by the EPA and local authorities, including monitors in County Kildare.  Air quality was good throughout the country in 2006 and complied with the air quality standards in force for all pollutants.  The report is available on the EPA's website, www.epa.ie.  If the indicative level for any pollutant is exceeded, the Air Quality Standards Regulations 2002 require the local authority concerned, following notification by the Agency, to develop a long-term air quality management plan to ensure compliance with the thresholds for the relevant pollutant or pollutants, including those arising from traffic.  As the monitoring in 2006 indicated that air quality in Ireland is good and complied with the air quality standards in force for all pollutants, I understand that the EPA required no local authority to develop a long-term air quality management plan.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	672	Excavations at sites listed on the statutory Record of Monuments and Places are licensed by my Department under section 26 of the National Monuments Act 1930, as amended, with the exception of excavations associated with approved road developments.  In the latter case, archaeological excavation works are carried out in accordance with ministerial directions issued under section 14A of the National Monuments Act 1930, as amended, following consultation with the Director of the National Museum of Ireland.  The specific reasons for any application for an excavation licence or for ministerial directions are carefully considered by my Department on a case-by-case basis and licences and directions are issued, with conditions as appropriate, in line with national and international best practice.  All excavations carried out under licence or directions, including those undertaken in association with development projects, have the potential to add to the overall state of knowledge of our past.  My Department will continue to support the development of this information resource and to disseminate knowledge and awareness of the archaeological heritage as widely as possible.For the past number of years my Department has provided grants, through the Royal Irish Academy, for archaeological excavations aimed at increasing the body of archaeological knowledge.  For each of 2006 and 2007, these grants amounted to €200,000.  I am currently considering measures that could be taken to further enhance archaeological research.  My Department funds all excavations associated with conservation works to National Monuments in State ownership or guardianship and provides financial support for the publication of the annual Excavations Bulletin which summarises the results of all licensed archaeological excavations undertaken in the State.  The Discovery Programme, which undertakes targeted research excavations, is supported by the Heritage Council, which is funded by my Department.  My Department continues to fund the publication of reports on various archaeological research projects.  Last week, for example, I launched Volume 5: The New Survey of Clare Island; Archaeology.  Further publications on Kells Priory in County Kilkenny, Ardfert Cathedral and a national shipwreck inventory for Counties Louth, Meath, Dublin and Wicklow are due for publication soon.To further assist in disseminating archaeological knowledge my Department is live-testing a dedicated archaeology website, www.archaeology.ie.  My Department has initiated and implemented a number of tailored education and awareness raising projects highlighting Ireland’s archaeological heritage such as the Archaeology in the Classroom project for primary schools undertaken in conjunction with the Limerick Education Centre.  A further version of this project tailored for Transition Year is at an advanced stage of development.  It is my intention that the review of archaeological policy and practice in Ireland, which I have initiated and which will include public consultation with relevant stakeholders, will address in-depth issues of the type raised in the question.
