          <p eId="para_17">The committee is in public session to deal with the scrutiny of statutory instruments 28 and 37 of 2012.  Members will recall it was agreed at the joint committee meeting of 15 February to invite the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, to discuss these two statutory instruments in detail.  In that context, I welcome the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and thank him for accepting the committee's invitation.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">Regarding its format, the meeting will move directly to a question and answer session which makes sense because members have been circulated with the statutory instruments concerned and may proceed to put questions to the Minister.  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Gallery that all mobile telephones must be switched off and remain so throughout the meeting.  I advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2) <i>(l)</i> of the Defamation Act 2009 witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in regard to a particular matter and you continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Equally, members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_23">We are taking each statutory instrument in sequence so I shall say a few words about SI 28.  To speak bluntly, I am a little surprised to be asked to explain the statutory instrument which is simply about the provision of a Minister of State's wages.  There are two Ministers of State involved.  After the formation of the Government the original statutory instrument in regard to the two Ministers of State who attend at Cabinet was signed.  As members know, the former Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, resigned and was replaced as Minister of State by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, who then received the allowance.  The statutory instrument to provide the appropriate wages was signed, circulated and promulgated in the normal way.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">I do not know what is the issue in regard to this statutory instrument but it is useful for me to put forward some facts in terms of the pay rates, if that is what it is about.  Perhaps a member of the committee believes that Ministers or parliamentarians are paid too much.  If that is the case I would be interested in hearing his or her views and will entertain any views that oppose them because all these matters are constantly under review.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">Take the Taoiseach, for example.  Taking into account the reductions plus the pension levy, the Taoiseach now earns some 37% less than his predecessor.  Again including the pension levy, Ministers earn some 32% less than their predecessors.  One can go through this - I brought the table with me.  Ministers of State with the right to attend Cabinet, namely, the category we are discussing, earn some 28% less than their predecessors.  I suppose I should also mention Deputies.  Taking into consideration the pension levy, Deputies earn some 23% less; the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad some 16% less; the Leas-Chathaoirleach 15% less, and so on.  If one looks across the public service generally, very significant reductions in wage rates have been applied through four different pieces of legislation under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act, or FEMPI.  That is in addition to the impact of the pensions levy.  Bluntly, the political class, to use a phrase beloved of some, has taken much more significant cuts than public servants generally.  That is right and proper.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">In essence, that is the backdrop.  There are categories of pay.  Ministers of State are paid more than Deputies. Ministers of State who attend Cabinet because of additional duties in accordance with the long-standing practice in law, are paid more than Ministers of State and Cabinet Ministers are paid more than that again.  The Tánaiste is paid more than Ministers and the Taoiseach is paid more than the Tánaiste.  That is the hierarchy of the pay scales and I would certainly expect the hierarchy would be maintained.  If there is any issue about the actual pay scales I reiterate I am happy to entertain it.  We might hear people's views in regard to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">If there are particular issues members wish to mention I am happy to hear them.</p>

          <p eId="para_29">I draw the attention of members to the ESRI report published today and a contrast in it concerning which we should be mindful.  Something that surprised me in a report just published is the statement that private sector workers' pay is virtually unchanged by the recession.  The average earning of private sector workers remained virtually unchanged through the worst of the recession, according to the new ESRI research.  In spite of the unprecedented fall in output and the sharp rise in unemployment, average earnings and average labour costs hardly changed between 2006 and 2009.  Perhaps things have changed subsequently but during that period public sector workers certainly took a very significant reduction.</p>

          <p eId="para_30">I thank the Minister for agreeing to take this issue.  I had hoped his first appearance at this committee would be to deal with the annual Estimates.  I must put on public record that I find it unacceptable that the annual Estimates for this year of more than €50 billion in expenditure will not be discussed until the month of May.</p>

          <p eId="para_36">We should have it here.  The only reason we are having the discussion on the Estimate of any Department is that the Government needs to approve funding for the Referendum Commission before the week is out to commence spending money on the campaign.  It is dreadful that it is only on foot of an EU referendum that we are discussing Estimates in the first four months of the year.  The briefing note referred to orders made by the Government under these provisions being made on the proposal of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  I note the statutory instruments are signed by the Taoiseach.  Perhaps the Minister can explain.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">No one disputes that the Minister of State should receive the proposed salary but it is an additional allowance of €17,205 for merely attending Cabinet meetings.  I do not know how many Cabinet meetings are held in a year but if there are 30, it amounts to €573, on top of the ministerial salary, for attending a one-hour or two-hour meeting.  If there are only 20 meetings, the figure rises to €860.  How does the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform feel about a person receiving a good salary and while acknowledging the reductions that have been made, receives €573 for attending a one-hour meeting once a week?  Is this good value for money?</p>

          <p eId="para_38">Deputy Fleming characterises it very badly and bluntly.  The Deputy was happy to support Ministers of State who attended Cabinet meetings receiving €20,000 during the last regime.  We have reduced the sum.  There is a category of pay scales.  For example, the Chairman of a committee is paid more than a member of the committee.  There is an allowance for the additional work, which is normal.  Within the hierarchy of politics, Deputies are paid a salary, Ministers of State are paid more and Ministers of State with the additional responsibility of Cabinet are paid more again.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">It is as if Deputy Fleming is characterising teaching as only the time one is physically in front of the class.  A Minister of State who attends Cabinet meetings has access to all Cabinet documentation and input to all Cabinet debate.  He or she does not have a vote at Cabinet but in my time in three Governments there was only ever one vote at Cabinet, on the appointment of the President of the High Court.  It was the last vote of that Cabinet.  It is normal for the Ministers of State to be very involved in Cabinet.  Only two Ministers of State attend Cabinet - the other in that category is the Government Chief Whip.  The business of the Chief Whip is considered significant because he is advising the Taoiseach.  Some ten years ago, this was independently determined by an independent review to merit a pay grade higher than a Minister of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">The first issue is whether one agrees with the hierarchy of the Minister of State with the responsibility of attending Cabinet deserving to be paid more; the second is the quantum of pay.  People may have views on it and I am happy to hear their views.</p>
          <p eId="para_41">The order is signed by the Taoiseach because, under the Act, the statutory instrument is a Government order, not a ministerial or departmental order.  The signature of the Taoiseach is required for a Government order.</p>

          <p eId="para_43">That is fine.  The Minister made reference to the ESRI report, which reflected the hammering public sector workers had taken relative to their private sector counterparts in the years in question.  The Minister also made reference to a series of financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation that was passed by the House.  The premise of the provisions was that the State was in economic crisis, that crisis measures had to be taken, that we were all in this together, as the saying goes, and that the pain had to be shared proportionately and equally.  This was the position of the Minister time out of number so I cannot see how he can justify an allowance of over €17,000 for a Minister of State, or super junior as they are called, to attend Cabinet.  I do not understand how that makes sense even though I hear what the Minister says about the hierarchy of pay and the levels of pay enjoyed by politicians from the Taoiseach down.</p>
          <p eId="para_44">All of us, and certainly all of the Government, are overpaid and we have debated this matter before.  We are here to discuss the specific allowance.  Given the emergency measures introduced for pay cuts and pension levies, how can Deputy Howlin, as the Minister charged with overseeing public sector reform, politically and personally justify the payment of the allowance?  It is most unlikely the super juniors or the Chief Whip would refuse to attend Cabinet meetings on the basis that they were not in receipt of these moneys.  If I am incorrect, the Minister can tell me.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">The sum of money may seem peanuts when we look at the broader parameters of the financial crisis but it is nonetheless most significant that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, who made budget day announcements on deep expenditure cuts, is standing over this.  Will the Minister reconsider this or revoke it?</p>

          <p eId="para_46">I will repeat what I said because the Deputy is great at broadcasting but not great at receiving.  I believe in the hierarchy of payments for different jobs.  I am sort of a trade unionist and maybe I am trained to think the labourer is worthy of his hire.  There is a hierarchy of pay.  I am not sure whether the Deputy disagrees with the first set of principles, that there should be a hierarchy, and that the Minister of State attending Cabinet meetings has a different role and, because of access to all Cabinet documentation and input into all Cabinet decisions, does not have a departmental function but a whole of Government function.  It is not a matter of a number of hours being spent on it; it is a different job and they should be paid more.</p>
          <p eId="para_47">The Deputy has a strong view that they should be paid less.  That is fine and we can have a debate on it.  We have substantially reduced the pay of all public servants and certainly politicians.  The gross pay of the Taoiseach is 37% less than his predecessor and we have also increased taxes.  The figure for Ministers is 32% and 28% for Ministers of State attending the Cabinet.  There is no parallel reduction in pay among others who have been asked to share the burden.  Should we go further?  I am open to suggestion but we should not single out two individuals.  There was no objection when the former Minister of State, Deputy Willie Penrose, received this allowance and when that statutory instrument was placed before the Dáil.  When a woman gets it, suddenly there is an objection to it.</p>

          <p eId="para_50">Is it because it is Deputy Jan O'Sullivan that what was unchallenged for Deputy Penrose is now challenged?  The principle is very simple - one either accepts or rejects a hierarchy of pay.  Either we should be paid a flat rate for everything, and some regimes have tried it, or we pay people for work done.  If one believes in different jobs, a hierarchy of pay and appropriate differentials accruing to different functions, the only matter to be determined is the appropriate pay level for each.  We have made substantial reductions in the pay of all public servants and I will not pick out two individuals and say that they, alone, should not receive their wages.  If the suggestion is to apply cuts to everybody, I will entertain the notion, but I will not pick out two people.  It is unfair of any individual to try to do that.  I do not agree with Deputy McDonald that the allowance is peanuts; it is a substantial sum of money.  The allowance is there to match a significant job.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">Some Deputies opposite have views on pay for politicians uniquely.  I think politicians do an important job in holding the Government to account.  Members of the Government make extraordinarily difficult and onerous decisions.  All of my colleagues work all the hours God sends.  Are we making mistakes?  Of course we are, but is there a notion that politicians, or the people who are making these hard decisions and governing the country, should somehow be treated differently from senior administrators, Garda officers or medics?  If we are examining public sector pay we must do so in the round.  I know there is popularity attached to bashing office holders, and there are some out there who believe that if we paid nothing at all to politicians it would be too much.  We need to ensure people are paid an appropriate wage.  To answer the question directly, I recommended to the Government this particular set of wages as an appropriate wage.  It may well be, in the context of all allowances payable to everybody, something to which we have to return.</p>

          <p eId="para_53">I assure the Minister there is nothing wrong with the reception on this side of the desk.  I can hear clearly what he is saying.  He is advancing a notion of hierarchy of pay.  This is about fairness.  In my experience of dealing with and debating with the Minister, he has resisted at every turn any suggestion for dealing with very high pay within the public sector.  He has hidden from the issue and run away from it.  It is clear that he stands over this sum of money.  I used the term "peanuts" in respect of the overall budgetary situation, because non-payment of these moneys obviously would not rectify our financial woes, as I am very well aware.  We can use this as a reference point for the Government when it next decides to come in and make further announcements of cuts to services that people rely on.  Notwithstanding the cuts that have been made to the pay of politicians - particularly in the senior ranks, including the Taoiseach - they are still, by international standards, overpaid.</p>

          <p eId="para_57">The Deputy is very good at soundbites, and she plays to it.  It is absurd to suggest that I have either hidden or run away from the issue of high pay.  I am the only Minister who ever put a ceiling on pay in the public service.  We set a threshold when we came to office, a little more than a year ago, of €200,000 for the Taoiseach, which is a significant reduction compared with the pay of his predecessor, and we have graduated all others below that rate.  It was a battle to enforce that ceiling across all grades of the public service.  Some resigned and moved out of the public service; that is fine.  We put in those ceilings and we may well have to go further, but the notion that we have not done so is incorrect.  If 27% is nothing, what about 50%?  I am sure if we made cuts of 50%, that would not be good enough for the Deputy either because there is a soundbite to be had in saying that we should beat people more.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">I am acutely aware of the pressure people are under.  We need an appropriate level of remuneration across the public service generally.  I respect public service.  The notion that if one is in the public service doing an extraordinary job, as people in the hospital services and others are doing, one should be in a different category from the private sector is incorrect.  I was given the ESRI's surprising report about the maintenance of pay levels generally in the private sector.  I am sure that is not uniform - many people have taken pay cuts in the private sector as well - but statistically, that is what has happened.  Statistically, within the public service, people have had pay cuts or levies of the order of 14%.  That is important.  Maybe we do need to go further.  If the Deputy has specific proposals - not for two individuals to get a headline, but for larger groups of people - which will save substantial money, I would like to hear them, and we may have to consider them.</p>

Those of us who are critical of some aspects of politicians' and public servants' pay or allowances are not directing our criticisms - or at least, I and the United Left Alliance are not directing them - towards the vast majority of public servants, who, as the Minister rightly says, have been hit extremely hard with levies and effective pay cuts of 15% to 20% over the last few years.  In the majority of cases, these cuts were unfair and unjustified, and they have resulted in significant economic damage.  My concern is about pay at the top level of the public service, and not only the public service; I am concerned about excessive pay in the private sector as well.  I find it obscene in almost any circumstances, but particularly in circumstances of recession and the imposition of brutal austerity measures on low and middle-income families, that any public servant, or anybody paid with public money or employed by a fully owned State or semi-State company, is earning ten or 15 times the lowest wage.  In the case of ESB, I believe the chief executive is getting in the region of €800,000.</p>

I find it unjustifiable that politicians or people paid with public money can be earning ten times the amount somebody on the lowest level of income is getting - somebody who is living in poverty in the current climate.  Of course there should be fair remuneration for a job done, but I do not see why the Taoiseach needs €200,000 a year and I do not see why Ministers need €140,000 or the Tánaiste needs €180,000.  I do not see how it can be justified when we are imposing brutal austerity on people on the lowest level, who are being plunged into poverty as a result of Government decisions.  How can it be justified?  When allowances are thrown in on top of that, as well as significant budgets for public relations-----</p>

          <p eId="para_71">I am interested in the Deputy's view that the majority of pay cuts imposed were not justified.  I would like to hear his views on which ones were not justified.  We have made significant reductions across the public service and we have also reduced the number of people working the public service, because we have to pay our bills.  I know there are Deputies who oppose all taxes except notional ones - notional taxes are okay but any real tax proposal is to be rejected - and all cuts to services, indeed demanding additional money for services.  However, in the real world we have to cut our cloth.  I am open to hear the views of members as regards the pay rates of anyone in the public service and I accept the bona fides of Deputy Boyd Barrett when he says that he believes that there should be a lower threshold for all public service employees.  However, there are difficulties.  My fear is that we will be unable to employ accountants, lawyers, senior medical people, etc., and it will only be possible to hire them from the private sector because we cannot pay them in the public sector.  This is a model I would not favour.  However, I do not wish to stray from the Chairman's admonition.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">The principle I have set out is that there should be a hierarchy of payments, graduated to responsibility.  This should apply in politics just as exists in any walk of life, that the more onerous the task given, the higher the remuneration.  If there is a view that there should be a flat payment for everybody, that the Taoiseach would be paid the same as a Deputy, I am willing to hear that view.  However, I do not think this works in the real world.  It does not work in the private sector.  We need to pay reasonable rates and this has to be linked to what we can afford.</p>

As we speak, the troika people are in town and they are talking about matters which will have very great consequences both now and in the immediate and near-term future.  It is not appropriate to be doing too much navel-gazing with regard to a statutory instrument such as this one.  It is much ado about nothing.  The Minister has explained that there is a hierarchy of responsibility beginning with being a Dáil Deputy or a Senator and moving ultimately to the Taoiseach, just as in any body of organised activity.  I refer, for example, to the Army.  I do not think anyone would join the Army unless there was a hierarchy of pay.  I do not know what is the top rate of pay in the Army but perhaps it is quite close to what the Taoiseach earns and the same applies in the Garda Síochána.  These rates are merited.</p>

Nevertheless, as we attempt to deflate the Irish economy, we are trying to drive down public sector costs and public sector pay to bring it in line with the EU average rate.  However, the EU average pay of parliamentarians is approximately €84,000 and this is reflected in the pay of MEPs.  It is still slightly less, not substantially less, than what Members of the Dáil earn.  Has consideration been given to cutting the pay rate for Deputies so that it is at the level of the EU average rate which we encourage all other sectors to match?</p>

I do not wish to criticise the Minister too much but the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act was opposed and the other pay cut was also opposed at the time.  The Minister referred to making a cut of 25% or 35% more than the cuts under the previous Government.  The allowance to which he referred was €18,421 under the previous Government and this had been reduced by that Government from €20,023 in September 2008.  The Minister then reduced it by another €1,200 or so.  Therefore, the previous Government had done much of the work and we were attacked for it.  The Minister may not have said specifically that we should not have done that but he attacked the overall legislation which we introduced.  It is unfair to quote the 2008 salaries and say that this Government took a cut based on those figures when in fact the cuts were made from 2008 onwards.</p>

It was interesting that this was done after 14 years.  I can refer to the actual figures.  In September 2008, the Taoiseach was paid €285,583.  The Taoiseach today, after the pay-related deduction, PRD, is paid €181,050.  This is a reduction in excess of €100,000 over those few years.  The Senator is correct that the Financial Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act was enacted in 2010 and the pay-related deduction was introduced subsequently.  There have been a number of deductions in pay over time.  However, in truth, the very substantial payments which members of the previous Administration enjoyed for their 14 years or the bulk of their 14 years has been greatly reduced and rightly so.  I know that no matter how far one goes, there will be some who will say it is not enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">I am reminded that when the Labour Party first entered Parliament in Britain at the turn of the 20th century, one of its first demands was for payment for Members of Parliament because up to that time it had been the prerogative of the landed gentry to represent the shires and the notion that ordinary working people should be given a wage for being a Member of Parliament was a novel concept.  We need to put this into context.  We need to be objective and fair in this regard.  In my view, while the political class, to use that phrase again, should take a very significant pay reduction because it needs to give leadership, this should not be cruel and unusual punishment.  If pay grades are to be reduced, then we should look at the public sector in its totality and generally.  I suggest we reduce pay in all analogous grades on the same basis and we may well have to do this.  However, we have made substantial reductions in the past three years and it behoves the committee to acknowledge this.</p>

          <p eId="para_83">Members will be aware that a public representation allowance is available to Deputies and to Senators.  I refer to the list of categories under which sums can be claimed and which has been circulated to members.  For instance, it shows allowances for rent and rates for constituency offices, improvement in office accommodation, signage in respect of constituency office, maintenance of office furniture and equipment, purchase of stationery, insurance costs, cleaning of office, web hire, and so on.  I was formally approached by the representative group of Dáil Deputies.  I received a formal request signed by two Deputies acting in a representational capacity asking me to include in the list not one cent extra but to include extra secretarial assistance.  The list of priorities in the support base of Deputies changes over time.  For example, before I had the statutory power to do it myself, one recommendation I made to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, was to reduce the number of envelopes available because over the past ten years more work is done through e-mail.  I believe we can go considerably further on the envelope side.  The way Deputies deliver their service with the same sum of money has changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">Over the past few years, the volumes of business coming to a constituency office of a Deputy have become enormous and mean a single secretary cannot cope.  A formal request, which initially came from a Fianna Fáil Deputy, was made to include additional secretarial assistance.  I believed this was a reasonable request as it does not cost the State a cent extra.  Rather than spending money on delivering leaflets, the same money can be used to employ a person one day a week to give a helping hand in a constituency office.  I know public relations came into it but that was because the line approved was for additional secretarial assistance which in the original statutory instrument encompassed public relations work.  Some secretaries did media contact, press releases and that sort of thing which is encompassed in this.</p>
          <p eId="para_85">I made this order because I was approached by a cross-section of Deputies who said this is what they needed.  If I hear from this committee that it is not needed, I will have no difficulty in rescinding the instrument.</p>

I thank the Minister and his Department for forwarding a comprehensive briefing note on the proposed legislation.  Analysing legislation at a pre-publication stage is an important and welcome development.  This committee is determined to engage and contribute to the maximum extent possible in this process both now and in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">I advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the joint committee.

They are directed that only evidence connected to the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they do not criticise or make charges against a person, persons or an entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p>

          <from>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Brendan Howlin)</from>
          <p eId="para_113">As I am the only witness here and I have absolute privilege, even if the Chair stops me, I will retain my absolute privilege.  However, I will do exactly as he instructs.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">I thank the Chair and members of the committee for providing me with this opportunity to present the Government's proposals on whistleblower protection legislation.  In addition to hearing the views of the committee on the general scheme or draft heads of the protected disclosure in the public interest Bill, I hope to be able to provide any additional information which members might require and answer their questions on these important legislative proposals.  I look forward in due course to receiving the committee's formal views on the scope and design of the whistleblower protection regime which is being developed.</p>
          <p eId="para_115">As members will be aware the programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce whistleblower legislation.  Following Government approval, the general scheme of a Bill was published at the end of February last with a view to informing public debate on the measures and to give interested parties the opportunity to provide their input and observations on the proposed approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">In that context, officials in my Department have already consulted with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and Transparency International.  I am pleased that the initial feedback received on the legislative proposals has generally been positive.  It is also important to stress that these proposals meet the recommendation included in the recent report of the Mahon tribunal to introduce a cross-sectoral whistleblower protection Act in place of the existing sectoral approach to whistleblowing protection.  According to the tribunal this fragmented approach has led to a complex and opaque system for protecting whistleblowers which is likely to deter at least some from reporting corruption offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">I strongly believe it is vital that Members of the Oireachtas are provided with an opportunity to consider these proposals and outline their views and perspectives at an early stage in the legislative process.  Too often in the case of important legislative initiatives the first real opportunity available for Members to contribute to the legislative process is on Second Stage subsequent to the publication of a Bill.  I have an open mind on this legislation and will happily embrace any ideas that might improve it.  Important steps have already been taken to promote the role of Oireachtas committees in undertaking what is termed a pre-legislative scrutiny role.  This allows Oireachtas committees to consider draft legislation at an earlier stage and has resulted in a more meaningful input into law making.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">Strengthening the role of the Houses of the Oireachtas in this vital respect is central to the Government's political reform agenda.  While there has been some engagement by my Department with key stakeholders it is critical that Oireachtas committees are given greater opportunities to lead and drive this process, particularly in the case of important reform initiatives such as whistleblowing legislation.  One of the positive results which I hope will emerge from the work under way to regulate lobbying is that discussions with key stakeholders on legislative measures will take place within a structured public process rather than behind closed doors.  We will deal with the lobbying legislation separately but rather than people coming to me perhaps they should come before this committee to express and test their views in public.  That should be the case generally in legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">A structured engagement with the Oireachtas on the legislative proposals is warranted at the earlier heads of Bill stage, particularly since whistleblowing has been described by an authoritative international expert as one of the most complex, conflict-ridden areas of public policy or legislative practice.  I am confident that a review will bring significant benefits in terms of the final design and content of the legislation in delivering on Government policy objectives for safeguarding whistleblowers.  It will also help ensure that we correctly strike the delicate balance in considering the seriousness of the public interest claimed to be at stake against the extent to which the would-be whistleblower's actions were reasonable in the circumstances.  I am grateful to the committee for its willingness to undertake this work.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">The results of a recent Eurobarometer poll remind us - if we needed reminding - of the extent to which a lack of trust in the integrity of business and politics continues to be of significant concern in Ireland, with over eight out of ten people feeling that corruption remains a major problem.  The OECD, among several other authoritative international bodies, has highlighted how facilitating the reporting of misconduct by employees could substantially help organisations detect and respond swiftly to ethical or integrity violations such as fraud and corruption, and in the public sector the mismanagement and misuse of public funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_121">Organisations in both the public and private sectors should therefore welcome the whistleblower who is prepared to disclose information on serious wrongdoing in a workplace as a critical element in detecting and ameliorating malfeasance.  Unfortunately experience shows this is seldom the case and the act of whistleblowing usually damages the career of the whistleblower as well as the image of the organisation concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">The proposed protected disclosure in the public interest legislation can play an important role in encouraging the decisive shift required in the culture of organisations and the perspectives of those working in them to accept the positive contribution that whistleblowing can make to identifying and mitigating significant reputational risks to organisations.  The most effective way to prevent retaliation against whistleblowers is through changes in organisational practice and culture.  Employees who take the risk of disclosing information on serious wrongdoing in the workplace with the public interest as their goal, deserve strong legal protections against victimisation or reprisals for having taken that action.</p>
          <p eId="para_123">The proposed legislation is intended to underpin the development of a business environment in both the public and private sectors where wrongdoing is reported and the negative and undesirable consequences for the individual who discloses such information are minimised or indeed eliminated.  Commentators have rightly stressed that it is unethical for an organisation to encourage its employees to report wrongdoing if it does not also provide appropriate protection when an employee who responded to this call suffers retaliation.  The proposed legislation offers accessible reporting channels to those who want to report wrongdoing.  A key objective is to enable the reporting of potential wrongdoing in a manner which resolves the problem at the earliest possible stage without matters developing to the point where the question of public whistleblowing arises with all the attendant difficulties and problems that it creates.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">The introduction of effective whistleblowing protections applying to all elements of the public service and private sector is an important step in facilitating the bringing of serious wrongdoing to light.  It also has an important role to play in helping to rebuild Ireland's international reputation following major systemic failures in corporate governance and institutional performance which have been widely documented.  The proposed legislation is aligned with best practice internationally, constituting a dedicated, comprehensive and standalone legislative framework in terms of consistency of approach, legal clarity and certainty, and heightened visibility.  At the corporate and organisational level, the proposed whistleblowing legislation provides the opportunity for all relevant bodies to assess the extent to which their systems, processes and culture support the business conduct and outcomes that would stand up to external scrutiny in future circumstances, and that strong legal protections are available to employees who draw attention to wrongdoing and misconduct.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">The draft heads of the protected disclosures in the public interest Bill 2012 provide for an overarching legislative framework for good faith reporting and protected disclosure on a uniform basis for all sectors of the economy covering the public and private sectors.  This includes the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces, subject to specific provisions aligning the making of protected disclosures with safeguarding sensitive or secret information relating to security, intelligence and defence matters and maintaining the integrity of criminal investigations.  The primary elements of the proposed legislative proposals include: extensive coverage of persons in the workplace environment; coverage of a broad scope of wrongdoing; and provision of a number of disclosure channels through which, subject to what is intended to be a stepped disclosure regime, the disclosure of information regarding potential wrongdoing can be communicated to an appropriate authority for investigation.  It also details the protections which a whistleblower can avail of in the case  of having made a protected disclosure and the proposed mechanisms for redress.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">A detailed presentation has been circulated to members of the committee outlining the key points and key features of the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">The introduction of whistleblowers legislation in Ireland represents a further significant step forward in the delivery of the Government's reform agenda.  It underscores the Government's commitment to restoring fully Ireland's international reputation and significantly enhancing corporate governance and standards of accountability.  It presents organisations with a significant external legal benchmark against which they can measure and assess key conduct and behaviours that lead to long-term organisational and business stability and sustainability.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanFleming" eId="spk_71">
          <from>Deputy Sean Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_128">I welcome that the Minister is introducing this legislation and I know he has had a keen personal interest in the topic over a number of years.  It is good that he has the opportunity to deal with it now.  I welcome the general thrust of the Bill and have a few questions.  The Bill deals with the private as well as the public sectors.  Some people might have been concerned that it might have only dealt with the public sector.  It is important that there be a level playing field for all employees regardless of their employer.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">The Minister referred to this representing best international practice.  Does this level of whistleblower legislation exist in other EU countries or is it more restrictive or open?  What is the view of IDA Ireland on these matters?   Companies we are trying to attract to locate here, which are not familiar with this legislation, could be very concerned that they are coming into a country where there is provision for employees or sub-contractors on their sites to make genuinely well-founded but erroneous claims, which might militate against them coming here.  I would welcome the views of those trying to attract business to Ireland.  At the same time, the same rules need to apply as apply to Irish private and public sector companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">I ask the Minister to talk about a "genuine error".  People in big organisations may believe in good faith in what they are saying.  In the previous debate here the Minister mentioned the word "hierarchy" on many occasions.  It is inevitable that someone who is not high up in the hierarchy of an organisation would not be aware of other issues or compensating factors that might mitigate the perceived wrongdoing of which a person is aware in a particular level in an organisation.  There may be other factors higher up in the hierarchy ensuring they never came to pass.  What happens when it is a genuine error?</p>
          <p eId="para_131">The Minister also mentioned there may be immunity from prosecution, an issue with which I always have a problem.  If two people are involved in a court case and one has immunity from prosecution, that person can say and do what he or she likes and the other person cannot do the same.  That is not equality of treatment and it opens up tremendous conflict as to who decides.  Will the DPP need to decide on a case-by-case basis?  While that normally happens in tribunals, it can happen in criminal cases also.  However they need to be very advanced in the process before getting to this immunity.  The Minister also mentioned the issue of retrospection.  I am not aware of too much legislation that has been introduced with retrospective effect.  I ask the Minister to talk about events that might have occurred prior to the enactment of this legislation but could be encompassed by it.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">Overall I welcome the Bill.  Most of the examples the Minister has given relate to the public sector - local authority or HSE workers.  As the discussion continues I would like to see more detail of the protections of people in the private sector and more practical examples as to how this will work in the private sector.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_72" as="#Minister_for_Public_Expenditure_and_Reform">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_133">I thank the Deputy for the welcome he has given the Bill.  He has got to the heart many of the big issues with which we have been grappling.  The first issue related to the pan-sectoral approach which is contrary to the view taken up to now.  I have always believed we needed a simple, understandable pan-sectoral approach so that the same rules apply to people regardless of whether they work in the public or private sector.  The only tweaking will be on the security side and if the Deputy wishes we can go through that in some detail shortly.  I will consider the approach taken internationally.  In the UK in 1998 and in New Zealand in 2000, statutes were enacted applying widely across the public and private sectors prohibiting the employer from retaliating against employees disclosing information about wrongdoing.  The gold standard we considered is the model in UK and that country was the ground breaker.  The New Zealanders learned from that and introduced a refined and better model in 2000.  Even since then there has been case law from which we have learned.  We believe that when this is enacted, Ireland will represent the gold standard - that is our objective.  The Deputy asked about the EU and other countries.  The G20 has asked for that model to be replicated and at the Seoul summit in 2010 the G20 leaders recognised that the issue of whistleblowing was a key element in fighting corruption generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">The Deputy asked about the view of IDA Ireland.  In formulating this proposal I have had close contact with all Departments, not least the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and they fully support it.  They believe this will enhance Ireland's reputation and be a draw for inward investment rather than the reverse.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">The issue of good faith is critical and I would be interested in hearing the views of members as I have no clear view on it myself.  The honest belief is important but motivation is a different kettle of fish.  For instance in the case of Mr. James Gogarty - I probably should not be case specific - would one say his motivation was good-faith motivation?  However his information was important and led to very significant facts being disclosed.  This is a matter we may need to tease out.  It is important that the person honestly believes the information imparted is true.  However, I am not clear in my mind about the motivation.  I put the notion of good faith reporting into the legislation.  If someone knows where the bodies are buried - to use that phrase - but his or her motivation to disclose the information might not be the best perhaps as a result of having been overlooked for promotion, does that diminish the value of the information?  I would be interested to get the views of members on that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">The Deputy also spoke about immunity.  Immunity is to ensure that people who whistleblow are protected from legal sanction as well as administrative sanction in the workplace.  While we can tease out the detail of that, I believe we need that level of immunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">Regarding retrospection, in the UK someone is covered who was a whistleblower before the enactment but the victimisation arose after the enactment.  That is the model we are trying to replicate here.</p>

          <from>Chairman</from>
          <p eId="para_138">I am sure Deputy Fleming reflects the general view of the committee that the heads of the Bill are extremely welcome.  I am also sure the committee will be happy to engage on the proposals and take the Minister up on what he has said about giving input even before the Bill is published and certainly before Second Stage is reached.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">There is not much point in analysing the heads of a Bill in the same way as one would analyse the text of legislation.  An important aspect is one the Minister identified, which is the change of culture in organisations, both public and private.  The hope is that this will encourage the introduction of internal mechanisms in employment environments where perhaps a code of practice would be put in place.  Certainly employees ought to be made aware in advance that a particular set of procedures is in place and protection exists for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">I think I am clear on the answer to a particular key issue but I would like full clarification from the Minister.  Protection of a whistleblower is not based on a necessity for the information he or she communicates to be true ultimately.  This is why the test of good faith exists.  It is a belief in the substantial truth of a piece of information.  Of course it could turn out to be entirely erroneous - one hopes this would not happen - but if such a person acted in good faith or in the reasonable belief it was true he or she would nevertheless be protected.  It is extremely important that this is so.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">The questions of good faith and reasonable belief are always difficult issues conceptually.  How does one test reasonable belief?  It can be done only through an objective test and asking whether it was reasonable for the person to believe it.  If somebody states he or she believed it to be true it is an assertion of belief by an individual, but it must be tested in some way if a dispute arises.  The only way this can be resolved is to apply an objective test and ask whether it was reasonable for the person to believe it.  This brings us to a range of areas in terms of applying such a test.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">I do not want to make too much of this because we are dealing with the heads of the Bill but I draw the Minister's attention to heads Nos. 5 and 6.  If one discloses to an employer one must have a reasonable belief that the allegation is true and the disclosure is made in good faith.  However, if the disclosure is made to a relevant body included in the list provided, a higher burden is placed on one.  Two different words are used with regard to this, namely, "allegation" and "disclosure".  I do not know why this is, perhaps it is something small.  A person reporting to a relevant body must reasonably believe the disclosure to be substantially true.  I do not want to nitpick but "substantially true" does not necessarily mean "true".  If something is fully true one tends to say it is true.  By "substantially true" one usually means it is not entirely true but it is more or less true.  It looks counter-intuitive and looks like a lesser burden is placed when reporting to an outside body because it requires belief that something is substantially true whereas we require somebody reporting internally to believe it is true.  We need to examine these distinctions.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">Deputy Fleming spoke about a person making a mistake.  We want to protect the whistleblower but we must also protect against rare enough but possible abuse of the legislation.  One has immunity against civil action which I presume includes immunity against being sued for defamation.  If an allegation is made that a financial officer in a company did something improper the person making the allegation will be protected, but if such a serious allegation turns out not to be true, where does this leave the person against whom the wrong allegation was made?  Such a person could well be affected in his or her professional standing if a suggestion was made that an accountant or financial officer did something wrong.  We need to address the issue of civil liability.  We want to give rights and protections to whistleblowers but we must be careful the pendulum does not swing so far as to cut out the possibility of somebody through no fault of his or her own being drawn into something that ends up being untrue.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">I wish to raise another point on these drafting issues.  The provisions against penalisation are not all that different from the provisions we are already familiar with in employment law whereby an employer cannot penalise somebody for having made a complaint.  We must be careful because it is open to abuse.  I am not saying it would be abused but we want to get this legislation absolutely right.  We want to protect whistleblowers but we do not want the thing to run too much in the other direction.  An employer may have taken action against an employee which the employer thinks is justified but the employee decides to make a complaint or report something which he or she reasonably believes to be true and therefore the employee cannot be touched.  We need to have protection against such types of abuse.  I do not state they would be common but they could happen.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_145">The Chairman is using his legal focus to good effect because these are the issues we have been discussing.  It was not for nothing that I quoted the description of this area of legislation as one of the most complex conflict-ridden areas of public policy or legislative practice because we are striking balances.  We do not want to have a charter to enable people to destroy other people's character but at the same time we want to overcome what unfortunately seems to be endemic in certain strands of Irish public and private sector life where wrongdoing was routinely covered up and nobody reached out.  Getting this balance right has taken a great deal of crafting to date.  On the basis one does not reinvent the wheel we have looked at where it is in operation.  As I have already stated the gold standard was originally the United Kingdom and has migrated to New Zealand.  These jurisdictions have a great deal of experience and it might be worth the committee's while to bring before it the New Zealand ambassador or somebody from New Zealand or the UK with experience of this type of legislation to go through the pitfalls that have been seen.  We have had such interaction with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">The Chairman made a point on cultural change and this is extremely important.  The object of much legislation is not to have a legal forcing of actions but to change the culture so that all companies will as a matter of form have their own codes of conduct, so as a matter of routine when people see wrongdoing they will have a procedure to report it and the notion of victimisation will not arise.  We must migrate to this culture, and to help this the legislation will require all State agencies to draft a code of conduct and all Departments and State agencies will do so.  We have had discussions with the Labour Relations Commission on a code of conduct for the private sector on a cross-sectoral basis also so there will be commonality in it.  People will know where they can go and they know the consequences of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">The entire regime is graduated so the threshold of disclosure slightly increases as one reaches up.  The idea is that when it beds down, as it has elsewhere, there will be a channel at employment level where one can disclose wrongdoing with reasonable assurance that it will be acted upon and remedied and it will be the end of the matter.  There is a reasonable level of honest belief with regard to this.  If one goes beyond the company to report to the next level, which is regulator level, one must have a slightly stronger belief that the matter is substantially true.  We can tease out how this would be done.  One would be going beyond the company and alerting somebody external and this should not be done without some thought.  I am willing to hear the Chairman's views and I understand his views on how "honest belief" as opposed to "substantially true" will be measured.  I very much agree with him that in ensuring wrongdoing is outed and that people are comfortable and not victimised for whistleblowing, we do not have vexatious or malicious people or people who are just not right.  There are people who perceive wrongdoing all over the shop.  All of us in our clinics come across people who just believe that everybody is corrupt and doing them down.  There cannot be a charter for them to assassinate people's good names or characters.  We will try to get these factors right.  The committee's opinions on this matter will be helpful.</p>

When introducing something new like this, there is always a danger of building something in theory instead of seeing what in practice has led to us addressing this problem.

          <p eId="para_152">Take the DCC-Fyffes insider trading case, the AIB DIRT scandal, NIB medical insurance policies, some of Bank of Ireland's activities and Anglo Irish Bank's behaviour as examples.  In Professor Honohan's report, he stated that it would have taken a courageous person to bring into discussion some of the operational matters in the Central Bank.  There was no wrongdoing, as wrongdoing is difficult to define.  One either breaks the law or one does not.  Wrongdoing can be an operationally substandard approach to work.  How does one measure that?  It can lead to significant problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">Someone at middle management level might be dissatisfied that, for example, the principles of banking as expressed on balance sheets are being deviated from or are not apparent in a balance sheet financial structure, but Ireland has no prescriptive French-type or Continental-type law that sets out which box has not been ticked or which measurement has not been achieved.  I might be losing my audience.</p>

          <from>Deputy Peter Mathews</from>
          <p eId="para_155">We live under the common law culture, which is driven to a large degree by precedent.  Precedent is fact and history.  Instead of using the template of the UK model, as amended by New Zealand, we should examine where the problems lie and who the main actors are.  Consider Mr. McErlean of the AIB Group and those people involved in other cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">Decisions in the courts have been turned upside-down.  For example, in the longest running case in Irish corporate history, the High Court's decision was turned upside down by a unanimous decision of the Supreme Court.  Mr. Justice Fennelly explained that insider trading was "a fraud on the market."  That decision was reached at the end of a long process with considerable costs and during which all sorts of people presented all types and levels of evidence, which was interpreted through many different somersaults and acrobatic understandings.  It eventually came down to one sentence, which conveyed the unanimous agreement that there was insider trading, which was a fraud on the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">If we examine the facts behind such cases, we can try to put together a framework to encourage people who have reasonable grounds, supported by evidence, to make cases to their internal managements or boards, to an ombudsman or whatever so that we can prevent that type of group-think behaviour.  Establishment group-think in Ireland was so pervasive that it led to problems.</p>

          <from>Deputy Arthur Spring</from>
          <p eId="para_158">Regarding the question of how to proceed with whistleblower legislation in respect of financial institutions, ownership needs to be taken by the hierarchy, as the Minister called it.  A lower level employee might find a problem and report it to someone in the hierarchy as per the company's internal procedures.  If the person to whom that employee reported the issue does not see it to an end, not only should he or she be reprimanded within the organisation, but that person should also be unemployable in institutions licensed by the State.  The same could apply in Departments and the wider Civil Service.  If someone is found to have acted in a negligent way with grave consequences for the people of Ireland, he or she should no longer be employable by the State.  There must be an element of pushing an issue up to the hierarchy, which would be responsible for following through on it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_160">Deputy Mathews gave a large overarching presentation.  We will not be able to solve all of our problems through legislation.  No matter how well crafted it is, it will not cover every eventuality.  In the heads as published, nine categories are encompassed by this legislation.  They are comprehensive and will encompass the issues raised by the Deputy.  The Bill fully meets the compendium of best practice and guiding principles for legislation on the protection of whistleblowers drawn up by the G20.  This Bill is not simply the product of my Department.  It considers the international context to determine which is the best way to go.  In terms of the G20 aspirations being pushed on countries, no one has yet crafted as advanced a Bill as this.  Most of its elements replicate what has been established in the United Kingdom and New Zealand, but it will be even more nuanced and, after the committee and Oireachtas have concluded their work on it, better.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">Deputy Spring's point relates to the issue of changing cultures.  Two questions must be posed.  Unless cultural change is embraced, the approach taken will be legalistic, in that people will argue against the protection of whistleblowers as opposed to the reverse.  Under the legislation, the onus of proving that an action was in bad faith will fall on the employer as opposed to <i>vice versa</i>.  We should migrate away from that situation over time, as will happen.  People will assume that it should be a normal, healthy part of any company or State agency to discuss something they believe is not right with someone else to have it put right without further ado.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">A point was raised about consequences for those who resist.  We will need to tease out this matter, which relates to a wider question on which Deputy Mathews touched when he referenced an article in one of today's national newspapers, that is, fundamentally altering the structure of the public service.  This is a job of work upon which we have embarked.  I do not know whether the committee has had a chance to read the programme for Government in that instance, but it is ambitious in terms of changing the public service's structure.  However, this matter is wider than the public service and we must ensure that there are consequences for people who damage the reputation of companies, who withhold or prevent the proper functioning of the common good or best or good practice or who aid and abet wrongdoing or criminality in any way through their silence.  We must tease out these issues.</p>
