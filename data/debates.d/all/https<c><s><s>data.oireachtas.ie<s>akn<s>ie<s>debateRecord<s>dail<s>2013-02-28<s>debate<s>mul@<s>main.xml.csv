He further warns that the proposed cuts will lead to preventable increases in the number of deaths and serious accidents and illnesses in the workplace. In other words, people may die. These are not my words but those of an authority that is not known for exaggeration or hyperbole. In 2012, 47 people lost their lives in workplace accidents, and to date in 2013 there have been six workplace deaths. That is a total of 53 lives, on average almost one a week. We all agree that those lives could have been saved and those accidents should not have happened. That is why we support the work of the Health and Safety Authority. Yesterday many of the Tánaiste's colleagues spoke of "agonising" about the decision to abolish the various mobility allowances. On this occasion, however, they do not need to agonise. The Government has been put on notice by the authority charged by the Government with protecting people who work that it is not in a position to fulfil its role. It has put the Government on notice that its inability to fulfil its role will lead to preventable increases in the number of deaths and serious accidents and illnesses in the workplace. It is as stark as that. There is no need to agonise over saving the lives of workers. There is clearly a need to save workers and their families from having to agonise over serious injury or fatal accidents. What is the Tánaiste's position on this letter and the cuts approved by the Minister? Does he as Tánaiste and leader of the Labour Party intend to engage with the Health and Safety Authority on this issue?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	1	We are all keenly aware of the challenges posed by the State's finances, where public expenditure continues to outstrip revenues collected. All public sector organisations must continue to deliver improved services in the context of constrained resources. The careful balancing of resources across organisations is an ongoing exercise. I understand that against this backdrop the agencies operating under the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation were recently informed of 2013 staffing targets as part of the ongoing employment control framework. The HSA has had an excellent record in recent years in the context of declining resources, which has been achieved largely through the hard work of its staff, through workplace inspections and as a result of its development of innovative tools including BeSMART, its online risk assessment tool, its new online licensing portal designed to make compliance easier, simpler and less costly, and GeoSmart, its inspection management system. Furthermore, awareness campaigns, the involvement of industry organisations and its encouragement of greater compliance by employers contributed to the achievement of strong workplace health and safety levels in Ireland, including a reduction in fatal workplace injuries in 2012. Sectoral changes, including the collapse in employment in the construction sector, have changed the operational landscape in which the HSA works, and the HSA will continue to adapt. Notwithstanding the concerns expressed about its 2013 staffing target and the undoubted challenges it faces, the authority has proved itself to be an adaptable and high-achieving organisation, having met all of its ECF targets since 2009. Its recent strategy and its programme of work for 2013 outline the HSA's commitment to working smarter - for example, the targeting of its resources at higher-risk sectors, such as agriculture, and places of work; the concentration of information and legislative programmes on higher-risk areas; and the identification of new ways of delivering services by deploying its innovative IT-enabled inspection management tools to support more effective inspections and making more use of desktop inspection for specialist areas - for example, in chemicals. The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will work with the HSA over the course of 2013 to monitor progress on its targets and to achieve the best use of available staff and resources.

Yes, the HSA and all of its staff are doing a very good job, but the chief executive has been forced to write to the Secretary General of the Department to say that the target proposed is not achievable, based on his experience of current processes and mechanisms. The man whom we charge with heading up the authority that has done such a good job is saying he cannot do that any more. He cannot fulfil his role. The Tánaiste spoke of workplace inspections. In 2013 the number of inspections will be down by 30%, and there will be further reductions in all services, including the work the HSA does in advising high-tech companies on their processes and resources for research and development. So, here we go again: last Monday there was a big glitz-and-glamour announcement about a research and development programme, but on Thursday one of the agencies charged with assisting that programme has to write to the Department to say it will not be able to assist these companies in doing their job.A cut and paste answer to that specific charge made by someone charged by this House with delivering a function is frankly not good enough. It is clear in the Secretary General's letter to the HSA that the Minister has signed off on these targets. The authority knows it cannot deliver on them and has outlined the consequences. Again, will the Tánaiste make a specific intervention to ensure the authority will be resourced to deliver? He spoke about tight resources, but the HSA, in its letter to the Minister, has cited a number of examples of organisations, including the Houses of the Oireachtas, ComReg and the Commission for Energy Regulation, that have been given extra posts this year. We are telling an organisation in charge of protecting workers that it will not receive extra resources, while other organisations with less important remits will. It is a question of choices. Is the Tánaiste going to choose to act on behalf of the health and safety of workers?

The HSA does a very good job. However, the employment landscape has changed. The numbers involved and the level of activity in construction which used to occupy much of the attention of the HSA have changed. The way in which the authority is conducting its business, for example in online activity, has changed. All of that said, of course, the views of its chief executive are taken seriously by the Government.

The Secretary General of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is due to meet the chief executive officer of the HSA today to discuss the content of the letter sent. The Government takes the issue of safety very seriously, as well as the views expressed by the HSA's chief executive officer. There is clearly a context in which this issue has to be discussed, namely, the financial constraints we are experiencing and the changed employment environment. The Secretary General of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will meet the chief executive officer of the HSA today.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	6	On 10 November last the people voted to enshrine the rights of the child in the Constitution. At the time the Tánaiste said the referendum was an opportunity "to state clearly and unequivocally that we, the Irish people, value children and childhood." That was the rhetoric and we know the reality has been very different. The reality is that the Government, through the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, is making cuts to youth services across the State and in Dublin city. These cuts will bite hard and target some of the most disadvantaged communities across the State. The City of Dublin Youth Services Board is proposing cuts, some of them of the magnitude of 14%, in projects across the city. For instance, the SWAN project in the North Wall will lose over €62,000 in funding. Cabra For Youth will have its funding cut, while Ballyfermot Youth Service will lose over €74,000. The Base Youth Service in Ballyfermot will take a significant hit, while the Bradóg Regional Youth Service based in the north-west inner city is facing a massive cut of €65,000. The Sphere 17 Regional Youth Service in Darndale will lose over €122,000.

There are many others that I could list for the Tánaiste. Each of these projects that deals with children on the front line, some of them in crisis, others in trouble, represents real value for money and the State gets bang for its buck. Every cent invested in our youth and these projects gives a direct return to society, the State and the Exchequer. The scale of the proposed cuts will be devastating for youth projects across the State and in Dublin. What about the Tánaiste's much heralded commitment to valuing children, childhood and youth? What about the Government's commitment to disadvantaged communities and children? What will the Tánaiste do about these cuts? The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is set to sign off on them next week. Will the Tánaiste intervene to stop her?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	9	The Government does value children and childhood. This is the first Government to have a dedicated Department of Children and Youth Affairs, headed by a Cabinet Minister. This is the Government that delivered on a commitment that had been spoken about for 20 years, namely, to enshrine the rights of children in the Constitution. The Government spends a considerable sum of money in the delivery of youth services which are delivered through the vocational education committees and the various youth bodies and services organised throughout the country. From time to time, the demand for services, the numbers using them and the numbers involved vary. Accordingly, the amount spent in an individual service may go up or down. I know the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has an ongoing dialogue with youth service providers. She consults them regularly about what is the best way to deploy and use the resources of the State to ensure these services are working in the interests of the young people for whom they are provided.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	10	The establishment of Departments and changes to the Constitution are only of value if they are actioned, become a reality and inform public policy. For all of the Tánaiste's rhetoric, the truth is the youth affairs budget has been cut by 10%. This will directly translate into a 14% cut for the SWAN project in the North Wall. This project caters for 350 young people and does immensely valuable work. If its work is undermined or disrupted or services are lost, the Tánaiste must be very clear that we will lose on the double. Children and youth lose the opportunity attached to the service available to them, but the State loses too. The Government should not be penny-wise and pound-foolish in this matter. The sum of €62,000 which this project will lose might not be a big deal for the Tánaiste as it is a fraction of his own salary and of those disgraceful pensions that so many former politicians receive. Just as families on small incomes struggle with a small cut, so too do projects with lean budgets. I put it to the Tánaiste again that these cuts are wrong and I do not believe he can stand over or defend them. Will he intervene with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and insist on the cutbacks being stopped? Will he and the Government insist on the commitments they made to children and disadvantaged communities being honoured?

#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	32	Figures released this week in my constituency, Waterford, show that the number of home burglaries in January was up by over 30% on the figure for the same period last year. The rising statistic are on a par with figures throughout the country. In some areas the number of home burglaries has almost tripled in the past year. I suspect, given all the facts and figures, the real figure is a good deal higher. I encounter victims of burglaries on a regular basis, all of whom paint a similar picture of the terrible pain and misery caused by this violation of private space. Often this horror is revisited when the perpetrator is brought to court and spared from a jail sentence. Often, items taken are never returned. They include personal jewellery and items close to people's hearts. I was in a house last week in which the mother and the father of the residents had died tragically some months before. Jewellery belonging to them was taken and more than likely will never be returned. I witnessed a husband and a wife crying in front of me. Many cry outwardly and many into their hearts. The psychological effects of having one's home violated cannot be underestimated and can last forever. One point frequently under-reported concerns the cost of replacing items in a home and repairing the damage done by intruders. Many opt not to claim under insurance policies because of a fear premiums would go through the roof. Many others cannot afford to take out insurance policies. Research undertaken by Eircom PhoneWatch puts the average value of goods stolen in home burglaries at a staggering €1,868, a colossal expense.  I have one further comment to make before I come to my question. With many others, I believe the criminal justice system is failing the victims of burglaries. Today in every city and town, probably in every estate, someone's house will be burgled. Will the Tánaiste consider introducing legislation to force those found guilty of burglary, regardless of whether a community service or custodial sentence is handed down, to repay the cost of repairing the damage they have done? Under such legislation, every judge in every District Court would be instructed to ensure the perpetrator, regardless of means, would make reparations which could be deducted from his or her wages or social welfare payments. I know the Tánaiste is aware of this matter; having spoken to other Members, I know they are aware of it also. It is a crime that has gone unnoticed compared to serious crimes against the person. It is destroying people's lives throughout the country. There is a fear among people that they are being abandoned and not taken notice of. Often, I have been in court when an out-of-touch judge, because of some do-gooder, says kind words about the perpetrator, while the victim is left abandoned. We need to do something about this problem urgently.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	33	I thank the Deputy for raising this question which is both serious and relevant. I agree that the effect of the burglary of a person's home cannot be measured simply in financial terms in respect of the goods stolen or interfered with. There is also an absolute sense of violation felt by the victims. The sense that someone has been in one's home and bedroom tampering with one's personal belongings and, in some cases, stealing or damaging things that may not be of great financial value but which are of considerable sentimental and emotional value to the victims is unnerving. The suggestion the Deputy has made is constructive. In terms of penalties, the Minister for Justice and Equality has a strong personal view in favour of restorative justice. I will bring to his attention what is a worthwhile and constructive suggestion made by the Deputy and ask him to have the Deputy's comments considered as a way of dealing with the issue. Naturally, the proposal could never repair the sense of violation and damage experienced by someone whose home has been burgled, but perhaps it might be a more pragmatic, effective and appropriate way of dealing with the perpetrators than some of the ways by which they are being deal with.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	34	I believe the remarks of the Tánaiste are sincere and imagine many people throughout the country will be most comforted by them. They will send a clear message that there is a price to be paid if one violates the home of another. I am not here to make any direct attack on the Judiciary. However, I put it to the Tánaiste that throughout my political life I have spent a good deal of time representing people in court in Waterford city, as have some of my fellow Members. People can be taken aback at some of the sentencing procedures carried out by the Judiciary. How often have people who have burgled homes been seen walking around the streets the following day by the very individuals whose homes had been broken into? They are shocked and bewildered in such circumstances. At times the Garda can prepare very good cases and I have been with gardaí in the District Court, but because a given judge is out of touch, no sentence is applied and the person responsible can go back out and reoffend. I read a report in a local newspaper in Waterford on one person who had reoffended 25 times. I am comforted by the response of the Tánaiste and believe others will be also. I hope that within a short period he will act on my suggestion.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	35	Yes, I will. As I said, I will bring the Deputy's remarks to the attention of the Minister for Justice and Equality whose views are very much along the lines of restorative justice. Naturally, we should understand this end of the equation is considered after the damage has been done. Even where a financial penalty was imposed by the courts, a strong sense of violation would still be experienced. A stolen item of sentimental value, for example, a wedding ring inherited from a mother or a grandmother, can never be replaced.It may not be the financial value but rather the family or sentimental value that is important. This is why we have to address the issue of home burglaries by preventing them. The work that is being done by neighbourhood watch groups and community gardaí helps in advising local communities and home owners about simple precautionary measures, such as not leaving the bathroom window open when one is on one's way out because one has forgotten to close it. Householders can get advice on these simple precautionary measures. Community gardaí and neighbourhood watch groups have developed ways of identifying and marking personal goods to enable gardaí to identify their owners when somebody is detected. There is also a requirement for a sense of good neighbourhood in communities so that people keep watch over the homes of those who live alone and who may be vulnerable. This is a big issue and it causes considerable worry for people. The suggestions that the Deputy made this morning are valuable and constructive, and I will ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to consider them.

He should allow this Dáil full scope to contribute to the debate. He might hear something that demonstrates to him the error of his ways, although I will not hold my breath.

There is a clearly established pattern with this Government by which a Bill that is not controversial is allowed to run for days whereas a controversial one is rammed through with a guillotine. That is undermining the democratic basis of this House in an attempt to protect the Government from public scrutiny and anger. I ask the Tánaiste, if the promise of a democratic revolution means anything, to lift this guillotine and allow full scrutiny of this Bill.

That is reflected in this proposal. If the Opposition desires more time to set out their points of view on the Bill, I am prepared to offer it tomorrow. If Opposition Deputies are prepared to accept my offer, I propose to extend the debate until 5.30 p.m. tomorrow.

Their support for the important work of reducing the number of smokers is heartening. The Department of Health and the HSE continuously monitor the marketing tactics of the tobacco industry. As these tactics evolve, so too must our legislative and policy framework. I am pleased that the legislation which was introduced to fulfil our obligation to change our laws on the minimum pricing of tobacco allows me to regulate the industry's various promotion tactics. In that context, I take the opportunity to display an example of the new tactics being used by the industry to promote new products and thereby ensnare young people, including those under the age of 18 years. As I have said previously, the findings of a 2006 survey showed that 78% of Irish smokers started to smoke before they reached that age. Here we have an advertisement that is slim and nicely presented and which has the name of a high-end fashion magazine attached to it.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	91	The images being displayed on cigarette packets show the reality of what smoking does to people. We want them to understand the consequences of smoking include peripheral vascular disease, the amputation of legs, rotten lungs and cancer. When they see these images on the front of cigarette packets every time they open them, I hope they will realise the harm they are doing to themselves. We are here to help smokers and want to help them to quit. We are not anti-smoker but anti-smoking. As has been said on many occasions during the discussion of the Bill, the health, social and economic damage caused by smoking is immense. Every year in Ireland approximately 5,200 people die prematurely from diseases caused by tobacco use. It is estimated that the HSE spends approximately €1 billion each year to treat tobacco-related diseases. We are seeking to reduce the public pay bill by €1 billion. I suggest it would be better if we could reduce the health bill by €1 billion. I discussed tobacco issues - specifically, the new tobacco products directive - at the EU Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee hearings in Brussels on Monday. I will mention some stark facts revealed at that forum. Some 700,000 people in the European Union die from tobacco-related illnesses every year. It is estimated that EU public health expenditure on treating smoking-related diseases is €25.3 billion annually. Some €8.3 billion is lost in productivity within the European Union each year as a result of deaths, absenteeism and early retirements linked with smoking. As I have said before, no parent wants his or her children to smoke, regardless of whether he or she is a smoker or a non-smoker. As Minister for Health, I intend to reduce the number of smokers in Ireland. This can only be achieved by means of a combination of measures, including raising awareness, education and price increases. We will develop legislation relating to tobacco products and smoke-free measures. We will support cessation services for those who really want to escape nicotine addiction. Such measures are about saving lives, rather than about interfering with smoker's rights. I am not anti-smoker; as I said, I am anti-smoking. I expect many tobacco measures to be discussed next week when I meet all of my European counterparts at an informal health summit in Dublin. I conclude by reaffirming the Government's commitment to tackling smoking in Ireland. Our aim is to de-normalise tobacco and make it socially unacceptable for our children and young people to smoke. I again thank the House for its support for the Bill. I will continue to seek its support for the tobacco initiatives I will bring to the Oireachtas in the future. This is about saving lives, protecting citizens and shielding our children from this killer habit.

The Minister touched on a number of issues, including the need for us to be more adaptable in order to keep ahead of the tobacco companies and the way in which they are marketing. The new package is just an example of what measures they are resorting to in order to try to tackle this kind of legislation. The Minister needs to focus his efforts on teenagers. It is striking that teenagers, in particular young girls, are taking up smoking or continuing to smoke. We have grown up with the message rammed home to us through images like those shown earlier, but it seems not to be getting through to those who are starting on the path. If we stop them from starting smoking, we stop it fully. Addiction seems to be the only word for this. The Minister expressed the wish that the image might shock those who open the box. However, the very fact they have bought the box in the first place and spent the kind of money necessary to do so shows they are gone beyond that stage. We are dealing with addiction. In the Minister's next focus on this issue, we need to focus in on areas that assist people in tackling that addiction, in the same way we do this with regard to other drugs. Tobacco is a drug that is killing people. I commend the legislation. There is still a lot of work to be done this area. It cannot just be done by the Legislature, however. It has to be done by everybody involved.

It is a pity the health spokespersons cannot all be present because they are at the health committee, which is a bit bizarre. I know Deputy Ó Caoláin was involved and was very supportive of this legislation. There will, hopefully, be other measures to follow up on this legislation in future. For everything else we eat and drink, the ingredients are listed, and there needs to be a move towards listing or limiting some of the ingredients contained in cigarettes which are sold to the general public. There also needs to be more action in terms of taxation and whatever other moves we can take to try to discourage people further at this stage, so future generations and the future HSE does not have such a high cost in terms of the health bill which, as the Minister mentioned, is estimated at €1 billion this year. We must also consider everything that flows from that, including the families that are affected when a person is in hospital or in dire straits because of the consequences of smoking in an earlier part of their life or right through their life. I wish the legislation well. I hope it will have the desired effect and cut down on the number of people, particularly young people, who are smoking, and that society as a whole starts to learn the full consequences of people smoking. I ask that, at a future date, we start to address the issue of the ingredients contained in cigarettes and start to ban some of the ingredients. While that might not necessarily reduce the number of cigarettes smoked, it might reduce their effect.

As a retailer who has been selling cigarettes for over 20 years, I have seen and studied people's habits when it comes to cigarette smoking. As the Minister himself said, it is terribly important to do everything we possibly can to stop the younger generation from starting smoking. I have every sympathy, as I know the Minister has, for hardened, addicted smokers who find it terribly difficult to give up smoking and who probably, in many cases, will never give up smoking - they will leave this world continuing their habit. Nonetheless, I commend the Government in all of its endeavours in trying to stop young people smoking. There is no good reason that a young person should make that move to take the first cigarette and eventually get hooked and form a lifelong habit. It is breaking them financially and crippling their health so, of course, the Minister is right to do everything he can to stop this. That said, however, there is one issue on which I have had a difficulty with this and previous Governments, which sought to price cigarettes very high in comparison to the rest of Europe. As the statistics prove, this has left a big opening for the illegal tobacco trade. There is no reason in the world that a person in Ireland should be paying €10 for a pack of cigarettes when a person in another part of Europe can pay €1.80 or €2 for the same thing. This is leaving the illegal trade wide open. I wish the Minister good luck in his endeavours. He should always remember that, for some of the people who are smoking today, nothing the Minister or the Government does will stop them. However, if we can stop young people, the Minister is to be highly commended in that regard.

Mar sin, níl aon laincis ar an Dáil géilleadh do iarratas mhuintir Mhaigh Eo go ndéanfar an t-ainm a leasú go Gaillimh Thiar-Mhaigh Eo Theas. Má bhreathnaíonn muid ar seo, tá sé spéisiúil gur thug an tAire leithscéal nach ndéanfaí é seo, ar an mbunús go gcaithfí é a dhéanamh i ndáilcheantair eile. Mar a tharlaíonn, tá an fhadhb réitithe don Aire inniu, mar níl aon mholadh nó iarratas ann ó dhream ar bith i ndáilcheantar ar bith ach amháin dáilcheantar Gaillimh Thiar. Tá éileamh láidir ó mhuintir Mhaigh Eo freisin, atá sa dáilcheantar i nGaillimh Thiar anois, go n-aithneofar go bhfuil cuid de Mhaigh Eo istigh sa dáilcheantar agus táthar ag iarraidh go n-aithneofar é sin sa reachtaíocht. Mar is eol don Aire, is as Contae Mhaigh Eo don Taoiseach, Mhaigh Eo láidir, agus tá dúchas Mhaigh Eo go smior ann. Táim cinnte go mbeadh an Taoiseach ag iarraidh go mbeadh aitheantas don chuid sin de Chontae Mhaigh Eo atá ag dul isteach le Gaillimh sa Bhille seo. Mar sin, creidim go mba cheart don Aire géilleadh don iarratas atá os comhair na Dála agus glacadh leis an t-aon leasú seo amháin. Leasú beag atá ann, leasú a thabharfadh an-sásamh do mhuintir Mhaigh Eo. Caithfidh mé a admháil, ní fhaca mé riamh dream ar bith níos dílse dá ndúchas agus dá gcontae ná muintir Mhaigh Eo. Is cuma cé chomh minic agus a thagann siad go Páirc an Chrócaigh nó cé chomh minic agus a bhuailtear iad, tagann siad ar ais an bhliain dár gcionn leis an flosc agus an fonn céanna tacaíocht a thabhairt dá bhfoireann fhéin.When we discussed this on Committee Stage, the Minister rightly confirmed that there was nothing in the terms of reference about names for the Constituency Commission and, therefore, accepting this minor amendment would not undo or significantly change the work of the commission.  The other argument used by the Minister against accepting the amendment was the spurious grounds that there are constituencies that go across county borders with larger numbers in the county not mentioned in the constituency title as happens in the case of Galway West and Mayo South. There is one difference. Their elected representatives in Dáil Éireann are obviously happy that their counties are not mentioned in the name of the constituency. The people of south Mayo are very unhappy that their county is not mentioned in the designation of the new constituency of Galway West that comprises a significant part of Mayo South.  Therefore, I suggest that the Minister accepts this amendment because if he does so, we can move on very quickly. I do not think anybody is opposing the Bill or the remainder of it. Everybody in the House accepts the case for an independent commission in respect of the size and shape of constituencies. There is probably regret in Mayo that the Taoiseach decided to reduce the number of Teachta Dála or increase the number of people to be represented by Teachta Dála because it resulted in the inevitability that Mayo would no longer be one constituency confined within the bounds of County Mayo. It has created this situation whereby part of Mayo had to be put somewhere else - either with Sligo, Roscommon or Galway, with Galway being the county chosen. If the Minister asks the Taoiseach, I am sure he would be very supportive of this because as I said in Irish, the Taoiseach is a proud Mayo man. We all know the very famous song about Contae Mhaigh Eo. It is fair to say that county loyalty among the people of Mayo is as strong as in any county in Ireland if not stronger. County identification is very strong, particularly in the part of south Mayo that I will represent once this Bill is passed. Therefore, I ask the Minister to accept this minor amendment. There are no other amendments relating to it. Everybody else obviously accepts the naming of the constituencies in the rest of the country. The people in Mayo are the only ones looking for change. I cannot see what perversity is prevailing that the Minister cannot accept what is a simple amendment. I know my colleague, Deputy Calleary, will be speaking on this amendment and supporting the rest of the people of Mayo in their demand that their county be recognised in the naming of the new constituency of what I hope will be Galway West-Mayo South. 
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	98	I am happy to support Deputy Ó Cuív's amendment. The Minister made an aside that we were happy to go in with Galway. We are not. This is a serious point. I know we accept an independent report and reports of the Constituency Commission have over the years been completely accepted. Perhaps it is time to look at that process and perhaps there should be a draft report. Never mind the people in here - communities are very unhappy at being sequestered into Galway in order to make up the numbers for Galway. The name of the constituency is important. We are not advocating a change in the boundaries. It recognises the fact that over 10,000 Mayo people will now be voting in Galway West. They are not there just to make up the numbers. They will make a very serious impact on that constituency and that impact and input should be recognised in the title of the constituency. The name of the proposed constituency is outlined in legislation which is why the Minister is in a position to change it and he can do so without affecting the independence of the Constituency Commission as it will not affect the boundaries. It is not just people in this side of the House who support it. Various Government Deputies have been running around south Mayo in the past few weeks telling people that they too want Mayo South to be included in the constituency title. Today gives them an opportunity to stand with the people of south Mayo who are very proud members of our county and have their identity recognised in this new constituency.  If the commission came back and said that Carlow-Kilkenny was to be known as Carlow plus a bit, the Minister might not have been too happy with that. I can assure Deputy Ó Cuív that it is only the Government who is changing the voters. Footballers like Donal Vaughan will still play for Mayo and when it comes to Sunday in May, we will still hammer Galway regardless of where we are. This is a serious matter that is important for the people in that part of the county who are not happy at being moved so let us kill off that argument first. Due to the fact that they are not happy and they are a significant input, they should be recognised in the naming of the constituency.

Many Deputies representing the greater Dublin area can walk the length and breadth of their constituencies in a couple of minutes. Compare that to the work a rural Deputy must do to give proper representation to his or her constituents. It is a completely different ball game but, unfortunately, the Government seems hell-bent on this gerrymandering or Hogan-mandering. I certainly do not like it and do not see any point in it. If the Government thinks it will weaken the resolve of some Deputies in this House and get rid of them, it might get a bad fright yet.

Mayo should be included in the name. Despite the population increase of 8.2%, it is the first time we have had a predetermined outcome in terms of the number of Deputies. If one looks at the new electoral map, one can see that parts of counties have been sawn off and other parts rammed together. The terms of reference of the Constituency Commission need to be stronger in respect of keeping county boundaries intact. I know it is not always possible to do that and Deputy Ó Cuív's amendment is as a consequence of that. The name is just one issue. Sligo-Leitrim-west Cavan-south Donegal is an odd shape for a constituency. Pieces of Cavan and Donegal will be stuck together with Sligo-Leitrim. It does not make sense. Imagine the work of a Deputy trying to deal with local authorities which he or she is expected to do under Better Local Government in order to have that linkage. Could the Minister and Minister of State take on board that under Better Local Government, the Deputy is supposed to have a strong linkage with local government and the management structure in local authorities?On the question of the breaching of county boundaries I refer to the situation in Laois-Offaly. I have to deal with four local authorities. I deal with Carlow because of the situation in Graiguecullen, I deal with Laois-Offaly and now I will have to deal with Kildare. The part of Kildare that has been put in with Laois makes no sense. The area in question straddles Monasterevin, Kildangan, Kilberry and Castlemitchell. It is shaped like the Gaza strip. That is the only place I have ever seen that is the same shape-----

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	112	There is no logic to it. It takes in two local electoral areas which means two engineering divisions of Kildare County Council. It will mean having to deal with two local area engineers and two separate systems of administration of the county council. I know the Minister will make smart remarks in reply. This House needs to look at what is being proposed with regard to local government. I support the strong reform of local government which goes further than the Minister's proposals. However, without proper reform of local government and without trying to make some fist of aligning local authority boundaries with Dáil constituency boundaries, we will have an unsatisfactory system of national and local government. A boundary commission is meeting today to decide the local government boundaries and the new municipal districts. However, there does not seem to be a connection between the work of the commission and this legislation. There is talk about joined-up government but this will not be possible without some coherence between the Dáil constituency boundaries and the local authority boundaries. I appeal to the Ministers opposite. I do not know if other parties disagree with me on this issue but I hope they do not. Sinn Féin has a strong view that there has to be some correlation between Dáil and local authority boundaries. I am aware we are not permitted to interfere with its work but perhaps the House could send a letter to the commission to reinforce the point that if possible it could arrange for some alignment of the two boundaries in its report which is due in May. It is hoped that when we deal with the next revision of Dáil constituency boundaries we will make a better fist of it.

It is consistent with long-established precedent with which Deputy Ó Cuív is familiar as he was the Minister when all these matters were agreed, in line with that precedent and in line with all his actions. It is quite hypocritical of him to try to bang the drum now about naming a constituency when he did not do it himself when he was a Minister. I will not accept the amendment.

The recent Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures are important and indicative that we, as a nation, are on the right path in terms of slowly but surely recovering from the economic collapse which struck us in the past decade. Employment is growing and jobs are being created but, unfortunately, a large number of jobs, particularly in IT, are not being filled.Being unemployed has serious and far-reaching consequences. Societies throughout the world have developed in such a way that a person's self worth and value can often be bound up with one's job or role in the community. Throughout our history, a hierarchy of importance has been attached to professions. It is unwise and unhealthy to adopt such an approach. Every citizen possesses particular qualities and skills suited to certain areas of work and our everyday lives bear out this fact. Some of our friends, acquaintances and families are studious and are very much at home with theorising and problem-solving while others are much more practical and suited to working with their hands, have a gift working with the people in a leading, caring or managing capacity or have a wondrous grasp of technology, IT programming and so forth. It is the role of the State to recognise this and to support and nurture citizens to reach their potential. Education and training are essential for this. We must realise we cannot continue with a one size fits all approach and it is out of this realisation that the further education and training sector has grown. A proportion of people will excel in a university setting but for others it is a complete waste of time and resources. Other more practical or skills focused avenues, such as the institutes of technology or the part-time learning environment, are much more beneficial to those individuals. In my county of Galway, we have an abundance of educational opportunities, from my alma mater
of NUIG, with its vibrant campus in the city and its nationally important Ollscoil in Connemara, to GMIT with its innovation hub on the Dublin Road and its very important centre in Letterfrack. Third and fourth level education is flourishing in the west but we are also very fortunate to have a thriving further education and training sector with a number of reputable course providers offering a different, but no less valuable, educational experience which is often able to respond more quickly to the needs of citizens at different life stages. The Galway Technical Institute is but one example. A previous Department of Education and Skills consultation paper noted how our further education and training sector has evolved organically in an unco-ordinated fashion and while it is true that at times a deeper relevancy and effectiveness can emerge organically, it is more often the case that strategic thinking and direction are required, and no more so than when financial resources are constrained. It is worth looking at a snapshot of the further education and training sector in Ireland. Currently, there is an annual investment of €900 million in FET and this provides for approximately 270,000 full-time or part-time places. It is provided in a large variety of centres and currently 450 centres deliver formal further education and training, including FÁS training centres, VECs and Youthreach centres. Hundreds of large and small centres deliver formal and informal courses to different cohorts of learners and 9,000 staff are employed to deliver these thousands of courses. The courses include technical and vocational training, leading to a specific career, including apprenticeships and post-leaving certificate courses. It also includes courses in basic literacy, numeracy and adult education. Seirbhísí Oideachais Leanunaigh agus Scileanna will provide this co-ordination and funding. It will, as its Irish acronym suggests, shed a new light on the further education and training sector to ensure it is responsive and flexible and meets the education and training needs of Ireland in the 21st century. The SOLAS action plan, launched in October 2012, aims to reform radically and restructure the further education and training sector so it can enjoy restored public confidence and promote courses which are relevant to learners, industry and society. The action plan for SOLAS crucially noted that a revitalised FET sector must promote access for all learners who wish to avail of programmes - the unemployed, the employed, school leavers, early school leavers, those with disabilities, job changers and those who want to pursue particular interests through part-time learning. FÁS was more about providing courses for jobseekers and, to a large extent, it achieved that goal but with varying degrees of success. For example, a web design course run by FÁS in Galway a number of years ago was imparting web design skills using software that was obsolete by approximately ten years. Such was the change between the older of edition of the software and the newer editions, the course was rather pointless, albeit well-intentioned and run by friendly and competent staff. This is one example where an education and training course became out of touch and obsolete and needed to change with the times and the changing technologies. In all aspects of life, it is vital to recognise when something has outlived its usefulness. FÁS has served us well but it was established in the 1980s to meet the challenges of that particular time and recession. The world has moved on. Technological advancement has transformed both the education sector and the workplace. Much greater flexibility and responsiveness is required if we are to maximise the potential not only of the taxpayers' contribution but also that of our people. The focus of FÁS on jobseekers was suited to an era of its creation. Lifelong learning and constant skills updating were not as appreciated or deemed as necessary as they are now. As many people now realise, it is imperative to keep up to date, to keep one's skills sharp and to engage with and understand the most recent developments in industry. It is a sad reality for all of us that people, as with technology, can become obsolete in terms of the skills they have. To a great extent, further education and training is as vital for those in employment as it is for jobseekers. Furthermore it is a regrettable fact that the reputation of FÁS has been tarnished in recent years with unusual or irregular practices, in particular concerning expenses. Confidence in any State agency or Department is paramount. FÁS has experienced a decline in the confidence people once had in it, which is regrettable but factual. I am heartened to see that SOLAS will be underpinned by four key principles, specifically that the organisation will be learner-centred, outcome based, strategically focused and integrated. These aims are clearly rooted in common sense and will maximise the effectiveness of public funding while ensuring the learner is placed at the heart of the State's further education and training policy. From this Bill, it is evident that SOLAS will be bestowed with a wider responsibility. One of its chief functions will be the creation and implementation every three years of a national strategy which will ultimately benefit the FET sector, citizens, the taxpayer and the course providers. In preparing these three year strategies, huge priority is being attached to co-operation and consultation with the other stakeholders, most notably the Departments of Social Protection, Education and Skills and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Enterprise Ireland, Teagasc and employer groups. Co-operation and collaboration with agencies such as Teagasc is crucial if we are to continue to benefit from the opportunities which exist in our most successful indigenous industry, namely, farming and agribusiness. In the past few years, Teagasc has experienced a substantial increase in the demand for its courses. Co-operation and collaboration with SOLAS is essential to ensure we can meet this growing demand and so harness the opportunities presented. A requirement for consultation with the various stakeholders will also guarantee relevancy is the top criterion in deciding the type of education and training courses to be funded from the public purse. Importantly, SOLAS will have an oversight function and will monitor the quality and effectiveness of course providers and the educational courses. The Bill contains further provisions concerning board membership, corporate governance, accountability and whistleblowing which will rightly ensure SOLAS observes the highest organisational standards. For almost 30 years, we have heard constant talk about the need for a one-stop-shop, to use the well worn phrase, for unemployed persons. Throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, this was touted at the best way forward in meeting the needs of jobseekers. This Government has moved beyond talk and is taking action. Today central locations with all the supports a jobseeker requires are being rolled out with the new Intreo service in the Department of Social Protection and this Further Education and Training Bill complements this and is part of a suite of legislative reforms which will include reform and revitalisation of the VEC structure into new streamlined education and training boards as well as a renewed emphasis on quality. We need to ensure all systems, supports and procedures are in place to facilitate getting people back to work. Recently, I received a telephone call from a constituent about the back to work allowance. The individual had an idea to set up a company but their biggest fear was that they would not be entitled to social welfare supports should the company fail. That is a real and understandable concern which could put a person off setting up a small business. We need to ensure a system which encourages people to take up options, retraining or placements etc. I am confident this Bill along with other important reforms will ensure jobseekers can avail of the advice and support they need on education and training options ultimately to rejoin the workforce and realise their potential. I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, and the Minister, Deputy Quinn, on their work on this very important Bill.
#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	127	I thank the Technical Group for allocating some of its speaking time to me. I acknowledge the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon. We were very glad when he visited County Kerry a number of months ago to attend the launch of an informative and comprehensive booklet outlining the various courses and further educational opportunities that are available for people who find themselves in need of upskilling and further training. In the world as it is today education is no longer confined to a specified period of a person's life. Everybody is obliged to follow a lifelong training curve. The Minister said as much in his speech in Kerry that day. He correctly pointed out that everything has changed completely since a number of years ago, when people went to national school, then secondary school and, if they were fortunate, on to university, and that was it. Now, however, people must continuously upskill. There are no jobs for life anymore. It is a very fortunate person who would find themselves leaving college, getting a job and retiring from that job after 30 or 35 years. Unfortunately, those jobs are no longer available. I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill. One could say that SOLAS, the body being established by the Bill, is FÁS by another name. I hope it will be beneficial. Another change is the 16 education boards which will replace the 34 vocational education committees, VECs. The VEC structure served this country very well over the years. I had the utmost respect for the individuals, be they teachers, principals, vice-principals, politicians and county councillors, who served on those VECs and did great work. Indeed, I remember many of the politicians in Kerry who worked on the committees. They did great work and were proud of that work. They were also proud of their role and function in the VECs. When discussing SOLAS and FÁS it should be recognised that FÁS did a great deal of good work. Unfortunately, its good work was sullied by the actions of a few. However, we should not throw the baby out with the bath water and paint everybody in FÁS with the same brush. I encountered great individuals who worked at all levels of FÁS. When I consider the group schemes set up throughout the country by FÁS, which provided thousands of days of work and training, and the very valuable function FÁS performed, I hate to think that people would consider that FÁS was all bad. That was not the case, and the Minister and the Government know it. A small number of people gave it a bad name. When discussing the establishment of a new entity such as SOLAS we should bear in mind that some decisions taken by this Government have not worked out. One example is the centralised system for awarding third level education grants, Student Universal Support Ireland or SUSI, which was an absolute disaster. It is a disaster to this day. It is almost March but even this morning I was still dealing with students who have not received their grants. That is totally unacceptable and wrong. Many of the young people affected wanted to pull out of their courses and I had an awful job persuading them to stay. Thankfully, some of the colleges worked with us. They knew the money would be paid and that the applications would be processed in due course. However, it is not acceptable, right or proper that it is almost March and people are still waiting for education grants. Every Member of the Oireachtas and county councillor has been inundated with representations from people who are in this difficulty. The same has happened with the centralisation of driving licences. That was introduced a few weeks ago and it is already chaos with people unable to get their driving licences processed. We had the same experience with the processing of medical cards. Unfortunately, the Government's track record with centralisation and change has not been good to date. However, that does not prevent me stating that I wish this legislation well. I hope it will work. Over the years I, like many other Members of the House, have had the pleasure and privilege of attending Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, award ceremonies. The individuals receiving their awards were generally accompanied by members of their family and extended family. It could be their parents or their children. It was always a proud and happy occasion to see these people having their educational and training efforts recognised and rewarded. I always enjoyed getting an invitation to those events because I knew it would be a happy and joyous occasion. I hope that will continue. As every person knows, particularly if they have a family, no two children or people are the same. Everybody has their own special skills set and abilities. If one is dealing with somebody who has an intellectual disability, for example, they might have some other great abilities and a fully able person might be unable to keep up with them. I have always seen that in life. If a person is lacking something in one way, they more than make up for it in another. When it comes to education and training we are duty bound to ensure that systems will be put in place to nurture each young person being educated and to make the most of their abilities. I never look at a person and wonder what is holding them back, I always look at the good points that will help them move forward. Thankfully, there is a role and function for everybody in the world. I am very proud that under this Government and previous Governments the way was opened for people with disabilities to secure gainful employment. Indeed, in some large companies and in local authorities there is a standard quota whereby they must try to employ a certain number of people who have disabilities. Wherever one meets people with disabilities who are working, one finds they perform their functions in an excellent manner. They bring their own special skills set to the job. It is only right and proper that they be given every possible opportunity. I am very proud of the Institute of Technology Tralee. It is a vital facility in our county and I hope it goes from success to success. Not only does it fulfil a role in education, it is also an important financial asset for the county. I hope it will continue to grow. Thanks to solid investment over the years and to our teachers in the national and secondary schools and in the colleges the standard of education is increasing all the time. Our young people deserve that.When people are starting out we must ensure that they have the best education and training possible, whether they are intending to work here or go abroad. I am concerned to ensure that in the context of training we engage with employers. I have listened to the Minister of State, Deputy Ciarán Cannon, speak in public since his appointment and he has touched on this issue many times. We must ask what skills employers here need people to have. We have no business training people to be something for which there is no demand. It is important to consider our small employers and to ask what they need from the workforce and what training they want people to have. The Department and SOLAS will have to work together to ensure we establish that connectivity between employers, who will create more employment, and the workforce, who want to obtain gainful employment and to be trained in the proper skills to be of value to an employer. It is working together as a team that enables everyone to be successful. An employee will have a good job to keep him and his family, or her and her family, and the employer will be able to get the most out of the workforce. Not so many years ago, all a person needed to do was to go to secondary school and do the group certificate - as it was then - before going to AnCo for a couple of years to be trained as a fitter or in another trade. Those people went on to work in State bodies. There were plenty of jobs for young people with a minimal education at one stage, but now things are completely different. No person can have enough education now. Further training and skills are of vital importance to the young people who have had to go abroad. I hope many of them will be able to return when our economy is on the rise. I hope they left here with sufficient training and skills to find gainful work internationally. The world is a small place now and we hope they will come back. When we consider the future direction of our training sector, we must consider the core industries of agriculture and tourism. Given the size of the world population, there is a massive market for good-quality food, which is one thing we have in Ireland. The horsemeat scandal has done nothing to dent our reputation; it has proved that we have the necessary checks, measures and accountability in place, as demonstrated by the fact that it was here the problem was first discovered. It went on to become a Europe-wide and worldwide problem. We can be proud that it was the checks put in place here by the relevant Departments and State agencies that ensured the problem was detected. In the context of farming and the agrifood sector, we must consider the agricultural colleges and the excellent work they do to train young farmers. It saddened me during the boom that many agricultural colleges faced closure as so few young farmers wanted to be trained in a sector in which they saw no future. Thankfully, the colleges are now operating at 100% capacity and cannot cater for the number of students who want to attend them. It proves that there are young people who want to stay in Ireland, take over family farms and obtain the required education, skills and qualifications to allow them to be successful, forward-thinking farmers. Like every other sector, farming has changed enormously over the last number of years. A great degree of expertise is now required of farmers in animal husbandry, tillage and dairying. Things are completely different from the way they were ten or 20 years ago. I hope future investments will be made in the training of our young farmers, ensuring that they are able to fulfil the massive potential of the sector and the demand for good-quality food and food products internationally. Irish farming has an excellent reputation. It is a sector we can enhance and expand manyfold in the years ahead. It is vital that every opportunity be taken to ensure that young people are trained to work in every aspect of the tourism sector. There is great potential for further growth in tourism. Recent visitor figures indicate there has been significant growth in the numbers coming to Ireland, particularly from North America, whose previously high visitor numbers had dwindled in recent years. I hope to see growth in the sector again. We must ensure that when people come to Ireland, there are people working in the sector. I have the utmost respect for people working in tourism, whether it is front-line staff who meet tourists when they arrive at hotels or those working in kitchens to do the washing up. Every person plays a vital role in a very important sector. We will rely on tourism, along with farming, to help us in the years ahead. Funding must go in the right direction. We must ensure there is no waste. While I do not think the Minister will allow that to happen, I must take the opportunity to discuss the Government's track record. When it came into office, a great deal of play was made about appointments to State boards. Unfortunately, it was recently proven by journalists who did their homework that the only qualification one has needed in the last two years to get on a State board was membership of either Fine Gael or the Labour Party.

Only last week the Government launched the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs outlining the strategy to do this, with 333 initiatives. One of these initiatives gives employers a financial incentive to employ people who are long-term unemployed. The JobsPlus scheme will provide businesses with grant payments per employee of €7,500 for those who have been unemployed for between one and two years and €10,000 for those who have been out of work for over two years. The grant will be payable over two years. This will provide valuable training and work experience for people who have unfortunately found themselves unemployed. While this initiative is very welcome and adds to a range of initiatives that the Government has introduced over the last two years, such as the reduction in VAT for the hospitality sector, a more fundamental job must be done in matching skills to potential job opportunities. Unfortunately, because of our concentration on the building boom and the skills attached to it, many of our unemployed do not have the skills to avail of new employment opportunities. This is now widely recognised. As a nation we spent billions of euro of taxpayer's money on FÁS training schemes. Money was squandered by that organisation on many useless projects at a time of near-full employment. There is now an urgent need for a restructuring of our training systems if we are to make any significant impact on our huge level of unemployment. The Education and Training Boards Bill and the Further Education and Training Bill form the central planks of the reorganisation of our training and education methods. The Education and Training Boards Bill proposes that the 33 VECs be aggregated into 16 education and training boards, known as ETBs. Each ETB will be required to provide education programmes and opportunities for adults and make available wider education and training supports to other education providers, other than those under the ETB itself. There should be a role for development companies to identify needs and opportunities at local level, especially in rural Ireland. Under the auspices of the ETBs, courses can be aimed at providing training opportunities for employment at a local level. This involves a twin process of aggregating a number of the VECs into a single ETB and assimilating FÁS training services into most of the ETBs. In practical terms, these reforms will include the introduction of shared services in areas such as human resources, payroll and pensions, as well as many more cost-saving exercises. I have often wondered why some public servants are paid weekly and others fortnightly while still others are paid monthly, but that is for another day. In an overall context, ETBs will be governed not only by the Education and Training Boards Bill, which is currently on Report Stage, but more importantly by the Bill before us today. All of this new legislation will provide ETBs with clarity about the future and define their relationships with others involved in education and training. The ETBs will now be solely responsible for the provision of an integrated, publicly funded further education and training service in their geographic areas, which I welcome. They will also be required to collaborate with bodies such as SOLAS and the National Employment and Entitlements Service, NEES, in order to ensure the implementation of national policy. This is particularly important in terms of labour market activation and meeting future skills requirements. In essence it means that people who find themselves unemployed will now have a real opportunity to be retrained by virtue of all of these organisations working together. All this will be driven by local service agreements between SOLAS and the ETBs.  The purpose of the Further Education and Training Bill is to give effect to the Government decision to establish an education and training authority. It mainly provides for the establishment of SOLAS, under the auspices of the Department of Education and Skills, as well as the dissolution of FÁS. Much of the Bill is very technical and deals with issues such as the transfer of staff and property from FÁS training divisions to the newly-formed ETBs. SOLAS is the overarching body, which will facilitate more coherent and integrated national and regional planning across the further education and training sector. The Bill provides that the Minister can advance moneys to SOLAS and that the latter may provide grants subject to certain terms and conditions. The rest of the Bill mainly deals with various structural and staffing issues. As the Minister emphasised, SOLAS will not be delivering courses on the ground; that will be the job of the ETBs. The role of SOLAS will have many parallels with that of the Higher Education Authority in the higher education sector. The aim of SOLAS is to work with the ETBs to harness what is good about our further education and training system and make it even better for those who use it. The new system must encourage people to train and, more importantly, to retrain for jobs that will become available. The central objective, as always, for this Government is to get people back to work. I believe this reform in our education processes will greatly add to this objective and I commend the Bill to the House.
#PeterFitzpatrick	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-party	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-dob	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	144	The Further Education and Training Bill 2013 provides for the establishment of an education and training authority, known as SOLAS, which will co-ordinate and fund further education and training provision in Ireland. The Bill also provides for the dissolution of FÁS and the transfer of its staff and property to SOLAS. The Bill is part of a wider process of institutional reform of the further education and training sector in Ireland. SOLAS will be responsible for co-ordinating and funding the further education and training sector. The Bill assigns a broad range of functions to SOLAS, including strategic policy direction, programme development, funding, oversight and co-ordination of the sector. Some key functions of SOLAS are to advance funding to providers of further education and training; to determine, following consultation, what types of education and training programme should be funded and delivered; to establish systems to monitor the quality of further education and training programmes; to prepare and submit a five-year national strategy for the provision of further education and training; and to conduct research on matters relating to these functions. Unlike FÁS, SOLAS will not deliver programmes itself.  It is expected that, following the establishment of SOLAS and the enactment of the Education and Training Boards Bill 2012, existing FÁS training centres under the remit of the 16 ETBs, which will replace the current VECs and manage the delivery of publicly funded further education and training. The Bill is one part of a wider process of institutional restructuring of the Irish further education and training sector which aims to radically reform the system so that it can enjoy restored public confidence and provide courses that are relevant to learners. A number of steps towards major structural reform of the further education and training sector have already been taken. In July 2011, the Government decided to integrate the delivery of further education and training under 16 ETBs, a process that involved amalgamating and rationalising 33 VECs. This is provided for in the Education and Training Boards Bill 2012.  Currently there is an annual investment of some €900 million in further education and training. This provides for around 270,000 places in part-time or full-time further education and training courses, provided in a large variety of centres. Currently there are some 450 centres delivering formal further education and training, including FÁS training centres, VECs and Youthreach centres. Hundreds of large and small centres are delivering formal and informal courses in atypical modes to different cohorts of learners. There are some 9,000 staff employed in the sector delivering thousands of courses. These courses include technical and vocational training leading to a specific career, apprenticeships and post-leaving-certificate courses, as well as basic literacy, numeracy and adult education. SOLAS will consult with the Department of Social Protection and employers to determine what types of courses and training programmes it should fund, with such courses and programmes to be delivered by public and other bodies. It will also promote, encourage and facilitate the placement of persons who are in receipt of jobseeker's allowance or benefit in further education and training programmes that are funded in whole or in part out of public money, in consultation with the Minister for Social Protection.  The board of SOLAS will comprise ten ordinary members, including the CEO, who is an ex-officio member, and one chairperson. The Minister will appoint a chairperson and nine ordinary members who, in the opinion of the Minister, have expertise and experience in matters connected with the SOLAS functions and matters connected with finance, trade, commerce, corporate governance or public administration.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	145	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Further Education and Training Bill. This Bill is yet another step in the Government's reform agenda. We have found ourselves in a situation in which many areas of society and Departments are in need of reform.The Bill takes a dramatic step forward in streamlining and updating the structures around further education and training. It is clear that the needs of the people have changed dramatically in this area in recent years. It is only right and proper that the structures change to meet these needs. There is a new cohort out of work, people who never envisaged they would find themselves in such a position. They want to get back to work; not working is an alien concept to them. The structures in place to support them in education and training must allow a training place to translate into a job interview and a job interview into a job. In establishing SOLAS, Seirbhísí Oideachais Leanunaigh agus Scileanna, we are undertaking to build a more efficient, effective and better focused structure that will ensure the maximum amount possible from a budget of almost €1 billion will reach those who need it and be freed from bureaucracy. Despite the blather of other Members, it is important to remember the amount given by the Government in extra resources and places in further education and training in every constituency. Structural reform is important and what the Bill does in this regard is welcome. However, I want to highlight two other important points on further education and training. The first concerns making people aware of the supports available in this area. I am constantly shocked by the number of people who attend my constituency clinics who are not linked with services and have no direct link with a course or training. While there is so much on offer, the actual awareness levels are low. I know the Department of Social Protection has taken a leadership role in that regard, but we need to examine the use of social media and national road shows to explain what is available in further education and training. The second issue we need to address is the perception of what further education and training are and the supports on offer. There has been, sadly, a negative, if not snobby, attitude to what further education entails. Recently, as a member of the Oireachtas education committee, I met several Australian Senators visiting Ireland. In Australia they have this viewpoint that not everyone needs to have a third level education, but everybody needs to be trained in some expertise or skill. College and university will not be for everybody and there is no hierarchical need. Their system has been very much set up to reflect this. Whatever a person's skills set is, the state must support him or her. That is a worthy and important lesson we can learn from our Australian colleagues. On Tuesday I saw a similar model which addressed these two issues at the Bray offices of the Department of Social Protection. It had linked in with a range of voluntary and statutory organisations such as FÁS, the MABS and the National Adult Literacy Agency, to put on an exhibition of what was on offer in further education and training. It was heartening to see the range of supports available and the number of voluntary organisations chipping in with the role they were playing. It was also great for someone to avail of the services of a one-stop shop. Great credit must go to the Bray offices of the Department for arranging this event. The Bill dismantles the structures of FÁS. Deputy Michael Healy-Rae has pointed out that FÁS has done much good work, with which I agree. There are many in my constituency who work for FÁS and continue to provide a great range of services. Just like matters went wrong in the banks and politics, they went badly wrong in FÁS in terms of corporate governance. However, many of those working on the ground in various FÁS offices and training centres have done a very good job. I acknowledge this and have no doubt many of them will continue to make contributions in the new structures. Yesterday we had very encouraging news on the jobs front for the first time when we saw employment trends move the right way. Unfortunately, there is a significant challenge when it comes to youth unemployment. It is appropriate that we are debating the Bill on the day the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, are meeting EU employment Ministers in Dublin. We need to make further education and night classes attractive. They cannot be seen as something someone's mother goes along to in the evening. These are programmes that someone in their 20s should be finding attractive. We need to involve industry in further education and training, an issue in which I know the Minister of State, Deputy Ciarán Cannon, is involved. There is no point in having people taking flower arranging or basket making courses if industry's needs are different. It is about matching the needs of industry with the courses on offer. There are many high-end courses available, but we need to constantly ask what skills sets it needs. It comes back to my point that at the end training has to equate to a job.
#MaryMitchellOConnor	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-party	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-dob	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	146	The Further Education and Training Bill 2013 provides for the dismantling of FÁS and the creation of SOLAS which will be fundamentally different from FÁS, a semi-State body in which the public have lost confidence. SOLAS aims to radically reform and restructure the further education and training system in order that it can enjoy restored public confidence and provide relevant courses for learners. What happened with overspending in FÁS was scandalous. Corporate governance was at an all-time low. The mismanagement - the non-management - was galling. First-class flights, expensive dinners, luxurious hotels were all paid for courtesy of the taxpayer. This was scandalous, disgraceful and must never happen again. Thankfully, such days are at an end. The Government will never allow mistakes like this to be made again. Accordingly, I am assured to see provisions in the Bill relating to whistleblowing. Sections 34 to 36, inclusive, provide for whistleblowing in cases where a person communicates the view that an offence has been or is being committed. SOLAS will provide for a targeted learner-centred approach. It is important that we provide courses relevant to the current jobs market. Since the downturn, the jobs market has changed dramatically and continues to develop and transform. Today in the media there is mention of an increase in job creation, but I also note these are high-end jobs. The courses provided by SOLAS need to adapt to mirror changes in the jobs market. Those seeking training courses should receive the very best available that will equip them with skills which will assist them to find suitable jobs and careers. Continual research needs to be conducted to ensure the courses provided are ahead of the curve, that obsolete courses are ended and students' time is not wasted. Courses provided must also reflect the advances in technology and industries as they arise. They need to be more practical and serve the needs of jobseekers and employers. They need to be dictated by the needs of jobseekers and employers, not by the skills of course providers, as well as being dictated by skills shortages, not by the knowledge base of course providers. These will be the objectives of SOLAS which I will be watching with interest to ensure they are met. I commend the Bill to the House.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	147	Fianna Fáil supports the Further Education and Training Bill 2013 that will formally change the name of FÁS to SOLAS. We welcome the extended role it will play in providing for oversight of and direction for the further education and training sector. We are all familiar with FÁS from its offices in our constituencies. Despite the justified criticism of the agency at its top level, I always found local FÁS offices, particularly in Enniscorthy, County Wexford, provided excellent services and were supportive in meeting the needs of the unemployed. They were also supportive of business and people with ideas on how courses should be set up and run. I hope many of the agency's workers who have expertise in these areas will transfer to SOLAS and keep on providing valuable knowledge on how courses should be provided in the future.It is important to recognise that courses which may have been relevant in the past are no longer relevant for job opportunities at present. I note that the SOLAS board will consist of 11 members with relevant expertise to be appointed by the Minister for Education and Skills after consultation with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister for Social Protection. Will the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, explain what kind of people will be involved and how the Minister proposes to select people for the board? Will those appointed be ministerial supporters or people from IBEC and successful industries with a wide variety of experience? Will they simply be political appointees? It is important that the board has the relevant expertise required to drive SOLAS in future. The model is right but the implementation of the model concerns me. Will the Minister of State outline when the education and training boards, ETBs, will be set up? How many, if any, have been set up to date? If none, how will all of them be set up by the end of 2014? Are we waiting until after the 2014 local elections to see the make up of the new ETBs? I cannot see how all the ETBs will be set up by the end of 2014. There should be an urgency about this matter. Will the Minister of State outline what dialogue has taken place between the VECs and the Department in recent months and what will take place in the coming months? The boards of County Wexford and City of Waterford VECs are to amalgamate. I understand one meeting was held last week among representatives and members of the two boards. However, there has been little urgency about the amalgamation of the two and I imagine the position is the same in the other counties. There will be 16 ETBs with 16 chief executives. This morning I calculated that there are eight counties in the south east and south Leinster, including Waterford and Wexford. There will be five chief executives running that area. One wonders whether we need 16 chief executives. Do we need five chief executives in the south east to run the SOLAS campaign? The Acting Chairman will be aware that some multinational companies employ 40,000 people but have only one chief executive. Is it the case that much of the money will be gobbled up by the chief executives and their entourages and staff rather than providing for people who need services, training and reskilling? Are the VECs resisting or embracing the changes the Minister envisages with the amalgamations? Another issue is that FÁS operated all year round and the staff were available at different times of the day. Often up to now FÁS staff have been available at night time. Will the new boards and ETBs be flexible or will they be like VECs at the moment, which close down at 4.30 p.m. or 5 p.m. in the evening until 9.30 a.m. the following morning? These areas need to be teased out by the Minister. There should be flexibility and people should be available to run courses, advise on courses and meet communities and business people who may wish to set up courses. Trainers should be available at night time because often business people and others may not be available during the day. We need flexibility in the system. What opportunities will be available? While FÁS did a very good job with the courses that were relevant ten or 15 years ago, especially in my county, where the building industry was a hive of activity, this is no longer the case. Vast numbers of people are unemployed now who once worked in the building industry and who had left school at a young age because the money was good. Such people find now that they have a lack of education and skills and it is important that under the new set-up SOLAS recognises this and encourages people to get back to education. The new agency should consider providing courses for job opportunities that are likely to be available. Job opportunities in my area are likely to be in the fishing and farming industries, wind energy, which is on the move, information technology and tourism. Recently I learned that people who worked in wind energy area had to be sent to England to be trained for work permits and relevant skills to allow them work with wind turbines that have been erected. These people were not allowed to work in the area unless they held something like the FÁS safe pass qualification, but they had to go to England to get the qualification and that should not be happening. These areas should be examined. We should consider such areas in consultation with the providers and design courses that are relevant to industries in a given area. Some Deputies have referred to the agricultural colleges. There are excellent agricultural colleges throughout the country include one in Pilltown, Kilkenny and others in Cork and other parts of the country. However, we should bring the agricultural courses to the students. I hope the new ETBs will provide agricultural courses in County Wexford or County Kilkenny or wherever. Students should not have to leave their county and go to Cork or other areas. The agricultural courses required to enable farmers to farm and draw down grants should be provided in the schools or colleges under the ETBs. This matter should be examined as well. Post leaving certificate, PLC, courses have been particularly successful. Enniscorthy Vocational College is the centre of excellence for PLC courses in Wexford. Last year there were 450 applications but only funding for 300. This meant 150 people could not get on a PLC course. Those refused a place went back on jobseeker's allowance and were getting €100 per week or €5,000 per year for doing nothing. Rather than being paid €5,000 per year for sitting at home, there should be a system whereby we can increase the number of PLC courses at that school. I imagine other schools throughout the country are in the same position. These schools have the facilities to provide the PLC courses. Obviously, they would need extra teachers, but would it not be better to pay extra teachers to provide courses rather than pay €5,000 to students to sit at home? These students want further education and want to better themselves. Like many of the people I referred to earlier, they were in the building industry and left school at 16 or 17 years of age. They are seeking re-education and to re-enter the education system now. I wish to make one final point and I will finish on this note.

Many have qualified as air hostesses, because there are courses in that area, and have taken up other job opportunities. I welcome the fact that SOLAS is in this new position. I hope the new organisation will embrace what is needed in the country at present especially given the high level of youth unemployment. I trust the new boards will reflect the relevant expertise that is required. More important, the VECs need to come on board and buy into the system. The ETBs will be providing the service in future and it is important that they reflect the relevant job opportunities in each constituency and county. I welcome the Bill, which represents a step in the right direction, but a good deal of work remains to be done between now and the end of 2014. The Minister referred to setting up the ETBs. There should be a speeding up of the process. There is an urgent need to establish some of the ETBs before the end of 2014. Perhaps there should be some pilot systems in operation before then to determine how they are working. Having discussed the matter with members of County Wexford VEC and the City of Waterford VEC, I have detected little urgency at present in bringing them together and ensuring they are ready for change and ready to embrace change.They have yet to iron out all the union and flexibility problems that may arise, including longer working hours and flexible work practices. I am sure the Minister of State is capable of dealing with these issues to ensure SOLAS is a success.
#AnnPhelan	unknown-#AnnPhelan-party	unknown-#AnnPhelan-dob	unknown-#AnnPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	150	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill. One of the main objectives for this Government is to get people back to work. There are thousands of people who need to get back to work but do not believe they have the necessary qualifications. Education is the great equaliser. The Further Education and Training Bill 2013 provides for the establishment of an education and training authority, SOLAS, and the dissolution of its predecessor, FÁS. SOLAS will co-ordinate and fund further education and training throughout the country. The aims of SOLAS are complex and meeting them will be challenging. It will prepare and submit a five-year strategy for the provision of further education and training to determine what type of funding should be delivered to these programmes. It will also assess whether funded bodies have been performing their functions in an efficient and effective manner and establish systems to monitor these bodies. The concept of fit for purpose is critical in a training authority.  Among the new aims of SOLAS is the replacement of 33 vocational education committees with 16 new education and training boards, ETBs. FÁS will be disbanded and the existing centres will be transferred to the responsibility of these new ETBs. This Bill is part of a wider process of restructuring the Irish further education and training sector with the aim of radically reforming further education systems so that they can once more enjoy the full confidence and support of the public. The lavish waste that occurred in FÁS shattered public confidence in that State agency. Hundreds and thousands of euro were wasted while people on the ground were told there was no money for courses that would eventually get people back to work. The fact that the waste continued for so long unnoticed and unchecked was a stark reality that hit hard. How could a State agency specifically charged with getting people back to work and off the dole be so irresponsible in wasting public funds? However, it would be remiss of me not to state that the ordinary staff in FÁS carried out their duties in an exemplary manner. Estimates abound that FÁS was spending millions of euro at a time when this country was enjoying a boom and many more people were in full employment than is the case today. Fianna Fáil was in Government while this was happening but not only did it miss the reality of what was going on, it was also slow in reacting when it became aware of it. This is why SOLAS has to work. Its establishment is a positive step but new safeguards must be put in place so that history is not repeated.  More people are in need of help in this country than ever before. The demands of the current employment market are ever-changing and further education bodies will need to react rapidly to these trends. Ireland needs to be able to tell the international labour market we have a labour force that can react swiftly to market changes, especially in the information technology sector. An ongoing evaluation and assessment system should built into the new board, with the needs of the employment market matched with the training provided so that the right talents and skill sets are made available. If we can confront the ghosts of the past now we can avoid repeating mistakes, but if we do not get it right now we will regret another wasted opportunity. This Bill presents a great opportunity to get the people of Ireland back to work and restore their self-respect. There is a shortage of suitably qualified workers in certain areas, such as technology. When people have been out of work for some time they can feel they are no use to society and SOLAS will need to guide them along the most appropriate paths while valuing what they have to offer. However, the second and third level education system faces wider challenges than those who are out of work or in need of skills improvement. The curriculum must be able to change quickly. For several years there has been a decline in the number of people studying science subjects at second and third level, which has led to shortages of technical and scientific expertise. Languages are also a cause for concern. FÁS notably failed in this regard. We need to be able to offer prospective jobseekers the possibility of learning another language. As a result of the digital era, the entire labour force has changed and business has become global. These are the market shifts we need to be aware of and react to if the world's leading firms are to continue to beat a path to our door. Ireland has enjoyed the highest of international reputations for our educated workforce, but we need to maintain its quality. Although it is a shame that Irish people have to emigrate, they are able to find high-quality employment wherever they go and they are treated extremely well. Of course, our international reputation should not be our sole concern. We must also look after the people who through no fault of their own have lost their jobs and are now looking for employment in a depressed global economy. It is soul-destroying to send application after application only to be told that one is not wanted. We continue to see the green shoots of recovery and thanks to the work of this Government, the IDA and other bodies, jobs are being created on a daily basis. However, we do not have a one-size-fits-all solution. As the Minister for Education and Skills has noted, it is more important than ever before that the sector is fit for everyone's purpose. While I was a councillor in Kilkenny County Council I conducted a study of the number of jobs lost in Ireland and found that 50 jobs had been lost every week since 2002. This decline began in the high technology sector with the loss of 50 jobs in Spectra in Tralee. The only person who raised this issue in the House was the Minister, Deputy Quinn. I commend the Bill to the House. I have great hope for SOLAS and the education and training boards.

This adjustment is further complicated by a process of major restructuring in the labour market, particularly in respect of employment opportunities. This seismic shift has resulted in mass unemployment in almost every EU country and has given rise to a range of issues relating to socioeconomic policy, employment and work opportunities and labour-market-oriented training. This Bill is part of a systematic effort to implement unprecedented reforms which are intended to streamline and improve the further education sector in Ireland. This Second Stage debate takes place in the same week that the Oireachtas finalised the Education and Training Boards Bill 2012.This Bill provides the basis for the new local education and training board system. The Bills are complementary, with the Further Education and Training Bill designed to assign a broad range of functions to the newly established education and training authority, SOLAS, which will be responsible for co-ordinating and funding further education and training. The Bill has been described as one element of a wider programme of institutional reform of the further education and training sector and is part of a joined-up approach that involves three separate pieces of primary legislation, as well as the establishment of a range of bodies that are part of a radical process of rationalisation and amalgamation. The enactment of the Bill is happening at a time when a significant number of citizens have been laid low by an unprecedented economic meltdown that can only be reversed in part by stimulating job creation and enhanced employment opportunities. The Further Education and Training Bill is part of a broader strategy that links a number of initiatives being implemented to meet the increased demand for education and training that has resulted from rising unemployment. Its importance in overseeing funding and driving forward policy across the further education sector cannot be overstated. The establishment of SOLAS under the Further Education and Training Bill will, I hope, bring closure to one of the worst scandals arising from the workings of a State body since the formation of the State. The scandalous misuse of funds and expenditure in FÁS, dating back to 2004, was common within the higher echelons of FÁS, when spending controls were routinely bypassed and there was a serious failure to implement good corporate governance procedures. In some of the most appalling examples of unaccountability, incompetence and wastage, characteristic of some of the worst excesses of the so-called Celtic tiger era, the activities of certain senior personal within FÁS greatly undermined the capacity of that organisation to discharge its duties at a time when labour activation measures through training and learning were badly needed. Their actions discredited an organisation that had done much good work in helping to generate employment since its inception in the 1980s. During that period the organisation was spending almost €1 billion of taxpayers' money annually, even at a time of full employment. It was a time of decadence and wastage and in 2011, when reviewing the extent of the scandal that had become fully apparent in 2008, the director of employment with the OECD labelled what had happened "a national disaster". In the same year the ESRI found that FÁS-provided activation interviews for unemployed persons had a negative impact on their prospects, leading to a 17% lower chance of securing employment than for those who did not undergo an activation interview.  It is against this dark legacy and culture of recklessness and irresponsibility that SOLAS is tasked with funding the delivery of services from the 16 new education and training boards. The establishment of SOLAS is part of a reform agenda designed to revitalise the further education sector and enhance the State's labour market activism strategy. There is a large and diverse further education sector, with a wide range of providers and courses that have been described as unwieldy and inefficient, not least because they have evolved in an unplanned and relatively unstructured fashion over many decades. Together, VECs and FÁS deliver over 70% of FETAC awards annually, but, unlike most other OECD countries, further education and training in Ireland have grown in an organic and unco-ordinated way and are delivered by numerous organisations and providers. It is, therefore, highly unlikely that taxpayers have been getting value for money under the current arrangements and one of the most pressing issues that must be addressed in the time ahead is the duplication of courses at a regional level, both within the PLC sector and the parallel FÁS training system. Equally important is the capacity of teaching staff within further education and FÁS training services to deliver the standards required by high tech industries. Crucially, we need to address the crisis we face within the employment sector that, in part, stems from a lack of suitably qualified workers in key areas such as technology and the service industry. The importance of ICT, foreign language skills and expertise in business, engineering and technology requires very specialised courses that can only be delivered by motivated staff who are experts in their respective fields. This can only be achieved through adequate investment throughout the education system, where preparation to meet ever-evolving and diverse employability criteria is dependent on the standard of education delivered from preschool onwards. One of the first challenges to be faced is how to fully integrate FÁS with the further education sector, where the terms and conditions of employment vary greatly. Put simply, at a time when we need to develop a more efficient and effective system, we cannot afford a further education and training service that is closed down for half the year. For too long, we have had a dysfunctional training system that has contributed greatly to a disastrous waste of potential talent in people who, if provided with the proper assistance, could play an integral part in helping to kick-start our economic revival. In order to enhance the delivery of further education and training, we need to establish a more integrated and coherent system that can meet the future needs of the labour market. AONTAS has proposed that the starting point for this reform be the development of an integrated quality service that is able to cater for a wide range of learning needs for the labour market. This should include a capacity to deliver a diverse range of skill sets that include personal, social, cultural and civic development. In its submission in response to the Bill AONTAS has also expressed the view that the definition of what is meant by further education, as proposed in the legislation, is extremely narrow and fails to reflect the complexity and scope of what we mean by training and learning. There are also concerns that the functions of SOLAS have been limited by the narrowness of their scope, which, while identifying employers as key stakeholders, has neglected to engage in a meaningful way with providers of further education and training and adult learners. Current labour market programmes are limited in the way they cater for people with literacy and numeracy needs. All too often, they fail to address the needs of the long-term unemployed. We need to acknowledge this and the fact that when people with literacy and numeracy difficulties participate, the relative benefits when compared to other groups are much greater. Adequate funding is also needed to advance the capacity of further education and training providers to deliver the learning programmes that reflect the complex demands of the labour market. In addition to these aims, we need robust systems in place to monitor the quality and outcomes to ensure the qualitative delivery of programmes that are fit for purpose. All of this must be underpinned by an ethos that seeks to promote and appreciate the value of further education and training. There is much merit in the proposal to develop a learner charter that would be adopted by all further education and training providers. Section 9 outlines how SOLAS will consult and prepare the further education and training strategy which will inform and shape the delivery of services. To be credible, this strategy must be carried out after close consultation with providers and adult learners, where there is a credible learner-centred theme that reflects the diversity of learners. In other words, the diverse perspectives and interests within the further education and training sector must be represented on the board of SOLAS. NGOs such as AONTAS and NALA are well placed to fulfil this role. This is essential if we are serious about addressing the appalling rates of literacy and numeracy. As we attempt to see a new further education and training system emerge, we need a strategic and co-ordinated response to address this problem. SOLAS should be required, therefore, to consult adult learners in the development of the further education and training strategy. Sinn Féin supports the proposals brought forward by NALA that there be a dedicated adult learner perspective on the board of SOLAS. This would ensure learners had a voice and an input into the decision on the governance of SOLAS and the development of further education and training policies which would improve the quality and effectiveness of education authorities. There is little doubt that in order to improve and develop the further education sector, a holistic approach is needed, with the type of joined-up strategy that links the primary and post-primary school curriculums, when preparing young people for adulthood. Of paramount importance is the promotion of equality of opportunity for all social groups to ensure the optimum impact of further education and training that has a key role to play in tackling social disadvantage.Therefore, our priority must be to assist those who most need help. Unfortunately, they are often the least likely to receive assistance. The educational needs and requirements of adult learners are very complex. Many adult learners had negative early experiences with the education system. Teachers, instructors and administrators must make a serious effort to address this issue. It is imperative that innovative and creative course offerings are made available to prospective students. Courses should be well structured and thought out, and should be designed in a way that incorporates a process of active learning. This is of vital importance in any further education strategy. While I acknowledge that thousands of adults have benefited from PLC courses, I wonder why the Government showed such a lack of foresight when it decided to increase the pupil-teacher ratio in the further education sector from 17:1 to 19:1. People who return to further education, particularly the long-term unemployed and the poor, often need extra attention in areas such as literacy and numeracy. The increase in the pupil-teacher ratio flies in the face of the need to assist such people. It will put serious pressure on the learning outcomes achieved by the students of even the most committed teachers. It goes without saying that such cuts pose yet another educational challenge, even for the most dedicated adult learners. If we are genuinely interested in assisting people to increase their skills and retrain so they can access scarce employment opportunities and improve their human capital, we must ensure the needs and requirements of adult students are core priorities in our further education system. At a time when unemployment, under-employment and emigration are harsh realities of life for thousands of Irish people, elected representatives have a duty to ensure that the education system is properly funded and resourced and that the needs and requirements of the recipients of education are at its core.

While I have not fully scrutinised every aspect of this important legislation, I feel I need to speak on it. A number of issues of considerable concern regarding this package of legislation - the Bill before the House and a related Bill that we have discussed on Report Stage - have been raised with me. The two Bills will reorganise the further education sector, integrate that sector with what used to be FÁS and is now SOLAS and give responsibility for certain matters to the Department of Social Protection. We all sympathise with the general thrust of what the Government is proposing and the rationale behind what it is trying to do. It is seeking to streamline the further education sector and link it to the need to educate, upskill and retrain people in a way that better prepares them for the labour market. I refer to those who are entering the labour market for the first time and to the hundreds of thousands of unemployed people who would like to return to the labour market. The idea of trying to connect things up - to join the dots between education, skills improvement and retraining and getting people into employment - is absolutely correct. It has been decided to link this structure to the Department of Social Protection so that the Department will have a role in trying to get people back into the workplace, rather than being seen merely as a place that gives out money. It seems to me that this attempt to put the various pieces together in a coherent way is generally a positive move. It is particularly required in light of this country's awful unemployment situation. While I am sympathetic to the general thrust of the Bill, I am concerned about a number of aspects of it. The decision to increase the pupil-teacher ratio in the further education sector seems to fly in the face of the stated objectives of this legislation. I did not understand this fully until teachers in the further education sector explained to me the potential damage the increase in the ratio could do to the quality of the courses that are offered in the sector. While the basic point they made is of relevance throughout the country, it is particularly pertinent in my constituency because there are three further education colleges in Dún Laoghaire. It may be unusual to have such a concentration of further education colleges in one place. Teachers and representatives of all three colleges have made the point strongly that the increase in the ratio will fundamentally undermine the incredibly important work these colleges are doing in providing education, skills improvement and retraining to a precise cohort of people in the sectors of society that have been most blighted by the unemployment crisis. More than most, these people need the right type of education and retraining if they are to enter the workforce. Further education colleges often deal with people for whom conventional academic education, which tends to suit those who go straight from second level to university, is not the best or most appropriate form of education. Very talented people who might not perform well when offered a more academic type of education need a form of education that focuses on their specific abilities, skills and talents. The type of further education we are discussing caters for them by allowing them to develop their skills and abilities in a focused way. Generally speaking, these colleges cater for people from the more socially disadvantaged groups and from the less well-off sectors in our society. The teachers have told me that the change in the pupil-teacher ratio will result in the loss of five or six full teaching posts in each of the colleges in my area.In fact, if four or five jobs are to go as a result of the ratio, it may mean 11 part-time posts in each of those colleges, given the first people who will lose their jobs are those who are part-time, not full-time. Those people are often teachers with specialisms, without which the courses they taught simply cannot be taught any longer, because the full-time staff would not have those particular skills. They state a whole range of courses will be lost in their colleges and that the number of places they will be able to offer is going to be dramatically reduced. With regard to an issue that did not feature in the debate on the connected Bill, they point out that, because of the caps that have already been imposed in terms of funding being matched with the numbers, they were already taking in hundreds more people than they were being given money for by the Department because they did not want to turn anybody away. That was difficult enough for them but, now, with the change in ratio, it will become unsustainable. They state that hundreds of places will be lost because they simply will not have the resources to provide teachers with the particular skills. If that is what is going to happen and, as a result, the avenues for further education and the diversity of different offerings in terms of what is available for further education for hundreds of people is to be dramatically reduced, how do we square that with the generally positive aspiration of trying to reskill and re-educate as many people as possible for the workforce? It runs directly counter to it. It will have the opposite effect to the one the Government states as its objective. Again, if one were a conspiracy theorist, which, of course, none of us is, one would note, on the one hand, the real impact of what is going to happen as a result of the change in the student-staff ratio in existing further education colleges and, on the other, the fact this Bill contains a specific reference to and provision for outsourcing further education under SOLAS to private colleges. Of course, students pay substantially more in private colleges than they would pay in registration fees in further education colleges currently, given these are relatively modest, despite recent increases, compared to what one would have to pay to the private colleges. While the Government's intention may be genuinely to increase the number of people upskilled, retrained, taken off the live register to be trained and so on, because of the change in the ratio, the further education colleges will not be able to provide for those numbers, and someone is going to have to pick up the slack. It seems to me that this slack will be picked up by the private education sector at a greater cost to the people who need that education, which is very worrying. If one was putting together the pieces of the jigsaw that are fuelling my concern on this, one would then look at the Government proposals for the membership of the board of SOLAS, which are alarming. The Bill states that the Minister will appoint the chairperson and nine ordinary members who, in the Minister’s opinion, have experience of, and expertise in regard to, matters concerned with the functions of SOLAS and matters connected with finance, trade, commerce, corporate governance or public administration. The word "education" does not feature. It is all about finance, commerce and economics.

That worries me. There is a reason for being worried about it, given the result of the setting up of these super-quangos in the past, such as, for example, the HSE, which we all know turned into an utter disaster. The HSE replaced the health boards. While there is no question the health boards had major problems, at least they were more locally based and, in my opinion, could have been reformed in a way that was more responsive to local need and more representative of the different stakeholders. Instead, we got a super-quango, the HSE, which is unaccountable, it seems, even to the Department of Health. The current Government has rightly been critical and said it would get rid of the HSE and so on. However, who were the people appointed by the last Government to the board of the HSE and who have made such a bags of it? They were people connected to commerce, trade, finance and so on. There were virtually no health professionals on the HSE board - that was part of the problem. It was this super-quango which ruined the health service. Some of the people on the board were from big accountancy firms and, oddly, one of the first board appointees was a former chief executive officer of Microsoft. While I am sure he has talents, what the hell is he doing in the HSE? One seriously begins to ask questions. Is the intended or unintended consequence of this that, as in regard to health, which we saw as a business rather than a public service, we may be doing the same with further education, which is seen as a business which we can then outsource to the private education sector? Education is not a business. For sure, it should be connected to employment and directed towards training people for industry and work in any sector of the economy, but it is not a business and it should not be just done on the basis of number-crunching, unit costs and all that kind of thing. That does not add up to good education. As I have said to the Minister of State, the word on the ground from the people actually delivering further education is that the student-staff ratio will seriously undermine what is supposed to be the central purpose of all this, which is the quantity of courses and places that can be made available for people. In my own constituency, and this could be replicated elsewhere, Dún Laoghaire currently has a VEC for these three colleges but this will now be amalgamated into the education and training board for the whole of Dublin. How is this rationalisation, if it is not just a cutback, going to improve the governance of further education in a place like Dún Laoghaire, where, in fact, it was very responsive to local need? Again, the teachers say the courses they developed over the years built up a real rapport with the needs of the people in the sector, and the courses were developed and were directed towards the needs of the people coming in and towards local business and local industry. It was dynamic. While I am not saying there were not problems with other aspects of the governance, removing this to some board at a citywide level, where that connection is broken between the governance of further education and local needs and dynamics, is a real danger. I would like to hear the Government's response to some of these points. Obviously, it will be discussed in more detail on Committee Stage. I reiterate that while the idea is good in principle, if this reform, as has often been the case particularly in the current climate against a backdrop of cuts and austerity, turns out to be the packaging in which cuts and reductions in resources are implemented, it may not achieve its ends. There is considerable evidence that some of the measures being implemented by the Government may militate in the opposite direction. I hope that is not the case but I would like to hear more assurance from the Government that this will not be the case because teachers and people working in the further education sector tell me that this will be the real net effect. Could the Government respond to those points?
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	157	I will respond quickly to the few points raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett. He mentioned conspiracy theories and proposed that we do not get involved in them in this House. I would argue that he elucidated one particular conspiracy theory over the past ten minutes. This is that we are somehow setting out through the creation of SOLAS to dumb down and under-resource further education and training in this country. We are setting out to achieve the opposite. We are not creating a super-quango. To be fair to the Deputy, what we are trying to achieve is a difficult concept to get one's head around. This is one of the most ground-breaking and reforming pieces of legislation that will come before the House in the lifetime of this Government. The closest analogy I can draw is to the function of the Higher Education Authority in terms of its relationship with universities and institutes of technology. The Higher Education Authority has a board and executive that determine the long-term vision and strategy for the direction and ambitions of the higher education sector. The board of SOLAS will have a similar function - no more and no less than that. The democratic power emanating from communities across the country that has been a critical part of the VEC structure in the past will remain that. The rapport that Deputy Boyd Barrett said has been established between the VEC sector, learners, employers and enterprise in his constituency will remain and will be enhanced through this process rather than detracted from. I understand why people seeing such substantial change happening would question the reason for it and perhaps see that it somehow undermines their position. It is often difficult to convince people of the need for such change. Over the past year and a half, I have actively engaged with teaching and managerial staff, learners and trainees in every sector and have found nothing but significant enthusiasm among the sector for the changes we are suggesting. The sector will openly admit that it has grown organically into a rather fragmented structure across the country. There is significant duplication ongoing. For example, if a VEC in Donegal decided tomorrow morning to spend valuable taxpayers' resources on developing a new course in aquaculture, which might be very pertinent to the local economy, it is quite possible that a VEC in Galway, Kerry or other fishing communities across the country might not even be aware that such a course has been developed. Certainly there would not have been the level of co-operation and collaboration between the VECs to allow that course to be delivered elsewhere.  I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett about the expertise that has been developed over decades of work within the VEC structure. What we are going to do here is bring together all the expertise, which is very significant, under one umbrella group or entity and then bolt on all the expertise that exists within the training sector, which again has been developed using valuable taxpayers' resources through the decades through FÁS. Bringing those together will create a powerful opportunity for people who need to gain the highest quality of educational opportunity locally. That is exactly what SOLAS is setting out to create. As Minister of State with responsibility for training and skills, it is my responsibility to ensure that the Department, through its regional and local presence, provides timely, realistic and relevant opportunities for individuals to continue their education and training and for them to be equipped to avail of future job opportunities. A common number of themes emerged from the discussion last night and today. The need for our further education and training sector to keep pace with a rapidly evolving economy and jobs market was one of the major themes that emerged from our discussions. That is very much what we intend to do with the creation of SOLAS. In conjunction with Forfás, we are carrying out significant research on the skills shortages occurring now and those that may occur in the medium and long term. The new ETB structures under the aegis of SOLAS will also be obliged to carry out research in Dún Laoghaire, Galway and elsewhere to find out what skills shortages are unique to those regions and need to be responded to quickly. In a recent press interview, I suggested that FÁS was a very large behemoth of an organisation that was perhaps incapable of responding quickly to urgent changes in the jobs market. The new ETB structure under the aegis of SOLAS will be like a speedboat - able to rush to address new skills shortages and new evolution and innovation in our jobs market.  I recall reading a piece in Newsweek a number of weeks ago which stated that 50% of the careers that will exist by 2025 do not exist now. That is how rapidly the jobs market is changing. I read another piece online last night which stated that in the US alone, 300,000 jobs have been created developing apps for iPhones and other mobile devices. I spoke with the leader of an international software company six months ago who told me that 85% of that company's revenue now accrues from products developed over the past 18 months. Standing still is not an option anymore. If Ireland is to remain globally competitive and at the helm of global technology development, we need to ensure that we have people to feed into and play a very active role in that process of growth and innovation. It is critical that we have training, upskilling and further education opportunities available. That is what we are setting out to do here. There is no underhand scheme to somehow privatise the sector. FÁS in its current incarnation would already outsource about 75% to 80% of its training because the organisation does not have the capacity to deliver in the numbers we need. What I also want to see happening through the creation of SOLAS is for us to be able to actively interact with every person we either train or educate so that we can find out from him or her at an individual level how effective and meaningful the intervention has been for him or her. We will do this through an innovative software system. In the past, FÁS and the VECs gathered some of that information but more often than not, it was not used but was stored away in filing cabinets. It did not play a part in forming the long-term education and training ambitions or goals at either regional or national level. If one has all that data gathered, can track every individual and know that he or she was supported in a software, managerial or other course in any location in the country, one can tell whether he or she is back in further or higher education, is in employment or unemployed six months later, as well as the other resources he or she needs. That information at one's fingertips will be a very powerful tool in designing further education and training opportunities in the future.  Together with the Minister, Deputy Quinn, I am very confident and passionately believe that we are heading in the right direction. I want this to be successful. I look forward to hearing the contributions on Committee Stage. I am anxious to be as conciliatory and as collaborative as I can when dealing with the concerns of Members. I hope to be able to address those concerns in so far as possible.

I, therefore, wish to call on the Minister to ensure that local democracy will be involved and that communities will at all times be reassured about and be kept fully informed of developments in this regard. The 2006 wind energy guidelines are obsolete and insufficient, particularly in the context of the recently signed memorandum of understanding with the United Kingdom. There must be a cohesive approach involving the Departments of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Environment, Community and Local Government in order to ensure that proper guidelines are put in place. When I refer to proper guidelines, I mean those of a statutory and mandatory nature. It is imperative that my concerns be taken on board and addressed at an early stage. I understand that there was a recent two-week consultation period in respect of wind energy guidelines. I ask the Minister to examine reopening the consultation process, particularly on foot of the information deficit which exists. Information deficits tend to give rise to, perhaps, unnecessary concerns among communities. A major debate on this matter is commencing in the midlands. I am of the view that this debate must be managed properly. Adequate regulations must be put in place and we must ensure that we bring people and communities along with us. What could be a win-win situation could easily be turned into a loss if we fail to do the latter.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	162	Like the previous speaker, I want wind energy to be harnessed. However, this must be done in a sustainable and proper manner and local communities must be involved. What is happening in Laois and other counties at present flies in the face of this. Four areas in Laois have been designated in the local county development plan and four further areas are open to consideration. In fairness to them, local councillors developed some reasonable proposals in respect of this matter. However, what will happen is that a company will be able to use the strategic infrastructure legislation in order to sweep those proposals to one side. The key issue is that electricity produced by means of wind energy must be used to supply local customers in the first instance. We do not want huge turbines to be plonked in the middle of Vicarstown, Ballybrittas or wherever and the energy they generate to be reserved exclusively for the British market. I do not have any hang-ups with regard to the export of electricity to Britain. We should do that if we have surplus supplies. However, we currently import 85% of our fuel and much of this is used to generate electricity in this country. We need to ensure that things are done the right way around and in a sustainable way. Deputy Charles Flanagan referred to guidelines. These are not worth the paper on which they are written, particularly as they state that, in general, noise is unlikely to be a significant problem where the distance to the nearest turbine is more than 500 m. The guidelines are not specific in the context of distances. What we need to do is consider local heritage, the landscape and the impact of noise and of the shadow flicker effect of turbines on people. Companies are buying up location rights from farmers at present in a completely underhanded way. Regulations are required in this regard. All we have in place at present is the strategic infrastructure legislation, which large companies will use to sweep the democratic wishes of local councillors, as expressed in local development plans, and those of local communities to one side. We must try to stop this happening. I ask that this matter be revisited. In addition, I am of the view that we should seek, on an all-party basis, to have regulations - not guidelines - similar to those which exist in other countries put in place.

The cost to our economy in this regard is €6 billion per annum. This is despite the fact that we possess undeveloped capacity in the context of indigenous renewable resources which is capable of allowing us to meet our energy needs several times over. If one looks at a map of Ireland, one can see that it is uniquely well situated in the context of being able to generate wind, wave and tidal energy. The crucial aspect of the matter under discussion is the need for community buy-in, especially in the context of wind turbines. In too many instances, outside companies manufacture and erect turbines in particular areas and, with the exception of the small number of farmers from whom land is rented, the majority of host communities see little or no benefit from such projects. This gives rise to animosity. The planning guidelines are being flouted. Wind turbines erected in County Donegal are situated far closer to occupied homes than the guidelines stipulate. It is clear that regulations are required. We need to examine the potential benefits for the State, particularly in the context of employment. In that regard, we must consider introducing a national strategy on renewable energy. At present, all we have in place are a number of objectives and certain targets. What is required is a national strategy which sets out in full the Government's plan for the development of wind energy and the use of natural resources in the short, medium and long term.

The wind energy development guidelines of 2006 provide advice to planning authorities on catering for wind energy through the development plan process. They are also intended to ensure a consistency of approach throughout the country in the identification of suitable locations for wind energy development and in the treatment of the relevant planning applications. To ensure that Ireland continues to meet its renewable energy targets and, at the same time, that wind energy does not have negative impacts on local communities, my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and other stakeholders, is undertaking a targeted review of certain aspects of the wind energy guidelines of 2006. This focused review will examine the manner in which the guidelines address key issues of community concern such as noise, proximity and visual amenity, and any other potential impacts as considered appropriate, as well as considering ways of building community support for wind energy development. The press notice issued on 30 January marks only the initial stage in that review process. In response to Deputy Flanagan, it is essentially a pre-draft consultation intended to inform the preparation of the revised draft guidelines, and I emphasise the word "draft". This early consultation allows for the public and other stakeholders to have an input into the process at the earliest possible stage. The Environmental Protection Agency and Sustainable Energy Ireland will also be consulted. All statutory planning guidelines issue first in draft form for public consultation over a period of a couple of months. Once the consultation period is closed, the submissions received on the draft guidelines are considered and taken into account in the final form of the guidelines. The draft guidelines, like all other new or revised guidelines, will go out for extensive public consultation for a period of six weeks to two months. The publication of those draft guidelines will not take place until the third or fourth quarter of this year, and the extended public consultation I am describing will then take place.

I merely wish to add to my earlier contribution by stressing to him the importance of local consultation at all times. There is cross-party agreement on the benefits of wind energy to this country, and that is of great importance to our economy and our society, but I ask the Minister to confirm that he will ensure a process of consultation that will address the justifiable fears of communities in terms of the impact of the infrastructure on communities and on the landscape.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	166	While I welcome the statement in the Minister's reply that there will be a review, and we appear to have some time to have an input into that, the problem is that we will end up having guidelines. The difficulty is that, while a county development plan has some standing, as a believer in local democracy I feel it should have a stronger standing, particularly when councillors such as those in Laois set out areas that are designated for wind turbines in proper locations. That should be respected. The problem with guidelines is that they will not have statutory weight; they can be overruled. Large companies will come up with arguments to override them, and when we read headlines such as the one I have to hand from a local Laois newspaper, which states that Laois farmers could reap millions from wind turbines, with the article stating that a person could get up to €25,000 per annum for having one of these giant turbines in his or her field, there will be a stampede for wind turbines. I fear that by the end of the year large parts of the midlands will be dotted with turbines; we will have the turbines first and then the planning applications. I wish to highlight that in areas of counties Laois and Offaly, as well as others, there is an urgent need to deal with this issue. We cannot lock the stable door after the horse has bolted. We must take action on it now. It is urgent, and it is important that we put proper guidelines in place such as those proposed by Deputy Penrose and Senator Kelly.

Everybody agrees that wind energy is a good thing, but the expected benefits from renewable energy, including wind energy, will not be achieved unless there is a strategy in which we set out what we intend to achieve and how we intend to achieve it in terms of the financial income to the State, the impact on the host community and the benefits for the host community. We have two ways of doing that. We can set out our stall, work with people and have it done, or we can work against people. I am a strong proponent of bringing people with us and getting them to understand the reason for a development. Otherwise, private companies will come in, short-term jobs will be created, there will be financial gain for a number of landowners, but the wider societal and local community benefits will not accrue unless we set them out and aim to achieve them.

I pointed out in my original response the accurate position regarding draft consultation. If people want to get involved in that consultation in a meaningful and constructive way, I would welcome that, but there is sufficient time during the course of most of this year for that consultation to happen. I have outlined the process accurately, but there is a lot of misinformation surrounding this important matter. The current system, with detailed statutory guidance for planning authorities on wind energy development, provides for a degree of specificity and uniformity across all planning authorities, while also leaving the final decision in the hands of local decision makers. The community and the general public, therefore, will have many opportunities to engage in this process, with the help of their public representatives. The introduction of mandatory minimum distances set out in statute, as has been proposed by some, could effectively prohibit a planning authority from considering wind energy development that may otherwise be acceptable or even desirable from a broad energy policy perspective. We have to have a balance.  The final outcome of the review of the guidelines will be binding on the planning authorities. These are statutory guidelines which I, as Minister, will issue under section 28 of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2012. This provides that planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála must have regard to the guidelines in the performance of their functions and must demonstrate how they have implemented the policies and objectives of the Minister in applying the guidelines in their functional areas. Planning authorities are also required, under section 28, to make copies of the guidelines available for inspection and distribution to members of the public. I hope I have allayed the concerns of the Deputies. The process is very open, and sufficient time will be given to local communities to have their say.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	178	I am sure the Minister is well aware that keeping small institutions open in small villages is becoming a challenge. There is an ideology driving much of government thinking in the developed world, and at its core is the idea that small institutions, services and outlets are only sustainable if they are economically sustainable. The notion that a premises might have a social value, which is generally not a quantifiable commodity, is fading off the radar. We do not value something unless it has monetary value, which is leading us to a point at which we know the price of everything and the value of nothing. There must be an active desire on the part of the State to keep our villages alive. Many of these institutions are interconnected, and when one is closed it threatens those that remain. That false economic philosophy, which fails to take on board the social dividend, must be challenged if we are to avoid turning rural Ireland into a wasteland. The cost of such closures to the people is immeasurable, sowing the seeds of economic failure, unemployment, isolation and social problems too numerous to mention. Duncormick post office in Wexford probably would not even be up for review by An Post but for the fact that it was closed for review, and now An Post is considering not reopening it or allowing a tender process to commence in the village.There is much anger in the village of Duncormick at the idea that it might not have a post office. The nearest post offices are 6.6 km and 7.2 km away. There are many old people in the area who do not have transport of their own and who are literally begging for lifts to get to the post office to carry out any business they may have. I know the Minister is at pains to stress that An Post is a commercial State body and that it must make ends meet, which is understandable. It has more than 1,000 post offices but I suspect it would like fewer. An Post might argue that it would be more economically sustainable if it had fewer units, but given that it is State-owned and the Minister has influence over it, it is important that we do not lose sight of the social value post offices offer these small communities.  We have seen the closure of post offices, Garda stations, small shops, small pubs and small businesses and there is the threatened closure of small schools because there are not enough pupils. It is a dangerous path to go down. The Government needs a strategy. If institutions do not appear to be sustainable and if the figures do not add up, we must help make them more sustainable. Retaining life in these villages is very important.

In my recent reply to a similar question from him, I set out that it is my clear objective that An Post remain a strong and viable State company, providing high-quality services on a nationwide basis through a network of economically viable post offices, and this remains my position. I know this objective is shared on all sides of the House. However, I stress that the company must be, as the Deputy said, in a sustainable and viable financial position to ensure this. I remind the Deputy that An Post is a commercial State company with its own board and management and their strategy and decision-making must be formulated in this context. Furthermore, operational matters are the responsibility of the board and management and I have no statutory function in this area. The Government is a strong supporter of the network through the range of services it provides, which include social welfare payments, State savings and Passport Express. An Post has also been successful in leveraging its retail footprint to provide other services such as banking and insurance, which support continued easy access to those services for local communities. I know the Deputy will join with me in congratulating An Post on winning an arrangement with the Revenue Commissioners to collect the property tax. That will help the revenue position of An Post and it is the kind of new service it can provide better than anybody else, with a network of 1,138 offices throughout the country. I fully understated the Deputy's concern about the viability of rural post offices and the importance of the post office to local communities. It should be noted that An Post is currently facing many challenges not just financially but from the development of communications technologies. Any decisions it may take must be considered in the context of maintaining a sustainable post office network. As shareholder, however, I have a strong concern in terms of the ongoing commercial position of the company and I regularly liaise with it in this regard.  I firmly believe An Post has many strengths. It is a trusted brand, has the largest retail presence in the country and is closely integrated with local communities. I have impressed on the company the need to further exploit its unique position in this regard and have been supportive of its attempts to diversify its income streams and to win a wider range of commercial contracts offering higher margins. I welcome the progress An Post has made towards diversification, including the announcement that following the decision of AIB to close a number of branches, an extended range of AIB services is available through post offices in the locality of the closures. This is beneficial not only to An Post as a commercial body but also to the local communities. My Department and I will maintain ongoing contact with the board and management of the company to work with them on our shared objectives in light of the challenging environment they face.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	180	It is good that post offices are diversifying, and the Minister mentioned the closure of AIB branches. The idea of our State-owned banks, or our pillar banks, providing a personal service is fading fast and we will see more branches closing than opening. There will be even more work for post offices. The post office in question is the last post office in this parish. There were two, but the Cleariestown office closed a couple of years ago. There are three post offices in the neighbouring parish. The local people have organised a public meeting tomorrow night as they are really upset at the idea that they may not have a post office in the future and that there will be no post office in the parish. The post office most people are using now is in Bridgetown, but there are no banking facilities there. Although it is a big loss to a small number of people, because many go to the nearest town to do their banking, it means a lot to people who are immobile and who are not computer-literate. Duncormick post office has an average of 800 transactions per week, which is not a large number, but surely it is enough to make it sustainable. I asked An Post if it would cost money to keep Duncormick post office open but it said it would not. An Post has more than 1,100 post offices and I asked if it wanted fewer than 1,000. The answer I was given was "Probably, yes" but at the same time it has admitted it would not cost it money to keep Duncormick post office open.  I know An Post is a commercial State body with its own board and that it makes its own decisions, but nobody has as much influence and control over it as the Minister. I ask him to look favourably on Duncormick's retaining its post office.

Contractual issues arose there and I understand notices have been posted locally inviting submissions from the local people. An Post has guaranteed me it will take them into account in making whatever decision it eventually arrives at, and that consultation process is quite deliberate. The Deputy and myself are at one in welcoming the diversification that has recently taken place in the post office. More of that needs to happen as its core business has been seriously affected by electronic substitution. It is as simple as that. The volume of letters has been falling. One can call it progress, technology or whatever one wishes but that is the reality of the environment in which An Post is trying to survive. I am sorry that although I gave the Deputy the opportunity to break the news about the collection of the property tax, he did not rise to his feet to welcome it. I thought he would welcome the fact that the facility is being made available. It demonstrates the entrepreneurial instinct of An Post and it is a positive step.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	182	As we all know, the collapse of the building industry and the banking crisis left many unfinished housing developments through the country. The importance of the placement of appropriate insurance or financial bonds with various local authorities became very obvious.In such circumstances the bond can be claimed by the local authority and arrangements put in place for remaining outstanding works and services to be completed by that local authority. In most cases this ensures that roads, lighting, footpaths, water management and so forth are done in accordance with the building regulations and the initial planning permission granted for that development. Last Monday, some members of Kerry County Council were briefed on the progress being made by that local authority on unfinished estates. They were informed that eight bonds had been placed with IBRC. Two had been claimed successfully prior to the recent and sudden liquidation of the bank. The other six now appear to be useless, placed on the list of creditors. I raised a similar situation some weeks ago relating to an estate in Arklow. In that instance, homeowners had been asked by the council to foot the bill in the absence of such a bond. I asked then that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government contact Wicklow County Council, take ownership of the issue and show leadership on it. Subsequently, I discovered that the bond in question is now being pursued through the courts, and rightly so. However, that policy indicates that in the absence of an adequate bond, homeowners may be pursued. The dramatic liquidation of IBRC has had a number of consequences the Government does not appear to have anticipated and planned for effectively. A number of credit unions, for example, had fixed term deposits with the former State-owned bank which might also be lost in the liquidation. Sources within the credit union movement have stated that losses could be as high as €17 million for credit unions across the country. I do not want this burning of credit unions and local authorities to be remembered as the only burning of bondholders that took place. That is the reason I raise this. Rather than me consulting with each local authority throughout the country, does the Minister know how many local authorities have bonds lodged with IBRC? How much money, potentially, will be lost to the local authorities? Did the Government consider the impact of the liquidation on local authorities and credit unions? What steps is the Minister taking to address this situation before it turns into a crisis that cannot be reversed?
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	183	On 7 February last the Oireachtas passed the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Act 2013, appointing joint special liquidators to IBRC with immediate effect to wind up its business and operations. At this early stage of the special liquidation the liquidators are engaged in intensive processes which involve, inter alia, asserting control over the businesses, processes, systems and personnel of IBRC. The issue of development bonds issued by the bank is one of a number of important issues that they must consider in exercising their statutory duties under the Act. In general, development bonds have traditionally been required as conditions of planning permission by local authorities. As a condition of planning permission the developer must provide a bond, set out as a planning condition, which is called upon in the event that the developer does not complete the development in accordance with the plans and particulars, the conditions of planning and relevant codes and regulations. I understand that IBRC had in the past issued such bonds to local authorities in respect of loans outstanding to the institution. Following the enactment of the IBRC Act the special liquidators' primary function is the orderly wind up of IBRC. I am advised development bonds that were previously entered into by IBRC in favour of the various county councils or local authorities remain in place. However, it should be noted that it is likely that any liabilities arising under these arrangements, if called upon, will most likely rank as unsecured claims in the special liquidation. It must be stressed that these bonds are contingent liabilities and will only be called upon where developers breach planning conditions and are not in a position to meet any liability that arises as a result. Any local authority should contact the special liquidators directly in respect of such claims should they arise. Throughout the liquidation process it has been acknowledged that there are, unfortunately, unavoidable costs associated with the recent agreement relating to the promissory notes. The Deputy has identified two categories of possible creditors that may become unsecured creditors through the liquidation process, but the normal Companies Acts priorities will apply in this liquidation process. Amounts owing by IBRC to a range of creditors, including, contractors, trade creditors and other service providers, are unsecured. The proceeds from the disposal of IBRC's assets will be used to repay creditors in accordance with normal Companies Acts priorities. Consequently preferred creditors will be paid first and then the debt which the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, will have purchased from the Central Bank will be paid. If there are proceeds available after repayment in full of the NAMA debt, these proceeds will be applied to remaining unsecured creditors. These costs must be taken in context. We have now rid Ireland of the annual promissory note repayment, reduced the State's cash borrowing requirement by €20 billion over the next ten years, brought the State €1 billion closer to meeting our deficit targets and Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society have been consigned to history. That said, the Government is aware of the difficulties the liquidation may cause for all those parties affected, including the local authorities. It must be highlighted that the key objective of the special liquidators is to maximise the value of IBRC's available assets to meet IBRC's liabilities to its creditors. If the renewal of these development bonds is required to protect, maintain or enhance the value of the loan or development, the special liquidators will consider each case on a individual basis and if the powers afforded to them under the IBRC Act permit them to do so. If the special liquidators are permitted to extend bonds they will consider a range of criteria, including the cost-benefit analysis in respect of each bond and the impact on the value of the loan or development of not renewing the arrangement. Again, it must be stressed that while these are unfortunate consequences of the IBRC liquidation, they must be considered in light of the considerable benefits that have been achieved as part of this arrangement, which represents a major step forward for our financial system. The substantial benefits of this arrangement flow from the exchange of the promissory notes for far more efficient financing from the State's perspective. In real terms, the benefits are considerable when compared with the existing costs associated with the promissory notes.

He also confirmed that the deposits of €17 million of local credit unions throughout the country are unsecured claims. He said that the local authorities should contact the special liquidators of IBRC about any claims they have on their books regarding development estates which remain unfinished. A report on ghost estates found that there are 1,770 unfinished housing developments throughout the country. According to the progress report from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, over 1,100 of these estates are in a serious problematic condition. The residents of these estates need support to ensure that their homes and environment are brought up to the standard laid out in the original planning permission governing those developments. The Minister referred to whether the liquidators choose to do this or that. First, the Government gave the Minister special powers to make payments with regard to IBRC, outside the realm of the special liquidators. The Minister should be conscious of that in the context not only of local authorities and development bonds but also with regard to credit unions, the staff of IBRC and the commitments that were given to them prior to the liquidation and the lack of enforcement of those commitments since the liquidation. I have strayed from the subject of the Topical Issue in that regard, but it is worth mentioning. The Taoiseach also stated that emergency recapitalisation funds are available to make up any shortfall. That was with regard to credit unions. Can the Minister give the same commitment or can he acknowledge that this commitment was given, that it was correct and that the House was properly informed, with regard to development bonds, the credit unions and IBRC staff?This situation will spiral completely out of control. As I said earlier on the Wicklow issue, it became apparent by virtue of the action being taken subsequent to the raising of the issue here that in the event of bonds not being accessed by the local authorities, it is the opinion of the Department that responsibility will lie with homeowners. A great many homeowners will be queuing up to seek clarification. If the Minister of State cannot provide clarity today, I hope it will be forthcoming very shortly.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	185	To suggest this is something new is not honest. It has been well known since the passing of the Act that a number of issues would arise in the special liquidation process. Deputy Barry Cowen has mentioned two: one in connection with credit unions and the other in connection with development levies. The Houses of the Oireachtas have provided powers to the special liquidator to do his job, which is to ensure the orderly winding down of the operations of IBRC in a way that maximises the value of assets worth between €12 billion and €14 billion that still exist within the company. A liquidation process is under way. Deputy Barry Cowen is correct in stating that the creditors in the two categories he mentioned are unsecured, as is well known. I will not comment on any individual case. As I set out in my scripted reply, it is a matter in the first instance for local authorities to make contact with the special liquidator. I will not prejudge the outcome of that process as the issue is worked through. I agree with the Deputy that it would be the irony of ironies were it to transpire that homeowners who purchased homes in these circumstances would have to face the bills where estates are unfinished. The Government will consider this issue, particularly through the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, which has a special relationship with local authorities. The first task of the IBRC special liquidator is to resolve the issue. The Deputy is correct to say that some credit unions could be caught by this, but many credit unions had the foresight to get out of this situation. There may be red faces due to timing or a failure to exit the bank well in advance given the fact that other institutions determined that they should do so. This is a normal liquidation and we should not automatically conclude from Deputy Cowen's remarks that people will be hung out to dry financially. We are aware of the circumstances and will work through the issue with other Departments as we see fit.
#KevinHumphreys	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-party	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-dob	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	186	I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, for taking the debate. The Minister of State may know that I have been raising this issue for some time through parliamentary questions and questions to the NTMA and the Governor of the Central Bank. It is a very important issue. In 2010 and 2011, the European Central Bank, ECB, and national central banks purchased almost €20 billion of Irish sovereign bonds in the secondary market through the secured market programme. At that time, the bonds were trading well below par. When Ireland redeems and pays out on the bonds as they fall due, the ECB will make substantial profits on the capital portion and further profits on the interest or coupon we pay out each year. Currently, profits are shared out proportionately among eurozone national central banks according to their share of the ECB capital base or on the basis of GDP and population. We should seek the return of these profits, which I estimate at between €3 billion and €5 billion. Those figures have not been contradicted by the Central Bank or the NTMA. Of that €3 billion, Germany would get the greatest share, equal to 19% of the total, or €600 million; France would get 14%, or €420 million; and Ireland would make a profit on its own bonds equivalent to 1% of the total, or €30 million. Greece has been given a deal worth more than €7 billion and we should seek the same. Just last week, the ECB released the figures on its SMP holdings showing that €14.2 billion is currently held. The figure excludes the holdings of other national and central banks on our bonds. I ask the Minister of State to look at this as part of the strategic and tactical negotiations on reducing our national debt. The Minister should start to negotiate this reduction.
#DominicHannigan	unknown-#DominicHannigan-party	unknown-#DominicHannigan-dob	unknown-#DominicHannigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	187	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important topic. In November, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and other eurozone finance Ministers agreed a deal for Greece that has not yet been made available to any other country. The special deal is that the interest and capital earned on the ECB purchase of Greek bonds will be returned to Greece. This represents €500 million for the Greek economy in 2013 alone, and the money will continue to be paid for the next five years. I understand that if a similar deal was extended to Ireland, it would represent approximately €500 million per year. Over five years, this would be about €2.5 billion. If we could renegotiate a similar deal for Ireland, we would be in a better position to address the hole in our budget. Over the next two years, we would have an additional €1 billion to play with in the Exchequer. I stress the need to go to Europe to make the case that we want something similar to the deal the Greek Government got. I ask the Minister of State to ensure that he and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, make a case for Ireland to get a similar deal from the ECB.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	188	I thank the Deputies for raising the matter and note their interest over many months in pursuing this issue with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan. What the Government is seeking to achieve with its European partners to underpin Ireland's exit from the programme is complex and is not simply a matter of requesting the same policy tools as have applied in the case of Greece. We should recall that serious budgetary and economic problems led to Greece's requiring urgent financial assistance in early 2010 and additional measures since. Despite the assistance provided in 2010 and the further assistance provided later, Greece's problems remained and its financial position continued to give cause for significant concern. Thus, in late 2012 a range of additional measures were agreed at EU level which were designed to help Greece to meet its commitments under its programme of financial assistance. It is worth noting that the measures taken were unique and particular to the very grave situation that obtained in Greece. It is also important to note that these actions were taken with significant additional conditionality, which I can refer to later and which we would not wish to be applied in our case. The measures agreed in respect of Greece included a debt buyback of bonds held by private investors - what was called private-sector involvement; a reduction of 100 basis points in the interest rate margin on the Greek loan facility, bringing it to 50 basis points; a cancellation of the guarantee commitment fee on EFSF loans; an extension of the maximum maturities of the loan to Greece by 15 years to 30 years, which is a measure we are working on following our communiqué to ECOFIN and the eurozone in January 2013; the deferral of interest payments on EFSF loans for ten years; and an agreement that member states will pass on to Greece's segregated account an amount equivalent to the income on the securities market programme portfolio accruing to their national central banks from budget year 2013. This last measure is a transfer from the relevant member states, not the ECB.On the question of the amount of money involved, while a figure for the profits made by the European Central Bank, ECB, on its holding of Irish Government bonds is not available, it published information on its holdings of bonds under its securities market programme on Thursday, 21 February 2013. This showed the ECB held €14.2 billion nominal value of Irish bonds on 31 December 2012, with an average remaining maturity of 4.6 years. The package of measures for Greece agreed late last year by eurozone Finance Ministers was designed to help put the Greek economy on the road to recovery. The package was agreed in the context of the statement by euro area Heads of Government that the scale of the Greek problem is so large that it requires special attention. It is important to note again that the concessions that have been agreed are specific to Greece and are accompanied by significant additional conditionality. It must be acknowledged Ireland is in a very different situation to Greece. Our programme is working. We have completed over 190 agreed targets and have surpassed many including our annual deficit targets. Growth has returned to the economy and I particularly welcome yesterday's figures showing positive employment growth. Furthermore, as a country exiting a programme, our situation cannot be seen as comparable to Greece. We are, however, examining the Greek package to see if aspects of it offer any possible benefit to Ireland, particularly for our exit. We have had positive news recently. The elimination of the promissory notes and Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, the sale of the Bank of Ireland CoCos, contingent convertible capital notes, the recent sale of Irish Life, and just this week, the announcement of the end of the bank guarantee are all significant milestones on the way to our recovery. We still, however, have very important and necessary decisions to take, as evidenced by the recent agreement on public sector pay. Ireland is a country very different from Greece. We must also recall the benefits we have already received, notably assistance in the form of reduction of interest rates and extended maturities. In addition, the Heads of Government statement of June last year on breaking the link between banks and sovereigns made explicit reference to supporting Ireland's well-performing adjustment programme. It is important to remember Ireland is exiting a programme. We should have regard to what we need to assist that exit rather than focus solely on measures provided for a country in very different circumstances.

I did point out that the ECB did publish its holdings of Irish Government bonds of €14.2 billion in the securities market programme. What is not clear is what other member states' central banks hold. I maintain it is approximately €20 billion. I accept we are not Greece. We certainly do not get the weather it gets. I am not referring to a write-down or an interest holiday but to the profits on Irish debt of which each eurozone country will receive a share unless we are given a similar package to that of Greece. There is an opening to negotiate this. We need to build on the deal Greece got recently. It would make significant savings of €3 billion, the equivalent of what would be raised if we sold off some State agencies. Such savings would make a substantial difference to our debt profile and help us speedily recover economically.

He once said one of the few good things to come out of Greece was feta cheese. I believe this deal the Greeks got with the ECB was also something good that came out of Greece. Notwithstanding the fact we are in a different programme, did a deal on the promissory notes, closed down IBRC and have had other successes over the past few days, this deal requires further action on our part. I expect the Minister to make the case to Brussels for Ireland to get the same deal the Greeks got.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	191	The adjustment this year for our budget is €3.5 billion. The equivalent adjustment in Greece is about €9 billion, despite the write-down it has already obtained. This is Greece's third run at this. On the other arrangements put in place by the Eurogroup, there was significant private and public sector involvement. We have always said we will examine all the options and continue to negotiate the package that best suits Ireland's needs. Some of the issues extended to Greece, particularly on the extension of maturities on the EFSF, European financial stability facility, and ESM, European Stability Mechanism, moneys, are being examined by the European Commission to see if they might fit into Ireland's circumstances. We are, however, in a different position to Greece. It is accepted internationally that Greece will be in the accident and emergency ward for a long time. We are not like that. We will be out of this programme because of the decisions the Deputies and other colleagues have supported this Government in taking over the past two years. It is important that we continue to look at the range of options that are there. The tools that apply to Greece may not automatically apply to Ireland. We are always open to looking if they can be fitted to the particular circumstances in the Irish case. This is an evolving negotiation with the end of it when the troika leaves and we are back on our feet. We are confident we can get there but we will continue to look at all of the options available. It is not honest, however, to claim the Irish debt profile, economic experience and banking position is in any way comparable to the situation that applies in Greece.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	192	As I have stated in recent days, it is important to note that some aspects of the promissory note deal are yet to be finalised. For example, the liquidator is in the process of overseeing a valuation and sales process for the assets of IBRC, while the final payments made under the eligible liabilities guarantee, ELG, scheme have not yet been determined. Nevertheless, simulations run by my Department estimate that the general Government deficit will improve by approximately €1 billion per annum over the coming years which will bring us €1 billion closer to attaining our 3% deficit target by 2015. However, this has to be seen in light of the estimated general Government deficits of €8.9 billion and €5.3 billion in 2014 and 2015 respectively, as per budget 2013. While this agreement is a significant step forward in restoring sustainability to our public finances, the Government is well aware there remains a considerable gap between what we get in revenue and what we spend. This situation is not sustainable over the longer term. In addition to the requirements to bring our deficit to under 3% of gross domestic product by 2015 as per the excessive deficit procedure, EDP, it makes sense that we bring balance back to the public finances and stabilise and reduce our debt burden. As we are only two months into the year, I will not be drawn into speculation on the composition of the next budget and the impact this deal will have on it. There are many other moving parts to be considered such as economic growth, tax take and expenditure performance. All of the above, including the impact of the promissory note deal, will form the basis of the Government's decisions regarding the budget. Assessing the impact of the promissory note agreement on future budgetary adjustments, in isolation from other developments since the time of budget 2013, would not be a constructive or informative exercise. The State has experienced a number of significant developments since the publication of the budget including the sale of contingent capital notes in Bank of Ireland, the sale of Irish Life which represented the first time during the crisis that a company in which we have invested has been returned fully to private ownership, and the encouraging tax revenue performance in December 2012.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 Irrespective of the above, I am sure the Deputy is well aware that the Government recognises that improving labour market conditions represents its most important challenge and, accordingly, is giving priority to job protection, job creation and supporting the unemployed. In this regard, the Minister for Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation recently published the 2013 Action Plan on Jobs, which seeks to address this important challenge. Further, I draw the Deputy’s attention to yesterdays QNHS release. Yesterday’s figures are encouraging, with employment increasing over the year for the first time since Q2 2008 and unemployment maintaining its downward trajectory, and give further weight to the consensus that Ireland’s labour market has now bottomed-out. While caution must always be taken in reading too much into the quarterly figures, the broad trend is positive.

As he knows, I welcomed the benefits from the promissory note deal. As he acknowledged in his reply, the projections are that it will result in savings of €1 billion on the general Government deficit. I did not expect him today to indicate the planned €3.1 billion adjustment for 2014 would be now €2.1 billion. I also accept there are variables with economic growth, taxation receipts and spending in line with the budget.However, the Minister for Finance can give an indication that it is his belief that the benefits from that deal will have an impact on the budget. The Labour Party Ministers have been running around the place telling everyone who will listen that the deal will have an impact on the budget for next year but the Minister for Finance is not saying the same thing. I am simply asking whether it will have an impact on the budget. My view is that we should be using the benefits, all other things being equal, to reduce the adjustment for 2014 and to invest additional money in job creation initiatives. That is the Fianna Fáil position. I am asking whether the Minister has a position and whether he believes it will have an impact on the budget.

After two years of very hard work we are getting the economy back into a position where it is growing again and where many of the indicators are pointed in a positive direction. It is only February. Over the years Ministers for Finance have not speculated about the budget, even within two months of it. To ask me to speculate about what provisions may be in the budget in February when there will be no budget until October at the earliest, in line with the two-pack, is not a reasonable request. Anyway, the position has improved and the deal on the promissory note has brought about a situation where, all other things being equal, tax increases and public expenditure totalling up to €1 billion will not be required to be made as part of the adjustments necessary to get to the 3% target by 2015. Let us consider the recently negotiated wage agreement. There is €1 billion in that but it has not been put to the members yet. There are many moving parts.

The Government could state that it believes the benefits of the deal should be extended to the public, that there should be a dividend to people and that people should be given some form of relief. The Minister is saying he cannot speculate and I realise that is the traditional position of Ministers for Finance. However, other colleagues in government have been categoric in stating that the deal will have an impact on the budget next year and that people will feel the difference. I have a duty as an Opposition spokesperson to put that question, albeit many months before the budget. At a minimum the House can give an indication that this deal is valuable and that it will result in a difference in the budget for next year. That is the question I am putting forward.

Obviously, if it improves the situation by €1 billion between now and 2015 then unless something disastrous happens the public will see the benefit of that improvement over the course of the budgets. Deputy McGrath is going down the road which got his party into trouble previously. As soon as they see a little money they want to go out and promise the people suddenly that they will spend it, that they will be back, that they will have a lash and that the nice people of Fianna Fáil will spend money and get people back to work.

At the same time, the Government must ensure that the day-to-day running of these institutions has regard to competition, market conditions and the need to develop stable commercial enterprises to meet the long-term credit needs of households and businesses. The Deputy will be aware that the relationship framework with the bank provides that the State will not intervene in the day-to-day operations of the bank or its management decisions. The frameworks are published on the Department of Finance website. I must ensure that the bank is run on a commercial, cost-effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the bank as an asset to the State, as per the memorandum on economic and financial policies agreed with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF. Neither the Central Bank nor the Department of Finance has a statutory function in respect of interest rate decisions made by individual lending institutions at any particular time. I understand that Allied Irish Banks has not yet announced any increase to the standard variable rate. AIB last increased the standard variable rate in November and that increase brought the rate to 4%, lower than most of the other financial institutions. For example, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB have rates of 4.35% and 4.34% respectively. To fund mortgages the bank must borrow at wholesale rates, which are currently higher than the ECB base rate. The bank must ensure that the rate it lends at is economically sustainable and provides a return for the bank and, ultimately, the State as its shareholder. I understand that the Central Bank pays attention to the effect of any increases in the standard variable rate on mortgage arrears and it would no doubt be concerned if banks were exacerbating their arrears problem and as such impairing their ongoing feasibility by such actions.

We have already seen the start of the water charges legislation in the House. It was stated earlier in the House that €30 billion of austerity measures have been imposed on the people. Yet perhaps the greatest crisis we are in the middle of - a singular crisis which the Government has not acknowledged - is the crisis of those with mortgages in distress or default. I cannot say it often enough: one in four people are in mortgage distress and 115 additional people fall into that category every day. The Minister stated that setting rates was a commercial matter for the institution and I understand that. However, it has always been a commercial matter for the institutions but that has not stopped the Minister for Finance, his colleagues and the Taoiseach in the past from banging their fists on the table and demanding that the banks deal with interest rates. That was immediately after they got into government. Why is there a different approach now? AIB, while not announcing a rate change, has signalled that it plans to increase the rate. Let us be clear: this bank got billions of euro of Irish taxpayers' money. If AIB increases the variable interest rate by 0.25%, it will be the highest lender in the market in terms of interest charged. It is a bank that has increased its interest rate twice in the last quarter of 2012, with two increases of 0.25%. The bank is turning the screw on ordinary people, who are concerned about being unable to pay their mortgages at this stage.

The Deputy would not thank me if I were the type of Minister who would interfere with private commercial decisions of the banks or try to use any leverage as the Minister for Finance to influence the banks one way or another on behalf of particular clients. We cannot run a country in that way. We have seen examples of that previously and in other countries and we are not going there. What I want to do with the banks is continue to make them profitable. The decision taken this week to abolish the bank guarantee means that the banks will no longer have to pay the levy they were required to pay for the use of the guarantee and that will increase their profitability by approximately €1 billion throughout the sector. That will put the banks in a better position to give a better service to people. However, decisions on how the banks apply their new-found profitability is a matter for them. AIB is at the lower end of mortgage lending. It was well off the pace previously and was losing money on practically every mortgage it wrote.

All it has to do is increase its rates by 30 basis points and it will be the highest. The Minister for Finance owns this bank on behalf of the Irish people. He says it would be wrong to interfere because that is not the way to run the country but he called the banks into Government Buildings. His Deputies were banging their fists and telling the media they were going to insist on the banks passing on interest rate decreases. In fairness to the banks, they complied. What was good then is good now. It is unpalatable for the tens of thousands of people who are in mortgage distress with AIB or are just about surviving that the Minister will sit idly by while a bank which received €21 billion of the money they have foregone in taxes over the past six years charges the highest interest rates in the market. He should use his influence because it will be disastrous for the economy if AIB is allowed to increase its rates given that we already face an unprecedented crisis with mortgages.

If the Deputy is advocating a regime of banking in Ireland in which politicians, whether in or out of office, can influence commercial decisions by banks, he is going straight back to the days we have just left, when a telephone call to certain people would get a loan.

The figures were estimates from the Revenue tax forecasting model using actual data for the year 2009, adjusted as necessary for estimated income and employment trends in the interim. Figures of cash receipts are subject to timing arrangements and can also be distorted by cash flow adjustments. The incomes and tax values as calculated by the model cannot, therefore, be revised or updated by reference to actual revenue outcomes for years 2011 or 2012. For ease of reference, the information I provided for 2012 in my reply of 3 October last will be set out in the Official Report.-

The numbers of income earners shown in the table counts a married couple who have elected or have been deemed to have elected for joint assessment as one tax unit, although USC and PRSI are individualised charges, and as such the yield is calculated on the basis of individual incomes. The basic data underlying the figures of tax and incomes provided in this form for 2012 were compiled as part of the preparations for budget 2013. Corresponding data for 2011 were not prepared as they would have been less relevant for budgetary considerations and equally demanding on resources. For that reason, figures are not readily available for 2011 on the same basis and could not be collated in the time available for this reply due to the significant data processing work involved. This is a matter which the Deputy needs to study. It is not something on which I can supply further information across the House.

 The figures are estimates from the Revenue tax forecasting model using actual data for the year 2009 adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends in the interim. These are, therefore, provisional and likely to be revised. It should be noted that the income ranges shown in the above tables relate to gross income as defined in a Revenue statistical report for 2010. It should also be noted that a married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit. Furthermore, the estimated earnings of public servants are not separately identifiable in the figures projected for 2011 and 2012. The latest relevant sector-based information available on income earners in the tax system is derived from income tax returns filed for the income tax year 2010 and represents about 95% of all returns expected at the time the data were compiled for analytical purposes. The data relating to the public sector include individuals in receipt of various forms of income from public sources that would not normally be regarded as constituting employment within the public service, for example, those receiving fees or those on State boards. On the basis of the available tax based data, it is not possible to identify and exclude income from public sources to groups that would not normally be regarded as employed within the public service or to distinguish the earnings of employees associated with typical work patterns. Accordingly, it is likely that the number of public servants from this source is overstated. On that basis, the total numbers of public sector employees, and the breakdown of those numbers by income ranges, is set out as follows:

We know from previous replies that the 10,000 highest earners have astronomical incomes. The figure is approximately €595,000 per individual. Even after the effective tax rate and PRSI are taken into account, they have incomes of in excess of €300,000. These are astronomical figures compared to the average industrial wage or social welfare rates. Is it not fair to ask these individuals to make an additional contribution to the Exchequer? Should they not give up at least another €1 billion in tax and PRSI? They would still be very wealthy, with average incomes of approximately €264,000. Is it not reasonable for these individuals to pay a higher rate of tax on a fair basis?

Everybody will pay that amount. Beyond that figure, the rates of taxation are very progressive. Under the new deal, senior civil servants have been hit hard by the wage reduction. With everything thrown in, their marginal rate of tax is 61% or 61.5%. Obviously people who earn higher incomes have more take home pay but the levels of taxation are quite progressive.

I suggest that, at a time when we are abolishing mobility payments, taking €350 million per year from low paid public sector workers, abolishing exceptional needs payments for needy families and imposing a property tax on households in negative equity or mortgage arrears, individuals on these levels of income should be made to pay their fair share in order to make a reasonable contribution. They are well able to contribute another €1 billion to the Exchequer while remaining very wealthy.

We are in a common travel zone and can move to and live in any of the 27 member states of the European Union. If we tax people too high we do not want a situation in which everybody who is wealthy leaves the country because we want the wealthy people to invest and be productive in terms of providing jobs for other people. A balance must be found but they pay their fair share. The top couple of per cent of wage earners contribute some 20% of all taxes.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	219	In designing the local property tax, the interdepartmental expert group chaired by Dr. Don Thornhill, the Thornhill group, had due regard to issues such as ability to pay and considered the provision of waivers or deferrals for households unable to pay the tax or where a payment requirement would cause hardship. For individuals on low incomes or those whose only income source is from the Department of Social Protection, the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 provides for the possibility of deferring the local property tax, LPT, charge in certain cases. To qualify for a deferral, the residential property must be occupied as a sole or main residence. The income thresholds for a full deferral will be €15,000 for a single person and €25,000 for a couple, whether married persons, civil partners or cohabitants. A person may claim a deferral if their income will not “as can reasonably be foreseen at the liability date” exceed these thresholds in that year. An increased income threshold applies in the case of properties occupied as a sole or main residence and subject to a mortgage. In such cases, the gross income thresholds may be increased by 80% of the mortgage interest payments. A deferral option in qualifying cases in this regard will apply until the end of 2017 and will assist individuals currently in mortgage distress. A deferral of up to 50% of the LPT liability will be possible where the gross income of the liable person does not exceed €25,000 for a single person or €35,000 for married persons, civil partners or cohabitants. A deferral of 50% of the LPT will also be available where gross income does not exceed the above thresholds, that is €25,000 single, €35,000 couple, as increased by 80% of the gross mortgage interest payments that a liable person expects to make by the end of the year for which the gross income is being estimated. This type of deferral will also be available until 31 December 2017.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 Where a liable person no longer satisfies the necessary conditions, amounts deferred prior to the date on which eligibility ceased may continue to be deferred. Interest of circa 4% per annum will apply to any amounts deferred. The deferred amount, including interest, will attach to the property and will have to be paid before the property is sold or transferred. The thresholds were based on the recommendations of the Thornhill group. The Government accepted the income thresholds for a full deferral and adapted the income thresholds for a partial deferral so that they are €10,000 rather than €5,000 above the thresholds for a full deferral. To determine whether deferral applies for 2013, a person is required to estimate on 1 May 2013 what his or her total gross income for 2013 will be. Gross income from all sources consists of total income before any deductions, allowances or reliefs that may be taken off for income tax purposes and includes income that is exempt from income tax and income from the Department of Social Protection but excludes child benefit.  I appreciate that some property owners may find themselves unable to pay local property tax but do not qualify for a deferral under the existing legislation. For this reason, the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2013 provides that a person who has entered into an insolvency arrangement under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 may apply for deferral of the LPT that is due during the period for which the insolvency arrangement is in effect. The 2013 Bill also provides that a person who suffers both an unexpected and unavoidable significant financial loss or expense, as a result of which he or she is unable to pay their LPT without causing financial hardship, may apply for full or partial deferral. Claims for this type of deferral will require full disclosure of the person’s financial circumstances, supporting documentation and any other information required by Revenue. Following an examination of the information provided, Revenue will determine whether deferral should be granted. The detail of how this type of deferral will operate and the criteria that will be used to determine eligibility will be set out in guidelines due to be published by the Revenue Commissioners shortly. Details of the deferral arrangements are available on Revenue’s website www.revenue.ie, where the commissioners have recently published a useful guide to local property tax. This will be revised to take account of the provisions in the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2013. It should be noted, however, that the provisions contained in the 2013 Bill are subject to its enactment.

We will have a fuller debate on this issue tomorrow when the legislation comes before the House, but today I want to focus on the issue of ability to pay. The Government's efforts to take ability to pay into account are woefully inadequate. For example, a family earning anything more than €480 per week gross - before tax and other deductions - is not entitled to defer the property tax. A family with three or four children will probably spend between €200 and €250 per week on groceries alone, before it pays any other bills such as gas, electricity, school costs and so forth. That family does not have a bob to spare; it is broke. That family will not be able to afford this tax. If a family cannot pay the tax but the pay amount is in excess of €480 a week, a penal interest rate of 8% per annum will be applied to the debt. We will have the debate tomorrow, but the issue of ability to pay this tax must be readdressed.

Essentially, it provides that somebody entering an insolvency arrangement may be entitled to a deferral, even if that person's income is in excess of the limit. A gross amount of €480 per week for a family with children is a very small amount of money. Half of it alone is spent on groceries and the rest is quickly accounted for by the payment of essential household bills. The Minister set the thresholds far too low. People on that level of income are absolutely broke. They do not have a bob and they will not be able to afford to pay this property tax. If the Minister is to revisit any aspect of the tax - he appears to be not for turning on the fundamental issue - I ask him to look at the issue of the thresholds that will allow people a deferral. This will not mean the tax will not be paid. It will be paid eventually. The current threshold figures are miserly.

As the Deputies will be aware, the European Council in October 2012 reaffirmed that the “the Eurogroup will draw up the exact operational criteria that will guide direct bank recapitalisations by the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, in full respect of the 29 June 2012 euro area Summit statement. It is imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns.” The Taoiseach and Chancellor Merkel spoke together following the October 2012 European Council and discussed the unique circumstances behind Ireland’s banking and sovereign debt crisis and Ireland’s plans for a full return to the markets. They reaffirmed the commitment from 29 June to task the Eurogroup to examine the situation of the Irish financial sector with a view to improving further the sustainability of the well-performing adjustment programme. They recognised, in this context, that Ireland is a special case and that the Eurogroup will take that into account.  While the State’s successful disposal of the Bank of Ireland contingent capital notes earlier this year is further evidence of investors’ confidence in Ireland and demonstrates that there is a market appetite for Irish assets, the Government is still heavily involved in drawing up the operational criteria that will guide direct bank recapitalisations by the European Stability Mechanism in full respect of the 29 June 2012 euro area summit statement. In this regard, the European Council stated on 14 December 2012 that “once an effective Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) is established, the ESM will be able to recapitalise banks directly. An agreement on the operational framework supporting this possibility, including the definition of legacy assets, should be agreed as soon as possible in the first semester of 2013”. Ireland continues to be fully engaged in this process within the Eurogroup and among Heads of State and Government. Furthermore, officials from my Department also attend technical meetings with the ESM and other member states. Discussions remain ongoing in regard to this issue and no conclusion has been reached. Notwithstanding these discussions, the Government will also continue to explore any market opportunities for our remaining banking assets to get a return of any of the sums used to bail out the banks.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	233	In the round, this issue deals with approximately half of the money that went into the banks, approximately €30 billion between the two pillar banks and Permanent TSB. What is the Government's objective with regard to the negotiations that are under way? Obviously, the ESM does not have any track record in holding shares in banks. A key issue in this regard will be the basis for valuation. The National Pensions Reserve Fund puts a figure of approximately €9 billion on our holdings in the banks. What does the Minister seek to achieve in this regard? Does he seek to get back as much as possible of the €30 billion invested in those banks? Is he of a mind to dispose of our stakes in those banks at the right price to the ESM, if the opportunity arises?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	234	The Government's objective is to try to have some of the money invested in the pillar banks when they were recapitalised in March 2011 credited once more to the taxpayer. The debate on the mechanism to be used for that purpose is still open.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	235	While I appreciate the Minister's difficulty, he is trying to ride two horses and keep both options open. He seems to be rowing back on last June's commitment, or at least the commitment given to the people by certain Ministers on the public airwaves at the time. I refer to the idea that we would get back the money pumped into the pillar banks and that it would be fully retrospective. It now seems less likely that we will get back that money on the scale suggested. A clear question arises in this context. When the banks appeared before the committee, they stated they were looking for investors. Are we going to sell to the investors at the market rate which the NTMA has calculated to be approximately €9 billion? There is also some contingent capital which could increase the €9 billion figure. The value of the shares could increase. Alternatively, are we going to hold out on the basis of having the 29 June commitment met in full? In other words, are we going to proceed on the basis that the ESM will recapitalise the banks as they require retrospectively? It is a question of what the Government intends to do. If a proposal comes from the private sector and is identified by the Department and the Central Bank as genuinely meeting the current market value of AIB and Bank of Ireland, will the Government decide to sell or will it decide to hold out to see whether progress can be made with the ESM on getting a value for the recapitalisation based on historic or possibly future value?

We succeeded in one serious renegotiation and I believe we will succeed in this also, but it will take time. We need to remember the conditionality. There will be no recapitalisation through the ESM until the single supervisory mechanism is in place and functioning. That will take us into 2014. There is a long lead-in time.

I could have started to recite X, Y or Z, but I did not do so. I do not expect the Minister to reveal his negotiating strategy. If he is telling us it is a question of a negotiating strategy, he must intend to go down the road of ESM recapitalisation. If it is not a question of a negotiating strategy, he must be open to the idea of private investors buying shares in the banks at a fair value. That would involve giving up on the ESM idea. If the ESM approach works out, it will not happen before 2014. If private investors make an offer today on the basis of the fair market value of the banks, will the Minister be minded to dispose of the State's assets in these banks, or will he be minded to wait until the ESM proposals unfold in 2014? That is a fair and honest question. It does not suggest I am wishing disaster on the economy or failure on the Minister. I am not impressed by this nonsense.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	244	It is a fair question, to which I will give a fair answer. In the first week of January we sold the contingent capital notes - the CoCos - in Bank of Ireland. We achieved fair value because we got back the €1 billion the taxpayer had put in and we got a little bit with it - €40 million or €50 million. That was good. If similar circumstances allowed me to sell either the other CoCos in AIB and PTSB or the preference shares, the sale of which is more problematic for other reasons, while getting back what the taxpayer had put in, I would sell them. I have made this publicly known in the markets and investors know it. They are available at a price but not below par value. I am not disposed to putting the equity in AIB and PTSB and the 15% stake in Bank of Ireland on the market now because I do not think we would achieve full value. As I said in reply to a separate question, I want to build up values in the banks. We are taking away the guarantee away and building up their values and cutting their cost bases. What the State holds is becoming more valuable. The primary purpose of the approach we are pursuing is to have normal and well performing banks that will provide credit lines for the economy. It is not essentially driven by a desire to enhance value. The enhancement of value is a consequence of the actions I am taking. What is going on in Europe is the biggest project that has been undertaken since the currency was established. A single supervisory mechanism is being put in place. The resolution legislation will govern how Europe deals with banks that become insolvent. It will set out the interventions, bail-ins and bailouts which are appropriate and deal with whether shareholders and others should be burned. We have to consider how to protect depositors and provide for a pan-European insurance system. Three pieces of work have to be done initially. The ESM will be empowered to recapitalise banks directly, while at the same time fulfilling its primary function - to react as the only fund for intervention, like the funds used to bail out Ireland and Portugal. There is a huge piece of work to be done. We are moving it forward through the Irish Presidency as quickly as we can. I do not think we will have a fully functioning supervisory mechanism until 2014, after which this debate will harden. I do not want to get to a position so far away that I cannot predict the moves. I want to make sure I am positioned correctly to get the best possible deal for the taxpayer.

When the Minister spoke about the amount of money he would like to get back, he referred to the recapitalisation that took place in March 2011 that followed the prudential capital assessment review. I assume all of the money put in, even before March 2011, is in the pot and on the table for negotiation through the ESM. Perhaps the Minister might clarify this. I would also like to ask a question about the basis for valuation. If we take it that the banks are worth €8 billion or €9 billion now - the IMF has spoken about potentially getting €20 billion back - is the Minister's hope and the Government's objective essentially that the ESM will pay more than they are worth at market rates? If not, it might not be in our best interests to sell to the ESM.

There is an Irish issue and there is an Irish responsibility also. I do not think the European authorities are going to exonerate us from all responsibility. The pretence that all of this was imposed on us from the outside is nonsense. People in Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society borrowed money at a very low cost on the interbank market and gave it out to builders and developers who took extraordinary risks because they were motivated by greed for their own enrichment. Unfortunately, as they are our fellow citizens, we end up with all taxpayers of the country sharing because of what they did. There is culpability attaching to certain people in Ireland. That is the pushback I will be seeking in the negotiations.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	249	As the Deputy is aware, the Government is conscious of the significant difficulties some homeowners are facing in meeting their mortgage obligations. It is committed to advancing appropriate measures to assist those mortgage holders who are experiencing real and genuine difficulty. A special Government sub-committee is already in place since March of last year to address the mortgage arrears problem. This sub-committee, which is chaired by an Taoiseach and includes all other relevant Ministers, reflects the need for accelerated progress in this area. The Government’s strategy to assist those in mortgage difficulty is built around measures in four distinct areas - personal insolvency, a mortgage advisory service, the mortgage-to-rent scheme and engagement with the banks - and considerable progress has now been achieved across this agenda. The Keane report indicated that, given the recourse nature of mortgages, personal insolvency reform and, in particular, the introduction of new and more accessible insolvency resolution frameworks were essential for resolution of the mortgage arrears problem. The Personal Insolvency Act is now law and the introduction of this Act should be a catalyst to incentivise banks to reach an agreed solution with individual borrowers in resolving mortgage arrears cases. With regard to the mortgage advisory service, an extensive independent mortgage advice framework has been established by the Minister for Social Protection, comprising an enhanced website, a mortgage arrears information helpline and the provision of free, independent one-to-one professional advice to borrowers when considering a long-term forbearance or resolution offer from their lender. In addition, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning has put the mortgage-to-rent scheme on a nationwide basis. Protecting the homes of the most distressed mortgage holders through a mortgage-to-rent scheme, under which ownership of the house passes to an approved housing body, is a key housing support for those with distressed mortgages. The existing owner then becomes a social housing tenant. This option is now available in appropriate cases and will be of benefit to low-income families whose mortgage situations are unsustainable, allowing such families to remain in their homes.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 The Central Bank, under its mortgage arrears resolution strategies project, MARS, has for some time been intensively working with lenders to ensure they can offer a range of longer-term options to their customers who are experiencing mortgage difficulty. These can include trade-down mortgages, split mortgages and sale by agreement, or other appropriate options as may be developed by lenders. It is important that banks have the capacity to implement these in an effective manner. While progress in this area has not been as rapid as desired, it is true to say that greater effort and resources are now being deployed across the banks on this issue and real engagement on resolution options should now be further enhanced. In this regard, the Governor of the Central Bank has very recently said that the Central Bank will shortly be setting out targets for effectiveness in achieving lasting solutions and is focusing in 2013 on the implementation of MARS by lenders. In addition to the above measures, the Central Bank's code of conduct on mortgage arrears remains a key framework governing the relationship between mortgage holders experiencing difficulties and their banks, and it offers very worthwhile protections for distressed households. The code provides that each bank must establish a formal mortgage arrears resolution process to deal with its mortgage customers who are in arrears or pre-arrears and establish dedicated arrears support units and appeals processes to handle such cases. The Central Bank has commenced a review of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, which will involve a public consultation process, to take account of recent developments such as the new personal insolvency legislation.  The Government is committed to building on the progress made and is further intensifying its efforts to address the mortgage arrears problem. In that context, we are proceeding on the basis of the recommendations of the Keane report. Ultimately, however, the Government is of the view that it is the regeneration of the economy, the restoration of employment levels and income growth that will provide the real social and economic improvements that will be required. That is why the Government is focused through its many new initiatives on fostering and generating economic growth. The successful achievement of this objective will restore consumer confidence and bring the tangible and sustainable recovery the country requires.

Perhaps 99% of the restructuring arrangements that have been made use those traditional methods. However, to achieve more innovative solutions, such as split mortgages or mortgage-to-rent arrangements, is more difficult. Only 12 split mortgage arrangements have been established and two mortgage-to-rent transactions actually completed. To achieve such restructuring, including shared equity and so forth, is virtually impossible - it is like pulling teeth from the banks. I deal with a lot of cases and my experience has been that while people will obtain straightforward restructuring, they will not get the less traditional solutions over the line. The Minister will have to do something to ensure there is action on establishing proper long-term restructuring solutions so that people can try to work their way out of their difficulties.

The Central Bank is driving this through the deputy governor and the Financial Regulator, Mr. Matthew Elderfield. A schedule has been drawn up for each of the banks and the banks are co-operating. They have also trained many staff in the banks to deal specifically with this and to engage with customers. I met the three main banks this morning. They seem to be making some progress, although I would like them to make more progress. There is no agreement about the statistics. One of the banks showed me statistics this morning that said it had made 46 restructuring arrangements of a certain type, rather than 12 - mind you, 46 does not make a lot of difference either. The banks are now talking about 1,500 a month - that kind of pace. They are moving it on. It is one of the main priorities of the Government this year to make sure this is sorted out. I agree with the Deputy. More focused arrangements must be made by the banks and they have to be ready to make these arrangements.

It was a crisis when the Minister came into office and the number of people in mortgage distress has doubled in the past two years. I want to focus on one bank in particular, AIB. The chief executive of AIB announced - I believe he is genuine - that it is writing to all 33,000 customers who are in mortgage arrears. This number does not refer to those who are in mortgage distress, because some of those people have had restructuring arrangements, although these are usually interest-only arrangements. I believe we can all agree that interest-only is not a long-term solution to the mortgage crisis; it is a short-term solution until something else changes - either the customers' circumstances change quite substantially or a more sustainable solution is found by the banks. Perhaps the Minister can relieve my concern. Has AIB informed him what it intends to do with the 33,000 customers who are in arrears? Is it going to adopt the approach it has taken heretofore, which is basically to establish interest-only arrangements for the majority of those people, so they fall out of the group who are in arrears of 90 days and are into restructured mortgages, but paying interest only? If that is the solution from the banks five years into this crisis, it is not good enough. Hopefully, there will be a lot more. The backbone has to be more debt write-downs for people whose mortgages are unsustainable, including other options.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	253	I am sure most people are agreed at this stage that the failure of the banks to deal with the mortgage arrears problem has hindered recovery. It now seems to be having a knock-on effect on the rental market because many people who would have bought property if the waters had been a bit clearer have not done so. Rental properties are now becoming scarce, as many people have refused to buy because they are not sure where the bottom of the market is going to be. Does the Minister consider that much of the renegotiating the banks are doing is short-term work rather than long-term? Maybe we are just kicking the can down the road a little and the problems will crop up again further down the line.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	254	There are huge differences among individuals with impaired mortgages. Many people simply want an interest-only arrangement while the main wage-earner is ill, while the second earner takes a year out to have a baby or while there is some crisis in the family. Many people are quite happy with an interest-only arrangement. Other people are happy if they get an interest-only arrangement and an extension of the mortgage. The standard mortgage in AIB is 20 years, and I am sure this is no different elsewhere. If we look at what is happening in other countries, extensions of maturity are viable because the average mortgage in Ireland is so short. A combination of an interest-only arrangement and moving out the maturity can help many people and is a viable option. Although averages are always a bit misleading, the average arrears in AIB is €13,000, according to one of its directors, yet there are people who are spending €15,000 on their credit cards. When one looks at it that way, it is not huge. It might be huge for an individual couple but, overall, I cannot see any reason, if this is addressed systematically and in an organised way, the banks cannot work their way through this for the benefit of people with impaired mortgages. That is what is now being driven hard by both the Central Bank and my officials in the Department of Finance. Of course, there is a Cabinet sub-committee, chaired by the Taoiseach, that is overseeing all this work. I hope the situation improves rapidly.

It is not appropriate for me, as Minister for Finance, to comment on or become involved in the detailed mortgage position of mortgage holders. In regard to the query posed by the Deputy, information is not readily available on the effect on the labour market and on the economy generally of allowing borrowers who are moving house to avail of job opportunities to retain the benefits of a tracker mortgage. It is important to point out that addressing unemployment remains the main priority of the Government and budget 2013 contained several measures aimed at addressing this issue. In particular, the additional supports introduced for the SME sector are intended to complement the work undertaken by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in respect of the Action Plan for Jobs and to encourage job creation. The recently released Action Plan for Jobs 2013, building on the work of the 2012 plan, contains a number of measures aimed at supporting job creation and tackling the unacceptably high levels of unemployment. The JobsPlus initiative, for example, which targets long-term unemployment, will provide an incentive to businesses to hire those who have been on the live register for 12 months or more by providing a cash flow benefit to businesses based on the duration of unemployment. As the Deputy may be aware, unemployment, while still at an elevated level, has shown some signs of stabilising in recent months, with the standardised unemployment rate static at 14.1% for the past three months, having fallen from 15% in February 2012. The number of individuals on the live register, seasonally adjusted, has been in decline since June of 2012.  The latest data from the Quarterly National Household Survey showed an annual increase in employment in the fourth quarter, the first such increase since the second quarter of 2008. Employment in the private sector seems to have stabilised, having increased by 0.6% in 2012. A modest increase in employment of 0.2% is forecast for this year, reflecting further employment growth in the exporting sectors, as well as the positive impact of various labour market initiatives. However, the unemployment rate is expected to remain elevated over the medium term, decreasing to 13.1% in 2015 as an increase in labour market supply mitigates the impact of a pick up in employment over the period.

There is a real issue here. Having a tracker rate is enormously valuable to a mortgage holder. They could be paying 1.5% or 1.75% interest as opposed to somebody on a variable rate paying 4% or 4.5%. This makes a massive difference to the monthly mortgage payment they have to make. They are trapped where they are because even people with borrowing capacity will not move because they will lose their tracker which they simply cannot afford to lose. There should be a policy initiative that would allow people to keep their tracker on that portion of the mortgage so if they currently owe €100,000 to the bank and borrow an extra €100,000 to move to a bigger property, they will keep the tracker on the original portion. It would generate movement and activity. Young families are living in apartments on a tracker rate and are absolutely trapped. Even if they are on good incomes and want to move, they cannot afford to because they would lose the tracker. This is something that is not possible for most people.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	259	The question related to doing what Deputy McGrath suggested for people who are moving quite a distance from their own locality to get a job so it was not just moving from an apartment to a house in the same locality. There are many considerations before people move, such as children in school and proximity to relatives. There is a case to be made but I suppose the Deputy knows why the banks are unwilling to concede to this. They are losing money on all trackers because the interest rate is so low and they would like to be rid of them. If somebody decides to move house and has to take out a new loan, they will take out one with a variable interest rate. It is very difficult to tell the banks they should not do this because trackers are loss makers. Perhaps there is some via media the banks should look at.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	260	Under the proposal I am suggesting, the banks would be no worse off because the mortgage holder would just keep the tracker on that portion of the mortgage. Obviously, the balance of the new mortgage would move to a variable rate. That is the key issue. There is no doubt that it would be healthy for the economy and generate movement and activity. It is something that should be looked at. Obviously, trackers are a big problem for the banks but if what I am suggesting was implemented, they would be no worse off and the economy and the families would definitely be better off.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	261	This issue needs to be looked at in the round. I appreciate that they are loss making but if an individual is willing to take out a bigger loan with a bank and a portion of that loan will have a variable interest rate, which is a financial gain for the bank, it makes sense for the bank to facilitate that move. It makes complete sense for the bank because it will be in a healthier position as a result. Does the Minister have any information about the number of people whose mortgages have been restructured and who were on trackers but are no longer on them? There is a great fear that the banks have been encouraging people off trackers.

I can see the point the Deputies are making. On some suitable occasion, I will feed their suggestions into the banking system but so far, I know the answer I will get unless there is a change of policy. If we could construct it as a labour market initiative, we might get further with it. I will pass on the Deputies' suggestions.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	263	The economic policies of the Government are designed with the core objective of restoring balanced economic growth. This will, in turn, allow for the continued creation of jobs and for the improvement of living standards for the people of Ireland. The policies are paying dividends - yesterday's figures show that employment and unemployment are now moving in the right direction. An essential condition for the resumption of balanced economic growth is sustainable public finances. International research has shown that elevated levels of public debt are harmful for growth prospects and ultimately for employment. As such, the Government is committed to cutting the deficit, stabilising our debt level and putting it on a downward path. Considerable progress is being made in this regard. I am conscious, however, that consolidation will have a short-term impact on the economy, although I do not accept that the impact is as large as some have suggested. Ireland is a small, open economy with imports accounting for over three quarters of GDP. As a result, a considerable amount of consolidation leaks out through a reduction in these imports. For this, and other reasons, the fiscal multiplier in Ireland tends to be somewhat lower than in many other European countries so economic and employment growth and fiscal consolidation are not mutually exclusive. The Government has continually stressed that while further consolidation is imperative for this country's future, there is also a need to ensure that such measures seek to minimise the impact on the economy and the labour market. With this in mind, budget 2013 - like its predecessor - was framed in such a way as to make it as jobs-friendly as possible and a number of measures were introduced to assist in this regard, including several initiatives designed to lend support to Ireland's job-rich SMEs. It should also be noted that Ireland's commitment to carrying out the necessary structural reforms has had clearly visible confidence effects in the financial markets - as evident in the decrease in bond yields in recent months.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	264	The IMF has admitted at this stage that it seriously underestimated the effects of austerity, as did the Government. Surely there is a compelling case not only to accelerate investment in priority infrastructure but also to bring forward plans to reform banking and to establish a strategic investment bank, as promised in the programme for Government? Does the Government still plan on creating a strategic investment bank that it would control completely and which would be guaranteed to lend to small business? An analysis by the ESRI has shown that despite cuts and tax increases of €23 billion introduced by the Government, between 2009 and 2012, the deficit only narrowed by €8.8 billion, which is about one-third of the €23 billion. This shows that the Government's fiscal policy has been damaging not just in terms of jobs and growth but has not quite so efficient at narrowing the deficit. Does the Minister not think that an increase in public investment is likely to be more productive in the long term?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-02-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	265	I do not believe that because it was tried not only in Ireland but elsewhere.A strategy of piling deficit on deficit and debt on debt was tried not only in Ireland but elsewhere and it was supposed to make everyone rich. That is the reason we crashed out. It reached the point where it was unsustainable and had to be paid for and we are still paying for it. That is not a solution. On the other hand, every economy needs some stimulatory demand-led projects. My colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, is using European Investment Bank funds to fund bundles of schools in various parts of the country and release 19 community health centres some time in the summer. This is very important. Completing roads programmes is also important. However, we should never forget the supply side of the economy, a case we have been arguing for a long time. We have included supply measures in every Finance Bill. If demand increases, supply normally increases to fulfil demand, but if supply increases, it can create its own demand. For example, I have observed Members using iPads and iPhones. They were not driven by demand but by supply. Smart people invented them and put them on the market. The fact that they were available meant everybody wanted to have them. An economy with supply side difficulties such as we have encountered can work. We cut the VAT rate for the tourism industry from 13.5% to 9%. That is on the supply side and it worked. Because prices are more competitive more people will come. It is a case of working on the supply side instead of the demand side. However, both are needed to balance an economy, but we do not have the resources for this big new deal initiative which works best in an enclosed economy. The IMF paper is very controversial and has been severely criticised by equally eminent economists around the world. Even if it works in a country such as the United States, it does not work in Ireland because the multiplier is probably less than one. If one spends money, it has a knock-on effect. However, we import so many goods that the money goes out fast. As savings are high in Ireland, it goes out fast. The return on big infrastructural developments in Ireland is no longer great. A balance on both sides is needed.

Good governance involves good investment which would be a creative initiative. The Minister knows that the domestic economy presents our biggest problem because it is struggling which impacts on people's lives. The lack of finance remains a serious problem. The Government promised a State strategic investment bank but two years have passed. Does it intend to establish it or is it dead in the water?

I presume this means he does not support his colleague's call for legislation to ban the full use of iPhones and iPads. Stimulus works, and so will austerity to get to a deficit reduction. There is no doubt about that. The big debate is which is the least painful and best path to choose. I have a very different view from that of the Government but mine is valid and is held and implemented by governments throughout the world. Stimulus does work. The Government has put all of its eggs in one basket. On average, 100 jobs were created every month last year. While any job created is to be welcomed because it presents an opportunity to remain in Ireland or move away from the deep depths of debt, the figure of 100 jobs every month means that it will take the Government 83 years to reach its target of 100,000 jobs, if things stay as they are. I hope nothing like that will ever happen, but we need a stimulus in the economy. There is no need to throw money at projects, as happened under the previous Government, but the National Pensions Reserve Fund has money that has to be mobilised to get people back to work and help to lift the level of economic activity in the State. I encourage the Minister to do this. However, many people have offered different opinions. I know that under the rules of politics, one's job is to ridicule or rubbish the proposals coming from the other side. However, political parties on this side of the House have offered genuine, serious proposals, as have people outside the House, which should be adapted to get the country moving again.

The Act provides that the Service is independent in the performance of its functions, including the maintenance and provision of courthouse facilities. In order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and have been informed by the Courts Service that expenditure on buildings, including leases, maintenance and related expenditure, in Wicklow town between 2004 and 2012 was €2.455 million. This includes work on both Wicklow Courthouse and Wicklow Circuit Court Office. Of this figure, €2.050 million was spent to acquire the site adjacent to the courthouse from Wicklow County Council. I am informed that the proposed redevelopment of the courthouse has not taken place because of the reduction in recent years in the capital funding available to the Courts Service for courthouse capital projects. The Courts Service has advised that when the necessary funding becomes available, it is their intention to redevelop Wicklow Courthouse as part of its programme for the development of county town courthouses.

Her permission was subsequently renewed and she is currently registered with the Garda National Immigration Bureau up to 18 August 2013. With regard to the Deputy's query concerning the entitlement to Irish citizenship of the daughter of the person concerned, I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs are currently examining the residency record of the mother in the State with a view to establishing if her daughter is entitled to an Irish passport post the recent Supreme Court judgment in the Sulaimon case.

Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 25 February, 2010, that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him. He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him. In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.  The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection. When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome. In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement. All representations submitted will be considered before a final decision is made. Once a decision has been made, this decision, and the consequences of the decision, will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned. The position in relation to the immigration status of Long Term Residency is that, at the date of application, a person applying for such status must have been legally resident in the State for over five years (60 months) on the basis of work permit, work authorisation or working visa conditions and, as such, must have Stamp 1 or Stamp 4 endorsements on their Passport during such periods. Given that the person concerned has no current right of residency in the State, he would not be in a position to meet the lawful residency criteria applicable to persons applying to my Department for Long Term Residency status. Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the INIS is, in the Deputy’s view, inadequate or too long awaited.

As well as being a significant event in the life of its recipient, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation as provided for in law is also a major step for the State which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.
