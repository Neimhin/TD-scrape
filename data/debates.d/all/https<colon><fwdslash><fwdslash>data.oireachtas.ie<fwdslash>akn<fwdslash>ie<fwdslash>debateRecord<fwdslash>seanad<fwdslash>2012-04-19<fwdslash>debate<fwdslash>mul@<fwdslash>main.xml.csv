#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I have received notice from Senator Brian Ó Domhnaill that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to refrain from taking account of the value of agricultural lands as capital assets in new means testing arrangements for third level maintenance grants.I have also received notice from Senator Averil Power of the following matter:The need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to clarify if the Government raised the ongoing grave and widespread human rights violations by the Chinese regime with Vice President Xi Jinping during his recent visit; if it raised these issues during the Irish State visit to China; if it has raised these issues in its general bilateral relations with China and if it has raised them at the EU level, given the well documented use of arbitrary imprisonment without charge or trial in China, the repression of minorities and the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners.I have also received notice from Senator Jillian van Turnhout of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Justice and Equality, in light of the launch of the steering group report on a national substance misuse strategy and the recommendation therein to commence section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008, relevant to the sale and display of alcohol in the off-trade sector, to clarify the manner in which section 9 is to be implemented given the two very different options available.I have also received notice from Senator Martin Conway of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Justice and Equality to reintroduce the grants scheme to promote equality at the level of enterprise, a programme that upskilled small and medium-sized businesses on their responsibilities under equality legislation, which was run by the Equality Authority and funded by the EU Social FundI regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.

We on this side of the House would also like to express our sincere condolences to the family of the late Mr. Barry.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.I will begin with good news for the Government and yesterday's jobs announcement.  That has to be welcomed, particularly so given that it affects areas of County Galway which are experiencing high levels of unemployment and emigration.  I commend the IDA, which is involved in a long lead-in time with many of these companies.  The Government of the day always reaps the public rewards but none the less these are real jobs and it is heartening to hear the reaction from young people around Inverin who can now think about finding employment at home rather than having to emigrate like many of their friends and relatives.The bad news, however, is that media reports have again drawn attention to the ongoing political donation saga.  Without going into the details of today's newspaper reports about €850 per table fund-raising events in the constituency of the Leader of the House in Malahide, as an editorial in the Irish Independent stated, the Government’s much vaunted commitment to ensuring that political donations are reduced practically to zero has yet to come to fruition.  Perhaps the Leader can indicate when it is proposed to introduce legislation on——

It is a fact of life that more than 80% of donations to my party are small donations rather than coming from the corporate sector.

It is proposed to hold an event in Malahide at which €850 will be charged to meet a Minister.  These are the facts of the story.Every Member of the House received a letter from the deputy general sector of the Communications Workers Union, Terry Delaney, regarding Vodafone's decision to relocate a significant number of jobs out of Dublin and Dundalk to Northern Ireland.  I will be very careful to avoid a certain partitionist attitude because the jobs are not leaving the island of Ireland.  Admittedly the decision will cause severe disruption but I hope there will not be too many job losses for those employed in Leopardstown and Dundalk.  The jobs are not going to the other end of the world, which was the case in respect of previous Vodafone job relocations.Although it is a private company, Vodafone makes a significant contribution to this country and a considerable number of Irish people hold its shares.  I am one such shareholder, primarily as a result of the original sale of Telecom Éireann, which morphed into Vodafone.  I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources the serious concerns expressed by the Communications Workers Union about the impact of this decision on jobs and request that he intervene with Vodafone, at least to establish why it has been exporting jobs from this country not only to the North but also to India and Egypt over the past 12 to 18 months.  Is it winding down its facilities in Ireland and will there be further job losses?  I am more concerned about this than about the fact that the jobs are moving to the North of Ireland.  They are only going a wee bit north.I ask that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade make it a practice to come to the House on a more regular basis in light of the developing international situation.  For several days the Palestinian Prime Minister boycotted a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the continuation of peace talks.  A spokesperson for the Palestinian Authority has gone on record as stating that the two-state solution involving the emergence of a Palestinian state alongside Israel was nearly finished or finished.

#IvanaBacik	unknown-#IvanaBacik-party	unknown-#IvanaBacik-dob	unknown-#IvanaBacik-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	17	I welcome last night's contribution from the Minister for Social Protection on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2012.  She made it clear that the changes proposed to the lone parents scheme are conditional on adequate child care arrangements being put in place in the next budget.  She has laid down an important marker in this regard.  I have met with groups representing lone parents and I know that in principle there is support for the important reforms the Minister wishes to make to ensure the State no longer plays an intrusive role in determining the nature of parental relationships.  The question of whether a parent is alone or in a relationship should not be a concern for the State.  The State's concern should be for bringing children out of poverty.  The lone parent benefit, which has been in place for a long time, has a poor output in terms of bringing lone parents and their children out of poverty.  The Minister is committed to making the scheme more effective but she recognises that the planned phased reduction in the age of children will not work unless access to affordable, safe and high quality child care is also made available.  We will be debating this issue next week.I welcome the debate on a Private Members' Bill on abortion which took place in the Dáil last night, 20 years after the X case.  There was unfavourable comment on the issue in this House yesterday.  I was perturbed to hear some Senators criticise the National Women's Council and the Irish Family Planning Association.  I commend these organisations for hosting an important presentation yesterday, some of which I was privileged to attend.  Four brave women who themselves had been through terminations of pregnancy as a result of being pregnant with babies who were not viable and could not survive beyond birth gave harrowing and intimate accounts of the personal tragedies they had suffered from having to terminate their pregnancies in another country and the lack of compassion shown by this State. One of the women stated that it was a time of her life when the State should have put its arms around her but instead it turned its back and forced her to travel abroad for a medical procedure that should have been available in this country.I am glad the other House has had the opportunity to debate these issues and that the Minister for Health stated that the Government will not shirk its responsibility to take action on foot of the export group report due in June or July. This year I hope we will see legislation to deal not only with the X case but also with the predicament of the many women in Ireland who find themselves in the position of the four brave women who gave presentations to all of us yesterday.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I join other Senators in expressing sympathy with the family of Mr. Barry.I agree with what Senator Bacik said about the debate.  I thought Deputy Clare Daly showed remarkable courage and the atmosphere has changed.  Anybody who listened to "The Late Debate" on RTE radio will have noticed a remarkable similarity in the language used in this House — regrettably from these benches — and from the person who was representing the so-called pro-life movement.  It was the repeating of a mantra obviously by a group who are concerted.  That is what we live with in this world.I ask the Leader for a debate on the economy.  It is timely to have a series of rolling debates on the economy because of the activities of the banks.  Yesterday an elderly couple living in Killiney were evicted and are now on the side of the road.  I was pretty disgusted by some of the comments on the radio from people who have no sympathy for them simply because they live in Killiney.  I have no knowledge of their circumstances but where they live does not make it any easier to be forcibly ejected from their own home and forced to live in a tent in their garden without any access to their personal possessions.  I believe it is a disgrace.  Many of the banks that came flooding into this country when they saw easy money to be made have now shagged off out of it and are getting their jaws sunk into the unfortunate Irish people.  I never thought I would see the day when there would be evictions in this country again.  If they are to continue and if there is one eviction in 2016, the whole thing should be cancelled in honour of people like James Connolly and Pádraig Pearse, who fought against evictions.While I am discussing the banks, I ask the Leader to communicate my concern to the Minister for Finance.  They are still swindling us as hard as they possibly can.  If one issues a cheque it takes four days to clear.  They should be given five seconds because it can be done by computer.  Where did that money go for the four days?  We all know where it goes — it goes to support the banks so that they can get interest on the money they have stolen from their own customers and then lodged.We should take on board the seriousness of the issue of eviction.  Four years ago in this House I called for the establishment of a department of home security to ensure people's constitutional rights to safety in their own home.I refer to the so-called body exhibition that is taking place in the Rotunda, with glowing tributes from the newspaper of record, The Irish Times.  Will the Leader inquire of the appropriate Minister as to the conditions of this exhibition?  I understand an American company bought the bodies from a Chinese hospital.  There has been a suggestion that some of these are victims of Falun Gong executions.  It is clear that neither the people who were the original occupants of the bodies nor their families gave consent for this exhibition.  It is an absolute disgrace and an affront to human dignity that this exhibition should be permitted in this country.
#MichaelMullins	unknown-#MichaelMullins-party	unknown-#MichaelMullins-dob	unknown-#MichaelMullins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	19	I welcome the very significant job announcements made yesterday by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, particularly the 250 jobs for Inverin in County Galway.  Very significant employment opportunities will be available to many young people in the west of that county.  I hope this is the start of many significant announcements over the coming months.  We are starting to see some stability and confidence return to the country.  I hope the people will take that on board when they come to decide on the stability treaty in six weeks.  Investors want to see confidence restored in the euro and want to see confidence restored in our country.Following the publication of the report of the commission on credit unions, I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on that report at an early opportunity.  Everybody in this House and the Government recognise the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement and the distinction between them and other financial institutions.  We all want to see a vibrant credit union sector.  The credit union was always regarded as the bank for the small saver and small borrower.  That credit unions are lending very little now is causing great hardship and distress.  We need an open and vibrant discussion on the role of the credit unions in the light of the publication of the commission report and the possible restructuring that may take place in the coming months.  Obviously it is encouraging that the number of credit unions that are undercapitalised has reduced from 56 to 51.   The Seanad needs to discuss the future of the credit union movement given its importance to the people.
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	20	I ask the Leader to arrange an early debate with the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Shortall, on her campaign to introduce legislation to control the price of alcohol being sold in supermarkets.  Below-cost selling in supermarkets is putting enormous pressure on publicans and their families and is also encouraging excessive drinking at home.  Vodka can be bought for less than €15 for a bottle and whiskey and other spirits can be bought for less than €18.  Last Sunday's newspapers advertised Tesco selling 24 large cans of beer for €24 and Supervalu had a similar offer for Heineken at €18.  It is putting pressure on the trade and also on families.  I commend the Minister of State on her work in trying to introduce this even though she is meeting enormous resistance from the industry and also from the newspaper industry.  Sunday newspapers rely greatly on the supermarkets advertising between Aldi, Lidl, Supervalu, Tesco and Dunnes Stores.

#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	22	Last Monday I passed through Castlerea and noticed publicans erecting a sign proclaiming "Customers wanted — apply within".  While this was a humorous approach by the two publicans Albert McCormack and Seán Lavin of the Horse and Jockey in Castlerea, it nevertheless indicated the pressure on pubs at this time.  Today's edition of the Roscommon People highlighted this particular situation.  Some 1,617 pubs closed down between 2005 and 2012 with approximately 25,000 job losses in the past five years.  If any other industry had such a loss there would be an outcry.  In every town and village there have been job losses in the publicans’ trade.  By highlighting this in Castlerea, we will raise the issue again here in the House.  Below-cost selling in supermarkets is detrimental to the well-being and health of the public.  On 25 March 2004, a publican, Thomas Byrne, of The Square in Roscommon sent a letter to the editor highlighting the detrimental effect it would have in this regard.

The UK Department of Health is due to publish a review of the breast cancer screening programme later this year. According to a recent study, at least ten such women are receiving unnecessary treatment each year. When the review is published, perhaps the Minister will attend the House to let us know how this will affect the treatment of women and a small percentage of men who get breast cancer in Ireland each year.
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I give a cautious welcome to yesterday's statement on lone parents by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton.  It was an important and significant statement.  When the budget was first announced, those of us in opposition said that child care was an impediment to many unemployed lone parents seeking access to the labour market.  I welcome the Minister's statement that she will not implement the measure which, unfortunately, remains in the Bill to reduce the cut-off age from 14 to seven.  This concerns the age of the youngest child in terms of qualifying for the one-parent family allowance.It is timely for this House to have a proper debate on child care provision.  We all aspire to having world class, affordable, safe and high quality child care but unfortunately we do not have it in this country, although huge progress has been made in some areas.  Taking what the Minister has said at face value, if it is her intention, and that of the Government, to improve child care in the State, it is important that we should discuss what that will mean.  We should discuss not just the child care needs of lone parents but of all parents, whether employed or not.As we all know, lone parents were specifically targeted in the budget when one considers the cuts to their earnings disregards, payments while on CE schemes and qualified child payments.  There were also cuts to the back-to-school allowance, rent supplement and fuel allowance, which had a disproportionate impact on lone parents.  While the cut-off age aspect of the budget on lone parents is important and I hope we will see a change in it, there were many other aspects in the budget that have disproportionately and wrongfully impacted on lone parents.  I hope that they will also be reversed in the context of the Social Welfare Bill's progress through this House.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	31	Following the Christmas recess, we passed the Electoral Amendment (Political Funding) Bill, which is now before the Dáil for consideration.  To a degree, that legislation addresses the concerns raised earlier by Senator Mooney.  During my contribution to the Bill on Second Stage, I said the Minister had got the legislation as correct as he possibly could.  The alternative to personal or corporate funding of politics is that the taxpayer would pay the bill for political parties.  I am not sure how the public would respond to that.  Since we debated that Bill here, there have been further developments and controversies about political funding.  I hope that during the forthcoming Dáil debate the Minister, and the Government generally, will reflect further to see if additional changes could be made.  We must ensure an end to any corrosive impact on the political process by how it is funded.  I hope the debate is still open as far as the Government is concerned and that any further legislative changes will revert to the Seanad where the Bill originated.Reference was made to the abortion debate yesterday in the Lower House and the presentation that took place in the audio-visual room.  I attended that particular hearing and was struck by the harrowing tales presented to us by the women present.  One would have to be sympathetic to the scenario they presented, but this is a complex matter.  I wish it could be solved easily, but it cannot and will not be.  The debate has to be dealt with calmly and rationally.  I am disappointed by the attempt sometimes to portray pro-life people as being some sort of prehistoric ogres, which they most certainly are not.  We must be careful in how we portray and categorise people.As of today, the only alternative I can see to the pro-life culture of Ireland is the abortion culture of Britain and America.  If that is the only alternative on offer, I would certainly prefer the status quo.

#MarkDaly	unknown-#MarkDaly-party	unknown-#MarkDaly-dob	unknown-#MarkDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	40	I ask the Leader to organise a debate with the Minister for Social Protection present on the report from NUI Galway which stated that 21% of children in this country are going to school, or to bed, hungry.  That would account for 344,000 children who are not getting enough to eat.  That statistic is all the more shocking because the media gave very little coverage to it.  In addition, the debate in this House is not describing the situation as an emergency, which it surely is.  If 350,000 children here or elsewhere are going to bed or to school hungry we should call it an emergency.  The figure is all the more stark because at yesterday's meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade it was pointed out that in 2006 one in six children in Malawi were going hungry while today, due to Irish Aid, the figure is one in ten. There may be different levels of hunger but I do not think one can explain that to a child in Ireland or in Malawi.  Surely we can put in place a school meals scheme, as has been done in other countries. It has also been put in place in some schools but not enough obviously, given the scale of the problem involving 344,000 children who are going to school hungry. Food should be available in our schools for all those children who need it. One in five schoolchildren today could be going hungry, which is an appalling situation. Simple solutions include breakfast clubs and dinner clubs but at the very least we should not allow our children to go to school or to bed hungry.

Neither was I hugely concerned — although perhaps a bit disappointed sentimentally — that Larry Gogan would not be travelling to the Eurovision event this year.  It is the first time he has not travelled there for many years.  One becomes concerned, however, when one realises that the National Symphony Orchestra has had its travel and performance budget curtailed without notice.  When one reads that RTE's London office will be closed after the Olympics, one realises that the €25 million in cuts are really beginning to bite.  RTE's director general, Mr. Noel Curran, has said that in future the emphasis will be on sport of Irish origin, which most Members of this House would support.  RTE's regional news output will be maintained but they will examine ways to make savings through leases and rents.I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to attend the House for a debate on what should be occurring at a time of crisis in RTE.  The emphasis on regional news and current affairs should be strengthened.  At this time, our sense of stability and pride in who we are can be cemented and encouraged by greater regional reporting, rather than by reducing it.  When I read those lines, my fear is that this is the thin end of the wedge and we are starting to examine ways of cutting such offices.  Those offices are then reduced slowly and entirely over time and it is only a small step before those journalists are taken away at a time when we need the emphasis to be more on the regional differences and the cement that binds us together.  Such a debate would be worthwhile and if we had notice of it, we could contribute in a way by bringing forward ideas and suggestions — I realise that cuts have to be made — in order that the core value of regional broadcasting and regional news which RTE has held high for many years would be retained.

Clearing house practices and rules exist but we need full accountability and transparency in this regard.  I wish to add to his call for a debate on banking and the economy.  In regard to banking, it is important that we know that everyone in the two pillar banks in particular — as the foreign banks have virtually departed — both at senior management and board level, have all been approved at this stage by the Central Bank and that they have met the fitness and probity tests as laid down.  There is also the question of the downsizing of AIB and the position as regards the offer to the staff.  I am concerned that we will have a duopoly with just two pillar banks.  This is not good as regards the availability of credit in the future.  I refer to the role of the credit controller's office and how it interplays.  I support Senator Mullins's very interesting point in regard to the restructuring of the credit unions because there would be less competition without them.  These are all very important matters and in my view are worthy of a debate in an early court if that can be arranged.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	43	I call Senator Ned O'Keeffe.  I beg the Senator's pardon; I call Senator Ned O'Sullivan.
#NedOSullivan	unknown-#NedOSullivan-party	unknown-#NedOSullivan-dob	unknown-#NedOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	44	I was referred to in a debate yesterday as Ned O'Shea.  I am beginning to enjoy the anonymity of it all.It might be timely to have a debate on the Irish horse-racing industry, especially in light of the recent great news from China, whereby the Chinese will attempt to establish a racing industry of their own, based on the Irish model and using the expertise and knowledge of our Irish trainers and all that goes with that.  This is a significant success and I compliment Horse Racing Ireland and everyone in the racing industry and also the Minister, Deputy Coveney, for achieving this arrangement for Ireland.  This will underpin further the importance of the racing industry to the country in which thousands are employed.  It is not an exclusive sport by any means because it is for everybody.  Every housewife in the country had a few shillings on the grand national and next week there will be the great flagship showpiece in Punchestown where all the world will see the very best of racing and the very best of sport.  I ask the Leader to consider arranging such a debate in due course so that we can highlight even further what is one of the treasures of the economy.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	45	I agree with Senator O'Sullivan in that matter.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has done a very good job and I compliment the Department and all those involved in progressing this sector and ensuring that Ireland is reaping the benefits of the hard work done over a long number of years.I highlight the report published this week on the implementation of the reform of the intern year for junior doctors.  I asked a question at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children about the number of junior doctors who have left Ireland after completing only one postgraduate year, the intern year, in an Irish hospital.  A total of 45% of interns working in Irish hospitals who finished college training in 2010 had left the Irish medical system by July 2011.  This is a frightening statistic.  I thank the HSE for setting up the procedure of monitoring the movement of interns and this is the second report in this regard.  However, it highlights the reasons young doctors are leaving at such an early stage in their training and it points to the lack of a clear career path for medical graduates.  There is a need for a discussion on this issue and I ask for a debate.  More than 600 students graduate from medical schools every year and it seems a large proportion are leaving the country within a year of graduation.  This needs to be investigated.This is a detailed report which also deals with the aspect of record-keeping.  Only 31% of graduates believed they had sufficient training in the area of record-keeping.  It is quite frightening that after five years in college and 12 months in a hospital, only 31% believed they were sufficiently trained in this important aspect of their work.  This issue needs to be tackled in view of the fact that such significant awards are paid out in litigation.  This should be highlighted in a debate when the Minister for Health is next in the House.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on this issue at an early date.
#MartinConway	unknown-#MartinConway-party	unknown-#MartinConway-dob	unknown-#MartinConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	46	I agree with Senator Ned O'Sullivan as regards the horse-racing industry.  The announcement by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, was spectacular and it seems to have been lost between headlines.  It means a national stud in China will have been created and brought about by Ireland.  For example, Coolmore stud is a world-class facility and we can all be proud of the Irish horse-racing industry.I agree with Senator O'Keeffe about the need for further discussion about RTE and the media in general.  In particular, I read reports at the weekend — as to whether they are true is another question — that the GAA is considering going into the digital area and perhaps having a digital channel whereby the all-Ireland hurling and football finals would be exclusively broadcast and would not be free-to-air.  The GAA has benefited enormously from State aid over the years and there is a responsibility on the GAA in the first instance. If it does not live up to it there is a responsibility on us, as legislators, to ensure that major sports events with such historic links as the all-Ireland football and hurling finals and the provincial finals and other major GAA events are available to all citizens of this country, free of charge. It is the least we can expect from our treasured national game.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	47	Well said.  The GAA in every county gets more money from the lottery.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	48	I ask for clarification from Senator Mooney.  There was some confusion regarding a fund-raising event held in Malahide and that the Leader of the House was in some way involved.
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	49	I apologise, it was just a Freudian slip.  I was referring to the Fianna Fáil group leader whose constituency is in north County Dublin.  The north County Dublin Fine Gael organisation has issued invitations for an €850 table at a fund-raising event in a hotel in Malahide and this has hit the national papers.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	50	I thank Senator Mooney.  I was worried that I had moved my residence.

#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	53	I thank Senator Mooney for clarifying that matter.  I am quite happy living in Waterford, I assure him.  I am not aware of that fund-raising event but he has clarified the matter.  He mentioned €850 but I believe that is the cost for a table of ten.  The vast majority of funding from my party — 90% — comes from €80 tickets sold to members and supporters the length and breadth of the country.Senator Bacik mentioned the debate that took place in the other House on abortion and Senators Norris and Bradford raised this also.  I indicated yesterday that an expert group chaired by Mr. Justice Sean Ryan will report back to the Government on this issue in July.  The Government believes this is the appropriate forum in which to examine this complex and sensitive matter.  I am sure we will have an opportunity to discuss the subject when the report has been published.Senator Norris also raised the possibility of rolling debates on the economy.  We will certainly try to arrange that.  He also mentioned the eviction of people from their home in Killiney.  It is sad to see any person evicted from his or her home in this day and age.  With regard to the clearance of cheques, I know the Senator raised the matter last night with the Minister for Finance.  He went straight to the horse's mouth on that matter.Senator Mullins spoke about the recent job announcement in Inverin, County Galway, as did Senator Mooney.  It is great to hear that young people now feel they can stay at home and work in their own parishes and communities as a result of these job announcements.  It was good to hear from Senator Leyden that he was rushing off to Boyle, where there is a further announcement of jobs this afternoon.  I hope the tide is turning in that regard.  The Senator also mentioned the report of the commission on credit unions.  We can and should arrange a debate on that report as soon as possible.Senator Leyden also raised the question of below-cost selling of alcohol.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Shortall, has indicated that she will attend and speak to the House on this subject, which is close to her own heart.  I am sure she will make progress soon.Senator Moloney spoke about advances in the treatment of breast cancer and prostate cancer in Britain.  We can arrange a debate on that issue with the Minister for Health.  It is encouraging to see these new advances in the treatment of all kinds of cancer, which give hope to so many people in the country who suffer from cancer.Senator Cullinane mentioned the provision of child care.  The Minister for Social Protection will be in the House all day and until late at night next Thursday dealing with the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill.  She will also be here on Friday next.  The House will be sitting, as I indicated, from Monday to Friday next week to deal with quite an amount of business.Senator Bradford spoke about political funding.  I am sure that if there are amendments to the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill, it will come back to us in due course.Senator Daly can raise the points he made about child poverty when the Minister is here on Thursday and Friday of next week.Senator O'Keeffe spoke about the cuts in RTE, which were also mentioned by Senator Conway.  I agree with the Senator that it is important that RTE retain its core values with regard to coverage and an emphasis on the regions, which is an important part of its remit.Senator Coghlan spoke about the duopoly of the two pillar banks, which does not augur well for competition. We can include that in our debate on the economy, which is to take place soon.Senators O'Sullivan and Conway spoke about the Irish horse racing industry and the development of the horse breeding and racing industry in China. This is of great benefit to the horse breeders and everybody involved in the thoroughbred industry in this country. I compliment the Senators on raising that matter.Senator Burke raised the issue of interns and junior doctors leaving within 12 months of graduation, and the fact that only 31% of those in training had a knowledge of record-keeping.  This is a disturbing report, and I agree with the Senator that we should arrange a debate on this matter as soon as possible.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	54	I am humbled and privileged to lead the tributes to the late Myles Staunton, a former Deputy and Senator, who sadly passed away last year.  I express my sincere sympathy to his family, his wife Marianne and children, Ruth, Elizabeth, Hugh, Myles and Aoife who are in the Visitors Gallery.From the outset of his career, Myles recognised that his native county could only prosper if it developed links with and understanding of the problems of other parts of the world and he recognised the possibilities of globalisation almost before the word was invented.  In the course of his long and distinguished career as a public servant and businessman, Myles championed the economic development of his native County Mayo, and promoted the economy of the west.  For many years he was passionately committed to the advancement of Knock airport as a vital transport link for the west.  Above all, Myles was a man of voracity and intellect.  He was an entrepreneurial visionary who unceasingly promoted Mayo as a great place in which to live, work and do business.  He was an advocate of alternative energy and the harnessing of our natural resources long before the green agenda came to the fore.  His acute business acumen and innovation was demonstrated by his involvement in the peat and seaweed industries.  He firmly believed in the use of our natural resources to create employment.  He was always seeking benefits for his community.  He was a central part in the team that brought the US-based company, Allergan, to Mayo 34 years ago and thousands of people have been positively affected by his actions since then.The late Myles Staunton was renowned in Fine Gael as an extremely capable and committed public servant.  He represented Mayo with distinction as a Deputy during the Liam Cosgrave Government of 1973-77 and served in the Seanad until 1982 and again from 1989-92.  His passionate commitment to public service ensured that he made a valuable contribution in the Chamber.  He was a founding member of the trilateral commission which brings together elected politicians, academics, business people and civil servants from Asia, Europe and North America and continued to be involved in his work in this area until last year.I had the pleasure of meeting Myles on numerous occasions and recall his warm and generous nature.  I recall having a meal with my wife in Dunmore East in the early 1980s at a time of a Seanad election.  During the meal a second bottle of wine arrived on the table which I was told had been provided by a gentleman at the bar.  When I investigated who had done this I learned that it was the late Myles Staunton.  He joined us and had a meal and we became the best of friends.  I do not know how he found Dunmore East and knew I was there but it did no harm in the election afterwards.The Cathaoirleach, Senator Paddy Burke, was among the many public representatives and friends who paid tribute to Myles when he described him as a true parliamentarian, public representative and a servant of both the State and County Mayo.  A former Taoiseach, John Bruton, made a moving tribute when he said that Myles was a convinced and convincing advocate of viable, commercial and privately run economic development in the west.  This was because he was willing to put his money where he mouth was, whether in the development of the local seaweed or turf industries.Myles was deeply committed to his family and family life.  I express my sincere sympathy to his family who are in the Visitors' Gallery.  I was delighted to attend his funeral in Westport, the town he loved so well, and to reminisce with many of his former colleagues who deeply appreciated the work he did for the party and the country for many years.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	55	On behalf of the Fianna Fáil group I express our deep sympathy to the family of the late Myles Staunton, his wife Marianne, Ruth, Elizabeth, Hugh, Myles and Aoife who are in the Visitors Gallery.  He is also survived by his brothers Hugh, Patrick, John and Neil to whom we express our deep sympathy.I had the honour of serving in the House during the 1989-92 period, referred to by the Leader, when the then Senator Staunton was an active member.  Outside politics he was a vibrant lively personality.  I do not believe that at any time he allowed his political affiliations to inhibit the manner in which he would reach out to people across the political divide.  That was one of his great qualities and, perhaps, one of the reasons he was so successful not only in politics but in the wider area of commercial life.  It was in the genes as he came from a very distinguished family in Westport going back to the turn of the previous century.  I read a little about his family background.  His grandfather, who was also Myles Staunton, was a leading member of the United Irish League, a movement determined to end the inequalities of colonial landlordism.  It is extraordinary that in our own families we are influenced to a large extent by those who have gone before us.As the Leader pointed out, former Senator Staunton was not only a successful politician but, perhaps, a more successful businessman.  He had the rare ability to pull people together and identify possibilities for his own area and was mainly responsible for bringing a large number of jobs to Westport and west Mayo.  At a time when it was not politically correct to do so, he was a strong supporter of Knock airport.  A former Taoiseach, John Bruton, made the point that he was a convinced and convincing advocate of viable, commercial and privately run economic development in the west, a strong supporter in the Seanad of Knock airport and held his own in every argument with those who questioned the vital link for all of Connacht in everything he attempted.  He was relentless in pursuing his goals and was never discouraged by the setbacks sometimes inflicted upon him by myopic bureaucracy.  That sums up the determination Myles Staunton had in everything he brought to bear on his life.I was struck by another aspect of Myles Staunton's life, the Leader mentioned the globalised nature of his activities.  He was one of the pioneers of the Euro-Arab dialogue and led a visit by Irish Deputies and Senators to Lebanon and Syria in 1974.  The Taoiseach who is a first cousin of the Senator, through his wife Fionnuala, was on the visit.  That is interesting in light of all that has happened in respect of Syria.  I was struck by a comment made in tribute by the then Cathaoirleach of Westport Town Council, Councillor Teresa McGuire, which sums up the essence of Myles Staunton.  She said Westport has lost one of its finest statesmen.  A politician always thinks of the next election while statesmen, like Myles, think of the next generation.  Myles Staunton was ahead of his time.  He was an advocate of alternative energy and the harnessing of our natural resources before there was the green agenda.On behalf of the Fianna Fáil group I express our deepest sympathy to the family on the loss of a husband, father and grandfather and the wider political community — Ireland has lost a great man.  Ní bheidh a leithéid ann arís.  I express my sympathy to his wife, Marianne, Ruth, Elizabeth, Hugh, Myles junior, who continues in the family tradition, Aoife, and his brothers Hugh, Patrick, John and Neil.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.
#IvanaBacik	unknown-#IvanaBacik-party	unknown-#IvanaBacik-dob	unknown-#IvanaBacik-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	56	I pay tribute to the late Senator Myles Staunton on behalf of the Labour Party group in the Seanad.  I welcome his family and extend my sympathy to his wife, Marianne, his children and family and to his friends and those who knew him in Westport.  I did not know him personally but I have a Westport connection, as my great grandmother was a Reilly from the centre of town and I have a great love for Westport. I knew of the late Senator by reputation and his great stature in the town. Senators Mooney and Cummins have spoken about the deep affection in which he was held in Westport.The late Senator was first elected in 1973 to the Dáil and as others have said, he served a number of terms in the Seanad and gave a total of 12 years public service to the Oireachtas.  As a Labour Party member, I was interested to read of his critical role in the formation of the Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition, the Government of Liam Cosgrave and Brendan Corish.  His election as a Fine Gael Deputy made that coalition possible, which is an interesting aspect of that election.  I have read of his eloquent advocacy for economic development in the west and in Westport, in particular, as well as his strong advocacy for the use of natural resources and his recognition of the possibilities of globalisation.  As Senator Mooney has said, he was ahead of his time in terms of the environmental agenda and recognising the possibilities of renewable energy and the immense potential of our natural resources for economic renewal and development.  He was ahead of his time also in terms of his role on the global stage, in looking to develop links between Ireland and Asia as well as other European countries.  I pay tribute to his distinguished and highly respected career in political life and in public service. Again, I express my sincere sympathy on behalf of the Labour Party group to his family, friends and the people of Westport.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	57	On behalf of the Independent group, I express my sympathy to the late Senator Myles Staunton's wife, Marianne, and his family, whom I am very pleased to see in the Visitors' Gallery of this Chamber, which he graced with his presence.  I know that my friend and colleague, Senator Quinn, who knew him better than I did, wishes to speak about a man whom we all liked and whose company we enjoyed.  He was a charming gentlemanly man, a man of ideas and endless intellectual curiosity. That is why it is so shocking that he died at a comparatively young age. I would say that because I am getting towards 70 years myself. I can hardly believe that it must be nearly a year since I saw him in Leinster House. He used to come from time to time to use the Oireachtas Library and the dining room. I remember having a little chat with him over coffee. Last year I met him and his wife, Marianne, in Westport. Unlike Senator Bacik, I have no known connections with Westport but it is one of the most beautiful towns in Ireland, a little like Birr, because it is a planned town. The way the river flows through it and the arrangement of the elegant buildings would have appealed to Myles Staunton because he had an organised mind. As others have said, he was ahead of his time.I had the privilege of serving on both occasions when Myles Staunton was a Member of this House and I remember him speaking on what subsequently became known as green issues, organic development, small local development using local products such as turf and seaweed.  That is very much the way of the future.  He is a real and substantial loss not just to this House and to his family but also to the country because we are beginning to realise the value of community, and learning from northern Spain, where one of the largest banks has survived because it is a community development, where everybody has a part share of it.  A conference is being organised shortly about co-operatives.  It would be such a privilege to hear the views of the former Senator Myles Staunton on these developments and I think he would have approved of it because he put the values of humanity above the system.  For that we all honour him.  Let me end with a little Latin tag that I think applies particularly to him . Nullum quod tetigit non ornavit — He touched nothing that he did not improve. 
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	58	My contribution will be devoid of a Latin phrase but Senator Norris's final remark was apt.  I join in the tributes to my former parliamentary colleague, Myles Staunton.  His service as a Deputy and a Senator was impressive.  He will remain in Fine Gael folklore as an iconic figure because he won that crucial extra seat in 1973.  The history scholars among us will remember that at that stage the Fianna Fáil Party had been in power for 16 years, which seemed endless, but his victory at that election changed the story and brought a new Government to power.In one sense Myles Staunton was a victim of his own qualities — his vision and ability.  The type of politics that allows one to win elections, both local and national, was not the type of politics he practised because he saw the bigger picture.  He saw that politics was not just about one's own community, town, county or constituency, but it was a much bigger job to turn around the country and the world.  His contribution in that respect is worthy of consideration.  I did not serve in the Seanad during his time but I observed his performance at parliamentary party meetings.  His speeches had a depth of vision and substance.  If we had more of those qualities in politics, and if the political system did not hinder that sort of politics, our country would be much better.We all learned from Myles Staunton's contributions in both Houses and at parliamentary party meetings.  In recent years, I would see him occasionally in the Oireachtas Library.  He was always talking about a new idea.  My final discussion with him was about the sugar industry and he had ideas about regenerating that industry.  There were times when he almost convinced me that one could grow sugar beet in Mayo, perhaps a stretch too far.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	59	For the Senator's information, sugar beet did grow in Mayo.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	60	I withdraw that remark.New ideas and inventions were to the fore of Myles Staunton's mind.  He was a very sociable character and was always a friendly face who was interested in people.  I extend my profound sympathy to his family.  They can be genuinely proud of him.  I see that the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, has joined them.  He is one of Senator Staunton's successors.  He has a different style of politics but the same commitment to country and cause.  It is interesting that people have a different way of approaching problems and contributing to society, but in his unique way, Myles Staunton played a role that will be remembered in the Oireachtas and in the Fine Gael Party.  For those whom he has left behind he has given us strong, positive and happy memories.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	61	I am delighted to be here to have the opportunity to say a few words about my friend, Myles Staunton.  We met when Denise and I were on our honeymoon.  We met at mass.  We were there for two Sundays.  We were in the south of Spain in a little village called Torremolinos in 1962.  Myles was on holidays there without his girlfriend who was to be his bride two years later.  In those days one did not go on holidays with one's girlfriend because it was not the thing to do.  One had to wait until one got married before that sort of thing happened.Denise and I were at mass on the first Sunday and noticed two altar boys made the collection.  The following Sunday there were no altar boys and I realised towards the end of mass there would be no collection.  The vast majority of people at the mass were Irish; one could hear the voices.  I caught Myles's eye and said we should make a collection.  I said I would do one side and he should do the other.  The first few collections were coins and I turned to Myles and said, "notes only".  As we went to each row we said, "notes only".  Notes were the equivalent of 5 cent.  The two piles of collections were so high that when we handed them to the priest at the end of mass he gave us a big hug.

#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	63	We met at mass because everybody went, but Myles was a devout man.  He had a strong sense of religion and the importance of the next life.  I hope he is looking down on us.  I wish he was here today.There is a lovely O. Henry story which I have told before about people getting an invitation to a funeral of somebody who was very old.  They went to her home and she met them at the door.  They said they thought it was her funeral.  She said she was not going to wait until she died, and that she wanted to see everyone again and would enjoy meeting them.  I hope Myles is looking down on us and would enjoy this occasion because he loved the House and the mixture of politics and business.I always admired Myles Staunton from an early age.  He was in business and was able to mix politics with it.  He became an idol and model for me to emulate.  I saw what he did and wondered if it was possible for me to follow.  We were competitors from that point of view.  Myles came here on a regular basis and we would check up on each other and how we were doing.  As I mentioned, he married two years after I did and ended up with five children, as did I.  I have not checked to see how many grandchildren there are, but there was competition in terms of children and grandchildren.What impressed me about Myles was his ability to be able to concentrate on business to the benefit of his local community.  I and my wife visited Myles and Marianne.  He took us to the seaweed factory and showed us what he was doing.  His commitment, enthusiasm and dedication to the people of that part of the world was evident.  In recent times I visited Knock airport.  Every time people mention Monsignor Horan they also mention Myles Staunton because it was one of his projects.  I did not realise until recently the extent to which he defended Knock airport in this House because it was criticised.  He did so because he felt sure it was the right thing to do.It was not until after Myles Staunton's death I found out he was a Fulbright scholar and was educated through the American system.  My memory of Myles will be of a person who was full of fun, craic, humour and great company.  Senator Mooney was correct when he said he came from a family of people who devoted themselves to the community.  He devoted itself to the next generation which is an interesting tribute to pay to somebody.  The next generation will benefit, not just in Westport and the west but Ireland as a whole, from the example he set.I am honoured to have the opportunity to say a few words about Myles Staunton.  I am delighted to have met Marianne and his family.  One son is in Australia and is unable to return.  I hope Myles is enjoying today, and is looking down and is proud of her, his five children, the days he spent in this House and the other House and his contribution not just to business but to politics.  His work has benefited the community and Ireland.  He has set an example many others would surely wish to follow.

I met him and Marianne some years ago and admired him from a distance because of the work he did in the local community, politics and local development.  As someone who is married to a Mayo man, I would never be forgiven if I let this great occasion pass and did not pay tribute to a great Mayo man who did so much for his community of Westport.  I am from Clifden and was always jealous of the work that took place in Westport.Many communities wished they had the likes of Myles Staunton to work with and for them.  Much has been said about his involvement with the development of Knock airport and Allergan.  He was involved in business, seaweed, peace, power and natural resources.  He had vision and foresight when nobody else did.  I could not put it better than Councillor Mullaney who referred to Myles Staunton and the great work he had done for the Mayo power project at Killala.  He said: "Great credit goes to the promoters of the project and in a special way I would like to acknowledge the important role played by the late, very great, Myles Staunton.  I can say without contradiction that without Myles this project would never have happened."One could not mention all the projects with which Myles Staunton was involved in Mayo and the western seaboard.  Nothing moved in the area without his having a hand in it.  I thank him on behalf of the people of the west and the country.  I have knowledge of the work he did when he was in the Seanad.

#MichaelMullins	unknown-#MichaelMullins-party	unknown-#MichaelMullins-dob	unknown-#MichaelMullins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	65	I join in the tributes to the late Myles Staunton and welcome Marianne and his family to the House.  I first got to know him back in the 1980s.  He called to me on a regular basis at my office in Ballinasloe when he was a Senator and was gearing up for a European election.  He was a most charming and delightful person.  One always felt better after meeting and having a conversation with him than one did before he arrived.  He was always full of vibrancy, new ideas and life.  He wanted to achieve things.  As other speakers have said, he was an entrepreneur in the true sense.  He wanted to create a better community for his beloved Westport.Myles Staunton harnessed green technologies and ideas before they became popular or featured on other people's radar.  I heard much from him about harvesting iodine from seaweed and his work in the peat industry.  He has left a lasting legacy.  He was involved in everything that was good and powerful in Westport and was involved in regional development in its truest sense.  His involvement with Knock Airport is legendary.  At that time he had many powerful detractors who spoke against what he, Monsignor Horan and others were trying to achieve but he was proven right.  Those of us who live in the west of Ireland and use the airport on a regular basis can see how it has benefited the region.  He helped to attract industries like Allergan to Westport and they are a lasting legacy.I have always associated Myles — another Senator alluded to it earlier — as the person who changed the Government in 1973 and broke Fianna Fáil's grip on power in a dramatic fashion.  If he had not won a seat in West Mayo, as it was known at that time, we probably would not have had the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government come to power.   Like the present Government it had to take the reins of power at a difficult time because we were in the middle of an oil crisis and it was a very difficult time economically.   I always felt that Myles was more of an entrepreneur and businessman than a politician but he was still a very successful politician.  He was elected to Dáil Éireann and served in Seanad Éireann and made a fantastic contribution to public life.  Obviously his foreign connections helped forge important links for the country, business and industry.  As speakers have said, the country has lost a great person, a man who made a major contribution to public life, business and enterprise in the west of Ireland.  We need more people like him.  Anybody who met him was left with a lasting impression and he conveyed a lot of good ideas and inspired people to try to achieve some of the things that he did for his people and community.  Mayo has lost one of its favourite sons.  I know that his family miss him dearly but they can be very proud of his very many achievements in public life and in business.

I did not know him as well as some of the members but I greatly enjoyed hearing the tributes and know that they are well deserved.  Neither did I have the opportunity or privilege of serving with him in this House.  Any time I met him he was always bubbly and good humoured.  As has been said, he was truly innovative and a man of great initiative.  He had great vision and achieved so much.  It has been wonderful to hear all of the Senators pay tribute to him today.

#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	67	I welcome Marianne and her family here today who were in the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, who was here earlier and is a close family friend, and Deputies Calleary and O'Mahony.I wish to be associated with the tributes to the late Myles Staunton who served in the Dáil from 1973 to 1977 and in the 14th Seanad, 15th Seanad and 19th Seanad, from 1977 to 1982 and 1989 to 1992.  Although his time in Leinster House preceded my election to the House, as a fellow Mayo person I knew him very well for a long time during his career as a councillor, a national politician and as a businessman.  Quite a few references were made to the 1973 general election and I remember it quite well.  I was at the convention in Breaffy House where he was adamant that only two candidates should run in the then three-seater West Mayo constituency.  His assessment was proved right and resulted in a change of government.Myles was very well travelled and was always going to or coming from some place, and I do not mean Westport or Castlebar.  He was a politician for the people and always sought to benefit his community but he had his eye firmly placed on larger projects and the bigger picture.  He was basically responsible for bringing Allergan to Westport which is now an important pharmaceutical industry in the region and the country.  He was a politician and a businessman but first and foremost he was an extraordinary salesperson and could sell any project.  He could have sold sand to the Arabs.  He was involved in seaweed manufacturing, egg production, peat briquettes and national peat power generation.  The larger the project the more enthusiastic he became and sold people his ideas.  He was a great European and it was a shame that he was narrowly beaten when he stood for election to the European Parliament in 1979 for the Connacht constituency.   He would have excelled in Europe had he been successful.In all of my dealings with the late Myles Staunton, a former Senator and Deputy, both in a private capacity and politically, he was very honourable and genuine.   He was an absolute gentleman whenever one dealt with him.  As has been said here already, he was quite a character who had a great sense of humour and was very entertaining and witty.  His political experiences were widely respected.  During his time in the Oireachtas he made many friends in the Houses.  His contributions here were always concise, to the point and were common sense.  His political experience was also recognised internationally as he acted as procedural adviser to several parliaments over the duration of his political career.  As my late father also served with him on Mayo County Council, I have had many associations with Myles Staunton over a long period.  I extend my sympathy to Marianne, Aoife, Myles, Hugh, Ruth and Elizabeth and the extended Staunton family.  His family is very welcome to the Seanad today but it is unfortunate that their visit is due to his death.  I was quite shocked when I heard he had died because I had met him just a couple of days previously.  Again, I would like to be associated with the votes of sympathy expressed in the House today.
Members rose.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	68	The House will be aware the Government agreed a programme of State asset disposals in February which is designed to reduce the State's debt burden and to help fund employment generating initiatives in the economy.  This programme has been debated on more than one occasion in the Dáil and I am pleased to explain today the position to Senators and to update the House on the progress made since my announcement in February.In brief, the asset disposal programme agreed by Government in February consists of the sale of the Bord Gáis energy business, but not including its gas transmission or distribution systems or the two gas interconnectors which will remain in State ownership, and the sale of some of ESB's non-strategic power generation capacity.  Consideration is also being given to the sale of some assets of Coillte, but not Coillte's land holdings; and the sale of the State's remaining shareholding in Aer Lingus, when market conditions are favourable and at an acceptable price to the Government.  I wish to emphasise from the outset that these options are being considered in a manner that protects the economy and our key strategic assets and ensures that value is secured for the taxpayer for any assets that are to be sold.This week's announcement of the establishment of the new Irish water utility under the umbrella of Bord Gáis Energy, BGE, demonstrates the Government's continued confidence in the semi-State sector as a vehicle for large-scale infrastructural investment and a driver of innovative change.  This utility will be the largest new semi-State established in a generation.  BGE is an excellent example of a strong, vibrant and dynamic State company which has demonstrated its capacity to invest and develop new, efficient and competitive businesses for the benefit of Irish consumers.  I am confident that Bord Gáis will continue to contribute to achieving key Government and national objectives in its ongoing management of the strategic gas infrastructure as well as the sale of its energy business and the establishment of the new Irish water utility.  In this context it is important to note the key synergies between the gas and the water utilities lie in core network functions, such as operating in a regulated environment, network management, metering and utility operation systems, all of which are strengths of BGE.  These core functions will not be impacted by the sale of Bord Gáis Energy.I have to admit that since I announced the details of the disposals programme, I have been struck by the number of contributions to the general debate that fail to take full account of the very serious position in which the State finds itself and which gives rise to the need for asset disposals at this time.  It is almost as though people speak about the debate as if it were peacetime as opposed to a Government and people facing an unprecedented economic challenge.  Although the economic situation has stabilised in the past year — thanks in large part to the concerted actions of the Government — we are still faced with a very difficult economic situation.  Our outgoings continue to greatly exceed our income and we depend on financial assistance provided under the EU-IMF funding programme for the continued day-to-day operation of the State.  Our obligations under this programme, as well as under the Stability and Growth Pact, require us to make measurable progress in reducing the budget deficit to a target of 3% by 2015.  We have to balance the books and stabilise our debt and there are no soft or easy options in achieving this objective.  If acceptable valuations can be achieved, the realisation of value from some State companies, although comparatively modest in the context of the overall fiscal gap, will go some measurable way towards lightening the State's daunting burden of debt and reducing the requirement for additional borrowing.In addition to dealing decisively with the public finances, the Government's primary concern must be and is to promote employment and economic recovery.  We need to grow the economy and create jobs.  In order to achieve this, some form of stimulus is required.  In the programme for Government, we set out concrete proposals to leverage revenue from the sale of State assets in order to invest in the productive potential of the economy.From the outset of our engagement with the EU-IMF troika on this matter, the Government also made it clear that we were not prepared to agree to an asset disposal programme over and above the one already set out in the programme for Government if it did not release a sizable amount for investment in job creation initiatives in the economy.  In this context, I am pleased to report to the House that the agreement reached with the troika, in advance of our final decision on the disposal programme, represents a remarkable advance.  When we first encountered it, the troika's position had been that the entire proceeds of asset sales — every cent — should be used to retire our national debt.   However, in return for committing to a disposal programme of up to €3 billion, a more ambitious target than we had provided for in the programme for Government, they have agreed to the retention by us of one third of the proceeds for reinvestment in the economy.  This offers the potential of up to €1 billion worth of investment in the economy from the sale of State assets to provide economic stimulus and support job creation.  We intend to combine these proceeds with other sources of funding.  I agree with those Senators who stated in their contributions that austerity or balancing the books are not of themselves a strategy.  We need stimulus.  However, the recklessness of the previous Administration has deprived us of the normal sources of stimulus.  We are now trying to find resources to invest in job creation.  As indicated, one third of the proceeds of the sale of State assets is one such source.  I have also indicated another source will be pension funds.  Only 2% of the €70 billion in Irish pension funds is invested in this economy, with the rest being invested throughout the world.  We need to bring some of that home.  I believe that is what Irish workers would want.  We are also looking to other sources including the European Investment Bank and so on for stimulus.  We intend to combine these proceeds with other sources of funding, such as those which I have just indicated, including our residual reserve, which is the National Pensions Reserve Fund and third party investment to finance much-needed stimulus.  We are carefully considering how this money can be used to maximise job creation within the economy.In the debates that followed my announcement in February, the claim was made on many occasions that the Government intends to sell off key strategic infrastructural assets and that we will end up selling them off in a fire sale.  To back this up, the previous Government's sale of Eircom has been regularly cited as a cautionary tale.  I assure the House that this Government is very conscious of the Eircom experience.  The programme of disposals which I have announced has been carefully thought through to ensure that mistakes that were made in relation to previous privatisations, most notably Eircom, are not repeated.  For example, in contrast to the sale of Eircom, the Government has made it clear that it has no intention of selling off strategic infrastructural assets as part of the programme now agreed.  It is instructive that when Eircom was sold off it was a communications infrastructure at the front edge of modernity.  We have no intention of selling off our infrastructure.  We are retaining ownership of the gas pipelines, gas interconnectors and the electricity grids.We have agreed to sell BGE's energy business but its gas transmission and distribution systems, including the two gas interconnectors, are not for sale.  We have agreed to sell some of the ESB's non-strategic power generation capacity to reduce the ESB's market dominance, as required under EU competition rules.  However, the ESB and all of its strategic assets, including its transmission and distribution network, will be retained in public ownership.  We have agreed to give consideration to the sale of some of Coillte's assets, which is likely to focus primarily on the harvesting rights of Coillte's forests.  There has been much debate in the other House on Coillte.  What we are selling is trees.  We are not growing the trees for decoration.  We expect them to be harvested and sold.  What we are selling off is a crop.  The land on which the forests are situated is not for sale.  We are only agreeable to dispose of the State's remaining stake in Aer Lingus because the remaining 25% shareholding is no longer a strategic asset as it does not enable the Government to determine Aer Lingus policy in relation to commercial decisions such as the use of the company's Heathrow slots.The position on Coillte, and its assets, is different from that in relation to Bord Gáis and the ESB.  Whereas specific decisions have been taken and announced in relation to the assets that are to be disposed of in the case of the energy companies, no such definitive decisions have yet been taken in relation to Coillte.  The Government has agreed that Coillte is to be included in the asset disposal programme but my announcement in February indicated that further consideration had to be given to how this was to be done.  I have already signalled that any disposal in the case of Coillte is likely to focus primarily on the harvesting rights of its forests, but that is primarily because I wanted to make it clear that there is no question of the Government disposing of Coillte lands.  However, a final decision on how best to release value from Coillte remains to be taken by the Government.  Since my announcement, we have received a number of interesting approaches in regard to Coillte.  We are open to all such discussions.I accept that some legitimate concerns remain regarding some of the wider implications of the proposed asset disposals, in particular in the context of Coillte and its forests.  Among these are the following: a potential lack of public access to the forests for walkers and for general recreational purposes; whether the forests, if sold, will be replanted after the trees have been harvested; the impact of any disposal of Coillte's forests in terms of the climate change agenda and, in particular, the position in relation to carbon credits; and more generally, whether the Government has engaged with the staff interests in the companies involved in relation to the planned disposals.  These are all genuine concerns but I can assure the House that all of these issues were already identified in the preliminary analysis that was undertaken by the interdepartmental working group which reported to Ministers in December 2011.  The group considered a range of State assets identified by Government as potential candidates for disposal, including Coillte.  I can confirm that the Government is conscious of all of these issues and that these will all be taken into account before final decisions are taken by the Government in relation to what Coillte assets are to be sold and how.I am happy to report that significant progress has been made in advancing the disposal programme since I announced its content in February.  Interdepartmental working groups have been established to examine each of the assets referenced in the Government's decision and NewERA, the new holding company under the auspices of the NTMA, has prepared two very thorough financial reports on BGE and Coillte which have now been submitted to and considered by the respective interdepartmental groups.  The Government is committed under the EU-IMF funding programme to outline in detail for the troika by the end of June 2012 the specific reforms that need to be taken, ensuring consistency with relevant EU legislation where necessary to allow for the asset sale programme to proceed and a calendar with indicative timelines for sales.Work is continuing in the relevant Departments and agencies on considering how the issues already identified as requiring resolution should be addressed.  In the case of Coillte and the ESB, these issues will be dependent on the final decisions taken on the particular assets of these companies that are to be sold.  I can assure the House that the Government will ensure that all of the implications of each asset disposal will be carefully considered with a view to mitigating any potential negative impacts associated with the disposals.  This will include ensuring the continuity of access to the forests as a public amenity.I emphasise again that the Government is committed to securing value for the Exchequer from asset disposals and will not be rushed into any fire sales.  As I have indicated in the other House, any asset which does not obtain best and full value will not be sold.  All of the disposals will be transacted via an open, transparent and competitive process and they will only occur when market conditions are right and when adequate regulatory structures have been put in place to protect consumer interests.  As well as making a modest but real contribution towards reducing the State's mountain of debt, the funds released from asset disposals will be combined with funding from the NPRF and used to leverage private finance sources to fund much-needed additional investment in job creating initiatives in the economy.  On this basis, I commend the Government's asset disposal programme to the House.  I look forward to answering any questions which Senators may have.
#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	69	I thank the Minister for coming to the House and for his continued commitment to debating here.  It is hoped this will be an interesting, engaging and honest discussion.  I use the word "honest" in the context of our having been told at various points by the Labour Party, although not so much by the Minister, Deputy Howlin, that the IMF is forcing the sale of State assets.  I note the Minister referred at least once in his speech to the IMF.  I noticed that he dropped the IMF into his speech on one occasion.  It is clear that Government policy is being implemented in this instance, with the agreement of the IMF.  The decision to sell these assets is purely and totally an Irish one and we are debating it on that basis.  We do not object to it.  Over three years ago, I lobbied the former Minister, Brian Lenihan, to privatise the national lottery.  A common feature of the economic crisis, particularly in states of the United States, has been that state lotteries have been among the first items to be sold off.  It should have happened a few years ago in this country.  The organisation of lottery games can be done more efficiently by the private sector.The potential sale of State assets usually causes those on the ideological fringes of Irish politics to get very agitated.  In general terms, my party has no objection in principle to the sale of State assets.  We carried out all of the privatisations in this country over the last 25 years.  Most of them were successful, although some of them were not.  The sale of Eircom was successful in terms of getting money into the State coffers, which is the primary aim of the Government on this occasion.  It was unsuccessful for those who lost out after they had bought shares and also in terms of the roll-out of broadband throughout the country.  The development of competition in the telecommunications industry has been a wide-ranging success.  I do not think every left-wing politician is signed up to Eircom's telephone services.  They are probably getting cheaper deals from its various competitors.  The increase in service levels in the telecommunications sector has been accompanied by dramatic price decreases.  Any sale of State assets must be fully transparent.  The opportunity cost of any sale must be fully understood as well.  We must know what the potential losses are to the State, arising from the sale of an asset, so that we can weigh them against the cash realities that are associated with such a sale.  That applies particularly in the case of Aer Lingus.The findings of the Moriarty tribunal made it clear that when State contracts are not transparent, the whole process can be brought into disrepute.  For that reason, I would like the regulation of lobbyists legislation to be enacted and passed before any of this takes place.  We learned in the tribunal report that politicians are not the only people who are subjected to lobbying.  I am sure public servants do not want to be lobbied, but it can happen.  It is important for the legislation I have mentioned to be enacted to ensure the sale of assets is transparent and in the interests of the public good.  We should never again allow Ministers of any party to have their decisions influenced by lobbying on the part of companies or individuals.  Therefore, the Government must implement the legislation it has proposed.  Fianna Fáil has already proposed a Bill, which was professionally drafted by our legal advisers.  It is open to the Government to accept that Bill as well.It is important to highlight that the Government is not being forced to sell any assets by the troika.  This decision is being taken by Fine Gael and the Labour Party in government.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, confirmed this in the Dáil on 6 October 2011 in response to my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath.  I hope Government Deputies and Senators will accept this when they are questioned about these sales in the months and years to come.  I emphasise that State assets provide considerable returns for the Irish State.  In 2010, semi-State companies paid dividends totalling €129 million to the Exchequer.  In addition, they employed thousands of people who contributed tax revenues to the Exchequer.  I have noted the Minister's assurances with regard to the sale of Coillte.  I had intended to refer to some of the concerns that have been raised in that respect.  It is important to highlight that the Minister has not been definitive in relation to the sale of Coillte.  He said that "a final decision on how best to release value from Coillte remains to be taken by the Government".  I would not have thought the sale of trees would be a particularly radical gesture on the part of a forestry company, although it is important.The issues have been set out by the Minister.  I will not repeat them.  He knows what they are.  While I am pleased that the Minister acknowledged the concerns, I remind him that the Labour Party manifesto stated that "Labour is opposed to short-termist privatisation of key state assets, such as Coillte or the energy networks".  As I have said, we do not oppose the sale of State assets, in general terms, as long as it is transparent and in the best long-term interests of the taxpayer.  The Coillte issue mainly arises because of links with certain people who are involved in other forestry companies and have gone into the media.  I suspect that will be dealt with through the introduction of the regulation of lobbyists legislation and proper competitive tendering and sales.  When I discussed this matter with Senator Barrett earlier today, he referred to beauty contests.  As a solicitor, I was involved in a number of such contests in relation to the purchase of assets.  I refer to the private sector rather than to the public sector.  The beauty contest approach leads to subjective judgment and might not be the best way of getting returns for the taxpayer.It should be possible to sell the retail elements of our semi-State bodies as long as the State retains strategic ownership of the transmission networks of the ESB and Bord Gáis.  Energy security should be an absolute priority for us.  In the build-up to the energy crisis in California that caused the collapse of Enron, the privatisation of the actual networks caused untold harm and led to substantial price increases for consumers in that state.  The lure of short-term financial gain for the Exchequer should not be used as a reason to reduce the capacity of the State to protect its energy needs.Fianna Fáil will support the sale of assets on a case-by-case basis.  We will consider each proposal as it arises and decide whether to support it on that basis.  The Minister commended the asset disposal programme to the Seanad.  It is not possible to commend the programme because we do not know the full details of it.  The last sentence of the Minister's speech was somewhat premature.  We do not know the full details of it.  I presume legislation will have to be passed when each sale is proposed.  In each case, we will decide whether to commend the action and whether to support the legislation.  Unlike other parties, Fianna Fáil does not have to change its previously stated position.  Fianna Fáil is a pragmatic party.  The private and public sectors have worked together over the years.  People can be involved in private business and in public business.  Something that is private can become public by being nationalised.  The opposite can happen too.  Most importantly, I urge the Government to introduce the regulation of lobbyists legislation before any further action is taken in this regard.
#MichaelWDArcy	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-party	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-dob	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	70	As I have said previously in this House, honesty is one of the things that is badly required in this country.  It is disturbing that on a number of occasions, people have stood up in the Seanad and Dáil Chambers to try to rewrite history.  It has always been the case that the positions are taken before advances are made and one moves on.  The position that one initially took does not change, however.  As time moves on, people claim they did not quite take the position attributed to them.  My clear memory is that the original memorandum of understanding provided for the sale of State assets.  An exact figure might not have been set out, but there was a clear and explicit understanding in the memorandum that assets would be sold and the funds used to pay off debt.

#MichaelWDArcy	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-party	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-dob	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	72	There was no equivocation about that.  I ask the Senator not to change that circumstance, which was quite clear.  The result achieved by the Government means that some money will be used to pay off debt and the rest of it will be used for job creation.  Everybody in this Chamber and the other Chamber agrees that the Government achieved a good result which will benefit unemployed people by helping them to get back into the workplace.  That is the core objective of the Government.  I accept that some people have a political ideology which dictates that assets should never be sold.  If that ideology were adopted in all instances, we would continue to own the routes that coaches used to take many years ago.  Those are the legacies we have.  We have to advance with them, like everything else.  It is interesting that at one stage in the past, we were told we should not lose the shipping lines we had.  As the aviation sector grew, fares decreased and new companies came to the market.  That shows how circumstances can change.The funds that will accrue to us from the sale of State assets should be reinvested in other assets that will increase in value over time.  As time moves on, those assets will become outdated like the former assets I mentioned.  I remind the House that the ESB sold six generators in 2005 and 2006.  One of them — Great Island power station — is in the constituency shared by the Minister and me.  It was purchased by Endesa Ireland, which invested €300 million in it.  In the next few weeks, some 450 people will start working on a massive construction project at the power station.  It will be one of the biggest construction projects in the State.  The Bord Gáis gas pipeline which is being advanced from Kilkenny will serve two major towns in County Wexford, which formerly had no gas.  That demonstrates the benefit of selling assets.  There was no furore when the Great Island facility was sold.  There now seems to be a furore, an ideological break, and it is said what is occurring is appalling and terrible. It is not.I want to raise an aspect of the sale of State assets that is different from that raised by the Minister.  It pertains to the assets of the State organisation NAMA.  It is a State company that has purchased properties, hotels and other assets within the construction and development sector to the value of €30 billion.  I am firmly of the view that the sooner NAMA puts on the market thousands of units such that we are able to find a base in the construction sector, the better.  The construction sector would then be able to advance again.There are 300,000 people unemployed in the country, not 440,000.  The live register states 440,000 are not working, which is correct.  At the peak of the boom, there were 140,000 unemployed.  There are 300,000 people unemployed who were not working four years ago and every single one of them wants to work.  Of the 300,000, it is estimated that 100,000 are from the construction sector.  Although we can install water meters — this is an advancement in that people will be employed — we need to get the construction sector moving.  I am not talking about state aid or anything of that nature but proposing that if NAMA put a certain number of its best units on the market, we would find a base.  When we find a base, the market will flow and people will start to reinvest.  It is crucial that we address this.  While it is not within the bailiwick of the Minister, he should note the assets are within a State company.Let me touch upon Irish Water.  Its establishment is a step in the right direction.  The proliferation of local authority bodies and companies involved with water is a result of our legacy of conducting business.  We have considerable expertise in some areas and a lack of it in others.  We should not require a local authority to purchase expertise from environmental engineers, etc., when the expertise is available in other local authorities, including those in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  I will not mention the one in Galway because of its history.  The expertise exists in a certain area.  If Wexford County Council wanted to advance a project, it would have to hire staff from an environmental company and pay the relevant fees, yet there are local authority staff in the network in Dublin who might have expertise to pass on.  The benefit of Irish Water is that we will no longer be paying money unnecessarily and we will be able to move towards a top-class, world-class water service, which we do not have at present.

#SeanDBarrett	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	80	I welcome the Minister and support his statements.  This is a very necessary part of setting the economy to right on foot of the problems that date from 2008 and before.  The McCarthy report, on these issues, was launched on 24 April last year and is, therefore, approximately a year in circulation.  It contains much useful information on the companies that the Minister has been talking about.  The preface states: "Our basic message is that, given the over-borrowed nature of the state's balance sheet, asset disposal is inevitable."The Minister chose this as his theme earlier and I agree with him.  It is also an opportunity to consider where there is entrepreneurship and initiative and who is not performing up to the required standard, particularly at this time.  There is a series of criticisms in pages 17 to 29 of the McCarthy report implying that, from 2008 to 2010, State company debt more than doubled.  The overall profitability has sharply deteriorated since 2007.  The report refers on page 29 to the lack of a dividend culture.  There were, therefore, some non-performing staff whose circumstances we must consider.On reading page 18 of the report, I noted some State monopolies have overindulged in mass market advertising which cannot be justified by reference to commercial requirements.  To use one of the Minister's phrases, "capture" was being attempted by hiring large PR departments.  It is interesting that the McCarthy group refers to this.Now that I am in the presence of the Acting Chairman, who is from the Kingdom, it is worth noting that when Mr. Mark Clinton sold the Dairy Disposal Company in 1974 to Mr. Denis Brosnan and company, it was worth £1.15 million.  Last week, it was worth €5.9 billion on the stock exchange.  It is a privatised company that has gone on to serve this country, its shareholders and customers worldwide absolutely splendidly.  It has also served the people of Kerry who invested money in it.The Irish Continental Line was referred to by Senator D'Arcy.  It had to be shut down because it engaged in irresponsible leasing deals with a gentleman in Hong Kong.  Its successor company is currently worth just under €400 million and it is not the annual menace to the public finances that the former company was.With regard to the Ryanair shareholding, Ryanair is worth €6.4 billion, 12 times more than Aer Lingus, which was the airline we had when we had a monopoly.  The identification of State companies with a desire to have a monopoly and influence public policy and regulators unduly must be faced up to.We have raised approximately €8.5 billion, it is estimated.  Mr. McCarthy referred to €8.2 billion.  In his report, he did not include, but referred to, the receipt of approximately €250 million.  That is extremely valuable.  The adjustment up to the time Mr. McCarthy was writing accounted for a figure of €20 billion.  We, therefore, got 40% off by the disposal of assets.  Life for Members of Parliament, including Ministers, and taxpayers would have been tougher had we not raised the €8.5 billion.  It is useful.One of the views put forward under the Culliton report was that the State should have a moving portfolio of assets and should not get stuck in a sector and be captured by the management at a very high costs.  Some managers earn what the Taoiseach earns.  We should have a moving portfolio and seek new investments all the time to generate the job creation capacity about which the Minister was talking.If, on the island of Ireland, Larne port, which is privately owned, is the most efficient, one can learn lessons therefrom.  Is it worth thinking about the privatisation of some of the ports?  They will compete because we have enough of them.  Mr. McCarthy recommended Rosslare port for privatisation.The same applies to airports.  There are enough airports to compete with each other in the United Kingdom and there are investors.  The Senators from Clare have asked whether there is any future for Shannon Airport under current arrangements and whether it can be sold separately, with the debt transferred to Dublin?  Will Dublin Airport Authority, the Aer Rianta complex, sink under the weight of the debt?  I propose to the Minister that he consider the separate sales of Cork and Shannon airports on condition that they compete, and perhaps the separate sale of one of the terminals in Dublin in the hope it might produce price competition between the two terminals.  There is excess capacity at Dublin Airport.The privatisation of the telecommunications company Eircom is regarded from time to time as an example of privatisation that did not work.  It is worth noting what Mr. McCarthy said about that.  His report reads: "The majority of those states that currently out-rank Ireland in international comparative exercises on broadband penetration and speed also privatised their incumbents in the telecoms market, in some cases earlier than Ireland did, and these private entities delivered the necessary infrastructure investment."  I have no objection that is based on the fact that Eircom was sold for more than it was worth subsequently.  It is about time that the State won on some of these deals.  Perhaps we sold Eircom to the wrong people, but the same mistakes were not made in respect of other privatised telephone companies.  There is an undue nostalgia for the old telephone monopoly, which saw high charges and low levels of technology.Senators Byrne and Michael D'Arcy referred to open sales and no beauty contests.  When the chairman reported, someone suggested — not entirely flippantly — putting the assets on eBay.  It would save a great deal of money on tribunal costs.The privatisation policy has much to contribute and has already contributed €8.5 billion.  In general terms, I commend the Minister on what he is trying to do to set the public finances in order.

#JohnGilroy	unknown-#JohnGilroy-party	unknown-#JohnGilroy-dob	unknown-#JohnGilroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	85	It is good that we have the opportunity to discuss this important issue.  Opponents of the Government and ideological opponents of the initiative to review the sale of State assets have put about a great deal of wilful misinformation.  Undoubtedly, many people have strong opinions on the issue.  The semi-State bodies have served the country well, but this should not be interpreted as meaning that their retention in the State's hands would be the most appropriate use of resources in the changed economic climate.I wish to raise a genuine question that I hope will be discussed with political honesty.  Senator Byrne made a similar point.  I hope that we can put aside our political differences and find a common political pathway to national recovery.  On this road, factors that we never believed would need to be re-imagined must be re-imagined, including the relationship between the semi-State bodies and the State.  This reconsideration forms part of the agreement with the troika, despite Senator Byrne's anxiety about presenting it as an independent proposal.
#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	86	I quoted the agreement directly.
#JohnGilroy	unknown-#JohnGilroy-party	unknown-#JohnGilroy-dob	unknown-#JohnGilroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	87	It is important that we be realistic and understand that, while the economy is in a precarious situation within the terms of the agreement, we could not survive outside those terms.  Some commentators have professed surprise at the decision to review the sale of State assets, but they should not be surprised, as this was well flagged in the programme for Government.Many genuine questions arise.  For example, one question that is immediately obvious is whether it is in the best interests of the State to own two electricity generation and supply businesses that are competing with one another.  This question needs to be reflected upon and answered.There has been much discussion in the House and elsewhere about fire sales, the national interest and the family silver.  If we remove the emotive language surrounding the debate, we will see the necessity of raising funds.  Classical Keynesian economics states that, in times of recession, states should stimulate their economies by borrowing money and investing it in infrastructure.  This is all fine and well, but Keynesianism is not applicable in this instance.  We cannot raise funds.  Who would lend to us?  We must be imaginative and look at ways of pulling the general wisdom of the State together, raising money and investing wisely.I congratulate the Minister on successfully renegotiating the position on the sale of State assets.  We are now allowed to reinvest €1 billion of the proceeds of the proposed sales in jobs, which are necessary if we are to achieve recovery.  This is a significant concession.Another important milestone on the journey is the significant announcement that we are to establish a new public utility, Irish Water, which will provide public service employment of up to 3,000 jobs through the investment of almost €3 billion.  This development must be welcomed.  A strategic partnership between the new water utility and Bord na Móna will provide an investment of up to €500 million for the construction of a new reservoir in the midlands.  My colleague, Senator Whelan, has been vocal on this issue.  Without his support, this necessary step forward would not have been taken.  It has been planned for nine years and will ensure a high-quality water supply, which is vital for the population and industry.  Key matrices of indication for attracting and retaining foreign direct investment, FDI, include our corporation tax rate, our skilled workforce and a quality, secure water supply.  We compete for FDI against countries such as Israel and India, in which respect the supply and quality of water makes a difference.I urge the Minister to use his influence to ensure that no time is lost in advancing this vital project to the planning stage.  I hope that we will see results shortly.  As the Minister stated, the creation of a new public utility company demonstrates the Government's commitment to the provision of quality public services.  A review of State assets is necessary and in the country's best interests.Most of the comments I wished to make have been made, but I will ask the Minister two questions.  Given the creation of a new water utility, must any part of the proposal to sell elements of State companies be reviewed?  In terms of the proposed sale of the national lottery licence, could we be given a commitment to the effect that there would be no diminution of funding for good causes?
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	88	I welcome the Minister back to the House and thank him for taking this debate.  It is remarkable to hear a Labour Party Senator referring to ideological opponents to the sale of State assets.  This shows how far the Labour Party has travelled down the path, as it is not long since that party was opposed to the sale of State assets.Whatever way the Government tries to dress it up, selling State assets is a short-term measure with a long-term cost.  Perhaps more than any other, this decision exposes the Government's lack of joined-up or long-term thinking.  The projected sale value of the asset disposals will make little or no difference to the State's overall debt burden.  Despite the Government's assertions to the contrary, privatisation is not the panacea of perfect competition.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party have failed to produce evidence-based analysis to support their plans.  We have been told that only non-strategic assets will be considered for sale by the State.  How transport, forestry and energy assets can be deemed to be anything other than strategic is beyond me.Retaining the State's significant 25% share in Aer Lingus is vital if we are to ensure Ireland's connectivity with Europe, the US and the rest of the world.  Trading the airline's Heathrow slots would be inconsequential to a private company, yet their retention is of strategic importance to this island's interests.Now more than ever, Coillte is an important rural employer.  Selling its harvesting rights to a private company that will buy our forests is a barmy decision.  The Minister asserts that we are only selling the trees, but those form the integral part of Coillte's asset.  The Government should be working with Coillte to develop the significant potential of the forestry sector for timber production, biomass and eco-tourism.Commercial semi-State companies have created tens of thousands of sustainable jobs, benefitting hundreds of thousands of families for decades.  The ESB is self-financing and has contributed €4.3 billion to the economy through taxes and dividends in the past ten years.  It and Bord Gáis together have paid €2 billion in dividends, twice what the Government intends to spend on its one-off jobs investment.  The Government has other funding streams for a jobs stimulus, including the National Pensions Reserve Fund and, possibly, the European Investment Bank.

I am happy to engage.I thank all Senators for their contributions.  I do not intend to engage with Senator Byrne, as discussing whether this initiative was contained within the original memorandum of understanding would be a sterile debate.  I can say honestly, with my hand on heart, that in my first encounter with the troika, within weeks of coming into office, it understood that there would be what it called an ambitious sale of State assets.  That understanding was made explicit to me but the Senator can take it as he will.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	96	My party negotiated with Fine Gael on a programme for Government.  Part of that programme involved the sale of €2 billion of assets because I believe in a stimulus.  We cannot simply have a balanced budget approach, necessary as that may be for us to get out of our economic difficulties.There are three strands to the problem.  The first is that we need to pay our own way by balancing our budget over time.  We have set out on a path to doing that by 2015.  The second strand is a stimulus package.  God knows, the potential for this is limited at present because, as Senator Gilroy noted, nobody except the troika is prepared to give us money at anything approaching an affordable rate.  The troika is setting out conditionalities for the money it is giving and it is not allowing its funds to be used for stimulus measures.We have to think outside the box in this regard.  Sometimes we have to hang up ideology to get out of a crisis.  My party is a passionate supporter of State enterprise because we believe it was a driver of industry and job creation at a time when the private sector would not get involved.  The success of Bord na Móna, the ESB and Aer Lingus are testament to that.  However, one cannot be trapped forever in the same groove.  We have to think about the next generation of State companies and how to deleverage companies that are successful.  Let them be dealt with by the private sector and use the money to build up the next generation of State jobs and enterprises which private capital will not provide.  Irish Water is one such proposal.I agree with Senator Byrne regarding the transparency of the process.  As far as the Government is concerned, it will be entirely transparent.  I have already issued a protocol that my staff and I will not be involved in it in any hand, shape or form.  I will not meet anybody who expresses an interest in any State company.  Interested parties will have to work through a channel that I have set up at arm's length.  I have sent that protocol to everybody who is involved in the process.I gave a full report on the lobbyist legislation to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service yesterday in the context of discussing the progress being made on several Bills.  The draft heads of the whistleblowing Bill have also been circulated.  This is complex legislation and I look forward to receiving the committee's feedback on it before June.  The lobbyist legislation is being worked on and we will publish it before the end of the year.  A freedom of information (amendment) Bill will also be introduced this year.  I have circulated my initial thoughts on that Bill to the Government.  My objective is to undo the harm done by the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003.  However, I do not want to simply repeal the 2003 Act because approximately 40 of the 65 or 66 provisions contained in it were recommended by the Information Commissioner.  I want to wind back certain measures as well as broaden the Act's remit.  This work is ongoing.I agree with Senator Byrne on energy security.  This is why we are retaining the energy infrastructure that provides the distribution paths for gas and electricity.  Senator MichaelD'Arcy's description of the experience in Great Island in Wexford is pertinent.  The power station at Great Island was sold to a Spanish company, Endessa, which has since invested hundreds of millions of euro in it.  The State got a good return from the sale and the by-product is that we are able to get natural gas in County Wexford.  However, the notion that the ESB should not be allowed to sell a power station for ideological reasons is daft.  Bord Gáis was established as a gas distributor but it subsequently decided to enter the electricity business.  Would a wind farm suddenly become a strategic asset simply because it is purchased by Bord Gáis?  I advise Senator Cullinane that not every tree is a strategic asset.  We are growing them as a crop and we need some flexibility in this regard.It is not my direct area of responsibility but during the negotiations for the programme for Government I was taken by the NewERA concept, which would achieve the objectives to which Senator Barrett and others referred.  We have not always received great value from our semi-State companies.  They have on occasion invested in projects that were not necessarily in the interest of Ireland Inc.  Some of them have made proposals to invest offshore for the sake of building corporate empires rather than the best interests of the Irish State.  I would prefer State companies to invest their resources in Ireland and we will insist on that through the newERA entity, which will allow proper corporate governance and the leverage of borrowing at scale.  These are innovative initiatives.Senator Gilroy referred to ideology and Keynesian investment.  That is a point I made strongly.  Several Senators spoke about Irish water.  Irish water is an important new State company but a degree of confusion has arisen because of the way things were said on Sunday before a formal decision had been made.  Irish water will be a new, entirely State owned company with a capital value of up to €3 billion.  We need a proper water infrastructure because water is probably the most valuable of resources.  It is certainly as important as electricity, gas, the road network or broadband.  We have an indifferent water supply, however.  When I was Minister for the Environment, I investigated group water schemes.  The EPA produces an annual assessment of water quality and the quality of some of the schemes is far from satisfactory.Every place in the country should have decent water quality and enjoy consistent water supplies without scarcity.  There are real challenges in this regard, as we have seen in the south of England where supplies are at risk.  We need to establish an integrated national company with the best skills available and that is what Irish water will offer.  Yesterday's decision will have no impact on the sale of Bord Gáis Energy.  We are selling off the energy generating component of that company.  Irish Water will be a subsidiary of the infrastructure company, Bord Gáis Networks, until the day when it, perhaps, becomes big enough to stand on its own.

The Minister should sell the convention centre.  I am sure somebody is interested in it and the sale would save €750 million, or close to €1 billion when interest is included.I was one of the first people to call for the disposal of Coillte because of the manner in which it was being run.  In 2008 Coillte disposed of immature forestry for a net profit of €10.1 million.  In 2009 it sold immature forestry worth €33.8 million for a profit of €25.4 million.  It has been selling immature forestry for several years.  However, I am concerned that the market value of the defined benefit pensions for Coillte's employees rose from €159.7 million in 2008, which was €10.2 million less than liabilities, to €123.9 million in 2009, or €98.3 million less than its liabilities.  I hope that any funds accrued from the sale of the felling licence of Coillte will not be pumped into the pension scheme.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	103	I am very concerned at the reports that the State assets on offer will raise nowhere near €3 billion.  I am also concerned that the €1 billion that has been earmarked for reinvestment in the economy to boost job creation, which the Minister mentioned, is also said to be at risk.  If the money is not raised, what will the Government cut next?  My overall view is that we should exert extreme caution in the manner in which we decide to sell any State assets.  However, there may be positive developments that cover some of those areas.  The OECD study found overwhelming support for the idea that "privatisation brings about a significant increase in the profitability, real output and efficiency of privatised companies".  Several notable studies have also shown that fully privatised companies outperform partially privatised ones because the government influence may distort commercial decisions.  I am interested in hearing how the Minister would react to that situation.  Some of the figures coming particularly from Britain, Hungary and elsewhere in the past have shown that when state assets were sold they were sold at very bad value.  We need to be very careful.  Is there a danger of a fire sale and that we might sell assets at the wrong time and not get value for money which could do us much more harm than would otherwise be the case?
#AideenHayden	unknown-#AideenHayden-party	unknown-#AideenHayden-dob	unknown-#AideenHayden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	104	The sale of State assets in periods of economic crisis is not unusual.  I remind Senator Byrne that the largest State sale ever was the sale of State housing starting in 1988 when in three years we sold off 30% of our entire housing stock.I ask the Minister to take the opportunity of the privatisation of State assets not just to look at a share sale which is the most common way of privatising State assets, but to consider the co-operative model with the State as a partner eventually passing the asset into, for example, worker control.  I also ask him to take the earliest opportunity to look at a national strategy for State investment.  This debate should not just be about the way we sell State assets but needs to be a wider debate on State assets generally.  For the sake of argument, in the future we should particularly consider the potential role for a State company to operate in the area of food security.  Successive Governments have failed to defend and increase the fishing fleet.  There may be a potential for a national fleet.  We face enormous challenges in retrofitting our housing stock.  There is potential for a State company to play a role in that area.  It is nothing but good corporate governance for the State to consider its basket of investments in State companies at any moment in time.  It should not just consider disposals but should look to the future of the State's role and a strategy for future investment.

Needless to say there is money to be paid back in that regard.  He also spoke about pensions, a point raised earlier by Senator Byrne which I forgot to answer.  Of course the full quantum of money in every case will not be realised because pension and other issues will need to be addressed.  However, we will give a full transparent take on it in order that Senators will know the full volume of money.Senator Quinn, as a man very experienced in selling product, will know one does not announce one's price in an auction.  Needless to say we have done very careful due diligence through the NewERA entity in testing the market — as one would.  The product we are bringing to market, to use a colloquialism, is one for which we know there is a robust price.  As I said in my initial commentary, if we do not get fair value for any asset, we will not sell it.  It is as simple as that.  That is understood and I have stated that from the outset.Senator Hayden talked about a co-operative model.  There is an imperative for us to get revenue in.  While she talks very positively about future State companies — there may well be further State companies beyond Irish Water — where there is market failure.  She instanced the food industry.  That is one of the areas of the economy that is taking off.  While there are very big drivers in the State sector, such as Bord Bia, to market product, there are many successful private companies converting fundamental raw product and adding value in the food and fisheries area.  Of course there is a State research company in the fisheries area developing new market product.  We will look at the general concept of getting value for existing companies by privatising either in part or in whole.  We will then take that money and leverage it with private capital into the next generation of State companies so that we can create new jobs and meet market need that is not met by the private sector.

The soft and easy and runaway options were given to the banks.  The reason we are discussing selling off State assets is because of the incompetence, greed and uselessness of the banks.  The most important State asset after water — the Minister is right — is forestry.  We cannot live without either in the sense that we need water but we breathe through the trees as most people in the Visitors Gallery will know.  We can live without heat as many people do and we can live without electric light as my grandmother did — as I am only 37, maybe my great-grandmother did it.  While we can live without these two elements, we cannot survive without forests because it is through forests that we breathe.  If we are to sell off our State assets, I suggest, as Senator Hayden did, that we must in parallel have some consensus about manufacturing.  When I was in Taiwan recently Chairman Chang pointed out that we in Ireland spent a lot of time talking about the financial centre, painting it and putting curtains in it, but we forgot about manufacturing and making things.  If we are to sell off our State assets we must have in parallel what the Minister calls a stimulus.  However, what does everybody mean by stimulus?  I am listening to this word and the manufacturing of jobs, but do we mean actual manufacturing?  What programmes and procedures has the Government put in place for the use of the money we will get from selling off the heartbeat of our country?

The Government has also agreed to sell some of the non-strategic assets of the ESB.  He did not state that the existing underground and overground ESB interconnectors were not for sale.  Has that been omitted?  I realise how strategic our electricity interconnectors are.  There are east-west interconnectors to Scotland and England and one is proposed for England to France.  I am anxious that they would not be up for sale and I ask him to confirm that for me.
#LorraineHiggins	unknown-#LorraineHiggins-party	unknown-#LorraineHiggins-dob	unknown-#LorraineHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	108	Following the sale of State assets, there is a general pattern of job losses as a result of investors seeking to acquire the best possible return on their investment when such a programme is undertaken by any government.  We do not want a situation in which we are introducing a job creation fund with some of the moneys we will acquire from the sale of some of the non-strategic assets while at the same time we may have a close to corresponding job loss figures from the sale of these State assets.  On that basis I ask if the relevant Department has conducted a thorough analysis of the job losses from the non-strategic State assets which are for sale.  Further to this point I would also ask that any job creation initiatives employed on foot of the sale of these State assets would take careful consideration of regional deficiencies as regards employment figures so that places such as Galway East will properly benefit from any such job creation programme following the sale of these assets.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	109	Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell rightly assigns the cause of our problems to the banks but I would not be quite so limiting.  There was not only incompetent and greedy banks but there was also incompetent and greedy developers and political individuals in cahoots with both.  There is enough awful blame to spread around.  I refer to the Senator's specific point about manufacturing, which is a good one.  I recall being in government before and when we left government in 1997 the economy was based on manufacturing, making and exporting goods that people wanted to buy.  Then someone thought of the great wheeze in 2000 or 2001 that we did not need to make anything but instead just inflate the price of land.  Our streets could be more valuable than the streets of Paris and we could all be rich.  It was a national pyramid sale.  Unfortunately, that pyramid has come crashing down and we are left with the reality now.  Senator O'Donnell asks a very pertinent question as to what we will do with the money.  As I have indicated, two thirds of the value of the assets sales will be used to retire debt.  This is not a bad thing of itself, although people say it is a modest contribution to the mountain of debt.  However, every modest contribution we need to make is good but we want to use as much as possible in order to leverage further private sector investment in job creation.  An evaluation of proposals will be carried out.I opened a conference for project managers this morning in the Aviva stadium.  They were listening to a presentation on the Spirit of Ireland project, which most members of the Government will have heard.  This is a significant project.  It is a matter for others to make determinations on it.  There are many extraordinary ideas and we need a proper evaluation of them and be open to listening to them.Senator Brennan spoke about non-strategic assets and I can give him an absolute assurance — which may have been omitted in my contribution — that all the networks belonging to the electricity grid, ESB networks, including all the interconnectors, will remain in State ownership, 100% guaranteed.Senator Higgins referred to the job loss figures that will be inevitable.  I do not agree it is inevitable.  We have given careful thought to what we should sell and I am very careful in this regard.  To put it bluntly, a daft policy has been pursued for the past ten years, or the past five years at least and this was alluded to by a Senator.  There was notional competition in the energy sector with two State companies actually vying with each other and one of them was not allowed to reduce prices.  I ask what sort of competition it is when a company is legally debarred from reducing prices in order for another State company to be allowed to capture a share of the market.  We were all offered 14% to switch from one State company to another and now we can get another 14% if we switch back.  That was the previous Government's idea of competition.  Our idea is in accordance with European competition law which would require the ESB to sell off some of its power generating capacity so that it would not be an overwhelmingly dominant player.  We would sell off the generating capacity of BGE and have a strategic private player in the energy market.  This would make for real competition.  Hopefully, this will not mean a loss of jobs but rather it will create jobs because it would push down the price of electricity for everyone if there is real competition as opposed to the made-up competition that passed for competition during the previous regime.This is the Government's specific strategy.  Our plan hits a number of points.  It will allow the ESB to continue as a vertically integrated State company because it would be downsized to meet competition law.  We will need a European derogation from the directive in order to do this.  Normally, the distribution and generation would be required to be disagregated but we are trying to hold it together.  We think this will be possible and also to have a second significant player in the energy generating business in Ireland.  As I said in reply to Senator Quinn previously, significant international players are interested in the Irish energy market but the proof of the pudding will be in the eating; expression of interest is one thing but putting significant cash on the table will be another.  We will explore all those options.

Has the Minister considered taking from all three companies the renewables part of their generating capacity and merging this into one clean, green company?  I know there are a number of green equity funds who would be prepared to invest in that scale of a company.  Such a merger might not be that difficult as the expertise in all three companies would be available and there would be an amount of downsizing.  The benefit of the downsizing is that the companies would then be in a position to compete further for more national projects of that type.

I know that due to unfortunate circumstances the State bought a pub in Limerick recently.  I think the OPW at one point owned a pub somewhere else in Limerick.  Such items of property should be sold because they should not be in the possession of the State.
#IvanaBacik	unknown-#IvanaBacik-party	unknown-#IvanaBacik-dob	unknown-#IvanaBacik-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	112	I thank the Minister for his comprehensive and very clear outline of the current Government position on the sale of State assets.  He has set out very fairly the nature of the programme for the sale of assets and he has given the House certain reassurances that are particularly important to those of us who would clearly prefer not to see us selling State assets.  However, as he said, we are in particular and exceptional economic circumstances, the gravity of which not everyone even in this House appears to appreciate, as evidenced in the debate and particularly with regard to the comments of the Senator from Sinn Féin.The Minister has very clearly set out a number of important principles that will guide the sale of assets, including that there will be no strategic infrastructural assets sold, that we have learned from the Eircom debacle and that a sale will only take place when market conditions are right and, crucially, one third of the proceeds from the sale will go to stimulus packages.  Other Senators have asked for the details in this regard.  My specific question is about the timeframe and whether there is any constraint on us as regards the timeframe within which the sale of assets should take place.  Can we take our time in assessing market conditions?  Are we required to sell within the timeframe, for example, of the EU-IMF programme?  That is something that is not quite clear.Others have mentioned the new Irish Water utility, which is to be set up under the auspices of Bord Gáis Energy.  This offers immense possibilities and is an exciting prospect.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	113	With regard to Senator Michael D'Arcy's commentary about an amalgamation of clean energy bodies, it is not envisaged that we will set up another State company in the energy sector.  The intention is to have one vertically integrated company offering a variety of options in terms of its generating capacity in order that it is not dependent on any one component part.  If it is a State company, it is important that it has a generating capacity that is as diverse as possible so that it is not totally dependent on one source of generation.Senator Byrne talked about an inventory of all State assets.  That is a good question, because we did not even have an inventory of all State property, which I instructed the OPW to obtain early on and which has been put together.  I dare say there are properties and so on that may not be known in a general sense but only to some agencies and so on.  I know from colleagues in the other House that even to get a list of all State agencies is very difficult, because many State agencies were established 50 years ago and never formally abolished.  They exist notionally but not in reality.  The Senator makes a fair point.Senator Bacik spoke about the timeframe for sale.  As I indicated previously in my reply to Senators Barrett and Quinn, we have done due diligence in that we have tested the market, and we know there is a robust and healthy interest in the product, if one likes, that we are putting on the market.  That will need to be tested, but I envisage the realisation of significant resources for the State next year.
#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	114	I have a short question about an area for which I think the Minister is responsible.  When a company is wound up or struck off, its assets traditionally go to the Minister for Finance, which I presume now means the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Is there an inventory of these assets?  Is this something the Department has considered in any great depth?  These assets become the Minister's corporate property at that stage.

#SeanDBarrett	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	117	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 8, subsection (2)(f), line 5, after “tests” to insert the following:"may be determined by the Minister with the advice and consent of Seanad Éireann".I welcome the Minister.  We had a very good debate on these issues yesterday, including the Minister's response to the points we made.  We were developing ways to bring road safety down to a lower level and looking at particular target groups, such as pedestrians, motorcyclists, cyclists and single vehicle car accidents, comparing the high rate of accidents on undivided highways with those on divided highways.I tabled this amendment in that spirit, where I propose there is an exchange of views.  Section 4(2) (f) will now state: “the persons, and the qualifications and training of persons, who may validly carry out test, may be determined by the Minister with the advice and consent of Seanad Éireann”.  It is very important that we have people of the required standards carrying out these tests.  It is fair to say that the industry has become more professional in recent times and the testers should be at least as good as the people they are testing.  In the PricewaterhouseCoopers report I noted with some concern that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport testers were reduced from between five and six to one in the years up to 2006.  The general principle is that when people go into the test centre and test vehicles they should immediately impress people there.  These are people from whom we can learn and who add value to the process.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	118	Section 4 provides that the regulations may make provision for persons and the qualification and training of persons who may carry out CVR tests.  I as Minister will make the regulations and they will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The House, if dissatisfied, will then have an opportunity to annul them within 21 days. This is the safeguard provided by section 3.Prior advice and consent from the Seanad to determine the provisions in secondary legislation would be unusual as the Oireachtas delegates powers to Ministers to make secondary legislation.  I am not aware of situations where a partial delegation of powers to one House by regulation would exist and it may be that a requirement to seek the advice and consent of the Seanad prior to making specific provisions in regulations would be unconstitutional under the separation of powers doctrine.  Accordingly, I am not in favour of accepting this amendment as I am confident that the legal basis for dealing with persons who would carry out tests is sufficiently provided for in this Bill. I will ensure that considered attention will be given to the making of the associated regulations within the policy framework of the Bill. Essentially what we will do is when we produce the regulations in the normal way, they will be laid before the Houses, allowing the Houses to annul them after 21 days. It would be unusual to require a Minister to get the prior consent of one House before making regulations. I do not propose to accept the amendment.

In page 9, subsection (4), line 23, after "consent" to insert "and that the Garda Síochána were so notified".The Minister and I discussed previously in the House the scenario envisaged in this amendment.  If somebody pleads that his car was stolen or was used without his consent, it would help if he told the Garda Síochána, rather than use this as his defence when the vehicle is involved in a crime or in an offence.  I am trying to strengthen the hand of the Garda so that it is at least notified that the vehicle is stolen, before it is used for criminal purposes.  How can the Garda look for vehicles that are stolen if it has not been notified?  Then it must try to deal retrospectively with the crimes in which the vehicles were involved.  It is a requirement, if one wants to use the defence that the vehicle was stolen, that the Garda should have been informed, which would assist it in solving crime.We discussed this issue before when the Minister was introducing earlier safety regulation.  I would be interested to hear his response on whether it is possible to use this as a requirement if somebody wishes to use the defence that his vehicle was stolen and he did not know who was driving it.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	121	We did discuss this suggestion during a debate on previous legislation.  I understand the Senator's intention in this regard but I do not agree with his logic.  Essentially, what this would mean is that people can use as a defence the fact that their car was stolen.  Cars get stolen and are then used for a crime.  If I were to accept this amendment, the person making the defence, would have had to inform the Garda that his car was stolen.  One might not know that the car had been stolen.  I have ministerial transport and I have not seen my own car in ten days.  I actually do not know whether it is still there.  It could be gone and it could have been used in a crime in the past ten days for all I know.  It could happen in families that one of the children or a spouse could take the car and commit a crime and the owner would not know that at the time and would not have told the Garda at the time, therefore could not use that as a defence.  I understand the Senator's intention but I think his logic is false.

#SeanDBarrett	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	124	I move amendment No. 3:
In page 9, subsection (5), lines 27 to 29, to delete all words from and including ",without" in line 27 down to and including "Authority," in line 29.The purpose of the amendments is to delete the provisions that dilute the State's role.I agree with the wording of section 6(5) up to the word ‘shall':  "A certificate purporting to be signed by an officer of the Authority and to certify that on a specified day or days, or during the whole of a specified period, no certificate of roadworthiness was in force in respect of a specified CVR vehicle shall...".  However, the State's role is diluted by the following words "without proof of the signature of the person purporting to sign the certificate or that he or she was an officer of the Authority,".  That is current in the adjoining jurisdiction in regard to extradition warrants.  Should we not do the documentation properly?  The vehicle could be worth €200,000 and if we want to restrain it, the documentation should be properly certified.  I do not know the reason that we would wish to do this without proof of the signature of the person or without proof that the person was so authorised.  It seems a strange exemption for the State to seek in implementing the provisions of the Bill.  I think the onus should be to do things by the book.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	125	These amendments propose to delete wording from section 6(5), section 22(7) and section 23(2) and that would have the effect of requiring personnel from the Road Safety Authority to be present in court every time there is a need to prove that a certificate of roadworthiness was not in force at the time of the offence, as in section 6, or that a person was not authorised, as purported to be a CVR test operator or a tester in section 23.Similarly the proposed amendment to section 22(7) could place a considerable burden on the authority if an officer required to approve the validity of a signature on a document containing a decision by an appeals officer.  The wording of the provisions published is consistent with existing legislation, including road transport legislation and to change these provisions in line with the Senators suggestion would place an unworkable burden on the Road Safety Authority.  The current wording places the burden on the defendant to prove that the signatures or declarations are some how invalid.  The removal of this text would result in further evidential requirements on both the authority and the Garda when taking prosecutions and as such would increase the administrative burden and reduce the efficiency of handling prosecutions in cases.  Essentially our concern is that, as may have been the case in the past, Garda and road safety officers would be summonsed to court on every occasion to verify their signature.  We are all concerned about the amount of time that Garda and other officers already spend around the courts waiting for cases.  This would essentially allow a solicitor to insist that everyone turn up and prove that the signature was his or her signature.  That would be impractical.  I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendments on that basis.
#SeanDBarrett	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	126	I agree with the Minister.

The wording of the provision, as published, provided that an application for motor tax would have been accompanied by a certificate of roadworthiness, where appropriate, before the motor tax could be issued.  The word "accompanied" was restrictive and would have caused problems for online motor tax applications.  Accordingly, the amendment broadens the provision and a decision has been taken to reflect more closely on a similar provision already in legislation regarding the requirement to have an NCT certificate.  The underlying principle has not been changed and the amendment simply seeks to improve the format of the provision.

In page 13, subsection (3)(d), line 1, after “have” to insert “trained personnel as per section 4(2)(f),”.My amendment refers to section 4(2)(f) where the Minister decides the qualification and training of persons who may validly carry out tests and I want to extend the provision to this section.  It is vital that all people that work in the sector meet the training requirements that the Minister has the power to introduce under section 4(2)(f).  I want an assurance that trainers and testers are the same standard as that we aspire to achieve in the industry.
#CaitKeane	unknown-#CaitKeane-party	unknown-#CaitKeane-dob	unknown-#CaitKeane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	130	When I read the amendment I thought designated qualifications was a good idea.  The amendment asked for experience that is superior to the minimum required for appointment under section 4(2)(f) which designated a certain level of experience.   Does the Minister think a superior knowledge is required?  Qualifications should be designated when a person is testing anything.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	131	The amendment proposes the inclusion of a reference to section 4(2)(f) that relates to people who carry out CVR tests.  The proposed amendment to section 11 is not required as section 11(1)(d) provides that the Minister shall not authorise a person to be a CVR test operator, or amend or renew an authorisation of a CVR test operator, unless the Minister is satisfied that a person has access to the testers necessary for carrying out the tests.  All such testers will need to be authorised as a CVR tester under section 17 which explicitly requires compliance with any regulations made under section 4(2)(f).The amendments to sections 21 and 22 cannot be accepted as the provision deals with the designation of deciding officers who will make decisions and authorisations related to both CVR test operators, the person or body corporate operating the test centre and the CVR tester, the person in the test centre who physically carries out the test.  Section 4(2)(f) relates to the training and qualifications of people who carry out the tests and does not relate in any way to the deciding officer provisions in sections 21 and 22.Again, the proposed amendments to section 33 are incorrect.  The section provides for appointing persons to CVR inspectors who have responsibility for roadside vehicle inspections and reference to training and qualifications of personnel who carry out tests in test centres would not be applicable here.  Accordingly, I ask the Senator to withdraw his amendment.I hope I am correct in my belief but Members may have mixed up two sets of people in the amendment.

#SeanDBarrett	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I used the legal analogy that the Minister can appeal to a higher court.  In that sense, the deciding officers and appeals officers should be at least as skilled as the people who test the vehicles in the first instance.  I am concerned that it would become an administrative role and detract from the operation of the system by saying that the inspector fellow was not bad but the guy deciding on the appeal had never seen a truck before or driven a bus in his life.  I am trying to re-enforce the credibility and operation of the system.To give a wider background and in the minds of economists, the Wright report outlined how few qualifications in economics were held by people working in the Department of Finance.  The Bill has the important task of promoting road safety and the people adjudicating on appeals should have the necessary skills.  It works in the courts because judges of the Supreme Court are senior to the High Court and District Court.  My amendment aims to build in that level of professionalism and Senator Keane seeks it also.  The Minister should consider that in order for the system to work, the hauliers and bus people who appear in these circumstances should experience a level of expertise that makes the process credible and believable for them.  I mentioned courts but I do not want people to lodge a court appeal subsequently.  It is a difficult task but the deciding officer must command the respect of all of the parties to such a dispute.  I leave those considerations for the Minister and ask him how best we can work them out.  This is a highly professional area and general administration, talents and qualifications may not be enough.  I await the Minister's response.
#PatONeill	unknown-#PatONeill-party	unknown-#PatONeill-dob	unknown-#PatONeill-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	134	With regard to the responses by Senators Barrett and Keane seeking higher qualifications for deciding officers, is that not already in the job description?  Anyone taking up the post would have to meet the job specifications, pass an interview and have attained certain qualifications before securing the job.  I presume such requirements would be already built into the job specifications.  A tester position is a promotion and a successful candidate would need certain qualifications and knowledge which an interview would reveal.

They could be somebody who is a little different.  It is often the case that somebody who is asked to review a decision, an appealed decision or even sit in the place of an appeal judge, does not necessarily have the same skills or come from the same background as the people on whom they are making an appeal or decision.  I do not want to restrict us to only having appeals or deciding officers who have come through the system.  We would like the flexibility of having other people who are appropriately qualified to decide such cases.

In page 13, subsection (4), line 11, after "decision" to insert the following:"within the period referred to in section 13”.Section 13 refers to a period which is not specified and is at the Minister's discretion.  In the section he requires people to respond to him and my amendment tries to ensure the he also responds to people and that the same turnaround time for a response to correspondence applies to the Minister as the applicant.  When I raised the issue with the Minister before he said there is a quick turnaround time.  By way of background, the judge presiding over the Swords Express case mentioned that the delay by a Department had doubly disadvantaged the applicant.  The Minister is entitled to require people to respond to him and I hope that he will give an undertaking that he will be equally diligent in responding to them.

If the Senator is willing to withdraw the amendment, we can return to it on Report Stage.  We may in our own amendment require the Minister to reply within a defined period or as soon as is practicable.  I do not want to commit necessarily to the period referred to in section 13.  In principle, I agree with what the Senator is proposing.  There was but a short period between Second and Committee Stages and, therefore, I would like the Senator to resubmit the amendment on Report Stage and allow us the week in the interim to consult the Road Safety Authority and Office of the Parliamentary Counsel with a view to accepting it or proposing an alternative form of words that would achieve what the Senator proposes.

In page 14, subsection (3), between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:"(f) the elapse of time since the offences and any penalty or sentence suffered on foot of the conviction.”.I am somewhat concerned that after people pay their fine or serve some time in jail, they find themselves debarred from certain activities and career paths.  I support the Government on not  building Thornton Hall but believe that prisoners should have some possibilities to develop their careers on their release.  If a very long time has elapsed since an offence and the penalty has been paid, can we say that the individual in question has discharged his or her debt to society and can therefore engage in the activities covered in this Bill?  We referred to driving trucks in this regard on the last occasion.There have been some legal cases concerning taxi licensing.  People who served jail sentences can go straight back into business after having paid their penalties.  The Garda has found it difficult to persuade many judges on this matter.  The judges have a view that there are penalties and that we should not keep adding extra penalties and prohibiting people for a very long time from re-entering the commercial world on having discharged their debt to society.  If somebody has had a clean record for a very long time, it should be covered, as proposed in my amendment. There ought to be some occupations that people are allowed to have after having discharged their debt to society. That is the purpose of the amendment.

First, many of the issues will be covered under the spent convictions Bill, which is progressing and will be returned to the Cabinet on Tuesday.  This will mean many of the convictions in question will be considered spent.Second, somebody with a conviction must submit five pieces of information: the nature of the offence; whether the conviction is one of a number of convictions for the same or different offences; any penalty or sentence suffered on foot of the conviction; any disqualification or forfeiture imposed on foot of a conviction; and whether the offence was committed in the course of or in connection with a business concerned with the testing, inspection, maintenance or repair of vehicles.  We are confident, based on this Bill, existing legislation and other criteria, that the phrase "the nature of the offence" meets the Senator's concern.  When somebody is giving the information required, he or she will be required to state whether the offence was committed 15, 20 or 30 years ago, for example.

#SeanDBarrett	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	143	I move amendment No. 9:
In page 18, line 8, after "suspension" to insert ", given an increased risk rating under section 39”.This was a matter on which the Minister made important points on risk rating.  Section 21 states: "The Minister shall designate persons in writing to be deciding officers for the purpose of deciding on the issue, offer, amendment, renewal, suspension and revocation of an authorisation."  I want to include a phrase such as "or to appeal risk rating".  I refer to a general procedure of the jurisdiction of the deciding officer.I am unhappy in general — the Minister indicated many words to this effect himself — that we are heading towards circumstances where there are three verdicts: guilty; not guilty; and risk rated.  If we are to have risk rating, as referred to under section 39, could it come within the jurisdiction of the deciding officer?  I am unhappy about the whole idea of it for the reasons I have outlined.  The Minister outlined some of them yesterday.  Somebody will have to decide the risk rating and there will have to be an appeals procedure for those who do not like their rating.  The view that seemed inherent in section 39, that it somehow involves a highly scientific technique and is definite, does not hold true.  It should be open to appeal, probably in the review of the deciding officer, or perhaps not included at all given the dangers I have mentioned in respect of a system with the verdicts guilty, not guilty and risk rated.  The fear is that if an individual were rated as being of extremely high risk, the decision would be appealed. If an individual is given an extremely low rating and there is an accident, is the State liable for rating that individual at the bottom the scale of danger? I am generally unhappy about the risk rating idea. Many of the views in this regard were expressed by the Minister yesterday.I refer to risk rating in general, not just risk rating pertaining to transport.  Actuarial science has not advanced to the degree that we can declare people to be risky or not risky on a scale of one to nine without going through due process.  Perhaps the Minister will consider dropping the provision.  Decisions on risk rating will be of major importance to people in the transport industry.  Perhaps risk rating should be part of the deciding officer's functions.  That is the purpose of the amendment.  Alternatively, perhaps risk rating should not be in the Bill at all.  This is a radical alternative.  I was most interested in hearing what the Minister said yesterday on risk rating and will be interested in hearing his response in this case also.

The proposed amendment would restrict the power of a deciding offer to suspend based on risk rating alone.  The section that provides for suspensions and authorisation and the criteria to be applied is section 18.  The amendment would undermine the powers of the deciding officer.  Section 18 is the key in that it establishes the basis on which the Minister may suspend an authorisation as a CVR test operator or CVR tester where the Minister determines that the person is so authorised.  A large number of criteria are outlined in the section.  From my reading of the legislation, this means the power to suspend is not based on risk rating.  A risk rating is just soft or supporting information, and a suspension could not happen based on risk rating alone in any case.  The criteria on page 17 would have to breached for somebody to be suspended.
#SeanDBarrett	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	147	I welcome the Minister's response.

In page 21, subsection (3), line 42, after "Authority" to insert the following:"following prior consultation with the Data Protection Commissioner".While fully supporting the idea of increased communication and the sharing of information, I am also concerned about the rights of the individual and check and balances.  Will the Minister agree to insert a clause whereby the Data Protection Commissioner will be consulted about the important issue of information sharing relating to this section?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	152	Section 28(4) provides for regulations to be made on the use of information, transferred, shared and exchanged under section 28.  It is my intention that the Data Protection Commissioner will be fully consulted in the development of these regulations.  Paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of section 28(3) allows the Minister to prescribe additional persons who can have access to and use of the integrated information technology system that will be in place called CoVIS, the commercial vehicle information system.  The Data Protection Commissioner will be consulted if additional such persons are prescribed under section 28(3).  I hope this commitment is sufficient for the Senator to withdraw his amendment.

This provision simply allows the authority, like any other State agency, to issue guidelines from time to time.  We had considered putting these into the Schedule.  However, on balance, it makes sense to allow for some degree of flexibility when it comes to guidelines which are not part of the legislation.  A public authority should be allowed to issue guidelines.  Saying that, one will meet people in the industry who will argue a matter is in legislation but could guidelines be issued to explain in common sense terms what it means. The Road Safety Authority needs to be able to issue guidelines for users affected by the legislation as to what certain provisions mean.
#SeanDBarrett	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	155	I move amendment No. 16:
In page 28, subsection (1), line 28, to delete "is given a numerical rating" and substitute the following:"is given a broad category of "above average risk", "average risk", "below average risk"."This concerns the risk rating provisions which have already been discussed.  It appears to be part of an EU requirement.  My amendment proposes not to give a numerical rating in this regard.  To impose a penalty on somebody by statistical inference elevates actuarial science to a level it does not have, particularly compared to the law.  Either a person has a conviction or not.  The numerical rating comes from regulations laid down by the European Parliament.  I propose we break it down into three categories, "above average", "average" and "below average".I do not mean to make silly analogies but last Saturday at Aintree the actuarial and statistical evidence claimed a favourite would win the Grand National when it was in fact won by a horse at odds of 33 to one.  This shows how inexact the evidence was on one afternoon.  I do not believe in imposing statistical penalties on people.  They are innocent until proven guilty.  Imposing penalties on someone because there is a statistical risk that something could happen seems to be strange.  If they have committed offences, these should be recorded, a penalty which I support.This proposal, however, introduces another category to guilty or not guilty — risk rated.  I am concerned this approach is gaining credence which could do serious injustice to people.  They might look like people who may get up to dangerous activities but they have not yet done so and may surprise us in the end.  This brings statistical inference into the law which is undesirable and elevates actuarial science to a status which it should not have.  That is my general concern about all of section 39.
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	156	My concern is at a much more grassroots level.  How will the introduction of the risk rating system work?  Will it be put on a certificate of roadworthiness?  Will the test operator be required to put a sign up on their business?  How will people know what is happening?  The legislation states, "a vehicle, premises or person is given a numerical rating based on the relative number and severity of any infringements of requirements" and, therefore, "a higher rating is checked more closely and more often than vehicles, premises or persons with a lower rating."  Do the premises relate to the test operators or are they the premises where the vehicles are kept?Am I right in assuming this is a transposition of European law?  The Bill cites directives of the European Parliament and the Council, and the European Communities (Road Transport Activities Checks) Regulations 2007.  If this system is introduced, might it prejudice a haulier's ability to generate business because competitors may claim they have a safer record based on infringement rates and risk ratings?  The infringements could be minor or technical, however.  I am curious about the background to and justification for this measure.  Can the Minister provide further information on why it is being introduced in Ireland?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	157	The measure derives from a European policy which we have signed up to as a nation.  The general view is that it makes more sense to focus enforcement activities on those with a high risk of offending than to carry out random checks.  This principle applies for everything from soft information in potential child abuse cases to transport enforcement, and it allows those who have a clean record to go about their business without being subjected to frequent enforcement checks.  The authorities, in turn, are able to focus their enforcement procedures on those who carry the highest risk ratings based on past infringements and penalties.The question that arises is whether the rating system is robust.  We do not want to see a situation whereby somebody gets a rating that cannot stand up to scrutiny.  I am assured that ratings will be based on objective criteria.  To the best of my knowledge it will not be a requirement to display the risk rating number and it will not necessarily be public knowledge.  However, individuals will have access to their own ratings and associated information.
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	158	I raise the issue because of the potential for the ratings to be used in an anti-competitive manner if they are publicly known.  Perhaps they will be subject to the Freedom of Information Act, for example.  The personal information held in the penalty points system is not released into the public domain other than where individuals are required to provide information for insurance purposes.I am curious to learn more about the experience in Europe where, presumably, the system is already in operation.  As the Minister noted, the question arises of how robust it can be made.  Taking up Senator Barrett's point about being guilty or not guilty, there is a grey area which seems to suggest that if an individual's rating is higher than his or her competitors, the latter could use it for anti-competitive purposes.  It is a new concept for Ireland but we have signed up to it and I want to tease it out.  I am sure it will work properly in practice.  I do not want to hold up the Bill unnecessarily but it might be helpful to the House if the Minister were to provide further information.

For example, an individual who has committed a number of tachograph offences carries a higher risk rating and is more likely to be targeted by the enforcement authorities based on his or her previous form.  This measure is simply an extension of that.  It is designed to allow targeted enforcement against those with form and less enforcement against those with a good record, in accordance with the EU directive.I have been informed by my departmental officials that while every individual or operator will have access to his or her risk register, the information will not be open to others.  It will be kept private, like penalty points.

I welcome the Minister's assurance about the number not being published or used as evidence.  I now understand that the information will be held internally in the RSA to help it decide where it should allocate resources and it will not adversely impact on operators in the transport industry.  That would require a conviction to be secured.The general background has to be borne in mind.  The vehicles used in the industry are expensive and the insurance industry also carries out policing.  Somebody who forms a partnership with an insurance provider will be rewarded for good behaviour.  I appreciate that the provision came to us from Europe but safeguards existed heretofore in the insurance industry and our safety record was relatively good.  Less than 10% of fatalities are caused by the buses and trucks covered by the measure.The new powers appeared to be draconian and I would not generally support the introduction of this principle to any wider application of the law.  However, if this is normal intelligence that helps the RSA to determine where breaches are most likely to occur it puts the matter in a better light.  I withdraw my amendments on risk rating for this reason and perhaps we will consider the matter again given that it is a new principle in Irish legislation to allow an enforcement agency to retain information about citizens who were otherwise not guilty of any offence.

In page 30, subsection (7), between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:"(d) an appeal procedure against the risk rating contended.”.This section states that the Minister may make regulations for a number of things that are listed.  Some of them refer to the risk rating.  My amendment seeks to provide for an appeal procedure for risk rating to add to the other provisions in the section.  As other Senators have said, this could be extremely damaging to a person's business.  If he is given a rating, he will know it and he may wish to achieve a better rating.  Given the damage that could be done even in the restricted circumstances the Minister mentioned in his last contribution, there should be some way of appealing that risk rating should it be unsatisfactory to the applicant.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	172	Given the short time we have had between Second Stage and Committee Stage, I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment to give us some time to consider it.  At the moment there is no appeals mechanism for somebody who has a risk rating.  The amendment proposes introducing such an appeal mechanism.  The legislation provides that a person may make submissions stating that a risk rating is unfair and that the number should be reduced.  The Senator is proposing something stronger, which is a proper mechanism of appeal.  I would like to consult the RSA before making a final decision on whether to accept the amendment.  I ask him to withdraw the amendment and table it again on Report Stage.
#SeanDBarrett	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	173	I thank the Minister and will withdraw it, pending Report Stage.
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	174	I endorse what Senator Barrett said and I am also grateful to the Minister.  Section 39(7) states:The Minister may make regulations providing for—(a) the making available to a person referred to in subsection (3), on payment of a prescribed fee, of information as to how a risk rating was determined,(b) the making of submissions by such a person to the Authority in relation to the risk rating, and(c) the revision or maintenance of a risk rating following consideration of submissions.There seems to be scope for the Minister to tweak the legislation slightly.  However, I take his point that he needs further consultation on it.  Having established a structure as outlined in section 39(7) to permit it to go to the gates but not push it through, there may be an argument for permitting some form of appeal.I can find no reference to sanctions.  Having already established that the risk rating is now at a point where the individual obviously feels that it is unfair, I assume if a person believes it is unfair and therefore incorrect he or she is will go down the road as prescribed in the legislation of paying the fee, getting the information and putting in a submission that it may have some adverse effect on his or her business.  For example, he or she may ultimately be prevented from taking the vehicle on the road.  If a person is availing of the facility provided for in the legislation, it would seem to suggest that the risk rating has reached such a point that it is actually interfering with his or her business and there may be sanctions.  That is why I am interested in ascertaining what are the sanctions.  If the risk rating is at a high level, is the vehicle put off the road?  Unless it was having some adverse effect on a person's business, why would he or she seek information as to how the risk rating was determined?  I may not be making myself totally clear.  The facility provided for in the legislation seems to suggest that it is permitting somebody who has received a high risk rating that is going to have an adverse effect on him or her, or his or her business, to take these steps.  What are the Minister's views in that wider context?

That vehicle will be stopped more often and the relevant test centre may be inspected more often.  The mechanism allows for a person, who feels he or she is being unfairly targeted, to challenge his or her risk rating.  Between now and Report Stage we need to ascertain whether the provisions to make submissions and seek to have the risk rating changed go far enough or whether we need a formal appeal mechanism.  A high risk rating does not result in sanctions — it just means the person will be targeted more often for inspections and enforcement.
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	176	I wish to take this discussion to its ultimate conclusion.  If the risk rating is high enough that the inspectors more regularly inspect the individual, the test centre or the vehicle, does it reach a point of no return?  Given that there are no sanctions, how long will that process continue until the inspector says: "Sorry, but your risk rating has continued to be high and you have not taken the necessary steps"?  I presume this is to do with maintenance of the vehicle as much as anything else to ensure it is roadworthy and it is not a danger to the public or the driver.  Where does it eventually arrive if the risk rating continues to be high?  If the inspections are becoming increasingly more frequent, at what point does the inspector say it is enough and instruct the owner to take the vehicle off the road or have it fixed?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	177	There cannot be any sanction based on a high risk rating.  It just means inspections will be more frequent.  As the number of inspectors is limited, there are not as many inspections as we might like.  There will not be thousands of inspectors out there spending all their time on one set of premises.  It just means that some people may not be inspected regularly and others may be inspected more regularly.  If, for example, a vehicle or operator had a very high risk rating and as a result was subject to ongoing inspections and nothing was found, it would indicate the risk rating was wrong.  Therefore, such an operator should not be sanctioned just for having a high risk rating.
#PatONeill	unknown-#PatONeill-party	unknown-#PatONeill-dob	unknown-#PatONeill-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	178	While I understand Senator Mooney's concern, if the risk rating applies to a vehicle, that can surely be rectified through proper maintenance so that when the vehicle is inspected again and is satisfactory the risk rating should drop.  An individual can amass penalty points when driving a car.  Can an individual's risk rating be reduced at any stage?  Under the penalty points system, they expire after three years.  Will a similar provision apply to an individual's risk rating?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	179	The Bill does not go into that level of detail but it will be based on objective criteria and obviously if previous offences from a long time ago gave an individual a high rating, then the person's risk rating may reduce.  It is not a case that an individual's risk rating would keep increasing up to a certain point.  The Bill does not go into that level of detail and it would not be appropriate to do so.
#PatONeill	unknown-#PatONeill-party	unknown-#PatONeill-dob	unknown-#PatONeill-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	180	With road traffic offences a driver reaching 12 penalty points is suspended from driving.  How far can an individual go with risk rating?  A maximum point may need to be specified.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	181	Penalty points relate to actual offences which reach a certain point at which sanctions are imposed.  This is different and is a risk rating that has been ascribed to an individual based on history, form and information.This is not in the legislation.  It must be done by regulation and worked out in more detail.  I imagine that every couple of years a risk rating would be ascribed to an individual or an operator based on their form and the information held on them in the preceding five years.
#NedOSullivan	unknown-#NedOSullivan-party	unknown-#NedOSullivan-dob	unknown-#NedOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	182	Following up on Senator O'Neill's very good point perhaps the weakness of the Bill is that while it prescribes for a risk rating it does not prescribe for a way in which it can be reduced.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	183	It does in the sense that somebody can make a submission.  What was referred to earlier is that one can apply for information and make a submission requesting that it be reduced based on the information being wrong.  I presume one would want it reduced rather than increased.  The Bill does provide for this.
#SeanDBarrett	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	184	As we will discuss this issue again on Report Stage, I will withdraw the amendment.
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	185	I have a brief question on people found guilty of an offence under these sections.  Does this relate in any way to the earlier discussion on risk rating?  Is it to do with the roadworthiness of the vehicle or the fact that the test centre did not carry out the test properly?  To what do these penalties and prosecutions relate?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	186	Will the Senator ask the question again?
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	187	To what do the sections quoted here relate with regard to summary convictions and class A fines?  To what do these relate in the context of the proposed legislation?  Is it to do with the roadworthiness of the vehicle or the incompetence of the driver, test centre or test operator?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	188	They relate to offences under section 4(4), 12(6)——
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	189	It is not a major problem if the Minister does not have the information to hand.  I was merely curious as to whether it related in any way to risk rating but the Minister has clarified it does not.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	190	No, it does not.  These are actual offences.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	191	This amendment will not change the meaning or intention of the provision.  It is solely a technical drafting amendment.
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	192	I seek clarification.  This section amends the Road Traffic Act 2002 whereby using a vehicle without a certificate of roadworthiness will incur penalty points.  How many penalty points?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	193	Five penalty points, the same as at present.
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	194	I thank the Minister.
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	195	If my heart ruled my head it would urge me, like my colleagues, to oppose this in principle because in effect it will transfer driving licence operations from local authorities to the Road Safety Authority.  The Minister has explained this and one of the key points he made which encouraged me and which I thought was very relevant is in the context of the concerns expressed about the removal of driving licence administration from local authorities and centralising it.  Concerns are still being expressed about a loss of jobs but the Minister has gone some way to suggest under the Croke Park agreement there will not be a loss of jobs.  Another point worthy of airing, which had not occurred to me and I had used the argument in reverse, is with regard to local authorities having become leaner and more efficient because of the reduction in staff.  The Minister suggested, and perhaps he will confirm this, that the transfer to a more centralised form of driving licence administration will release and free up existing local authority staff to work in other areas.  I am sure this must be a good step.  I presume this is what the Minister stated.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	196	It is.  Under the Croke Park agreement there will be no compulsory redundancies so people will not lose their jobs.  Many people are leaving local authorities and retiring and the number of people working in local authorities has fallen considerably in recent years.  Local authorities are now quite stretched.  This measure will reduce the number of people required to run the system from 200 to 60.  Therefore, 60 will transfer to the RSA and 140 can be redeployed within local authorities to other functions, whether housing or planning.  Staff will be freed up in local authorities to work in sections which are now very stretched.
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	197	As a matter of interest, how will the transfer of the 60 staff members be achieved?  Will they be recruited through the local authority system from existing local authorities?  Because of the embargo they cannot be recruited from outside; therefore, I assume they will come from the existing workforce.  Has a methodology been worked out for this?  Will the unions be involved?  Has this point been reached or is it something the RSA will be obliged to do rather than the Minister?
#PatONeill	unknown-#PatONeill-party	unknown-#PatONeill-dob	unknown-#PatONeill-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	198	I have a general question on driving licences.  I welcome the introduction of the credit card-type licence with a photo ID.  I know it will be an official document but has any agreement been reached with other companies whereby it will be accepted at airports?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	199	To answer Senator Mooney, and I will double check this in case I am wrong, but my recollection is that the 60 staff will be based in the RSA in Ballina and they will transfer from local authorities in the area such as Mayo and Sligo and other government offices in the area.  People are willing to go because the RSA is considered to be a good place to work.With regard to driving licences I have had preliminary discussions and Aer Lingus will accept it for travel in the common travel area with the UK and it will be accepted broadly as an ID.  Ryanair has indicated it will accept it when it becomes well known and accepted throughout the EU which I suspect will not take too long because it will be the standard licence for the entire EU from 1 January 2013.
#PatONeill	unknown-#PatONeill-party	unknown-#PatONeill-dob	unknown-#PatONeill-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	200	In the same way that a passport has an individual number and is tied to an individual will the new driver licence be linked through a PPS number to an individual?
#NedOSullivan	unknown-#NedOSullivan-party	unknown-#NedOSullivan-dob	unknown-#NedOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	201	I welcome the Minister's confirmation that the Croke Park agreement will be adhered to in this instance and there will be no compulsory redundancies.  Senator Mooney referred to the further diminution of the role of local authorities.  I hope this will not be a recurring theme in his Department or any other Department.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	202	What will be on the driver's licence is set down in an EU directive and includes name, date of birth, address and other information.  It does not include the PPS number.  We considered it and ideally in the future perhaps we can merge the new social welfare ID with the driving licence and have a single ID.  In large parts of the United States the Department of Motor Vehicles, which is the driver licensing authority, is effectively the authority which produces IDs.  The licence has a slash through it if one is not allowed to drive.  However we cannot do this yet because we are governed by the directive and it does not include the PPS number.With regard to local authorities it will not become a trend.  I have some sympathy with the Senator's comments in that regard.  My Department has been transferring some functions to local authorities.  For example and as the Senator knows, harbours have been transferred.  As part of the reforms led by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, we will propose to transfer a number of other functions to local authorities.  They do not want some but we will see what their response is.

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	205	This amendment brings clarity to the existing provisions, particularly where a person has been convicted of a drink driving offence under one section, for example, driving while under the influence of an intoxicant, and subsequently convicted of a drink driving offence under another section, for example, being in charge of a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	206	This is a minor amendment to address a drafting anomaly in existing legislation that was discovered while examining the provisions in the context of the developing Bill.  This small change will ensure that a person will not be available to undergo a driving test unless he or she has displayed on the front of the windscreen of his or her vehicle a motor tax disc and an NCT disc.  It changes "or" to "and".
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	207	This amendment creates a new section 51, which will delete section 37 of the 1961 Act.  Section 37 relates to the transfer and endorsement of new licences and will not apply following the introduction of the plastic card licence in January.

The end of that era should be recorded.

#AverilPower	unknown-#AverilPower-party	unknown-#AverilPower-dob	unknown-#AverilPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	213	This matter relates to Ireland's relationship with China in a human rights context.  I fully appreciate the trade opportunities available in growing China and that it is very much the land of opportunity for foreign businesses.  I appreciate also that China is a major economic player and that improving our relationship with the Chinese Government is a key plank of the Government's overall economic strategy.  However, while China is very much open for business to the outside world, it is also home to some of the gravest human rights abuses in the world.It has been well documented by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Falun Gong and other groups that China is home to arbitrary imprisonment without charge or trial and that hundreds of human rights lawyers and political opponents of the regime have been imprisoned or locked away from their families.  The Chinese Government recently admitted that China's most prominent human rights lawyer had been in detention for the previous year and that his family had not been notified where he was.  There has been widespread persecution of religious groups and minorities, in particular during the past ten to 15 years with the repression of Falun Gong.  Falun Gong practitioners, many of whom are active in Ireland, have been routinely subjected to arrest and to what the Chinese call "re-education", namely, sending people to labour camps where they are tortured, with women threatened and subjected to sexual assault in an effort to force re-education on them.  Organ harvesting is now also an issue.  It has been stated that some members of the Falun Gong organisation have had their organs harvested.I appreciate that there are different schools of thought in regard to how the western world should engage with countries like China.  I studied international relations at college and appreciate that many people would say that the best way to deal with these countries is to engage with them and that over time, as they become more economically progressive, they will come to respect political and civil rights and discontinue repression of their people.  However, like other countries, we have been working with the Chinese Government during the past ten years in particular, and, if anything, the evidence is that things from a political point of view are getting worse rather than better.  I acknowledge there has been huge economic progress but evidence is that political repression is worsening.  In the wake of the Arab spring last year, there was a greater crack down on opponents within China.I recognise the economic context of the Government's engagement with China.  However, Ireland has a proud history of raising human rights issues even when difficult to do so.  As chair of the OSCE and in the context of our holding the EU Presidency next year, we have a responsibility to use our voice on this issue.  We have done so previously when the Chinese premier was here ten years ago, at which time I was a student union officer in Trinity and one of our students, Ming Zhao, had been arrested in China for taking part in Falun Gong and was detained in a labour camp for two years.  The Government raised the case with the Chinese premier when here and Ming was subsequently released.During the recent visit of the Vice President of the People's Republic of China, Mr. Xi Jinping, Ming said: "Words are very powerful" ... "And my release was proof that a small country like Ireland can make a difference."  I ask that the Minister, in his continued engagement with the Chinese Government on economic matters, ensures we do not lose our soul.  While undoubtedly there are economic opportunities for us in engaging with China, they should not come at the cost of silence.  Perhaps the Minister of State will say if the Government raised the ongoing human rights violations with the Chinese regime during the recent visit of Vice President Xi Jinping to Ireland, whether these issues were raised during the State visit to China, whether they have been raised in general bilateral relations with China and if the Government has raised them at European level.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	214	I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.  Human rights are and have always been a priority of successive Irish Governments and a key plank of our foreign policy.    The Government is concerned about the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners in China.  Yesterday, officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade met with representatives from the Falun Dafa Association of Ireland and discussed ways in which human rights issues, including those relating to the Falun Gong, are raised with the Chinese authorities by Ireland and the European Union.  Freedom of religious belief and expression is discussed regularly with the Chinese authorities during bilateral meetings and at European Union level.  At these meetings, the Government reiterates the great importance Ireland attaches to human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.Through the formal framework of the EU-China human rights dialogue, which was established in 1995, the EU continues to share with China its experience in the field of human rights protection and promotion and continues to urge China to take clear steps to improve the human rights situation.  Arbitrary arrests and imprisonment, treatment of ethnic minorities and persecution of the Falun Gong are also raised by the European Union as part of regular political dialogue, as well as during specific human rights dialogue with China.Human rights are a constant and important issue of dialogue and discussion with the Chinese authorities at national and European Union level.  In the course of the recent visit of Xi Jinping, the Vice President of the People's Republic of China, the issue of human rights was raised at a variety of levels, including directly between the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Vice President.The Taoiseach recently returned from his first official visit to China.  During the visit, the Taoiseach and Premier Wen Jiabao released a joint statement establishing a strategic partnership for mutually beneficial co-operation between Ireland and China.  This new strategic partnership will facilitate practical, effective and result-oriented co-operation to further develop the bilateral relationship.  It covers several important sectors including education, tourism, agriculture and food as well as science and technology.  The two sides agreed to maintain the momentum of high-level exchanges and underlined the leading role of such exchanges for the development of bilateral relations.The strategic partnership, which is a major step forward in bilateral relations, provides for a strengthened political and economic dialogue between China and Ireland and promotes closer consultation and co-operation between my Department and its Chinese counterpart.  The strategic partnership reaffirms the commitment of Ireland and China to representing and safeguarding human rights.  As indicated in the joint statement, Ireland and China will conduct exchanges of expertise in governance and rule of law on the basis of equality and mutual respect.  As China develops, we hope further progress will be possible in ensuring individual rights are enjoyed by all Chinese citizens.  We will continue to address these matters in a frequent and regular dialogue, including in human rights dialogue and bilateral discussions, in a spirit of mutual respect and co-operation.
#MartinConway	unknown-#MartinConway-party	unknown-#MartinConway-dob	unknown-#MartinConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	215	I thank the Cathaoirleach for facilitating me speaking on this matter earlier than arranged.  A scheme under the auspices of the Equality Authority for a number of years was funded by the European Social Fund and facilitated small and medium-sized enterprises having equality training provided on site by consultants.  This applied in particular to human resources.  It facilitated companies with 50 employees or fewer to ensure all employees were not just treated equally but also knew how to treat customers with respect and equality.It was regarded as an extremely worthwhile scheme.  I spoke to a number of companies that benefitted from it.  I did not just speak to the owners or managing directors but also to unions and workers in the companies.  It ensured people working in the company and the management, supervisors and line managers understood equality legislation, how to implement it practically and how to ensure equality was respected and legislation was adhered to, technically and practically, in the day-to-day job.  The scheme has been discontinued.A consultant from County Clare, Kenneth Buchholtz, provided the training very successfully for a number of years for a number of high profile companies in the Shannon free zone and the mid-west region.  He is the source of my information and research.  No one seems to know why the Equality Authority or the Department have discontinued the scheme.  It was cost neutral from the point of view of taxpayers because it was funded by the European Social Fund.  Is the European Social Fund no longer providing financial support for the scheme or has the Department decided to channel money to alternative schemes?We have worked hard to ensure we have good equality legislation.  During the lifetime of this Government, we will ensure the quality legislation will be superior but there is no point in legislation unless it is implemented and becomes reality in people's lives.  The scheme was beneficial to companies without the necessary resources for equality officers on the payroll.  I am bemused by the scheme being discontinued.  Was there negative feedback or are the resources unavailable?  I hope the Minister of State has good news for us to the effect that the scheme will be reintroduced.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	216	I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, who is unavailable, for which I apologise.  I thank the Senator for raising it on the Adjournment.I emphasise the Minister's continued commitment, and that of the Government, to promoting good employment and equality practices by all employers in Ireland, including those in the SME sector.  There is a body of evidence that such practices, in addition to improving the welfare of workers, have advantages for firms in respect to stimulating innovation and improving competitiveness.The scheme to which the Senator refers is one of the activities undertaken by the Equality Authority under an overall equality mainstreaming approach programme.  The programme was set up under the human capital investment operational programme in Ireland, which is running from 2007 to 2013.  Administered by the Equality Authority, the equality mainstreaming activity is jointly funded by the European Social Fund and from the Equality Authority's grant-in-aid provision, to a maximum of €4 million over the seven years of the European Social Fund programme.The overall objective of the programme is to contribute to improving access to the labour market for specific groups experiencing barriers to employment.  The programme does this by supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, providers of vocational education and training, and providers of labour market programmes to make institutional changes to combat discrimination, to promote equality and to accommodate diversity.There are a number of distinct strands to the overall programme.  Support packages are provided to providers of vocational education and training and labour market programmes and to trade union and employer networks.  Funding is also available for research to support the knowledge base on vulnerable groups across the nine discriminatory grounds under equality legislation.  Funding is available to develop resource materials to support good practice in combatting discrimination, promoting equality and accommodating diversity.Consultancy support is provided for small to medium-sized enterprises, either in the form of sectoral projects, or individually under an SME grant scheme.  Under the grant scheme, small businesses have been offered from one to four days' consultancy support by expert equality trainers and facilitators to put in place equality policies and practices, which is paid for directly by the Equality Authority.  In the first four years of the programme, spending on the SME grant scheme amounted to €759,000.  Some 282 individual SMEs benefited from direct interventions of this nature.  The scheme has not operated in 2011 and 2012.  The Department's ESF budget line to the Equality Authority was reduced from €260,000 to €150,000 in 2010, with a commensurate reduction in activity on this programme.The selection of individual projects for funding is a matter for the project management, within the criteria set out and agreed with the European Social Fund for the overall programme.  The Equality Authority receives advice on the work plans for this programme from a national framework committee that comprises the social partners, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Finance and other stakeholders.  The Minister understands that the national framework committee, while acknowledging that the objectives of the SME grant scheme remain valid priorities for the programme, decided in early 2011 that it would not be prudent to operate the SME grant scheme in that year.  It suggested that a sectoral project approach might be an effective mechanism for engaging with the SME sector in the current difficult economic environment.  Such an approach was pursued by the programme in 2011 and 2012.  It is open for discussion.It is not in dispute that individual businesses and their employees and customers have benefited from this scheme and that it would be of value for it to continue.  The Minister supports the decision that has been made by the Equality Authority, which was a valid one in the difficult economic and budgetary context we face.  The Minister has been advised that the Equality Authority has not closed the door on reinstating the SME grant scheme in the future, if and when the budgetary outlook is more favourable.  I thank the Senator for raising the important topic of employment equality on the Adjournment.  I will be happy to reply to any further questions he might have.

That the door is being left open is a cause for hope.  We all hope that many new companies and indigenous enterprises will establish in this country and employ 20, 25 or 30 people.  If such companies were unable to access equality training, it would be a retrograde step.  We can have all the legislation we want, but if it is not implemented on the ground in practice it will have little effect.  I support the theory that we need to be prudent.  I suggest that we reduce the budget in this area while allowing the scheme to continue.  Perhaps we could enter into an arrangement with companies whereby they would pay a portion of the cost and the rest of the cost would be met by means of limited funding, as opposed to 100% funding.  I suggest that the Minister of State might encourage the Minister, Deputy Shatter, to let the Equality Authority know that he, his Department and the Government as a whole are in favour of the reintroduction of this scheme.  It has done good work.  The number of companies that have benefited from it was set out in the Minister of State's comprehensive reply.  I would like more companies to benefit from it in the future.  As legislators, we can——

I have listened carefully to what he has said.  I will raise the matter directly with the Minister, Deputy Shatter.  I will contact the Equality Authority to discuss training opportunities in this area.  Although the budget is limited, the fund has not been closed.  The Minister and the Department keenly understand the importance of the work being carried out by the Equality Authority and its partners, particularly in the employment field.  It is important for the new companies that are being established to be aware of the opportunity for discussions with the Equality Authority.  The Senator's suggestion that these training programmes should be paid for jointly is a good one.  I assure him that I will take the briefing notes I have been given and I will contact the Equality Authority on this issue as part of my SME agenda.  It has been proposed that this particular grant scheme should continue in difficult circumstances.  As I indicated earlier, the Equality Authority has not closed the door to its reintroduction in the future.The economic context we face has forced many difficult decisions to be taken.  There is no doubt that this scheme has allowed very good work to be undertaken by the social partners.  The current position has arisen as a consequence of the many difficult decisions that are having to be made across the board.  A level of co-operation and advice is being given to employers.  I am well aware that the Equality Authority will forward such information to any company that might make a direct inquiry to it.  I assure the Senator that the matter will be kept under review.  I do not want to hold out any false hope, however.  Having listened to what the Senator has said, I will ask the Minister's Department to raise it with the Equality Authority.  I will contact the authority from my perspective as Minister of State will responsibility for the small business agenda.  Many of the good points the Senator has made on the Adjournment today would be of assistance to small businesses.  I will contact the Equality Authority to discuss the issue that has been raised.

When I examined the Act in question, it struck me that I had never before seen legislation that allows the Minister of the day to choose between two different sections when the time comes for the commencement of the legislation.In 2008, the then Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Dermot Ahern, deferred the commencement of section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008, which relates to the structural separation of alcohol from other products in mixed trading outlets, in favour of a voluntary code of practice.  One of the conditions of this deferral was that there would be strict adherence to and implementation of the industry code of practice, which was devised by the Responsible Retailing of Alcohol in Ireland group.  The Minister said that statutory provisions would be activated if the voluntary measures were not successful.I suggest that the provision for structural separation in the voluntary code of practice was insufficient from its conception.  The inclusion of the caveat "as far as possible" in the relevant part of the code acts as a built-in get-out clause.  It completely undermines the intention of the provision.  Furthermore, there is ample evidence to show that the voluntary code is not working.  It is being breached on a regular basis, particularly in the convenience store sector.  This is supported by the findings of the Responsible Retailing of Alcohol in Ireland group's third annual compliance report, published in 2011, which shows that complaints relating to breaches of the code increased by 55% from 2010 to 2011.I am a member of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, which published a report on the misuse of alcohol and other drugs in January.  The committee made two recommendations that relate to the structural separation of alcohol.  We proposed that "legislation be introduced which would ban the presentation and sale of alcohol products alongside groceries, confectionary and fuel" and recommended that "voluntary codes of practice in the retail industry pertaining to the sale of alcohol be abolished and replaced by statutory codes".  This recommendation was replicated in the steering group report that I mentioned.On 23 February last, in response to a parliamentary question, the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, said "what was mainly contemplated by the Steering Group were the substantial provisions on structural separation in Section 9(1A) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 — though the powers of commencement of these provisions are vested in the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence".  I ask the Minister, Deputy Shatter, to commence section 9 of the 2008 Act.  It is unusual for a steering group report to recommend something that is already provided for in legislation.  I strongly believe we should be commencing the section in question.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	224	I am replying on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, who is unavailable.  I thank the Senator for raising this important subject.  In its 2008 report, the Government's alcohol advisory group recommended the structural separation of alcohol products from other retail items in mixed trading outlets such as supermarkets, convenience stores and garage forecourts.  The recommendation addressed a concern that alcohol is not an ordinary product and that this should be reflected in more restricted visibility, display and sale arrangements for alcohol products in such premises.  This recommendation subsequently formed the basis of the statutory provisions which are contained in section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008.Section 9 of the 2008 Act requires that alcohol products be displayed and sold in a separate part of mixed trading outlets.  It provides that the display and sale of alcohol is confined to a part of the premises that is separated from the rest of the premises by means of a wall or similar barrier; that access to this part can only be gained from the rest of the premises through a door, gate, turnstile or similar means of access; and the only place within the premises that customers can pay for alcohol is at a counter or point of sale within this separated part of the premises.  The only permitted alternative, which was included in an attempt to accommodate small outlets, is to confine the display and sale of alcohol products to a part of the premises to which the public does not have access, for example, an area behind a counter.  In such cases, wine could continue to be displayed as before.During the period leading up to enactment of the 2008 Act, bodies representing the mixed trading sector proposed implementation of a code of practice as an alternative to section 9.  The then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform agreed to postpone implementation of the statutory provisions in favour of an agreed code of practice, subject to compliance with stated conditions.  In particular, it was made clear that deferring implementation of the statutory provisions was conditional on independent verification of compliance with the code and that the code was achieving the objectives of structural separation.  A code of practice was drawn up and agreed between the Departments of Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the mixed trading sector.  The code sets out voluntary commitments on structural separation, advertising and training.A new body, Responsible Retailing of Alcohol in Ireland Ltd., RRAI, was established by the mixed trading sector to oversee implementation of the code.  Mr. Padraic White is the independent chair of RRAI.  The results of his compliance reports for 2009 and 2010 were broadly positive and the previous Government was sufficiently satisfied with the progress made that it did not feel it necessary to implement section 9 of the 2008 Act.  On receipt of Mr White's compliance report for 2011, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, launched a consultation process in which he sought the views of interested parties on the 2011 report and, more generally, on the effectiveness of the voluntary approach to implementing structural separation in mixed trading premises.  The response to the consultation process elicited a broad range of views on future arrangements for structural separation.  It appears there are three main options: continued reliance on the RRAI's existing voluntary code of practice; implementation of the statutory provisions set out in section 9 of the 2008 Act; or implementation of a statutory code of practice under section 17 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous) Provisions Act 2011.Section 17 of the 2011 Act provides that the Minister for Justice and Equality may prepare and publish a code of practice, or may approve a code drawn up by any other body, for the purpose of setting standards for the display, sale, supply, advertising, promotion or marketing of intoxicating liquor.  In both cases, a draft of the code must be published for the purpose of allowing those who may be affected by it to make representations.  Having considered representations received, if any, and decided whether to modify the contents or not, the Minister may proceed to publish the code in the Iris Oifigiúil.  Importantly, section 17 provides that any failure on the part of a licensee to observe the provisions of a statutory code shall not of itself render the licensee liable to any civil or criminal proceedings but may be a ground on which objection may be made to renewal of the licensee’s licence.Following examination of the submissions received in response to the consultation process, and the recommendation in the recently published steering group report on a national substance misuse strategy, the Minister expects to be in a position to seek Government approval for proposals relating to future arrangements for the display and sale of alcohol products in mixed trading outlets in the coming weeks.  I thank the Senator for raising this issue.

This is good news.  He has listened to everybody's submissions and I have no doubt the work of the committee and the reports he has received will lead him to make a decisive decision on this issue within a number of weeks as he has said.
#BrianODomhnaill	unknown-#BrianODomhnaill-party	unknown-#BrianODomhnaill-dob	unknown-#BrianODomhnaill-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	227	This Adjournment matter relates to the changes announced in the budget last year with regard to the means testing of capital assets for third level maintenance grants.  The specific reason I have tabled the matter is that many farm families are very worried that as a result of the Government decision and the work currently being undertaken by the asset implementation group, their children will not be in a position to avail of third level maintenance grants for the 2013-2014 academic year.There is a myth in Ireland that all farm children obtain third level maintenance grants, but there is no factual basis to back this up.  A survey of 72% of first level students carried out in 2009 found that 8.9% of new students were from farming backgrounds.  Of those, 8.3% were children of farmers and 0.6% were children of agricultural workers.  Some 39.7% of the children of farmers were in receipt of a higher education grant and 63% of the children of agricultural workers were in receipt of grants.  This clearly indicates that not all children from farming backgrounds are in receipt of third level grants.The current application form for a third level maintenance grant is complicated but there is a simple basis used for calculating the net income of the farm family.  That income is derived from whatever assets the farmer holds and from lands let or leased.  If I understand correctly, if the Government accepts the recommendation that agricultural land be classified as an asset, farm families will be penalised disproportionately.  While the income calculation is understandable, it would be very unfair if they were also to be assessed on the basis of the value of the property from which they derive their income.  An exemption from this proposal must be made for farm families.Agriculture is a resilient sector and it is helping to restore economic progress to this country.  There are other people with assets.  Some wealthy developers may have assets, but they may have fancy accountants who can hide those assets for them and their children get third level grants.  While we need to look at overall assets, farming land should be ring-fenced and should not be included in an assessment, whether for a farmer with 100 acres in west Donegal or east Cork .  The income they are deriving from that asset is actually contained within the net income on the application form for the third level grant.  That is the reason I have raised this.  I know some of the farming organisations have also been raising it, as have constituents of my own.  There is a worry out there that the recommendation coming from the implementation group will be accepted by the Government.  Unfortunately, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, in response to a number of parliamentary questions, has indicated that farming or agricultural land will not be excluded.  That gives me cause to believe that farming lands will actually be included as an asset, for which farmers will be doubly penalised.  That is the point being made by farming organisations.  I hope the Minister has some good news.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14379	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	229	I thank Senator Ó Domhnaill for raising this important issue.  The Senator refers to an announcement last December that the means test for student grants will be amended to take account of the value of certain capital assets as well as income for the 2013-14 academic year.  A considerable body of reports over a number of years have strongly recommended the introduction of a capital test for student grants, particularly on the grounds of equity and fairness.  The introduction of such a test would create a more equitable basis for means testing through a more complete analysis of a family's capacity to support their children in pursuing further or higher education.The Senator will appreciate that in the context of the current financial climate, the importance of accurately targeting increasingly scarce resources to those who need them most has become a high priority.  Given the increasing cost of providing student maintenance grants, the potential for this proposal to deliver cost savings on the student grant budget is also a critical consideration at this time.  While the introduction of a capital assets test for student grants may traditionally have been perceived as being likely to affect the farming community in particular, this is not the object of the proposal.  I emphasise that the proposal is not designed to target any one group.The Senator is aware that a dedicated capital asset test implementation group has been established, as he referred to this in his speech.  The group has been charged with introducing detailed implementation proposals on new means testing arrangements for student grants, to include the value of assets, for new applicants from the 2013-14 academic year.  The group has met on three occasions and its deliberations are ongoing.  I expect the group to report to the Minister by the summer and to make recommendations on the inclusion or exclusion of various classes of asset.  Any proposals will require further Government agreement and necessitate legislative amendment.

I fully appreciate that he cannot give any indication of what the group will report, but my great fear is for farming families.  The reason I am concerned about farming families in particular is that they will be penalised twice on the same income.  When filling in the application form for a third level grant, a family must specify the net income that was derived from the farm the previous year.  It is a matter of public record, in any event, because of all the payments from departmental schemes.  As that money is derived from land the family owns, if that land were classified as an asset, the family would be penalised a second time for the same income, which would be totally unfair.  There will certainly be a legal challenge to such a provision if it is introduced by the Government.  I appeal to the Minister of State to consider this view when the implementation group reports back to him and the Minister, and when dealing with any proposal with regard to farmers, to be extremely sensitive to the issues that are being raised.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14379	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	231	I thank the Senator for the points made.  I respectfully suggest to him that not all farm income is necessarily a matter of public record.  We would both agree on that.  However, I understand the Senator's point about double-counting farm incomes.  That is clearly set out in the application form.  The Minister will be receiving a report on this, and I will certainly convey to him the concerns outlined by the Senator.  He need have no doubt about that.
