        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_1">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_1">On 30 May last year, the country was astounded to see the "Prime Time Investigates" programme showing disgraceful scenes at the Leas Cross nursing home in Dublin, including patients with appalling bedsores and others abandoned in chairs and suffering abysmal standards of nursing care and inspection. It amounted to a savage assault on their dignity as well as their civil and human rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">A year and two weeks ago, the Taoiseach stood up in this House and faithfully promised to act with speed on the inspection of nursing homes. That is the standard response from the Government, a reflex action whereby it promises the world and does nothing. The Taoiseach promised specifically that we would have the legislation for an independent nursing home inspectorate by autumn 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">However, there is no legislation, and there will be none until 2007. The Taoiseach is running out of time in power. Those who have been betrayed by his Government are also running out of time as they are old. What they do not have is time and confidence in his word. Tomorrow, 15 June, is world Elder Abuse Awareness Day, a time to take cognisance of the problem. As we speak, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Catherine Byrne, is hosting a reception in the Mansion House to highlight the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_4">When one considers the Government's record in this matter, one sees that there are three questions for the Taoiseach to answer — perhaps I should wait until the Tánaiste has given him her advice. First, why has the legislation not been produced, second, why will the inspectorate not be independent, as the Taoiseach promised on six occasions in this House last year, and, third, where are the reports commissioned into the handling of Leas Cross by the authorities?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_2">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_5">Deputy Kenny will remember that it was decided that we should incorporate all the proposed legislative changes into the Health Information and Quality Authority legislation. I have announced many times that the legislation in question is being prepared. The inspectorate will be independent of the HSE, the group that provides the service, and that is one of the key issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">At present, we are spending €150 million, the highest amount ever spent on the elderly, for whom there has been an unprecedented increase in services. Many of those resources have been put into home care support packages, with €55 million allocated for them in the last budget. They are based on 1,100 pilot home care packages, delivering a wide range of services. We have increased old age pensions, access to medical cards, carer's benefit, care leave, child carer's benefit and the carer's allowance means test threshold. That has all been very helpful. There have been increases in nursing home subventions. All that has gone to help with housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">It is good that people focus on the elderly, as this Government has, having put enormous resources into building up capacities, capabilities and staffing to help them. The inspectorate is included in the new legislation and it will be independent. The resources are being spent.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_8">The problem is that the Taoiseach promised on six occasions that the inspectorate would be independent, but I understand that the HSE will retain overall authority, meaning that it will not be independent. Why has the legislation not been produced? The Taoiseach stood here over a year ago and said that the legislation would come before the House in autumn 2005, but there has been no sign of it, and neither will there be before 2007. Why has he failed to deliver on a promise that he made to elderly people who do not have time on their side? Second, why has the O'Neill report into 95 deaths at Leas Cross not been published? It has been in Government hands for some time. I see that the Tánaiste is giving the Taoiseach a running commentary. Perhaps she will stand up and answer the question.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_4">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_9">She says she does not have the report.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Ms Harney</from>
          <p eId="para_10">I have never seen the report.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_11">There were 95 deaths at Leas Cross and the Taoiseach expressed concern over that report. Why has it not been published? Has there been an explanation for the delay? As I said, tomorrow is world Elder Abuse Awareness Day. To end such abuse and show concern for elderly people, it is about time the Government got at least one fundamental correct. It has promised legislation and failed to introduce it. It has not published a report which has been on its desks for eight or nine months, and the inspectorate that the Taoiseach promised on six occasions last year will not be independent. As someone once said, the older one gets, the less one listens to what people say and the more one watches what they do. In this case, the Taoiseach's Government has failed yet again to address the scandalous abuse of elderly people.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_7">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_12">I reject all that. The Government has put in more effort, resources, staff, equipment and services for hospitals, homes and carers than any other Government. The Deputy's contention is simply not correct, and he knows it. The heads of the Bill have been published for consultation. I was pressed in the House that they be put out for consultation, and that has been done. We hope to pass the legislation later this year after it has benefited from the wisdom of the consultation process. The inspectorate is independent of the HSE. Deputy Kenny misunderstands the process. An inspectorate is already in existence while we are in the process of establishing the new inspectorate and putting together legislation with stronger powers.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_8">
          <from>Mr Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_13">The Taoiseach said that was the best way to deal with it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_9">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_14">I am not saying the current inspectorate is ideal. Obviously, we would not be changing it if we thought it was ideal. Nevertheless, an inspectorate exists so it is not the case that no checks are being done.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">The Government has not received the O'Neill report, which I understand is with the HSE. Constitutional issues of natural justice have arisen which must go through a very painful legal process before this is dealt with. The central point is that we have put an additional €150 million into services for elderly people this year. Our spending on health care services for elderly people has increased greatly. A total of €150 million is allocated towards improving services for older people, approximately three quarters of which will go towards services in the community, home care packages, primary community care for older people, medical cards, carer's benefit, carer's allowance and carer's leave, and nursing home subventions.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_17">All these improvements, most of which are new, significantly help elderly people in their homes and hospitals. We are continuing to build on what is a good service and to put more people into it to improve the service.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_12">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_18">What does the Government propose to do about the plight of thousands of people, most of them young, who find themselves burdened with management companies in housing estates located for the most part around Dublin? These are young people who in many cases did not know when they purchased their homes that they would end up contractually wedded to a management company for an excessive fee to deliver often illusory services.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">Local authorities have for some time made it a condition of planning approval that these management companies be set up. Such companies are customarily a front for the developer. They start out with this condition in the purchase so the unsuspecting young person does not know until a year later when he or she receives an invoice that he or she is required to pay what is usually a grossly excessive fee for services that do not materialise. In some cases, fees have more than doubled from one year to the next.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">There are several examples of major estates around Dublin where the householder is helpless to establish who is responsible for which service. He or she contacts the management company, which refers him or her to the developer. The developer then refers him or her to the local authority. He or she returns to the management company, which refers him or her to the management agent who collects the money. The householder finds out that he or she is contractually bound.</p>

          <p eId="para_22">The local authority will not assume responsibility for these estates until they are finished to a satisfactory standard. The estates are left unfinished or some units are retained by the developer so that residents do not have the facility to assert themselves in the direction and control of the management company.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">There may be a case for setting up a management company in an apartment block to look after a specified and narrow set of services which are regulated and whose fees are regulated. However, a scenario can arise where an estate consisting of one block of apartments surrounded by a few hundred houses is subject to this arrangement. Rates have been abolished but the present situation is more penal than rates ever were.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_25">The system introduces rates by the back door. Most management companies are not responsive. These young people are already in hock up to their eyes after purchasing apartments or duplexes and now find themselves faced with fees which were once €200 or €300 but are now over €2,000 in some cases. What will the Government do about this? It represents an abuse of power which management companies are being allowed to get away with.</p>

        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_17">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_26">This issue was raised in the House approximately three months ago. On that occasion, I asked the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to carry out a full examination and produce a report on how this situation can be legislatively addressed, if this is the only way it can be dealt with, which Members argued is the case. This process is being examined in the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">I acknowledge that there are a number of difficulties in this area but there are issues surrounding planning permissions in local authorities and why local authorities in many instances permit the formation of management companies. I acknowledge that management contracts are a good idea in some apartment blocks. A management company can probably best look after the combined needs of all residents in developments with open complexes and land and recreational space. Some of these residents are renting, while others are owner occupiers.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">That was the purpose of management companies. When they began, it was never envisaged that they would be used in large housing estates and I do not know why local authorities allowed such a scenario to occur. I am aware that this is a major problem in Kildare and parts of Dublin. I have seen cases put forward by a number of Deputies when we debated the issue about three months ago. I have asked the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to examine whether the situation can be rectified through legislation. At the moment, there is no legislation governing the way in which management companies control their business and the services for which they are entitled to charge. It is only set out very loosely that they are responsible for services and environmental matters. This allows them to venture into many areas in which their role was never envisaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">I do not know if there is a way because I have not read the latest report from the Department. As I understood it, the only way in which Government can control this situation and set guidelines is to examine the legislative process if local authorities cannot take control of the situation. I do not understand why local authorities give planning permission that permits management companies in residential housing areas. Why should it be a condition of planning permission that a management company looks after 30 or 40 houses? I do not see why that should be a condition of planning permission.</p>

          <p eId="para_32">I will confine myself to Deputy Rabbitte's question. Management companies were never regarded as desirable or essential for residential housing estates. Management companies in housing estates represent an unnecessary cost unless residents wish that they are established, and that is a decision to be made when people are living in their houses rather than beforehand. The matter is being examined and if legislation is required, it will be considered.</p>

          <p eId="para_33">I have encountered this phenomenon in several areas of Dublin, Kildare and Galway and I am sure it exists elsewhere. In the debate which took place in this House last November during which Deputy Gilmore introduced a Private Members' Bill, the only offer made by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government was that he would examine the proposals that would come from the Law Reform Commission. The commission is unlikely to make any report, not to mention implement such a report, this side of the general election. Meanwhile, all types of practices are occurring. It seems the Taoiseach agrees with me in this respect, but the difference between him and me is that he is in office.</p>

The answer given last night to my colleague, Deputy Burton, by the Minister, Deputy Roche, did not provide much hope.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">There is a practice of local authorities making it a condition of planning approval. The backlog of taking developments in charge can be as much as eight or nine years in parts of this county, whatever about the city. There is no way the local authorities want to hear anything about taking those areas in charge. Meanwhile, young people find that if they do not deliver on any arbitrary increase in the fee charged, they are likely to find themselves——</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_44">Deputy Rabbitte asked what the Government is doing about this matter. I have discussed it with the Minister and his advisers. If it cannot be done by his giving directions or instructions to local authorities, the legislative route should be examined. I am not sure how far that has gone, but I will check. It has been a number of months since I answered a question on the issue and I asked the Minister to address it.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">However, I do not accept that local authorities, at a time when they have far more resources and are getting more in subventions from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, are putting management contracts into their planning permissions so that they can avoid taking over sites. I do not consider there is an argument for that. At a time when authorities were severely strapped for resources, a time we all remember, they were able to take over sites, even if two or three years had passed. The arrangements they are using in their planning permissions are highly unfair. I agree with the Deputy on that point, but I have asked the Minister whether he can instruct the local authorities on that issue. If he cannot, I have asked him to examine the legislative route.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">There is a problem and I accept the argument in respect of apartment blocks. Where there are no management contracts for them, what tends to happen is some people look after them very well, some sporadically and some do not care at all. Very quickly, difficulties arise. Unfortunately, there are too many examples of that in this city and elsewhere. Management contracts were designed in this respect. Making a management contract for 35 houses or duplexes——</p>

          <p eId="para_49">If the practice cannot be stopped in the planning and development stage, it should be examined. It is an unnecessary increase in the cost. Most residents say they could live with the contracts if they got the services, but the management companies, even though there are regulations, do not manage the services. It is difficult to find who is behind the companies. For these reasons, the legislative route is probably the only way in which the issue can be controlled.</p>

          <p eId="para_50">Is the Taoiseach aware that the latest report published by the Combat Poverty Agency and launched by his colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, confirms that 17% of children in this State live in income poverty for five years or more of their young lives? Does the Taoiseach agree that this is unacceptable in one of the wealthiest economies in the world?</p>
          <p eId="para_51">Does the Taoiseach further agree that increasing child benefit and other income supports alone is not the whole answer and what we need is a wide-ranging strategy? Does he accept that within the strategy, there must be a commitment and clear plan to combat educational disadvantage? It is my understanding that the Government has a target to reduce class sizes to 20 pupils or fewer for all children under the age of nine years by 2007. Will the Taoiseach ensure the recruitment of the necessary additional teaching staff? Will it be done now? Will he ensure the provision of all the required assessments and the additional teachers required for children with special needs?</p>
          <p eId="para_52">Will the Government introduce a primary school database linked to the secondary school database to track attendance levels and flag and help combat early school leaving? Within that strategy, will the Taoiseach also ensure we will have an extension of the school meals programme to all children in disadvantaged areas, which is not currently the case?</p>
          <p eId="para_53">In what is supposed to be one of the best educated countries in the world, I expect the Taoiseach will acknowledge that we have a chronic shortage of speech and language therapists. This robs many children of their real opportunities and potential in life. Will the Government increase the number of training places to ensure we have adequate speech and language therapists in place as quickly as possible to correct the severe shortage and difficulties arising therefrom for young people facing into the future?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_54">As the Deputy knows, the recent report also showed 100,000 young people have been taken out of consistent poverty in recent years. We remain firmly committed to eliminating consistent poverty, combating social exclusion, ending marginalisation and creating a fairer society.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">We have significantly reduced poverty levels. The last major report in this regard, the UN human development report of late last year, showed that continued substantial increases in social transfers have resulted in real improvements in the living standards of persons depending on them. For this reason, last year, we provided a large increase in social welfare payments, especially the basic State pension and our commitment to get it to 30% of the industrial wage by next year. This will continue to enhance the welfare and overall well-being of those who are caught up in the daily struggle to make ends meet. Children at risk and those of lone parents rank highly in the report the Deputy mentioned, as did carers who look after people with difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">We have dramatically increased the number of teachers. There are 10,000 extra teachers in schools. We weighted this very much towards schools in disadvantaged areas. We did the same in respect of home-school-community liaison posts so that they would not only be in schools, but would link up with homes to try to help children with special difficulties. The case of child assessment services is the same, as psychological services work with home liaison officers to try to deal with families with multiple difficulties. The Deputy has a point on speech therapy, which is why we have substantially increased the number of training places. It is very difficult to find speech therapists from anywhere and vacancies cannot be filled by people from outside the country, as we have done with other positions. Training takes time and there have been difficulties in providing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_57">Over 80% of child income support is accounted for by child benefit, whereas ten years ago it was less than 30%, which shows the significant improvements we have made in society in the past decade.</p>

          <p eId="para_58">To say I have a point on speech and language therapy is a serious understatement. We have a real and serious crisis as regards young people's needs for speech and language therapy support. That has been identified throughout the State and I urge the Taoiseach to outline what steps he now proposes to take, not those he has already taken, the details of which he trundled out in response to my earlier question. It is very important to recognise that this summer many parents, preparing their children to return to school in September, will face the added burdens of the provision of school uniforms and books, as well as all the other needs that young people have. Is there any plan, for example, for the Government to increase the back to school clothing and footwear allowance? It would be a practical step but on its own is not the panacea for all needs.

          <p eId="para_63">The Deputy asked what we will do in the future. We will continue to work to eliminate poverty, particularly child poverty. The next national action plan to combat poverty and social exclusion is due to be published later this year and will reflect that strong commitment. Next year we will achieve a new benchmark level of €150, in 2002 terms, for social welfare payments, which is hugely important. As part of the programme of reform specifically addressing child poverty more than 21,000 families are set to benefit from substantial increases in the weekly income thresholds for family income supplement. Those increases will deliver an extra weekly income of €11.40 per week, bringing the figure to €169.20, which is a far higher increase than ever before. We have further relaxed the means test for non-contributory payments for those on pensions.</p>
          <p eId="para_64">Measures for schools including staffing, resources, capitation grants and the building programme, which includes renovations and repairs and is at an all-time high, are all under way. The back to school allowance was increased in the last budget and will come into effect for the next school year. We continue to enhance the welfare and overall well-being of those in receipt of it. Every part of the enormous resources of €12 billion we have put into social welfare is targeted to help those most in need. In the most recent five or six budgets the largest allocation has been to those in danger of poverty, including relative poverty. That is why enormous numbers are moving out of that category. Some people are still in difficulties and we must focus on those——</p>

Some rewriting of history is taking place at the moment but we are all agreed on the impact of the Famine on the psyche of the Irish people. I am aware the Taoiseach has received correspondence on the subject from the Famine commemoration committee, and that the Taoiseach's General Secretary, in a party capacity, wrote to Michael Blanch, the secretary of that committee, to state that Fianna Fáil was in favour of the idea being put forward.

Deputy Rabbitte asked for a national day to commemorate the Famine. I am not sure how that could be done — perhaps it could be linked to other occasions. Every year a large number of groups make passionate cases for national days for certain events. It was decided 20 years ago that the way to deal with all these days, and get over all the difficulties, was to have a national day of celebration and commemoration, which is on 9 July this year. I have been reluctant to get into designating days here, there and everywhere. Apart from the Famine, one could equally make a case for commemorating Michael Davitt and every year a number of such cases arise. We had a large commemoration for Robert Emmet a few years ago. I have been holding to a national day of commemoration for a number of years. I have been asked to examine some proposals and my Department, along with others, is examining the request to see if we can respond to the group that is asking us to do this.</p>
            <p eId="para_80">A number of initiatives have been planned to mark the 100th anniversary of the death of Michael Davitt. We have funded small grants and most of those commemorations are planned to take place from 27 May to 4 June. At these events the Government will be represented by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The Army will also be involved and a commemorative stamp will be issued. We have given some resources to the commemoration fund. Some Departments and agencies are also involved locally, although I am not sure what is the total sum of money they have given. Most of the resources we give to such commemorations are small. We are also providing a small grant to the Michael Davitt museum for a conference commemorating his centenary. These small grants, spread over 18 different areas, constitute a useful token to help people to organise commemorative events.</p>

            <p eId="para_81">I am not trying to restrict the Taoiseach to specifying precisely how we might commemorate the victims of the Famine but the essence of the case being made by the commemoration committee is correct. At a time of transformation in the country's fortunes and unprecedented prosperity, it would be appropriate for this State to commemorate the cataclysmic impact the Famine had on the Irish people in the 19th century. I urge the Taoiseach to respond to those who are importuning him. It is appropriate to do so. I know that small things have been done, including the Edward Daly sculptures and the figures on the quays, to remind us all where we came from. Given that commemorations are in the air, it would be appropriate for us to do something to mark this major event in Irish history.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_82">As I said, we are looking at how we can do it. I have received submissions and my Department is examining them to see what is the most appropriate way of dealing with the matter. I want to make the point that every year very good cases are made for commemorative events. There are at least two or three a year. That was why, in 1986, they moved to an all-party group which established a national day of commemoration. I have read the file on this. The Famine was a major event but there were many other events which were also considered important by active groups that wished to commemorate them in various locations. The other events, of course, do not match the Famine in terms of the death, destruction and emigration involved and which changed an entire generation for 40 or 50 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_83">I will see if some of the proposals can be accommodated in a way that does not open it up for many other occasions. Not a year, nor a quarter, goes by when there is not a big lobby to have another commemorative event but that causes problems for such events if it is done that way. The national day of commemoration now covers a wide range of issues. If a Famine commemoration can be done in the American style where they designate days, it will not have a knock-on effect. That may be one way of dealing with it, although I do not agree with it. I am examining the matter to see if we can facilitate a Famine commemoration that will not open it up for all the other events. I have been contacted by 30 or 40 groups seeking designated days or periods but I do not think that is a good idea.</p>

In considering the context, will the Taoiseach take on board the need for a commemoration of that sort so the lessons can be learned, not just about world hunger and the distribution of resources but also about the Irish diaspora which resulted from the Famine? We must be careful to avoid over-reliance on any one food or fuel, such as oil for example. The principle of not putting all one's eggs in one basket also applies as a reason for not commemorating all events together. The Taoiseach should deliver on that demand. The effects of the Famine were extraordinary and we need to commemorate it.</p>
            <p eId="para_85">Are there plans for the Government to mark the United Nations international day in support of victims of torture, on 26 June? The Taoiseach addressed the UN recently so I know he is in the loop as regards such events. We should be clear about this matter, given the need to implement checks on CIA extraordinary rendition planes.</p>

            <p eId="para_97">The State sent the <i>LE Eithne</i> to Argentina earlier this year under the command of Captain Mark Mellett, which was a great occasion and much appreciated by the Argentine Government. It was the first official trip by an Irish naval ship since Admiral William Brown from Foxford, County Mayo arrived on the River Plate more than 150 years ago.</p>
            <p eId="para_98">Next year will see the 150th anniversary of the independence of the Argentine state. Its Government and people have a strong affiliation and affection for the part played by Admiral Brown in building up the Argentine navy. Is it the intention of the Government to participate in the independence celebrations or to provide any other contact by way of further naval service visits or otherwise?</p>
            <p eId="para_99">The Taoiseach will be aware that the President visited Argentina some time ago. Given the interest in Admiral Brown, the Taoiseach will be aware of the proposal to have a suitable sculpture situated on Sir John Rogerson's Quay. The Argentinians are interested in contributing to a small memorial park in Foxford, County Mayo. Will the Taoiseach ensure that whatever assistance the Government can provide in this matter is offered, subject to the usual conditions being complied with? It is a matter the Argentinians feel more strongly about than do the people of this country.</p>
            <p eId="para_100">Are arrangements in place to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the Battle of the Somme, to which the Taoiseach referred?</p>

            <p eId="para_101">The Admiral Brown society is an active group, which I met. My Department has funded a number of related projects. For the commemoration of Admiral Brown next year, the society intends to build a memorial park, for which we have provided resources. There have also been contacts with the Department of Defence, although I am not sure from where they came, and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has also helped. Several Departments have been helping what is an excellent project.</p>
            <p eId="para_102">The military-to-military connections are strong. Admiral Brown, as the Deputy noted, is widely known in Argentina due to its education system, which is strong on military history and the admiral's role in particular. He is commemorated throughout Argentina by sculptures and other commemorations. The Government has been involved in this matter through the memorial park, the project on Sir John Rogerson's Quay and the work of the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Defence.</p>
            <p eId="para_103">The plans for a 1 July commemoration of the Battle of the Somme are ongoing and a number of agreements have been made. We have worked through the British Legion in making the arrangements for the commemoration. There will be an official commemoration at the war memorial in Islandbridge.</p>
            <p eId="para_104">The commemoration is part of the overall programme that reflects the shared history and experience of the people of this island, from all traditions, in 1916. The Battle of the Somme saw many young Irishmen lose their lives. It is fitting they are remembered, and the commemoration at Islandbridge is part of that process. Over many decades they remained unacknowledged, with their bravery and contribution largely forgotten. It is important the history of all the people of this island is acknowledged in an appropriate manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_105">The arrangements are well developed at this stage, in so far as they can be. It is planned that following the army ceremonial occasion, involving prayers and readings, the President will lay a wreath at the Cenotaph. Ambassadors from those countries that participated in the battle — the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, India and Australia — will also lay wreaths, as will the British Legion. While other elements remain to be worked out, that is the main issue. A State reception will follow in the Royal Hospital. Many organisations from the North will attend, as will many other groups active throughout the island, including the fusiliers, and, hopefully, the Northern politicians.</p>

Like many other literary people of his time, he was ill served by the State and was interned for his republican beliefs. I understand a stamp is being issued by An Post, which I welcome. What else will the Government do to mark the centenary of his birth? I suggest an Irish language scholarship or a bursary for writing in Irish would be appropriate.

            <p eId="para_135">With regard to the constitution, I spoke to the Austrian Chancellor, the President in office of the European Council, Wolfgang Schüssel. At the meeting on Thursday night and Friday it will be decided to push the reflection period out further, as I have been saying for a long time. It is unlikely there will be any change until the French and Dutch elections next year. Based on that, I doubt that the European Council will consider any pre-emptive action. Since I will not be at the meeting, I have put forward my views and the Irish position to WolfgangSchüssel. I will be represented at ministerial level. That is probably the view of most, if not all, member states.</p>
            <p eId="para_136">The Finns are due to ratify the constitution shortly, becoming the 16th country to do so. It has now been ratified by a large majority of countries and a large majority of the population. Germany has stated that it wants the matter carried forward during its Presidency next year. The problem for the German Presidency next year is that the French election is not due until the end of the Presidency so the time to make any progress afterwards is too short. The Germans will press forward on the issue but I do not envisage them being able to get to a conclusion on it given that they will only have about ten days after the election to make progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_137">I also spoke to the President of the Commission, José Manuel Barroso, on Friday. I reminded him that the last thing the Commission should engage in is proposals to start cherry-picking the constitution in any area. As Deputy Kenny is aware, there are some ideas around in that regard as well. It would be the wrong thing to do and just cause difficulties in the future and make it harder to deal with these issues. I was central to the debate about many of the balances on these matters. To try to go back to the Nice treaty, when there was a huge discussion, and to start picking out these issues would create great difficulties. That is not just an Irish view; the majority of countries would hold that view.</p>
            <p eId="para_138">The Germans were firm in their denunciation of that on JHA issues last week and I agree with the Chancellor's view. To start cherry-picking what was a delicately balanced document — it was not just balanced in the Irish Presidency but also in the Convention and in the discussions — will create untold damage. It is better to wait until after the elections before taking it forward. At that stage, I believe 17 or 18 countries might have ratified the constitution.</p>

            <p eId="para_139">The committee recommended legislation rather than constitutional change to give rights to non-marital heterosexual and same sex couples. The Taoiseach is correct that a constitutional amendment was not recommended. However, the committee took the view that people in non-traditional marital or couple arrangements should have the same rights as other citizens and it recommended legislative change. The committee recommended legislation to provide for cohabiting, heterosexual couples by either a civil partnership or a presumptive scheme. It recommended that civil partnership legislation should be provided for same sex couples. It also recommended similar legislation to meet the needs of other long-term cohabiting couples.</p>
            <p eId="para_140">Does the Taoiseach accept that this is an issue of acute concern, for obvious reasons, for a significant number of our population? Am I right in deducing that the Government has decided to kick the issue to touch and that no legislation will be brought forward in the lifetime of this Dáil?</p>

            <p eId="para_145">The majority view in the committee was that a referendum that proposed to extend the definition of family would be divisive and, having created division, would not necessarily carry majority support. Rather than put our community through a divisive campaign the committee decided to examine whether the problems presented in the submissions might be dealt with by a combination of other less divisive constitutional and legislative proposals. I agree with that approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_146">I also agree with the Deputy. It is a divisive issue and there are those who hold the view put forward by the Deputy. At the launch of the report it was clear that there were people who held the other view. There was strong division between the statements made at the launch. The Government established a distinguished group under Anne Colley, which commenced its work last February and is due to finish at the end of October, to report on how we should take these issues forward. Having spoken to Anne Colley recently, I am aware the group intends to adhere to its remit and have the report ready in the autumn or early winter. We must then consider how to proceed. I certainly would not rule out the possibility that we could at least start, if not complete, a legislative process over the winter.</p>

            <p eId="para_147">I am surprised to hear the Taoiseach say there will be no referendum given that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has made a case for one. The Children's Rights Alliance says we need a referendum on enshrining the rights of children in the Constitution. It appeared before the United Nations with a report, From Rhetoric To Rights. While there may not be a referendum in the lifetime of this Government, does the Taoiseach recognise the need for a referendum to enshrine the rights of children in the Constitution? Does he see that as part of a response to the 250 children who have gone missing from a Health Service Executive funded residential centre in Dublin and to the growing suspicion of trafficking in children? Is the Taoiseach amenable to such a referendum as proposed by the Children's Rights Alliance?</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_164">
          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_231">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_232">That Dáil Éireann resolves that sections 2 to 12, 14 and 17 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 (No. 39 of 1998), shall continue in operation for the period of 12 months beginning on 30 June 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">This motion seeks approval for the continuance in force of those sections of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 which would otherwise cease to be in operation on 30 June. The 1998 Act was enacted in the aftermath of the Omagh bombing of August 1998, which claimed the lives of 29 innocent people, including a woman pregnant with twins, and injured more than 200 others. That appalling act, a few months after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and designed to derail the peace process, was perpetrated by fanatics for whom human life holds no value.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">There is an upcoming criminal action against a person in Northern Ireland for these murders. The retrial of another person is also pending in this jurisdiction. The investigation into the atrocity continues on both sides of the Border and there continues to be excellent co-operation between the Garda authorities and the PSNI in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">In recognition of the exceptional circumstances surrounding the enactment of the 1998 Act, there was general agreement it should be regularly revisited by the Oireachtas. The purpose of this recurring Oireachtas scrutiny is to ascertain if the circumstances prevailing in 1998 justify the continuance in force of its provisions. Accordingly, by virtue of resolutions passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas on 16 June 2005, sections 2 to 12, inclusive, 14 and 17 will cease to operate on and from 30 June next. That is, of course, unless a further resolution is passed by each House authorising the sections to continue to operate for a period not exceeding 12 months. In addition, there is a requirement in the Act to lay a report on its operation before each House of the Oireachtas prior to consideration by the Houses of the renewal of the provisions. I laid a report before the House on Monday.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">The conclusion of the report is that the relevant sections should remain in force for a further 12 months. This is the firm view of the Garda Síochána, which considers the Act to be vital in the continuing fight against terrorism and it to be of paramount importance that the legislative provisions remain in operation. The reality is that those responsible for the Omagh bomb, and others like them, continue in their fanatical way to pursue, plan and promote campaigns of violence. There have been several near misses involving the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA since the Omagh atrocity. It is only through dint of excellent police work by the Garda and the PSNI that further tragedy on a massive scale has been averted.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">As recently as January and February of this year viable explosive devices were placed outside police stations in Armagh and Belfast. Last August a bomb, comparable in size to that detonated at Omagh, was made safe in Lurgan. I ask the House to consider the effects of the detonation of such a device, the human lives that would be lost and the damage that would be wrought to the chances of peace on this island. This is not an abstract notion. It is a real and present danger and one the security forces on this island work day and night to prevent.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">Advances in the quest for peace are to be welcomed. However, let no Member be fooled that a significant threat does not remain from dissident so-called republican groups. As recent reports of the Independent Monitoring Commission make clear, organisations such as the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA continue to aspire to serious acts of terrorism. They continue to be involved in intelligence gathering, extortion, recruitment and training. To quote the commission's most recent assessment, the Continuity IRA "remains an active threat" while the Real IRA's "aspirations and readiness to use extreme violence are undiminished".</p>
          <p eId="para_239">The State must be prepared to meet the threat posed by these people, particularly at this sensitive time when all our hopes are on restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland. There is also evidence that dissident so-called republicans are now willing to peddle their expertise to organised criminal gangs. The Garda intercepted a bomb at the West Link toll bridge in December 2005 which, it is assessed, was to be used as part of a feud between drugs gangs. This is a chilling development and one which must be countered. It is a serious matter when so-called republicans provide material of this kind to thugs who are killing ordinary teenagers by supplying them with drugs and killing each other to maintain their positions of strength. The Garda Síochána will continue to actively investigate links between terrorist groups and organised crime, including through the use of these legislative provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">In addition to home-grown terrorist groups, no Member can be ignorant of the newer and more sinister forms of international terrorism, in particular jihadist terrorism, which have manifested themselves in recent years. With the Madrid bombings of March 2004 and the London bombings of last July, which together involved the murder of more than 250 innocent commuters, two of our closest European friends and neighbours have had to face the full horror of this phenomenon. It would be naive to imagine that Ireland is completely immune from such threats. The Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 was enacted to deal with this international terrorist threat by enabling the application of the Offences against the State Acts against international terrorist groups and individuals. Chipping away at these Acts would be neither wise nor warranted.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">Since the end of the last reporting period from 1 June 2005 to 31 May 2006, section 2 was used on 14 occasions. It provides that where, in any proceedings for membership of an unlawful organisation, the accused failed to answer or gave false or misleading answers to any question, the court may draw such inferences from that failure or from the furnishing of a false or misleading reply as appear proper. However, a person cannot be convicted of the offence solely on an inference drawn from such a failure.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">Section 3 was used on nine occasions. This section provides that, in proceedings for membership of an unlawful organisation, the accused must give notification of an intention to call a person to give evidence on his behalf, unless the court permits otherwise. One cannot ambush the prosecution.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">Section 4 was used on two occasions. This section amends section 3 of the Offences against the State Act 1972 in such a way as to expand the definition of "conduct" that can be considered as evidence of membership of an unlawful organisation. Specifically, "conduct" can now include matters such as "movements, actions, activities, or associations on the part of the accused". This change simply aligns the definition of conduct in the 1972 Act with the reference to movements, actions, activities or associations used in section 2 of the 1998 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">Section 5 was used on 34 occasions. This section provides for the drawing of adverse inferences in the prosecution of a person for any offence under the Offences against the State Acts, any offence scheduled under the Acts and any offence arising out of the same set of facts as such an offence, provided that the offence carries a penalty of five years' imprisonment or more. The effect of this section is to allow a court to draw inferences where the accused relies on a fact in his defence that he could reasonably have been expected to mention during questioning or on being charged but did not do so. As with section 2, however, a person cannot be convicted of the offence solely on an inference drawn from such a failure.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">Section 7 was used on two occasions. This section makes it an offence to possess articles in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that the article is in possession for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of specified firearms or explosives offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">Section 9 was used on 110 occasions. This section makes it an offence to withhold information which a person believes might be of material assistance in preventing the commission by another person of a serious offence or securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of another person for such an offence. Some people wonder about that offence, but Article 9 of the Constitution states that loyalty to the State is a fundamental duty of every citizen and there cannot be a right to withhold information in regard to such terrorist offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">Section 10 was used on 15 occasions. This section extends the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act from 48 hours to 72 hours, but only on the express authorisation of a judge of the District Court. In this regard, the judge must be satisfied, on the application of a Garda officer not below the rank of superintendent, that the further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned and that the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously. The person being detained is entitled to be present in court during the application and to make, or to have made, submissions on his behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">In the reporting period in question, an extension was applied for in 15 cases. A total of 14 of these applications were granted while charges resulted in two of these cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">Section 11 was used on seven occasions. This section allows a judge of the District Court to permit the re-arrest and detention of a person in respect of an offence for which he was previously detained under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act but released without charge. This further period must not exceed 24 hours and can only be authorised in circumstances where the judge is satisfied, on information supplied on oath by a member of the Garda Síochána, that further information has come to the knowledge of the Garda Síochána about that person's suspected participation in the offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">Section 14 was used on 54 occasions. The effect of this section is to make the offences created under sections 6 to 9 and 12 of the 1998 Act scheduled offences for the purposes of Part V of the 1939 Act. This means that persons suspected of committing these offences are liable to arrest under section 30 of the 1939 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">I would now like to turn to those sections of the 1998 Act that were not used in the period under report, namely, sections 6, 8, 12 and 17. Section 6 establishes the offence of directing, at any level of the organisation's structure, the activities of an organisation in respect of which a suppression order has been made under the Offences against the State Act 1939.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">Section 8 makes it an offence to collect, record or possess information which is likely to be useful to members of an unlawful organisation in the commission of serious offences. Section 12 makes it an offence for a person to instruct or train another person in the making or use of firearms or explosives or to receive such training without lawful authority or reasonable excuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">Section 17 builds on the provision in the Criminal Justice Act 1994 providing for the forfeiture of property. Essentially, the 1994 provision empowers a court, in its discretion, whenever any person is convicted of an offence, to order the forfeiture of any property in the possession of that person which was used, or intended to be used, to facilitate the commission of the offence. The effect of section 17 is, in the case of a person convicted of specified offences relating to the possession of firearms or explosives, and where there is property liable to forfeiture under the 1994 Act, to require the court to order the forfeiture of such property unless it is satisfied that there would be a serious risk of injustice if it made such an order.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">I appreciate that some Deputies will look at the advances that have been made in the search for peace since 1998 and say that we no longer require this legislation, but I disagree. The full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement remains an ongoing challenge and one which the Government continues to pursue with the utmost commitment. The Taoiseach, together with Prime Minister Blair, will meet the parties later this month to try to move us closer to the full re-establishment of the institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">The enemies of peace have not gone away. Dissident so-called republican groups remain active, ruthless and determined to strike if given the opportunity. They remain resolutely opposed to the will of the people of Ireland, as expressed in the Good Friday Agreement, and to the peace it has engendered. They remain determined to destroy that Agreement by any means at their disposal and they have shown they are prepared to kill indiscriminately in their fanatical opposition to democracy and peace on this island. As long as there are organisations, such as those treasonable organisations prescribed under the 1939 Act, dedicated to frustrating the will of the people through violence and mayhem, robust counter-measures must be available to the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">The success of the two police forces in thwarting various attempts to take life, some of which I have mentioned, should not be perversely held up as reason to set aside this legislation. The fact that the Garda is successful depends on this legislation; it is not a reason for getting rid of it, rather it is proof that it is still required. Neither should the fact that some sections of the Act were not used in the period be held out as a reason for jettisoning provisions such as directing terrorism and the like because people are involved in this endeavour and the Garda is constantly in pursuit of them. Both the so-called Continuity IRA and the so-called Real IRA would gladly kill and maim any number of innocent persons in the pursuit of their fanatical and misguided view of what republicanism amounts to on this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">The Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 is one element of the State's ongoing response to the terrorist threat. I urge the House not to countenance weakening any of the tools the State has at its disposal in the fight against terrorism. I commend the resolution to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimOKeeffe" eId="spk_165">
          <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_258">Fine Gael supports the renewal of the provisions of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act. I support the motion because I believe that in the absence of a permanent and peaceful resolution to the conflict on this island, we cannot compromise the capacity of the State to act decisively to deal with terrorism and dissident activity. In analysing the need for the renewal of the legislation, I have identified four areas on which we need to focus.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">First, we should bear in mind that these provisions followed the horror of Omagh. We should also bear in mind that those responsible for that dreadful outrage and other like-minded individuals continue to plan similar types of activities on this island. They have not gone away, and as long as that is the case we need the instruments to ensure that as far as possible they will be brought to justice and, if they are arrested, that we have the processes and procedures to bring them to justice and make them answerable for these terrible crimes.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">The second reason that motivates me is that of the unholy alliance that now appears to have emerged between some of these pseudo-republicans and their allies in the area of what has been referred to as "ordinary crime". This alliance between these pseudo-republicans and patriots and criminal gangs is a very sinister one. There is no doubt that many of these pseudo-patriots acquired a certain amount of expertise in firearms and munitions. It is horrific from the point of view of the safety and security of the lives and property of the people in this country that they are, apparently, now prepared to make that expertise available to criminal gangs. This is an issue we must investigate in greater depth because more information is needed if we are to assess the full extent of that threat. It is a chilling development and we must consider every reasonable means to counteract it.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">The third reason for the continuation of these provisions relates to developments internationally, including the murderous threats from terrorist organisations such as al-Qaeda. I have considerable insight into this because I have a family connection in Darfur. Given the difficult and threatening situation there, one can imagine the turmoil that may develop in that unfortunate country. The problem is that the world has become such a small place that terrorists can easily establish international connections. There is occasional evidence, whether in regard to ETA in Spain or other such organisations, of these connections being used to seriously negative effect. We cannot ignore these developments in regard to international terrorism.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">The fourth and most compelling reason for the renewal of these provisions is that some of the killers of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe remain at large. These provisions and any others that are necessary should be used to bring these people to justice and to secure their convictions. If these provisions can be of any assistance in this regard, they are justified on that count alone. There is a duty on any citizen of this State with information on this matter to make it available to the Garda Síochána.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_166">
          <from>Mr. Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_263">Hear, hear.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimOKeeffe" eId="spk_167">
          <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_264">I was absolutely outraged to learn recently of statements by a Member of this House indicating he would not be prepared to make such information available to the Garda Síochána. That Member has a case to answer if he is presenting himself to the public as a democrat, a person who has converted entirely to the democratic system. We all have a duty and responsibility to ensure those killers who remain at large are brought to justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">For the reasons I outlined, it is clearly necessary to continue the provisions of this Act for at least a further year. The Minister has detailed the report on the operation of the Act and provided details which add further corroboration to the case for the renewal of the provisions. Nevertheless, we can all look forward hopefully and envisage that the day will dawn when this type of legislation is no longer necessary. That is an aspiration of mine. I would like to see a time when the compelling factors I detailed for the renewal and maintenance of emergency legislation of this type no longer apply. The concept of emergency legislation is far from desirable. Ideally, we should aim for a situation where all legislation is reasonable and responsible enough to stand the test of time and retain its relevance. On the other hand, however, we must accept that we have not yet attained an ideal world and that we must in the meantime retain this emergency legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">A related issue that the Minister might deal with in his response relates to an announcement he made last year of the need to establish a second division of the Special Criminal Court because of the delays in cases being heard in that court. Have those delays been rectified and what is the situation in regard to the establishment of a second criminal court? We should ideally work towards the gradual phasing out of such courts rather than their extension. In the context of the peace process and what appeared to be some reduction in criminal terrorist activity from some of the organisations involved, I was somewhat surprised that there was apparently a need for an extension of the court processes for dealing with the perpetrators of such crimes.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">I very much support the renewal of the provisions of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 for one more year from 30 June. We will continue to stand by these provisions as long as they are necessary, while looking forward to the day when that is no longer the case. We will do what we can in the meantime to provide the institutions of the State, particularly the Garda Síochána, with the necessary resources and instruments to enable them to maintain peace in this State and to co-operate in so doing with other authorities on this island. These provisions have a role to play in that regard and Fine Gael fully supports their renewal.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_168">
          <from>Mr. Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_268">Like me, I am sure this annual renewal brings other Members starkly back to that awful day in August 1998 when a bomb was detonated in Omagh. At the time, all of us were imbued with the notion that there was light at the end of the tunnel and that we were moving away from the awful decades of terrible violence, carnage and mayhem. A peaceful resolution of the differences that long existed on this island had been brokered and although obliged to work through the tortuous layers of implementation involved in securing that resolution, it seemed we were embarked irreversibly on a path of peace where any act of violence would be totally abhorrent and unacceptable. We were rattled to the core, however, by the awful bombing of Omagh, which indicated that there were some who could not be convinced that the only future for this country involved a peaceful path. These were people who would resort to a level of carnage and mayhem that had no regard whatever for life. Everybody, including pregnant women and young children, was vulnerable to their slaughter.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">Unfortunately, those people whose murderous deed brought us into emergency session and motivated us to introduce the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 still exist on this island. Some have moved some way down the path towards an acceptance of peaceful means as the only mechanism for advancing causes. Unfortunately, however, there is a coterie of persons with irredentist views who can never be convinced of this. It is clear the State must be robust not only in its determination to bring these persons to justice but in arming the protectors of the State to ensure citizens of this and adjoining states can go about their business without fear of being murdered and brutalised. As long as dissident groups, whether republican or Unionist, exist with murderous intent, we must have robust laws. I believe that the Provisional IRA exists still, unfortunately, but at least it is largely, if not totally, disarmed at this stage and is committed to the path of co-operating with the political solution on this island, as brokered by all parties and endorsed by the overwhelming majority of people, North and South, of this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">I wish to refer to the legislation and the processes involved therein. The legislation, although enacted on an emergency basis, has a review mechanism within it and we are called to this House to review it annually. Unfortunately, sunset clause legislation has a habit on occasion, especially in the security area, of becoming a fixed entity. Laws enacted in the early 1970s are now permanent, although notionally temporary, features of our legal system and criminal code.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">We must be clear about what we are engaged in here. If there are sections of this Act which should properly form part of the permanent law, we should have that debate and make the necessary arrangements. The annual notion that we are reviewing this legislation with a realistic intent to remove it should be addressed in a robust way.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">The provisions of the 1998 Act are unusual in that they require a report to be laid before the House within a period of not more than 21 days from its production. There is no requirement in the legislation for the report to be laid before the House, as is the norm with other reports of a similar nature, 21 days before the debate takes place. The report was only laid before the House last Monday, and it is a flimsy document. It basically contains a recitation of the number of occasions on which the various sections of the 1998 Act were used, a general view from the Garda Síochána and from the Minister, none of which is particularly informative. It is certainly not nearly as informative as the Minister's speech to the House, which was much more expansive with regard to the matters at hand.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">We must have a more robust interaction between the Executive and the Legislature on these matters. I have never had the privilege of serving in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, but there is a generally held view, which the Minister may share, that at the core of that Department, for a very long time, was a security view that almost deemed it an unnecessary liberty to share information with members of the Government. It was also deemed an extraordinary liberty to share information with, or ask the opinion of, Members of the Oireachtas outside of Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">I had occasion to deputise for the then Tánaiste, the former Deputy, Dick Spring, at a Cabinet security committee. I had the sense that the then Secretary of the Department felt that he had to be very careful when sharing information with people who happened to be holders of Cabinet office temporarily. Whether they could be trusted with the security of the State was a question on which the jury was still out.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">That mentality, quite understandably, built up in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform over a period because the security of the State was threatened and fundamentally assaulted over decades by people who wanted to bring down the Constitution, the constitutional authority and the institutions created by the people under the Constitution. Thankfully, we have moved beyond that now and that mindset, if it still exists, must be abandoned.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">We must have a better debate, and I am addressing this point to a Minister who normally listens to points made, about the future of the security arrangements in place on this island in the changed circumstances. We also need an open and reasonable debate on some of the matters put forward by my colleague, the Fine Gael justice spokesperson, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, including the future of the Special Criminal Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">The Minister referred to international terrorism and we are all aware of the terrible experiences endured by the United Kingdom and Spain in recent times. We have enacted the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 as regular law. Do we need to supplement that with special law? If so, why? If we need more robust, permanent law, why not have the debate and enact such law?</p>
          <p eId="para_278">In most developed democracies there is a security committee of the Legislature. We have the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights but it seldom, if ever, deals with matters in an open and robust way, with a realistic assessment from the Garda authorities, the Special Branch and those monitoring dissident groups of how real the threat is and what laws are required. Is there a need for the existence or, as was suggested last year, the expansion of the Special Criminal Court? All these matters could be usefully debated in an open forum that takes away the secrecy surrounding security issues that has overshadowed debates in the past. This would also reassure the public that their security is safeguarded, the most robust, but fairest, laws are being enacted and that the Oireachtas is not going too far in attempting to strike a balance between securing the liberty of the individual citizen and ensuring that terrorism is confronted robustly.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">The Minister referred to a new issue that has arisen, that is, the dissident republicans, or others, who find themselves with no career path for the future and are embarking on criminal activity or using munitions and explosives expertise or arms, originally ear marked for the so-called cause, for nefarious, murderous, gangster purposes. We must be robust in confronting that overlap between criminal gangsterism and dying dissident republicanism to ensure a new monster is not created.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">There is a certain <i>pro forma </i>or charade involved in producing a report that simply recites the number of occasions on which various sections of the legislation were used in the previous 12 months, accompanied by a few sentences to the effect that the Garda authorities believe the legislation remains a necessary arm for them and the Minister acquiescing with that opinion. That does not meet the requirements of robust, democratic scrutiny of the rights and protection of the citizen which must be balanced by legislators.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">I hope that, in replying to this debate, the Minister will indicate his thinking on the future regime for security arrangements in the State, the future attitude to the special courts, how the Oireachtas, to the best of its ability, might best engage so that there will always be public confidence that it will protect the rights of the citizen, not only to life and liberty, but to freedom of movement, discourse and all other entitlements, without the intrusion of the State. In the aftermath of 11 September, there was an imbalance in the United States as it rushed to enact the Patriot Act. We have endured over a much longer period a more sustained assault on our democratic institutions. By and large, with a few mistakes, we have been reasonable in the legislative measures we have put in place and we have continued to function as a constitutional democracy mindful of our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights and our international obligations under UN conventions. That is how we should advance and where we can set aside emergency or special provisions. We should always take the opportunity to do so, consistent with the well-being and protection of our people.</p>

          <p eId="para_283">Once again I implore all Deputies to consider the highly corrosive effect of this legislation on human rights, civil liberties and democratic life in this State before voting today. I urge all Deputies to reject the Government motion because no emergency exists that could possibly justify the continuation of the draconian measures contained in the sections that are up for renewal or indeed the rest of the Offences against the State Acts. Several of the sections have never been used and their continued operation in this non-emergency situation is a violation of Ireland's requirements under the derogation regimes of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. The legislation is also contrary to the Good Friday Agreement, which requires steps towards security normalisation, including the progressive elimination of the Acts' provisions as circumstances permit. Circumstances now permit.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">The Offences against the State Acts fuel a cycle of repression and resistance which ultimately jeopardises human security by unnecessarily breaching fundamental human rights. Article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights permits a state to derogate from certain human rights obligations, but only in time of public emergency which threatens the life of the nation and the existence of which is officially proclaimed and only to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation. Each derogation shall be directed to an actual clear, present or imminent danger and may not be imposed merely because of an apprehension of a potential danger. Likewise the European Convention on Human Rights also permits temporary derogations from certain human rights obligations and it imposes similar conditions to those of the international covenant.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">Last July the IRA called an end to the military campaign and in September completed its final act of placing all its arms and weaponry permanently and verifiably beyond use. This was confirmed by the International Independent Commission on Decommissioning and others. While armed loyalist groups have operated in this jurisdiction in the past, with the aid of British intelligence, in recent years they have not operated within the State.</p>

          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_287">No shootings or bomb attacks have been claimed by loyalist groups. There has never been an international terrorist attack in the State and dissident republicans are isolated and few. Therefore, the July and September developments seem a reliable indicator of a definitive end to any conditions that could have been used to try to justify a state of emergency. At this stage, surely it can no longer be denied that the continued use of these draconian provisions is untenable.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">The Minister sees imaginary threats to the security of the State where it suits his own agenda to do so — for example, to destroy the Centre for Public Inquiry and the good name of its director, Frank Connolly. This explains his desire to hang on to this legislation regardless of the reality on the ground. He cannot, however, deny that parts of the Offences against the State Acts violate international law by becoming a <i>de facto</i> permanent part of the criminal justice framework and by suspending ordinary rights on the pretence of a public emergency threatening the life of the State when no such emergency exists.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">The apathy of most of the Opposition on this issue, and the ill-advised, misplaced enthusiasm of others for these measures have negative implications for Irish society. The unreformed Garda Special Branch maintains the power to act as a political police force, systematically harassing citizens engaged in open, legal and democratic political activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">There are other far-reaching implications. The seepage of this legislation into the permanent legal infrastructure of the State contributes to the momentum of the post-11 September erosion of fundamental rights protection globally. Regimes of permanent emergency violate international laws and must be challenged whenever they appear.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">For the sake of the peoples of Ireland and in solidarity with those living in repressive regimes everywhere, every Deputy in this House who values democracy must first vote against the Government motion and then campaign for the repeal of the Offences against the State Acts in their entirety.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_172">
          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_292">I welcome the debate on the renewal of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998. This is an opportunity to reflect on this issue and it is important that we debate this legislation coolly and calmly. Of course we all agree that the Omagh bombing and the Dublin and Monaghan bombings targeted innocent people and were utterly wrong. Every Member of the House agrees with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">There is no contradiction, however, between talking about protecting civil liberties and human rights and opposing sectarian violence and expressing opposition to the Offences against the State Acts. People who raise awkward questions about this legislation should not have their motives questioned. Sadly, however, elements in society regularly do so, both in the House and outside it.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">The vast majority of people on this island oppose violence and support peaceful and democratic means. A small number still believes the way forward is through violence, but they are very much the minority. Since the peace process began, there have been major changes and we have made great progress. If we do not take that on board in this debate, we are simply being close-minded.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">When discussing this legislation, the peace process and the wider question of republicanism, it is my belief that true republicans should have nothing to do with criminal elements in society. That is not up for debate. We should also reflect on the meaning of republicanism in the Ireland of 2006 and come up with sensible ways of broadening that vision for the creation of an inclusive, progressive republic. In fairness to the republican movement, it has shown leadership and we should support it in this issue, particularly following its dumping of arms last year. There is an onus on us as Members of the Oireachtas to show leadership in the peace process and to be prepared to support those who are taking the major risks.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">It is now up to the DUP to wake up and get involved in the talks process. It is no longer acceptable for it to drag its heels. I strongly disagree politically with the Ulster Unionist Party but I commend its leader for his efforts in recent weeks. I do not criticise Reg Empey for trying to bring in the PUP, for facing up to the reality of loyalist violence and for trying to end it once and for all. I challenge those in the Ulster Unionist Party who are jumping ship because of Reg Empey's actions to think again. He is thinking of the bigger picture and broader society. It is not simply a numbers game to gain seats in the Executive. In his recent response, he has taken a brave and difficult decision. Whether one is an Independent Deputy or a member of the Government, the Opposition, the DUP, the PUP, or any other political organisation in this country, there is an onus upon one to get out there and deal with sectarianism and violence on the island. The attack on Nuala O'Loan's son in recent days was an absolute disgrace. That woman and her family have made a major contribution to debate regarding policing on the island, and that boosted the peace process. I express my absolute abhorrence of the attack on her son and challenge those involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">While the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is in the Chamber, I would like to say how important it is that Ministers acknowledge their duty to act responsibly and respect human rights and civil liberties. At this crossroads in political life and the peace process generally, why are we still considering repressive legislation? I ask that fundamental question because we do not need it. The time is right for change, and I strongly oppose this legislation and urge all Deputies present to consider my views.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CiaranCuffeGP" eId="spk_173">
          <from>Mr. Cuffe</from>
          <p eId="para_298">Some time ago the Minister promised to be radical or redundant, but today he is both repetitive and repugnant. I do not believe it correct to rubber-stamp this legislation for yet another year. There is a real danger of our becoming dependent on emergency legislation. In this instance, the harsh cases that he cites make for bad law, and developments in the peace process over the last 12 months as well as in recent years mean we should not keep such legislation on the Statute Book. I am concerned at the systematic erosion of civil liberties on the island, and renewing this legislation does nothing to protect them.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">It is also important to discuss the police force. In the South, I have seen both great and lousy gardaí in operation. They have kept their cool in the most difficult of situations, while others have lost their rag over the most minor of issues. Gardaí threatened me with the loss of an American visa in the bad old days of the 1980s. Gardaí also removed film from a camera when they did not like the pictures I was taking. More recently, I have learnt of widespread concern at the conduct of members of the force regarding the unexplained death of Terence Wheelock after his detention in Store Street Garda station. I have seen a more worrying can of worms exposed regarding the conduct of certain gardaí in the Donegal district. Giving the gardaí incredible emergency powers on a rolling annual basis does not make sense when those concerns are still current.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">I stress that the vast majority of gardaí are fantastic testimony to this State's foundation and can hold their heads high regarding how they conduct their business. However, there are rumblings of discontent, both from members of the public and from individuals who feel that they have been wronged by particular gardaí. We should be very wary of continuing to give this legislation a rubber stamp, especially when gardaí have been granted unprecedented powers of discovery under legislation passed by the Minister over the last few years. They also have unprecedented access to electronic information, drawing on data retained over several years. That gives them incredible ability to find out what people are up to. Given that they have been granted such further powers in that area, it simply makes no sense to continue, year on year, giving them powers afforded initially for a 12-month period under this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">The Minister and others have said on the record of the House today that "they have not gone away", in what I assume was a reference to subversive forces in the State. However, at some stage there must be respect and trust. It is incumbent on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to signal to all on the island that we are moving on. I am not convinced that the legislation we are passing today will achieve that. I worry about powers such as 24-hour detention periods, which are being used for purposes not originally intended in the legislation. If we are using legislation for a purpose not originally intended, there must be doubts over it.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">When we receive the good news from some of the darker forces in Irish society that the war is over, we should reciprocate and send out a clear signal that we too are moving on.</p>

          <p eId="para_313">I entirely agree with Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's comment on recent remarks by Deputy Ferris. It is totally inappropriate for any person to say regarding an offence subject to investigation by the Garda Síochána that people should withhold information. Deputies Ferris and Ó Snodaigh are no exceptions to the rule that one sits in this House only as a citizen of the State. No one not a citizen is so entitled. Under Article 9 of the Constitution, all citizens owe this State a fundamental duty of loyalty. If one does not like that, one should not be in this House. If one believes in the duty of loyalty to the State, one must assist its forces in investigating serious crime.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_315">The real reason that Deputy Ferris made those remarks is that he still clings to the idiotic ideology of the Provisional movement that somehow their acts were not crimes because they were carried out at the behest of the army council, in whom, the idiots all believe, the Irish people's powers of government are somehow vested. It is the sad delusion of fanatics, and the sooner they abandon that reasoning and stop making stupid statements based on it, the better. They must realise that they are citizens of the State, sit in this House as such, and owe that State and no other their loyalty under Article 9 of the Constitution. I also agree with what Deputies Howlin and Jim O'Keeffe said about the emerging evidence that certain such people have decided to sell their munitions and explosives expertise to drug warlords. That is a sad fact. It is not the first time that this has taken place because the Provisional movement tried to sell its expertise to drug warlords in Colombia for far more money but was foiled in the attempt.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">Deputy Ó Snodaigh persistently raises the question of my actions in respect of Frank Connolly. The rules of this House provide that anyone who thinks he or she has been maligned can go to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and have his or her side of the story put on the record, but this never happened in the case of Frank Connolly. No effort has been made in public or on the floor or on the record of this House to rebut one word I said. This silence is extremely eloquent. Anyone who believes his or her good name has been adversely affected by anything said in this House is entitled under its rules to have his or her side of the story put on the record, but this has never happened in the case of Frank Connolly for very good reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">The Government decided to establish a second chamber of the Special Criminal Court but has not appointed judges to it because the situation in respect of delays in the court has improved dramatically. The reason for the Government's decision at that time was that the Supreme Court had ruled that bail legislation which provided that people could be denied bail on the basis that they would commit a further serious offence was overridden if the State could not provide a reasonably proximate trial. I faced a situation where people were arrested at training camps in the south east and other places. There was every reason to deny them bail because the activities they were engaged in suggested an intent to commit further criminal offences. The Bail Act 1997 should have been available to deny them bail but the fact that there would have been a delay in holding their trials would, under the Supreme Court's reasoning, amount to a reason for their release. Given that I faced a threat of this kind, it was prudent to provide for a second chamber of the Special Criminal Court. Happily, it has not proved necessary to proceed with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">This legislation has been described as emergency legislation. It is not emergency legislation, it is legislation which is put in place with the one requirement that its provisions be annually renewed.</p>

          <p eId="para_320">It was brought about by the political emergency following the Omagh bombing but it is part of our law, subject to the rule that it be renewed annually.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">Certain comments have been made about my Department. My Department takes its job very seriously. Officials involved in security take their job very seriously but they are not the securocrats they are portrayed as. They are very reasonable people who live in the real world, rather than a shadow world of spooks. There is a very good exchange of information between the Garda Síochána and the Government. Under the Garda Síochána Act 2005, the Secretary General, who is non-political, has the right to demand documents, records and information from the Garda Síochána as is necessary. This means that for the first time, the Government has a clear right which is not simply operated by threatening to sack a Garda Commissioner. The Secretary General has a clear right to obtain such information as is necessary for the Government to discharge its functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">In an ideal world, perhaps we would not need this kind of legislation. We must bear in mind how the scales are balanced between those who are minded to break the law and those whose job it is to prevent them from doing so and prosecute them when they do so. If someone is being interrogated about membership of an unlawful organisation for 24 or 48 hours and continually tells lies, an inference should be drawn. It cannot serve as proof by itself but it should be capable of being drawn in these circumstances. It is not an unfair rule. The extension from 48 to 72 hours is circumscribed by fairly heavy judicial protections and compares very well with what takes place internationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">Certain Members have spoken here about infringements or destruction of human rights. Compared to virtually every other state in Europe, the Irish system must be one of the liberal systems. I do not think detaining someone for 72 hours would be regarded as strange across Europe, even in respect of very different types of offences. Before we argue that this law is somehow draconian, we should realise that it is not draconian compared with the norm across Europe in respect of these types of offences. I do not believe Europe is a draconian part of the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">Certain individuals constantly argue that human rights considerations are one side of the equation, while this kind of law is the other. I strongly believe that defending people's human rights and preventing another atrocity such as that in Omagh, which is a defence of human rights, requires that we have this law. If the deluded fanatics of the so-called republican movement who are still intent on detonating bombs eventually acknowledge that this chapter of their history was shameful and state that they will use different methods to achieve their political goals, we can examine some of these issues in a different light. However, we should not be naive and should always remember that the jihadist threat has emerged since 1998 in a form which requires the existence of robust laws in this part of the world. Not only do we have a duty to Irish people not to allow some jihadist atrocity to take place here, we also have an obligation to our fellow members of the EU not to allow Ireland to be used as a place from which such an atrocity will be planned or perpetrated in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_478">The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, who apologises for his absence today on amendment No. 1 indicated his intention to propose an enabling provision to the Bill to allow the Government's decision on whether to grant labour market access to nationals of Bulgaria and Romania on their accession to the European Union to be implemented by ministerial order. Amendment No. 1, as agreed by the Seanad, does this.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">Amendment No. 3 was proposed on advice of Parliamentary Counsel and makes the reference to section 10 of the 2003 Act more specific by referring to paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>d</i>) of that section.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">Amendment No. 2 concerns subsections (2) and (3) of section 9, which relate to information that will accompany or be included on an employment permit. This amendment, which was proposed on the advice of Parliamentary Counsel, is necessary to take account of an amendment agreed on Report Stage in the Dáil to the effect that an employment permit should include or be accompanied by a summary of the principal employment rights of the employee.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">Amendment No. 4 is a technical amendment, proposed on the advice of Parliamentary Counsel, which merely puts brackets around the figure "2".</p>
          <p eId="para_482">Amendment No. 5 was tabled by Deputy Howlin on Report Stage in the Dáil and the Minister was disposed toward accepting it. Accordingly he put it forward for consideration on Committee Stage in the Seanad. The amendment will result in uniformity in the entitlement of permits of unlimited duration after five years, irrespective of whether the employee or employer is the applicant.</p>

          <p eId="para_483">I support the amendments, which are mainly of a technical nature. Can the Minister confirm that he said the enabling provision would be implemented by ministerial order, to take into account changing labour market conditions with regard to Bulgaria and Romania? Will he give an undertaking to return to the House with more than just a ministerial order? Perhaps the order can be placed before the House for debate before the matter is concluded.</p>

          <p eId="para_486">I welcome the amendment which ensures that this House will, from day one, allow full access to nationals of Bulgaria and Romania when they accede to the EU. The Government has already done so and we have praised the Government for the stance it has taken. It is a pity the same stance was not taken by other member states. Only six countries allow full access but all 25 should and, upon the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, all 27 should do so. There should not be two tiers in the European Union. I welcome the foresight shown by the Minister but it would have been preferable if the Government had taken a decision to allow this from the date of accession. However, it has not done so but said it would consider the matter. It is regrettable that the decision on Bulgaria and Romania joining the EU has been kicked into touch for a further number of months. Otherwise on 1 January, all 27 nations in the EU would enjoy full rights from day one, provided they complied with the rules of the EU. When Greece, Spain and Portugal joined the EU similar restrictions were imposed but were lifted within two years because the excuses made at the time for blocking free access to the labour market did not materialise. I welcome the change in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">On the Bill in general, it is a pity that employment permits continue to be granted to employers rather than employees.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" eId="spk_193" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_488">At the meeting of the European Council in May the EU Ministers, as the Deputy is aware, deferred the decision until the autumn, to see whether Bulgaria and Romania were prepared for membership. They will review the situation at that point to determine if they will be worthy of entry on 31 January 2007. If the assessment is negative it will be put back to January 2008 but I hope they will be able to join in January 2007.</p>

          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_489">I welcome the amendments and the response of the Government, as well as the fact that the Minister has indicated that before a decision is made by ministerial order on opening up the Irish labour market to both new countries, Bulgaria and Romania, it will be brought before the House and the House will have a chance to discuss it. It is appropriate we should do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">The postponement of the decision of the European Commission until September, with the support of the Council, provides an added incentive for the Bulgarians and Romanians to get their houses in order. They barely meet the very onerous standards of the <i>acquis communautaire</i>. I gathered from my conversation with the socialist Prime Minister of Bulgaria that postponement until September is being seen as an added incentive for them to bring forward more of the necessary changes, particularly in the judiciary and in matters relating to corruption.</p>

          <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_491">It is most unfortunate that the amendments from the Seanad did not address the cornerstone of the Bill, the fundamental weakness, which was the fact that a permit is given to an employer rather than an employee. That would have released the stranglehold that employers have around the necks of employees, which we still see in the employers who abuse their position in that regard. Will the Minister consider revisiting that issue? Can an amendment be moved this afternoon to rectify that fault?</p>

          <p eId="para_493">A copy of the employment permit, which amounts to indentured servitude to an employer, is given to the employee, but not the permit itself. It is not a permit that allows somebody to come to Ireland to work, whereby if an employer abuses them they can change to a different employer. It is not a green card as exists in the US and that is what should have been addressed in the Bill.</p>

            <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_495">Mar atá tugtha le fios go minic agam sa Teach seo, tá dul chun cinn suntasach déanta maidir le forálacha Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2003 a chur i bhfeidhm. Tá 27 scéim teanga daingnithe agam go dáta le comhlachtaí poiblí agus foilsithe. Sa bhreis ar sin, tá mo Roinn ag plé faoi láthair le níos mó ná 70 comhlacht poiblí eile maidir le dréacht-scéimeanna teangan a ullmhú.</p>
            <p eId="para_496">Tá Oifig Choimisinéir na dTeangacha Oifigiúla bunaithe agus, i mí an Mhárta i mbliana, d'fhoilsigh an coimisinéir a thuarascáil bhliantúil do 2005. Tugadh feidhm don chuid is mó d'fhorálacha an Achta le héifeacht ó 19 Eanáir 2004 agus tiocfaidh fuílleach na bhforálacha i bhfeidhm go huathoibríoch ar 14 Iúil 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_497">I mí Aibreáin na bliana seo, rinne mé rialacháin a thug liosta na gcomhlachtaí poiblí atá clúdaithe faoin Acht suas go data. Tá deich gcinn d'orduithe logainmneacha déanta agam go dáta, ina measc An tOrdú Logainmneacha (Ceantair Gaeltachta) 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_498">Ar iarratas uaim, tá Foras na Gaeilge tar éis córas creidiúnaithe d'aistritheoirí Gaeilge a fhorbairt. Reachtáladh scrúdú ar 8 Aibreán seo caite d'fhonn painéal cáilithe a chur le chéile agus tuigim go mbeidh an painéal sin ar fáil do chomhlachtaí poiblí agus don phobal go luath. Tá i gceist tuilleadh scrúduithe a reachtáil amach anseo ag tráthanna rialta. Ar an iomlán, táim sásta leis an dul chun cinn atá déanta go dtí seo maidir le cur i bhfeidhm fhorálacha Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla ar bhonn céimiúil.</p>

          <speech by="#DinnyMcGinley" eId="spk_199">
            <from>Mr. McGinley</from>
            <p eId="para_499">Gabhaim mo bhuíochas leis an Aire as an eolas sin a chur ar fáil dom. Tá dul chun cinn áirithe á dhéanamh, ach sílim go bhfuil sé mall go leor. Deirtear go bhfuil 27 scéim teanga socraithe le heagraíochtaí Stáit go dtí seo agus go bhfuil 70 eile á n-achtú le comhlachtaí Stáit. Sílim gur sin an rud a dúirt an tAire. De réir mar a thuigim an scéal, tá breis agus 600, nó b'fhéidir 650, eagraíocht den chineál seo, ina measc Ranna, comhlachtaí Stáit, comhairlí contae, boird agus araile. An bhféadfadh an tAire a rá an bhfuil aon bharúil aige cén uair a bheidh scéimeanna teanga curtha ar fáil ag gach ceann den 650? Tuigim gur trí bliana atá i gceist le pleananna mar seo, agus tá sé follasach anois go mbeidh na trí bliana thart i gcuid de na cásanna sula mbeidh na scéimeanna curtha ar fáil ag an chuid eile. B'fhéidir gur chóir díriú isteach níos mó air.</p>
            <p eId="para_500">Tá sé de chead ag an Aire rialacháin a dhéanamh maidir le húsáid na Gaeilge go poiblí, in oifigí agus mar sin de. Cuir i gcás na litreacha a thagann amach as Ranna agus araile le seoltaí i nGaeilge orthu. Ba cheart go mbeadh comharthaíocht in áiteanna poiblí dátheangach, chomh maith leis an fhógraíocht a dhéantar.</p>
            <p eId="para_501">Nuair a chuirtear teachtaireacht chuig comhlacht Stáit, ba cheart go mbeadh sé taifeadta go bhfuil sí dátheangach. Cad é an dul chun cinn atá déanta ansin? Mar a dúirt an tAire, beidh forálacha an Achta ag teacht i bhfeidhm go huile is go hiomlán mí ó inniú, ar 14 Iúil. Dá réir sin, tá sé de dhualgas orainn go mbeidh gach Acht a chuirtear ar fáil san Oireachtas dátheangach, i nGaeilge agus i mBéarla, ón dáta sin ar aghaidh. An bhfuil córas i bhfeidhm anois a chinnteoidh gur mar sin a bheidh sé, de réir fhorálacha an Achta?</p>

            <p eId="para_504">Bhain an chéad cheist leis na pleananna. Tá córas fadálach go maith a d'aontaigh muid sa Teach seo. Le plean a chur i bhfeidhm, caithfear fógra a chur i scríbhinn agus an t-iarratas a lorg sé mhí roimh ré chun rud a thabhairt isteach, agus ansin caithfear an plean a mheas.</p>
            <p eId="para_505">Tá 28 díobh daingnithe, ach mar a mhínigh mé cheana sa Teach, is dóigh liom go bhfuil i bhfad níos mó ná an céatadán sin de ghníomhaíochtaí Stáit clúdaithe. Dhírigh muid ar na heagraíochtaí is mó a bhfuil tionchar acu ar shaol an phobail. Is é sin le rá nach mar a chéile iad na 600 eagraíocht ó thaobh tábhachta agus bainte leis an bpobal. Dhírigh muid ar chomhairlí contae Gaeltachta agus boird sláinte, nó an HSE mar atá anois, a bhíonn ag plé le ceantair Ghaeltachta. Dhírigh muid ar eagraíochtaí nó forais a bhfuil ról straitéiseach sa Stát acu, Roinn an Taoisigh, Oifig an Uachtaráin agus mar sin de.</p>
            <p eId="para_506">Is é ceann de na dreamanna is mo a mbíonn plé ag an bpobal leis ná na Coimisinéirí Ioncaim, agus tá siadsan istigh ón tús. Ainneoin nach bhfuil ach céatadán beag de na comhlachtaí Stáit clúdaithe, tá cuid mhaith de ghnáthghníomhaíochtaí an phobail clúdaithe. Is ceart díriu ar na heagraíochtaí ar fad a mbíonn plé ag an bpobal leo, an Roinn Talmhaíochta agus Bia, an Roinn Gnóthaí Sóisialacha agus Teaghlaigh, agus na Coimisinéirí Ioncaim, i dtosach, móide na heagraíochtaí pobail, is é sin, na comhairlí contae atá ag plé leis na contaethe Gaeltachta. Tá 70 ann i láthair na huaire. Is próiseas mall é má tá sé le déanamh.</p>
            <p eId="para_507">Nuair a bheidh muid ag teacht ar ais ag athbhreithniú na bpleananna, beidh bunsraith ann, agus ní bheidh aon dul siar uaidh sin. Is é an cheist a bheidh ann ná tógáil ar an mbunsraith a bheidh leagtha síos. Laethantaí, bíonn daoine á rá go bhfuil muid ag dul ró-sciobtha agus go bhfuil an iomarca á dhéanamh againn, agus laethantaí eile bíonn daoine á rá go bhfuil muid ag dul ró-mhall. Sílim féin go bhfuil dul chun cinn maith déanta. Ba bhreá liom go gcuirfí na 600 plean i gcrích.</p>
            <p eId="para_508">Chuir an Teachta ceist maidir le rialacháin. Tá mé ag obair ar rialacháin faoi chomharthaíocht agus na rudaí eile a luaigh sé. Ó thaobh na fógraíochta de, caithfimid tuilleadh obair bhaile a dhéanamh. Tá ceisteanna i leith fógraíochta ó thaobh an Stáit le plé. Maidir le comharthaíocht, tá súil agam rialacháin a thabhairt ar aghaidh go luath. Tá go leor oibre déanta air sin, agus tá mé beagnach tagtha go deireadh an bhóthair leis an gceann sin.</p>
            <p eId="para_509">Chuir an Teachta ceist faoi Achtanna an Oireachtais. Tá plé ar bun le píosa fada idir mo Roinn, Ranna eile agus Coimisiún Thithe an Oireachtais. Níor mhaith liom dul isteach sa scéal ró-dhomhain ach amháin a rá go dtiocfaidh sé isteach ar 14 Iúil go gcaithfear, de réir dlí, na hAchtanna — ní na Billí ach na hAchtanna — a fhoilsiú go comhuaineach san dá theanga. Tá sé ráite go soiléir ag an Rialtas go mbeidh na hacmhainní cuí ar fáil chuige. Tá comhráití ar bun i láthair na huaire, agus níl aon amhras orm ach go mbeifear in ann cloí leis sin. Is rud é a chaithfear a dhéanamh. Ba mhaith liom béimiú ó thaobh na nAchtanna de gur foirfiú nó beachtú ar fhoráil bhunreachta atá i gceist anseo. Cuireann an Bhunreacht dualgas orainn na hAchtanna a fhoilsiú san dá theanga.</p>

Táimid ag impí mar Rialtas, le tacaíocht chuile pháirtí sa Teach seo, ar an gComhphobal Eorpach glacadh leis an Ghaeilge mar theanga oifigiúil oibre ón gcéad lá den bhliain seo chugainn. Ar ndóigh, ní sheasfadh sé le réasún go n-iarrfadh an tír seo, a bhfuil fadhb aici na hAchtanna a aistriú go comhuaineach, ar an Eoraip dualgas a bhféadfadh a bheith níos troime ná sin a thógáil uirthi féin. Creidim go bhfuil daoine ina bhun sin. Ba é mé féin a d'ardaigh an cheist nuair a pléadh ceist na hEorpa.</p>

     <b>Mr. O’Shea</b>
      asked the 
     <b>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</b>
     the main findings of the recently published independent evaluation of the RAPID programme commissioned by POBAL; if he will state what the report cited as the main strengths and weaknesses of the RAPID programme; the action he intends to take following the report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_207" as="#Minister_for_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs">
            <from>Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_515">The RAPID programme aims to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within the 45 designated RAPID areas. My Department, with the support of Pobal, has overall responsibility for the co-ordination of the RAPID programme. It is a matter for each Department to respond to the recommendations contained in this report in respect of its specific areas of responsibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_516">As already indicated to the House, following discussions with my Department Pobal commissioned a formal evaluation of the programme, the final report of which was launched on 1 June last. The report indicates that the experience of the RAPID programme has been very positive in many areas and the programme has made substantial progress in identifying the needs of disadvantaged communities and in implementing important local projects in response to those needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_517">The main strengths of the programme are stated to be the facilitation of a significant number of local development projects addressing the most pressing needs of the local community. In the opinion of local stakeholders, these projects would not have progressed without the establishment of the RAPID programme. Another key strength noted was the establishment of structures that have provided a mechanism for disadvantaged communities to identify needs and influence policy. These structures allowed for the development of effective working partnerships between the key players, the levering of greater national and local government investment in RAPID areas and the development of innovative practice with regard to projects, community participation and engagement.</p>
            <p eId="para_518">In terms of programme weaknesses, the evaluators identified a general weakness with regard to strategic planning in some areas that has resulted in an <i>ad hoc</i> and reactive approach to bringing forward projects. Another weakness identified was the variation in the level of interaction with the local implementation of the programme by representatives of key State agencies as a result of other work pressures and individual commitment to the programme. The difficulty in securing funding for particular types of projects, for example, in regard to education, training and employment, was mentioned as another weakness in the evaluation report.</p>
            <p eId="para_519">I have given a commitment to consider the evaluators' findings and recommendations and intend to work with the various stakeholders at national and local level to address the findings in the report.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianOShea" eId="spk_208">
            <from>Mr. O’Shea</from>
            <p eId="para_520">I thank the Minister for his reply. Does he consider it a damning indictment of his role as co-ordinator of the implementation of the RAPID programme that the consultants' evaluation found there was limited implementation of the programme in a number of areas, most of which constitute the most disadvantaged areas? Is that not the kernel of the programme? This failure must be a damning indictment of the Minister's stewardship.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_209" as="#Minister_for_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs">
            <from>Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_521">I do not agree with the Deputy. There are 45 RAPID areas. As the report notes, the way the programme operates on the ground has been uneven. We have been addressing the issues on a continual basis. Community development, of which I have long experience, is a slow process. Mistakes were made in the past. When a community was not interactive and found it hard to self-motivate, it needed to be recognised that it would take time to get the best results in that community.</p>
            <p eId="para_522">I did not design the RAPID areas. I accept there are issues to be considered. As I stated at the recent RAPID conference, I have noticed that the smaller, strand 2 areas, where there is more of what I would call the village effect identification issue, have had more success and more interaction.</p>
            <p eId="para_523">One issue which I will consider is the size of RAPID areas. For example, there are a number of RAPID areas in Tallaght but only one in Clondalkin. If one operates the area implementation team, AIT, over an area in which there is no natural interaction because the sheer numbers mitigate against that, it is fair to suggest that it will be harder to achieve close identification. Smaller communities always have more identification.</p>
            <p eId="para_524">I pointed out time and again one of the challenges faced in urban Ireland — I spoke about this in the presence of the Deputy's party leader last night. If I attend a meeting in a village in rural Ireland, like Ballycroy, to launch a community plan, 300 of the 600 souls who live in the parish will attend. If I go to a similar meeting in Tallaght, which has a population of 85,000, 150 might attend. One is obviously interacting with fewer people.</p>
            <p eId="para_525">There are challenges. However, instead of walking away from the challenges, we asked this group to compile a hard-hitting, independent report. It set out many positives. However, we are not shirking the issues. We asked the group to identify the weaknesses, which we are now addressing.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Shea</from>
            <p eId="para_526">I take the Minister's point but it is a generalised one. The criticism in my question referred to the lack of progress in the most disadvantaged areas, which is the kernel of the problem. There is also the issue of the programme having no set budget. I find it difficult to differentiate between where new funding was spent, where funding came from within the NDP and what may or may not have been front-loaded. These are the issues which arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_527">The Minister referred to the criticism of the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS in the context of accessing training, education and employment. What is the Minister's view of the recommendation that an incentive should be offered to employers by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to encourage employers to recruit employees from RAPID areas?</p>

          <p eId="para_530">It is obvious that certain areas, by virtue of being the most disadvantaged, would have been expected to be the slowest to take advantage of the RAPID programme. A fundamental part of the programme is community motivation. I am not the AIT. The AIT consists of a number of statutory agencies, local authorities and so on, but it also consists of community representatives. One of the obvious problems is that the most disadvantaged communities will have the weakest community structures — that is why they are most disadvantaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">In the past we thought we would solve the problems overnight. We accept that there are problems in these areas. As this has now been confirmed by an independent report, we will consider ways of giving a particular lift to these areas. That is the only rational way to proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">I agree with the Deputy that problems have arisen, which have been highlighted, with regard to certain agencies not interacting fully with the scheme. To be fair to the Department of Education and Science, last February I asked its officials to attend the last meeting of the national monitoring committee, which took place on 1 June, to give an account of how they would be more proactive with regard to the RAPID process. The meeting was very beneficial. A series of similar issues have arisen. For example, we interacted for a long time with the Garda Síochána with regard to community policing and, eventually, we made progress. We try to identify the problem areas, select them and see how to develop them.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">I am glad the Deputy raised the issue of prioritisation. When I was first presented with the RAPID programme, in the Department of Agriculture and Food, and was told to set up rural RAPID, I identified the issue raised by the Deputy — how to be sure something that happened in a target area under the NDP would not have happened anyway. I accept that is a problem. It is a challenge that has existed from the start. One of the reasons CLÁR is different from RAPID is that I said, "Thanks but no thanks".</p>
          <p eId="para_534">I inherited RAPID in a form that was agreed between the social partners. We have moulded it, but to address the issue raised by the Deputy we have the leverage funds and the earmarked dormant accounts funding of €11.5 million which is specifically for the AITs for projects that were falling through the cracks. We have tried to make it a poly-method funding rather than just the prioritisation or re-prioritisation that was originally intended.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_537">I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 43 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_538">The overall aim of the mid-term review of the national drugs strategy, NDS, was to examine the progress made to date in achieving the key strategic goals set out in the strategy and to enable priorities for future action to be identified for the remaining period up to 2008. As part of the review, the steering group undertook an extensive public consultation process. As the Government has positioned the drugs strategy within the context of wider social inclusion policy, the recommendations in the report were framed in this context and the focus of the strategy will continue to be on illegal drugs that do the most harm and on the most vulnerable drug misusers, their families and communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_539">The key conclusions of the steering group were that the current aims and objectives of the strategy are fundamentally sound and that progress is being made across the pillars. However, the steering group also found that some adjustments were required to refocus priorities and accelerate the roll out and implementation of the various key actions in the remaining period of the strategy up to 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_540">The review found that 49 of the 100 actions had already been completed or were ongoing tasks over the life of the strategy, progress had been made on 45 other actions with more work under way to deliver them and there were six actions upon which considerably more work was required. Also, the steering group's recommendations resulted in 17 of the strategy's existing 100 actions being either amended or replaced with a further eight new actions being identified.</p>
            <p eId="para_541">The six actions that were identified in the mid-term review where considerably more progress was required dealt with the following: the extension of community policing fora; review of the effectiveness of the prison strategy with respect to drugs; development of drop-in centres, respite facilities and half way houses; setting up of a pilot community pharmacy, needle and syringe exchange programme; drugs training for various professionals; and discussion of the national drugs strategy at meetings of the Oireachtas committees.</p>
            <p eId="para_542">Progress is being achieved under the national drugs strategy. Tackling the drug problem will remain a key priority of the Government.</p>

            <from>Mr. Crowe</from>
            <p eId="para_543">I asked about the areas where there was least progress and the Minister outlined six actions that were required. I accept more work must be done in the needle exchange area. Recently I was approached by a family in Cork whose son was in the local hospital. There was no room in the psychiatric unit so he ended up in the geriatric unit. The family informed me that their son must go to Dublin every day to get treatment. There is no methadone treatment in the Cork or Limerick area so people are travelling to Dublin every day.</p>
            <p eId="para_544">One of the difficulties for people in those areas is that if they want to move on or get a job, for example, their life revolves around getting another drug. It revolved around that before they went for treatment but the concept of the treatment is to move people forward. The Minister should examine this because it is one of the issues that must be tackled. It is like a badge of courage for the health board in the area to say there is no methadone treatment there.</p>
            <p eId="para_545">There is a physeptone bus operating in Dublin. It has been operating for eight years. It was supposed to be a temporary measure. It is unacceptable because there is no anonymity and so forth. This should be reconsidered and action taken on it.</p>
            <p eId="para_546">With regard to treatment, according to a response from the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, there is a waiting time of 19 months for people in the Athlone area for treatment. That is unacceptable. The waiting time is six months in other areas. In my constituency it is nine weeks. Places on community schemes are not being taken up by the health service. Perhaps the Minister will deal with this.</p>
            <p eId="para_547">There is also the new drug, cocaine. One action could be dealing with the lack of cocaine drug counsellors. I accept there is a need to retrain people, but for the long term we must look to other countries that have had some success tackling this new problem. There are schemes in New York which have had huge success with the heroin problem. Perhaps the health service and the Department would consider them. We must look outside the box.</p>
            <p eId="para_548">I accept there has been movement on this issue but there is still a huge amount to be tackled.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#NoelAhern" eId="spk_216" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs">
            <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_549">I thank the Deputy for his comments. I accept the needle exchange was a weakness in the operation of the strategy. While a number of centres in Dublin have needle exchange programmes, they tend to operate for only a couple of days per week or for only part of the day. Too many people, therefore, were coming to one or two main centres in the city centre. The HSE has provided extra money this year for extra services in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_550">With regard to the Deputy's remarks about Cork, some towns and cities have a different philosophy. Some places deliberately try to adopt a drug-free approach. That is up to each local or regional drugs task force. However, one must accept reality. What one likes is one thing but it is important to provide services to people from a harm reduction point of view. I accept that, until recently, people outside Dublin who had a drug problem had to come to Dublin every day. Since we established the regional drugs task forces, they have helped the HSE to provide services at local level. That is the reason people can say that the number of people using services in, for example, Carlow or Portlaoise has increased by 300%. It has, because services are now being provided there and they do not have to come to Dublin to the extent they did previously. It is an ongoing battle.</p>
            <p eId="para_551">I accept there are drugs in other parts of the country. The services are being provided. The situation is not perfect yet but we are getting there. With regard to the bus, was the Deputy referring to the inner city?</p>

            <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_553">One of the Deputy's colleagues spoke to me about that recently. The buses were geared at the more chaotic people who would not go to treatment centres. This was the thinking behind them. I will follow up on the matter for the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_554">Many of the people who have a cocaine problem now were already attending services for other drug problems such as heroin. It is not necessary to have more counsellors specialising in a single drug. The HSE is upskilling many of the staff so they can provide a comprehensive service to clients, regardless of whether the drug is alcohol, heroin or cocaine. We look at other countries. There is an EU drug strategy. I do not know the position in America which is very much into law and order and where there is far less emphasis on harm reduction and treatment. It has often been said of America that unless one is in prison or going to prison one cannot access many of the services. At EU level officials are dealing with the EU drug strategy and we are observing and following best practice in trying to implement what is appropriate and good policy here.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DamienEnglishFG" eId="spk_219">
            <from>Mr. English</from>
            <p eId="para_555">I will not go back over the drug strategy figures. All the areas and principles to be concentrated on are fundamentally correct. However, the solutions proposed for the various areas are not achieving results. There are drug addicts but the misuse of drugs by young people, and people in general, at weekends or every second weekend or once a month, has increased and appears to be more accepted. This House is not sending out a sufficiently strong message that drugs are bad. While the Minister of State speaks about it, I rarely hear the Government taking the lead or trying to deter people from using drugs. There is a lack of emphasis on the need to spend money to end the scourge of drug misuse. In the area of law and order we have failed through community policing to prevent people indulging in drugs and anti-social behaviour. I would appreciate the Minister of State's comments on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_556">Responsibility for establishing youth centres or hang-out areas in all towns rests with the Minister of State's Department, the Department of Education and Science and so on. This is what young people need. In any town or village one visits, the young people say they want a hang-out area. I have spoken with young people in Cork, Limerick, Galway and in County Meath on the matter. However, it is very difficult to get funding or sponsorship for such projects from any Department, yet there is €20 million in the Department of Education and Science from the dormant accounts fund for which there is no plan. Is there a real effort to do something for young people? If we do not spend money on services for them many more will end up on drugs and drink and the only culture they will know will be the drugs culture. That would be a great shame. In recent days we have heard much about culture and people who supported the arts. We have to look to what will happen in future if we do not tackle the problem now. There is an urgent need for action.</p>
            <p eId="para_557">On the last day we spoke of the delays in getting methadone treatment and the fact that in some areas one has to wait for months. I also highlighted the issue of getting people off methadone. I accept we need to get people off drugs and on to methadone to stabilise them. However, we have to ensure they do not become addicted to methadone. There are massive problems here. There are social and economic reasons to get people off methadone. Should more money be pumped into alternative treatments or are there other approaches? I came across a document recently from the late 1800s or the early 1900s which stated that heroin was originally used as a cure. I have to admit I did not realise that. It was introduced originally as a cure for another problem, but look at the problems it has caused. I fear we are going down the same road with methadone. I would like to hear the Minister of State's comments on that.</p>

            <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_558">I do not see the community drugs strategy as a failure. We are working with the community and all the statutory agencies. Drugs have not gone away and will not go away in the next year or two. As I said in my reply there may be people who are using drugs for recreational purposes. While on the prevention side we try to provide information to all sectors of society, our strategy is geared towards less well-off areas where people are dealing with illegal drugs and where drugs do most harm.</p>
            <p eId="para_559">The Deputy mentioned community policing. By the end of the year we will have 1,400 gardaí. The number of gardaí has rocketed during the past seven or eight years.</p>

            <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_561">The figures are impressive. The Minister said that by Christmas there will be 14,000 gardaí when one includes those in training. In 18 months' time there will be 14,000 trained gardaí. There is a great deal of action. There are a few pilot joint policing committees in some areas of the city. The guidelines for same will come from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the next few days and will go before the justice committee. Some of those policing committees operating on a pilot basis in parts of Dublin are working well. Members of the community have an opportunity to talk with the gardaí and the local authority and plan their work in a comprehensive way.</p>
            <p eId="para_562">I agree that different Departments fund youth centres. The Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism allocated millions of euro last week. We have the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund and have disbursed more than €100 million. That fund is exclusively for the drug task force areas in Dublin and Cork. Recently we gave some capital money to Waterford and Carlow. That was the first time, with the exception of Cork, that we had given capital money but we had given some services money to a few areas previously. That fund will be rolled out in a structured way. We have targeted mainly the Leinster towns. It is not a case of sending Deputies home with nice letters telling them a fortune is being spent on their areas. We have to cater for young people who are at risk from drugs based on the evidence.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DamienEnglishFG" eId="spk_223">
            <from>Mr. English</from>
            <p eId="para_563">That is the point I want to raise with the Minister of State. All our young people are at risk from drugs. I accept that most assistance has to go to those most at risk. We do not realise the problem is increasing in all areas. Drugs are beginning to get a hold on young people. The casual user will suffer long term. They start by taking drugs once a week or once a month and then more often. Drugs misuse is becoming a massive problem in all areas not only for those particularly at risk but for young people in general who are at risk.</p>

            <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_564">In regard to the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund, in Dublin after the local and regional drug task forces were set up, we established a development committee comprising members from a drug task force, a local authority and a VEC, which looked at prevention. It is a case of trying to develop ideas that would help to provide facilities to give an alternative to young people. That will be rolled out over the next few years particularly in the Leinster towns and towns that have a specific problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_565">Methadone is a short-term solution not a long-term solution. There is a report on Bupenorphine which is another option. A special rehabilitation committee was set up, arising from the mid-term review, which is looking at the overall issue into the future. It is not a case of putting a person on methadone and hoping the problem will be solved. It is about training people and getting them back into education and employment, allowing them make a useful contribution to society. That committee will report in the next month or so.</p>

     if his attention has been drawn to the recently published report Drugs and Crime in Ireland; the additional measures he intends to introduce as a result of this report; the action he intends to take to address the failure to halt the drug trade described in the report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#NoelAhern" eId="spk_225" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs">
            <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_567">I am aware of the Health Research Board's report, Drugs and Crime in Ireland, which was published at the end of May as the third in its overview series. The publication had been flagged a number of months in advance at the consequences sub-committee of the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, which operates under the aegis of my Department, and on which my Department is represented.</p>
            <p eId="para_568">The report is a welcome addition to our knowledge of the complicated relationship between drugs and crime and I hope it will help to inform the State's ongoing efforts to reduce drug-related crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_569">The report states that activities aimed at supply control coupled with efforts to reduce demand for drugs remain essential policy goals in our efforts at reducing drug related harm in society. I was particularly reassured to note from the report that the provision of treatment services can have a positive impact.</p>
            <p eId="para_570">In this regard the report indicates it has been suggested that the 29% reduction in recorded crime in this State between 1995 and 1999 might be partially explained by the increased availability of methadone maintenance programmes during that period in the Dublin area. This suggests our current approach to treatment provision is proving to have positive results in terms of crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_571">In addition to the broad range of treatment services already available, I have set up a working group to develop a strategy for the provision of integrated rehabilitation services and to report on the appropriate policy and actions to be implemented. The terms of reference of the group are extensive and include examining the existing provisions of rehabilitation services in Ireland, identifying best practice and gaps as well as recommending actions to develop an integrated rehabilitation service. I am confident the report of the group will aid us in further developing the comprehensive range of treatment and rehabilitation services.</p>
            <p eId="para_572">On the issue of supply reduction, the Garda Síochána and Revenue's customs service have extensive strategies in place to deal with the drugs trade described in this report. These strategies include gathering intelligence on individuals and organisations involved in the distribution of drugs, including the support structures underpinning this activity, conducting targeted operations on criminal networks based on intelligence gathered and working in collaboration with other law enforcement agencies, both within and outside the jurisdiction.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianOShea" eId="spk_226">
            <from>Mr. O’Shea</from>
            <p eId="para_573">We acknowledge the point the Minister of State made on the success with treatment, specifically methadone. However, in terms of hard drugs, there is now much more cocaine than methadone coming in. Hovering in the background all the time is the prospect that crack cocaine could become more plentiful.</p>
            <p eId="para_574">Regarding the link between drug use and violent crime, the figures in the report show that 28% of detected crime in 2004 was related to drug users, while the figure was 66% in 1997, so clearly there is a significant movement. The author of the report points in the direction of increased employment and greater availability of treatment as a possible explanation. Does the Minister of State agree with the finding of the report that the social environment was a more powerful contributor than the effect of drugs on an individual in terms of whether the person used violence?</p>
            <p eId="para_575">The RAPID programme was mentioned. The consultants' evaluation contained a criticism directed towards the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS in terms of the difficulty in accessing money for training, education and employment courses. I know the Minister of State was a little distracted when about to make his reply, but would he or the Minister favour approaching FÁS and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to seek an incentive scheme for employers to employ people from RAPID areas? In other words, the employers would not need to be in the RAPID areas but the employees would come from there, because it seems from the statistics that in the context of providing additional employment, the violence aspect of drug use can be reduced.</p>

          <speech by="#NoelAhern" eId="spk_227" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs">
            <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_576">I accept there is more cocaine coming into the country, though much of the usage is on the recreational level. Not many more people are seeking services in the area, and those who are were on heroin already and were in contact with the staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_577">Clearly there are links between drugs and violence, and that was the case in the past, certainly anecdotally in Dublin constituencies. The attitude is that ten years ago, more drug abusers got the money for their next fix by robbing and mugging, but methadone has helped to solve that problem and stabilise people. Perhaps we have not had great success in getting people off methadone and more needs to be need done in that regard, but it has taken people away from crime in the short term.</p>
            <p eId="para_578">I appreciate what Deputy O'Shea said about jobs. Last week I launched a project in Dublin about getting drug misusers back into employment. There are a couple of such projects in different parts of Dublin. Employers have in general taken the opportunity to give jobs to drug misusers who have become stabilised. Employers may have perceptions and misconceptions about what might happen, but once they are happy that they can ring me, Deputy O'Shea or whoever in the event that the employee has a problem and that we will take these people off their hands, so to speak, certain employers are prepared to go ahead and take a chance for stabilised drug misusers.</p>
            <p eId="para_579">The mid-term review showed that the approach was a little too centred on putting people on methadone. The rehabilitation sub-committee has been set up to pull all those bits and pieces together and show that methadone is not a long-term solution. One needs to stabilise drug misusers, to look at retraining and getting them back into work so that they can make a contribution to their communities and families. That is the direction we are trying to take.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Shea</from>
            <p eId="para_580">I thank the Minister of State for that reply. Clearly there is positive movement in the area. Is the Minister of State in favour of an incentive programme being put in place to encourage employers to take people from RAPID areas? I accept the need for back-up services if people lapse and so on. For instance, I am talking about people who are on drugs, but I am also talking about people in RAPID areas who need the extension of their social inclusion to be gainfully employed. I know that to some extent this is in the area of responsibility of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. Employers should be given incentives to employ people from RAPID areas and, clearly, people who have had a drug habit and are now rehabilitated could also be taken on board. People whose lifestyle, as a result of methadone, is no longer chaotic, are employable too. There is a need to be proactive in encouraging employers to take on such people. We all know that in some of our cities and towns, certain addresses are a turn-off for employers. In some instances there is a tendency to look at an address rather than at a person.</p>

            <p eId="para_581">It is not today or yesterday that there has been geographic discrimination, certainly in Dublin city. Some people would have used their grannies' addresses when applying for jobs. That is not new and we have all lived with it in parts of Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_582">There are incentives, though not monetary, for employers to take on certain people. I saw at least two projects in operation recently which were funded by the Department for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. These are projects which are geared at retraining former drug misusers, getting them back into jobs and liaising with employers. There is at least a couple of projects involved in that, and employers are taking a chance. With regard to RAPID projects, I understand the Minister will evaluate them in his report.</p>

     <b>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</b>
     if the CLÁR programme will be of assistance to the Achill Sound sewerage scheme, County Mayo in view of the fact that the polluter pays principle means that it is making the scheme economically impossible, as the scheme has already been cut back to a considerable extent and the local contributions sought are still too high; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_585">I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 54 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_586">The Achill Sound sewerage scheme is a public scheme costing €8.55 million and it has been approved under the water services investment programme in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for commencement in 2006. Discussions are ongoing between that Department and Mayo County Council with regard to addressing certain funding aspects of the project. There are no measures operating under the CLÁR programme for the funding or co-funding of major public water and sewerage schemes.</p>

            <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
            <p eId="para_587">Can CLÁR programme funding be allocated to this scheme? The Minister informed me he has corresponded with Mayo County Council on the matter. The scope of the scheme has been reduced to not include houses on the Mulranney road. With this reduction, the marginal cost to Mayo County Council will be €2.4 million, equivalent to 38%. The council believes its contribution should be only 19%. As there is no existing sewerage scheme, the circumstances are unique. However, the polluter pays principle has sounded the death knell for a wastewater collection scheme in Achill, which has been on the cards since 1991. If the scheme was built then, the polluter pays principle would not be used. The result of having no scheme is that raw sewage flows into Achill Sound. Can a hardship provision be invoked? Can the CLÁR programme provide funding for the scheme?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_232" as="#Minister_for_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs">
            <from>Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_588">The idea of the CLÁR programme is to establish schemes. Individual projects are not evaluated. Each scheme has to be agreed with the line Department, in this case the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. No situation is unique — we are all unique and we are all the same. This applies to the Achill Sound sewerage scheme. A delegation recently informed me not to worry about the situation in Achill because there is a unique one in County Clare. My village, Corr na Mona, does not have a sewerage scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_589">If I were to consider the Achill Sound situation under the CLÁR programme, the methodology would be simple. A scheme would have to be established. The success of the CLÁR programme is that schemes are devised that are open to various projects once they conform to the terms of the scheme. I cannot pick out individual projects to suit a scheme. A scheme must be devised to address an issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_590">The Deputy claims there are areas in which the normal criteria used by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government do not apply. This is because of the polluter pays principle and the dispersal of dwellings in the area concerned. It must be accepted that the countryside cannot be covered with individual sewerage schemes. If one creates a scheme for the provision of sewerage systems, how does one confine it in such a way that people do not disperse further from villages and townlands to the point of it not being practical?</p>
            <p eId="para_591">The Mayo county manager has conveyed his concerns to me on the Achill Sound matter. I had tentative discussions with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the matter. I stress I cannot move on any project under the CLÁR programme without a scheme being properly devised. One attractive feature of the programme is that schemes must be introduced in a systematic manner and be universally applicable. For example, if I install flashing hazard lights outside one school, they must be installed at all other schools. There are serious challenges in devising a scheme that would not have an open sesame effect on projects because I do not have unlimited funds. The costings suitable for a sewerage scheme in a large town or agglomeration may not provide the basic services for areas with more scattered dwellings.</p>
            <p eId="para_592">A possible model exists in the Shannon Basin district scheme. It was introduced by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Whether it could be applied universally is another day's work.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JerryCowleyIND" eId="spk_233">
            <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
            <p eId="para_593">As no collection facility exists on Achill Sound, can its development be funded up to 50% by the CLÁR programme? Another reason for programme funding is that the scheme has not received priority in the past 17 years for one reason or another. If the scheme had been built in 1991, the polluter pays principle would not now be applicable and the estimated costs would be different. The Minister has claimed that those areas receiving CLÁR funding are deserving of it. I accept Achill Sound is not unique in terms of Belmullet and other areas without sewerage schemes. However, they are unique in the sense they do not have sewerage schemes. I suggest the Minister could ring-fence the funding for these areas and not extend it on a universal basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_594">The Minister promised 50% funding for the further development of the Michael Davitt Bridge on Achill Sound. It is apt this year as it is the centenary of Michael Davitt's death. The project will cost €4.1 million, half of which the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will match. There is a verbal commitment from CLÁR to provide the other costs.</p>

            <p eId="para_596">The swing bridge is in a precarious condition. In hot weather it cannot be opened because the metal expands, meaning six men would be needed to open it. There is also no pedestrian route across the bridge. Will the Minister address this matter?</p>

            <from>Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_597">The Deputy is straying far from water and sewerage schemes. The challenge when creating a new scheme under CLÁR is to keep it within a reasonable budget. This year €23 million has been allocated but consideration must be given for future schemes. The challenge is to have a scheme that is confined enough to be affordable and good enough to make a difference. I do not pick schemes by accepting people's ideas as I go along the corridor. The rules are clear, even and open. The situation at Achill is not unique. Off the top of my head I can list Corr na Móna, Carna, Kilternan and many other well-established villages which have no sewerage schemes. The challenge under the CLÁR programme in creating a scheme for wastewater disposal is to ensure a reasonable amount of money would make a difference and a larger problem would not be created of people moving further into the countryside.</p>
            <p eId="para_598">CLÁR never promised money for the Michael Davitt Bridge. People must always read the small print. At a meeting in Achill Sound, I said if Mayo County Council prioritised funding of €2 million for the bridge under the Gaeltacht strategic roads programme, I would accept it as an eligible project. I normally do not engage in co-funded projects with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. This year I made the rules handier for the counties in that I told the local directors of the department that if I give an annual allocation to a county, they can look at the totality of requirement for small piers, strategic roads, bóithre áise agus athnuachan baile, village renewal, and that they can take the whole ball of wax and decide where the priorities lie.</p>

            <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_602">The working group on rehabilitation was established in September 2005 and includes representatives from a range of Departments and agencies involved in delivering rehabilitation services, as well as representatives from the national drugs strategy team, NDST, the national advisory committee on drugs, NACD, and the community and voluntary sectors. The terms of reference of the group include examining the current provision of rehabilitation services in Ireland and recommending actions to develop an integrated rehabilitation service for the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_603">The development of comprehensive rehabilitation services is a complex process due in no small part to the fact that problem drug use is a chronic, often recurring, condition. As a result, rehabilitation necessarily involves the provision of services that support and encourage drug users at each stage of their drug use, from those whose problem is severe and chaotic to those who may have recovered, have been stabilised or, unfortunately, may have relapsed. At each stage the door must be kept open to enable those dealing with the problem of drug misuse to re-engage with treatment and rehabilitation services.</p>
            <p eId="para_604">Services that may contribute to the rehabilitation of drug misusers of necessity may come from a wide variety of sources and agencies. The health services provide aspects of ongoing treatment, counselling and therapeutic services. Educational and training agencies focus on the provision of educational, training and job search needs and community and voluntary organisations provide services under the local and regional drugs task force programmes which provide a wide range of supports.</p>

            <p eId="para_605">I thank the Minister of State for that reply. However, I remind him of his reply of 16 May to a similar question in which he stated: "It is envisaged that the recommendations will be finalised by mid-year and that the group will report to the interdepartmental group on drugs and the Cabinet committee on social inclusion". Can I take it that this date was a bit optimistic? Given that we have hit mid-year, will the recommendations be with the interdepartmental group and the Cabinet committee on social inclusion before the summer recess?</p>

            <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_606">Certainly, it appears that our projections were a bit optimistic. The group is continuing its work which has proven to be a bigger job than originally expected. I am informed that the recommendations will be finalised in the coming months. Much work has been done. The group has probably gone into the matter in far more detail than was expected and it has had a great deal of consultation with interested parties. The job has proven to be a bigger one than was originally expected and I am not sure whether the recommendations will be through the entire system by the summer.</p>

            <p eId="para_608">It may be the case that too many people are involved. The group is chaired by my Department and it includes representatives from the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and Justice, Equality and Law Reform as well as representatives from the national drugs strategy team, the national advisory committee on drugs, FÁS, the HSE and the community and voluntary sector. Both the Department of Health and Children and the HSE are involved. The job is a big one and while I will not say the group has got into it too deeply, the process has taken longer than expected.</p>

When these arrangements have been completed, it is intended that my Department, in partnership with Kerry County Council, will be responsible for the development of the two piers, one on An Blascaod Mór and the other at Dún Chaoin.

            <p eId="para_612">Islands come under the brief of the Minister but in his reply he did not refer to the current responsibilities of his Department towards the Blasket Islands.

            <p eId="para_613">My Department does not have specific responsibility for the islands because, as Deputy Boyle is aware, they are not inhabited on a permanent basis. I do not know how long it will take to resolve this matter. As the Deputy is aware, this matter has been ongoing since the late Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, God rest his soul, initiated this project, in which he was most interested. Due to the court cases that were taken, it did not come to fruition. Discussions are ongoing and I hope the matter can be resolved.

            <p eId="para_615">The matter has not been in the legal system since the Supreme Court judgment. This is primarily a matter for the OPW and the Deputy should, accordingly, table a question to the Department of Finance. Negotiations took place with the landowners. I wish to state as a general principle, rather than specifically in regard to An Blascaod Mór, that where one is achieving a result by agreement, one cannot allow oneself to be forced into a situation in which one is made to agree to the impossible. In other words, value for money and so on come into play. The issue has been dealt with on a voluntary basis since the Supreme Court case struck down the Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_616">It takes two to tango. To achieve a result, the obligation is equally on the owners to accommodate reasonable requirements of the State as it is on the State to try to accommodate the owners. One cannot have an imbalanced arrangement just because the State is a party to it. One would rightly criticise the State if an open cheque book approach was taken to resolving problems. If that were the case, questions would be asked about the procedures that were followed. I hope the matter can be resolved, but in that type of negotiation it is not acceptable to set a deadline for resolution. Whether these issues can be resolved depends on how reasonable are the requests of the other side.</p>

At that time it was most unusual for a Taoiseach to appear in the Seanad. The publicity that is accruing is not desirable. Recent newspaper reports suggest there is a complete stand-off on this issue. Is there any circumstance in which the State may exercise compulsory purchase powers? These islands are an important element of our culture. The literary tradition alone of the Blascaod Mór is very significant. Is it possible that access to the Blascaod Mór could be denied to both Irish people and tourists in perpetuity or is any fallback available to the State?</p>

Deputy O'Shea should put a parliamentary question to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon.

            <from>Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_620">In 2005, officials of my Department met with Ireland West Tourism with a view to examining ways of promoting the tourism industry of the islands. An inter-agency working group was subsequently established comprising representatives from Ireland West Tourism; Gaelsaoire, the Údarás na Gaeltachta subsidiary which promotes tourism in Gaeltacht areas; Fáilte Ireland; and Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann, the Irish Islands Federation, with the aim of drawing up a comprehensive plan to market all our islands as a niche product.</p>
            <p eId="para_621">Earlier this year, following on from the work of this group, Ireland West Tourism sought and was approved funding of €171,500 over three years from my Department to match a similar amount which had been committed by Fáilte Ireland for the implementation of a tourism plan for the islands. The main aim of the plan is to market the islands effectively to increase the number of tourists visiting them. Its main features are branding of the islands as a niche product; creation of an attractive, comprehensive website; a high quality publicity campaign; and lengthening of the tourism season by targeting specific groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_622">This strategy is in line with one of the main aims of my Department regarding the islands, that is, the maintenance of viable island communities through the provision of viable economic opportunities for them. This funding will form the basis for a sustained tourism marketing drive for the islands over the period concerned and will deliver tangible, worthwhile benefits.</p>

            <p eId="para_623">I very much support this concept. Is it intended as part of this investment plan that efforts will be made to extend this type of niche tourism to some of the other islands as well as developing it where there already is substantial activity?</p>

            <from>Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_624">One must view this as a two-pronged process, involving both the promotion and development of the tourism product. This investment plan is concerned with the marketing component because the product already exists and is quite pervasive. At the annual general meeting of Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann, a seminar took place at which representatives of the different islands, including Hare Island, Rathlin Island, Inis Mór, Inishbofin, Aranmore in Scotland and many more, spoke about island tourism. The plan involves promoting all the existing tourism products available on the islands, including islands as small as Hare Island in Cork, as a single product.</p>
            <p eId="para_625">Running parallel to this will be the development of the product and there are several ways of doing this. One element of this is the CLÁR programme, under which all the islands are covered. Údarás na Gaeltachta has invested heavily in developing the tourism product for the Gaeltacht islands. In addition, we have a new scheme of incentives for the development of businesses, including tourism products, that are launched on the non-Gaeltacht islands. This means money is now available through the county enterprise boards to develop the tourism product on those islands.</p>
            <p eId="para_626">My intention is that this process will be implemented on an annual basis and that we continue to market and develop the product simultaneously. As the product is developed, it must be marketed. Marketing without product is of no use and <i>vice versa</i> — we must develop both together.</p>

            <p eId="para_627">I am grateful for the opportunity to ask a brief supplementary question. In the case of Achill Island, for example, it is difficult for local communities to develop any proper tourism product. Notwithstanding his particular interest in the west, I am not sure whether the Minister is aware of the difficulties in this regard. Some wonderful projects have been lost to Achill Island because of the difficulty encountered by local communities because they cannot, for example, compete with private sector interests to purchase land.</p>
            <p eId="para_628">In most other EU states, local authorities have a far greater input into these types of projects. Under EU rules, a certain portion of funding must be secured from the local community but many communities simply cannot bear that load. In some cases, however, the local authority has come in and resolved the difficulty. Will the Minister examine how local authorities might be encouraged to assist local communities in developing worthwhile tourism projects? Otherwise they will not happen.</p>

            <p eId="para_629">Deputy Cowley is correct in that the problem to which he refers relates to State aids in that the State can provide only a specific percentage of funding. However, because local authority money is exempt from this threshold, it is possible to get around the problem. I encourage local authorities to make this type of investment because it is they who will reap the benefits in the future in terms of rates collected and so on.</p>
            <p eId="para_630">An issue that is currently of major interest to me, and in which we are investing considerable time, effort and money, is the development of the new rural development programme for 2007-13. This will involve a review of the <i>de minimus</i> provision regarding the level of grant aid that can be provided under the Leader programme. Achill does come under the island marketing scheme. Areas such as this are also covered under the rural social scheme in combination, for example, with the capital money I have put aside. I am particularly focused on the development of walkways and ancillary facilities through the Leader companies. We will see the results of many months of work coming to fruition in the near future.</p>

          <p eId="para_636">I move amendment No. 1:<entity refersTo="#bill.2006.9.dail.4_sub.amd_1" name="amendment"/>
                    </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_637">In page 7, line 9, after "generally" to insert ", with special emphasis on female participation".</p>
          <p eId="para_638">Since the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs published its report on women and sport, for which I was rapporteur, very little progress has been made with regard to the participation of women in sport, certainly not to the extent that was envisaged in that report. I acknowledge that the Government responded to the report and provided grant aid in the budgets of 2005 and 2006, which was very helpful. Furthermore, a number of the national sporting organisations have appointed female officers to promote female participation in sport. However, we still have not adopted the Brighton principles, for example, or indeed addressed a number of other issues that were clearly outlined in the committee's report.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">When the report was being prepared, the committee invited the sports editors of a number of the national newspapers to a meeting. At that time, out of every 100 sporting images published, 97 were of males and only three were of females, and that was on a good day. To some extent, that has improved. I have been keeping an eye on the published images of sports people and teams in the newspapers, and the ratio of female to male has improved somewhat, although there is still a long way to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">The amendment aims to ensure that the authority puts special emphasis on the promotion of female sport in the new campus. It is important that female sport is stressed and seen as part of the brief of the authority. Otherwise, women will not get the attention they deserve and which is necessary if we are to develop this area of opportunity. That is the purpose of my amendment. It contains the simple addition of a number of words which would place an onus on the new body to put special emphasis on the promotion of female participation in sport.</p>

          <from>Mr. Wall</from>
          <p eId="para_641">I support the amendment as tabled by Deputy Deenihan, which is a step forward in advancing sport in Ireland. The old adage that a new brush sweeps clean could be applied here. The advantages of having women on such boards is enormous and this has been recognised all over the country. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism" eId="spk_261">
          <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O’Donoghue)</from>
          <p eId="para_642">As Deputy Deenihan will be aware, one of the stated functions of the authority is to encourage and promote the use of the sports campus by people participating in sport at professional and amateur levels and by members of the public generally. In this context, the authority will encourage and promote the use of the campus by a wide variety of groups and this promotion will be targeted at both male and female sports people. I am reluctant to make a specific reference in legislation to any particular group as this could simply result in tokenism.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">The new authority will be primarily concerned with developing and operating the campus of sports facilities at Abbotstown. It is to the Irish Sports Council, in consultation with the national governing bodies, that I would look to redress any imbalance that there may be with regard to participation in sport by any one group of potential users.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">Deputies will be aware that the Government has taken tangible steps to encourage greater participation by women in sport. In the 2005 Estimates, the Government allocated €750,000 to the Irish Sports Council to promote the greater participation of women in sport. This was by way of a pilot endeavour, and in recognition of the effectiveness of the effort, the level of funding was increased in 2006 to €2.25 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">I recognise the importance of attracting more women to participate in sport and have taken specific action to achieve this aim. However, I do not think it can be achieved by means of the amendment before us. I have made the encouragement of greater numbers of female participants in sport the responsibility of the Irish Sports Council. In that context, and at my request, the council made €250,000 available to the FAI to assist with that association's development plan with a view to ensuring that it attracts more women into the game of soccer. The association currently has 12,500 registered female members, although many more women play soccer on an informal basis. However, this pales into insignificance compared to the 450,000 males who play soccer in Ireland today.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">We have the capacity to increase the number of women in sport and this will be achieved by virtue of the fact that since 1998 we have made a major investment in sports facilities across the country under the sports capital programme. Almost €458 million has been spent on providing facilities at 5,630 venues in every city, town, village and parish in Ireland. Gone, or at least going, are the days when women were turned off participating in field sports, for example, because there was no accommodation available in which to change. Gone are the days when women were discouraged from participating in sport because the major sports organisations considered their particular sports to be a male preserve. Gone, or going, are the days when women could expect to finish playing a given game and have no showers available to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">We can encourage a greater level of female participation in sport by continuing in the direction in which the Government has moved. I will direct the Irish Sports Council to have regard to the use of the Abbotstown facilities as part of its remit to improve women's participation levels in sport.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">Apart from the special initiative to which I have referred, various national governing bodies fund programmes, managed by the Irish Sports Council, which cater for both genders. Furthermore, in the selection of members of the authority, I will endeavour to ensure that the various strands of sports administrators are represented. For example, the current board of Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited has in its membership the chief executive of the Irish Sports Council. I consider that the national sports development authority should focus on developing the campus. As part of its <i>modus operandi</i>, I envisage that the authority will put in place a statement of strategy and I see that strategy statement as the more appropriate place for the authority to set out its approach to the various groups it will attempt to attract.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">It appears that only 10% of females in Ireland regularly participate in sport or physical activity. I would be the first to acknowledge that this is woefully inadequate and that is why I have sought to put funding directly into encouraging women to participate in sport. It is my intention to continue with that approach. For these reasons, I do not accept the amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_262">
          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_650">The low levels of female participation in sport are such that there must contain positive discrimination in Government policy towards women for a number of years to ensure greater participation. Women and young girls must be encouraged and facilities provided for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">I disagree with the Minister on one issue. In many instances, females have to share dressing rooms with males and some do not like doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">The Minister mentioned a figure of 10% and if we want to improve on that, there must be positive discrimination with regard to providing facilities for women and encouraging them to participate in sport. There is a medical reason for this amendment. There is concern about the increase in osteoporosis in the female population and it has been proven that weight bearing exercise reduces the risk of and offsets the oncoming of the condition. Obesity is common in both sexes but is in many cases is associated with females. We should encourage girls and women to participate in sport well into adulthood and old age.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">The more we emphasise this in legislation the better. Responsibility will fall on the authority to fulfil this part of its mandate under the legislation. If this is not included, the authority does not have to achieve it. Irrespective of the Irish Sports Council policy, I would not be confident about it unless it is a stated objective which places the onus on the authority.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_263" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
          <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_654">I said the days are going or are gone when women would not be properly accommodated in terms of changing and showering facilities. We have made progress in recent years in some parts of the country and in many places the facilities for women are now in place. It is also true that there are other areas where this is not the case and that is why I use the word "going" in the context of the ongoing spend under the sports capital programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">This year, I directed officials, when scoring applications, to give priority to facilities that would facilitate women. A sum of €54 million was allocated and priority was given, where possible, to facilities which would provide for women. That policy is worth pursuing until we have facilities of an equivalent nature for both men and women.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">Initiatives to target the greater involvement of women are already in place and I plan to enhance them. The Irish Sports Council has responsibility for the promotion of sport but only in the context of Government policy. I assure Deputy Deenihan that I will continue with the policy of providing more funding so that women will have facilities, will not be discouraged from participating in sport, will be accommodated and will enjoy inclusiveness. Every measure we can possibly take to ensure a greater level of participation by women in sport in the future will be undertaken.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_658">In page 9, to delete lines 16 to 19 and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_659">"(3) Of the members of the Council, no fewer than 6 of their number shall be men and no fewer than 6 of their number shall be women.".</p>
          <p eId="para_660">It is important that gender balance on State boards is enshrined in legislation. When I was a Minister of State, I was responsible for Bord na gCon and there were three women on it when I left office in 1997. The Government then had a clear policy that there should be a balance of at least 60:40. That policy has not been maintained because no women sit on Bord na gCon now. At any track, half of the customers will be female. From now on while I am on this side of the House, I will table an amendment to any Bill that involves the creation of a body such as this authority to guarantee equality in gender representation.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">Section 11(7) on membership of the Arts Council in the Arts Act 2003 contains a provision whereby no fewer than six of the council shall be women and no fewer than six shall be men. That is the wording I want to include in this Bill. If it is good enough for the Arts Act 2003, why is it not good enough for the National Sports Campus Development Authority Bill 2006? It will be difficult to explain that.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">The Minister gave a commitment, and I do not dispute his bone fides, that females will be looked after by the new authority. If the Minister is committed to female participation and is prepared to give those guarantees, why not accept this amendment? It is obvious that if there is not gender balance on a board, the female viewpoint will not come across. This facility is vital to the future development of athletics and will have a huge community element, so the Minister should accept the amendment to ensure gender balance.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JackWall" eId="spk_265">
          <from>Mr. Wall</from>
          <p eId="para_663">I support the amendment. The involvement of women in sports development, irrespective of discipline, has made a huge difference. In many associations, we saw that important positions were male-dominated but that women have now made a very significant difference. We should consider the GAA and what has happened regarding various county boards and clubs. We saw the effect of the acceptance of women into high positions. It has generated impetus in the GAA. Women's football is now probably Ireland's fastest-growing sport because the male bastion of the clubs has been broken open. There has been great involvement by female participants and in the higher echelons of the associations, even up to the level of county chairpersons and secretaries. That has made a significant difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">This is an ideal opportunity to show that we are willing to move forward and accept that women should be involved in the higher echelons of various associations to develop sport. If we do not take this chance, we will lose out on making a statement to the fairer sex that we want to see them involved. This is an ideal opportunity, and I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_266" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
          <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_665">Section 9(3) provides that the Minister shall, in so far as practicable and having regard to the relevant experience of the persons concerned, ensure an equitable balance between men and women in the composition of the authority. I have reflected on the issues raised by Deputy Deenihan. While I agree with the proposal's thrust, I will not accept the amendment. At present, it is Government policy that State boards should have a target of 40% female membership. It is certainly my intention to meet that target and I recognise the contribution that gender balance can bring to the board's operations. However, sometimes difficulties have been encountered in meeting even the present 40% target. The present wording of section 9(3) refers to an equitable balance, which leaves some flexibility to allow for a practical solution rather than binding the Minister, who may find that he or she has an insufficient pool of candidates of either gender.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">Deputy Deenihan refers to the legislation dealing with the Arts Council. Other legislation adopts the approach specified in this Bill, for example, the Industrial Development (Enterprise Ireland) Act 1998, the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act 2001, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act 1998, and the National Tourism Development Authority Act 2003. Many boards come under my Department's remit, and one of those, as Deputy Deenihan points out, is Bord na gCon. There was a woman on Bord na gCon, but unfortunately she resigned. However, I intend to ensure a more equitable gender balance on Bord na gCon in the not too distant future.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">Regarding other boards under my remit, such as those of Fáilte Ireland, the Arts Council, Culture Ireland, the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the National Gallery, the National Museum, the National Archives Advisory Council, the Crawford Gallery and Horse Racing Ireland, I wish to make very clear that there is a substantial number of women on each. I have nominated women to chair two of the most significant boards under my Department's remit, Fáilte Ireland, where Ms Gillian Bowler has been very successful, and the Arts Council, where Ms Olive Braiden has been similarly effective.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">It is not a case of my ignoring the cause of women. I would be the last to do so. It is simply a case of my introducing legislation that is pragmatic regarding membership of the board that we will be obliged to appoint. I give a categoric assurance to Deputies Deenihan and Wall that every effort will be made to reach the target of 40% female membership. While I cannot guarantee success, I will seek to do that, drawing on the pool of suitable candidates.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_267">
          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_669">Why include such a stipulation in the Arts Act 2003 and not in this Bill? I am sure the Minister had no problem ensuring gender balance on the Arts Council, to which he appointed six women. Saying that it might at times be difficult to find six suitable women is tantamount to saying that they do not exist, but they certainly do, and they are willing to participate and accept responsibility if allowed. I do not wish to be negative, but it is that mind set that affects women's participation.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">Looking at the administrative structure of sport across the country, one sees very few women given leading roles such as chairperson. Mostly they are the secretary but not the chairperson. The ratio of male to female coaches in this country is 3:1 at best. Unless women are visible on the boards, in this instance regarding sport, one will not achieve the requisite dynamic or emphasis.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">Women must be there fighting their own corner. Sport has for years been a very male-dominated world. In some areas, that is still the case, despite the great progress that women's football has made and the fact that some of our greatest athletes of recent times, including Sonia O'Sullivan, her namesake Gillian, and Derval O'Rourke, are women.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">I ask the Minister to accept this reasonable amendment, which is already enshrined in legislation and is the way forward. He mentioned several other organisations with which I am not familiar, but I argued this point when we discussed the National Tourism Development Authority Act 2003, putting to the vote a similar amendment to ensure equity. I am being consistent with this amendment.</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_673">It is true that Deputy Deenihan brought forward this proposal during the debate on the Bill that established Fáilte Ireland. The result was that we adhered to the legislation as presented. I subsequently appointed several very capable women to the board. The chairperson, Ms Gillian Bowler, to whom I referred, was among them and has been extremely successful in developing Fáilte Ireland for the betterment of the tourism industry. I stress once again that it is not a question of there being any discrimination against women on the board but rather of my being pragmatic regarding the legislation that I bring before the House. On the vast majority of the boards under my remit there are many talented women and I intend to examine very carefully the composition of the board established by this Bill with a view to ensuring gender balance as far as is practicable.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_269">
          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_674">Before I press this matter to a vote, I express my disappointment that the Minister did not accept this very reasonable proposal. He acknowledged there is a precedent for it. At the risk of being repetitive, it is very important that women's participation in sport be emphasised continually. All surveys have shown that there is a great drop-off in female participation at post-primary school and then again at school-leaving age compared with young men. That is not unique to Ireland, since it is also the case in other countries. Women must be at the centre of decision making in sport if the playing pitch is to be levelled in this country. They must be senior administrators and have a voice on all sports related boards. This debate presents the Minister with a marvellous opportunity to state that, from now on, women will be given equal recognition. This should be not be merely a ministerial promise but should be enshrined in legislation with which future office holders must comply.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">The Minister insinuated that it might be difficult to ensure this gender balance on this and other boards. However, out of the hundreds of women throughout the country, six very competent individuals could be chosen who would be excellent members of this proposed board. The Minister has probably made up his mind but I appeal to him for all the reasons I have outlined and the message that this would convey to the female sporting fraternity of this country to reconsider his decision and accept this amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">Without labouring the point, I must point out that one in four Irish women suffers from osteoporosis. In addition, we are faced with an epidemic of obesity and the incidence of cardiovascular diseases related to our low level of physical activity, especially among women. I appeal to the Minister to make the statement today and convey a message to women involved in sport in this country that he is prepared to give them guarantees going forward. I acknowledge the work he has done through the sports capital programme, particularly the allocation made to Tralee Rugby Club last year to allow it to provide changing rooms for women. This was a welcome departure because facilities must be shared in most clubs throughout the country. There is no doubt that a start has been made but we will not get this opportunity again during this Dáil and the Minister's tenure. This is probably the last Bill we will discuss in this House. This is why the Minister should make the statement and I am giving him the opportunity to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">I have been fairly magnanimous in the area of women in sport and have supported any initiatives by the Government or Government agencies. I did not launch the report of the Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs into women in sport in this House in 2004. Instead, I launched it at the women in sport conference held in Croke Park in October 2004. I also held a sports conference and passed on a number of ideas arising from that. I proposed and put a considerable amount of work into the committee's report and received support from Deputy Wall and others. It is regarded as a very progressive document and was probably the catalyst that ensured that funding was provided specifically for females in sport. Probably not too many people are interested in the issue of women in sport but the Minister has a great opportunity to make a statement in the House and say that he will ensure that women have equal representation on all sport related boards. I hope the Minister will not spurn the opportunity I am offering him.</p>

          <p eId="para_678">I understand Deputy Deenihan's arguments but I have already made a very clear statement about women in sport by providing the most substantial funding in the history of the State to attract women into sport. I have met many women's organisations with a view to advancing this cause and will continue to do so. For pragmatic purposes, the decision is in accord with the majority of legislation in the State. We will endeavour to reach the Government's stated aim of having at least 40% female participation on boards. The statement in respect of women in sport must be tangible. It must be clear to women involved in sport that the facilities and funding are available and we have illustrated this in the clearest fashion.</p>

          <p eId="para_803">Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 arise from pure frustration. I am sure many Opposition Members, as well as Government backbenchers, have experience of tabling questions to Ministers only to receive the reply that they have no responsibility to the House on the matters in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">On Committee Stage the Minister gave a commitment to consider a mechanism to allow the relevant spokespersons, or any Member of the House, to put a question to the authority which would have to be answered within a specified period of time. This would go some way to resolving the problems which Opposition spokespersons have. There is nothing as frustrating as receiving a one-line reply to the effect that the Minister has no responsibility to the House for the matter in question, which we have seen over the years. It is not good enough that such a mechanism is used by many Ministers. In recent weeks the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government said he would not organise any more committees on the matter. The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, said that, despite the fact that a number of State agencies and boards are under his aegis, he always ensures an answer is given to a particular question, even if he did not have responsibility to the House for the issue involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">A mechanism such as the one proposed must be put in place. The Minister said it would mean the chief executive officer of the Abbotstown board would have responsibility to the House as well as to the Minister, and that his position would not be tenable in such circumstances, which I accept. Amendment No. 4 proposes a mechanism whereby ordinary Members of the House and Government backbenchers could receive replies to questions on the Abbotstown development.</p>

          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_808">I support amendment No. 4, tabled by Deputy Wall. There is a deficit in politics in ministerial responsibility and that of various Government agencies to this House. It is probably one of the most frustrating aspects of politics to table a question on tourism, the arts or, perhaps in the future, the campus only for the Minister to say it is not his responsibility. It represents a democratic deficit in the system and is an increasing occurrence. At one time one could table a question on health and receive some response, but now it is a matter for the Health Service Executive. All the issues that used to be raised in the House on the subject of health can no longer be raised. The same applies in the Minister's area of responsibility. It is very frustrating when Members put forward 20 or 30 questions and half of the replies state that the issue is not the responsibility of the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">Deputy Wall is trying to ensure that the authority is at least answerable to the House. We all receive one-line responses from State agencies and nothing further. In some cases one is lucky to receive a one-line response. One might wait months for a reply but no in-depth response is forthcoming. Surely if democracy is to work, Deputies must have confidence in the process, especially when in Opposition. Surely we are entitled to a detailed response to queries on current matters in a specific State agency. Even a private company sometimes provides a detailed response but not a State agency, which is supposed to be answerable to this House, the supposed watchdog for such bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">This is a reasonable amendment. Even though the Minister refused to accept previous amendments in my name, which I thought made very practical proposals, especially given that only today he made a major announcement on the future promotion of ladies soccer, he should accept Deputy Wall's amendment because it will make this authority in some way accountable to the House. At the very least it will enable us to obtain information from the authority on issues relating to its work and its activities in the years ahead.</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_816">As I outlined on Committee Stage the impact of the proposed amendment would be to make the authority directly accountable to the Oireachtas in addition to being accountable to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, who in turn is accountable to the Oireachtas. The further requirement that the authority give a substantive reply to any written questions submitted by Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas within seven days would impose an untold administrative burden on a very small organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">I indicated on Committee Stage that the best way to deal with this issue would be through the customer charter of the authority rather than specifying such matters in legislation. I see this as an organisational matter and I will recommend to the authority that it include a commitment in its customer charter to respond to all requests for information in the speediest manner possible but, in any event, not later than 15 working days, providing the information requested is available to the authority within the time specified.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">I sympathise with the points made by Deputies Wall and Deenihan. In my own experience in Opposition I found statutory bodies could sometimes be quite slow in replying to Deputies' requests for information, which is not in the interests of the workings of democracy and is something about which I have the gravest reservations. In those circumstances I wish to clarify as we pass this legislation through the House that I expect the new authority to reply quickly to queries raised by Members of the House. That will have to be included in the charter and is something to which other legislation brought before this House to set up statutory bodies might well refer, at least in the course of the debate. I would be deeply disappointed if agencies under the remit of my Department did not comply with best practice. If it is the case that there are any statutory bodies under the remit of my Department which are not replying speedily, I would be grateful if Deputies could bring these matters to my attention and I will certainly take them up with the agencies concerned. In this instance, the fact there will be a customers' charter specifying that people should be responded to within a reasonable period — 15 working days if at all possible — will help considerably. In those circumstances, I ask Deputy Wall to withdraw his amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">Incidentally, if it is the case that we again find this body is not replying speedily and that there is procrastination, the House will return to the matter in the context of a future Bill. I understand the frustrations people feel about some statutory bodies. I always believed that such bodies within my Department's remit replied speedily and I have no evidence to the contrary. If Deputy Wall withdraws the amendment, the most appropriate way to deal with the issue would be under the charter. If that fails, the matter can be revisited on another day.</p>

          <from>Mr. Healy</from>
          <p eId="para_822">In yesterday's debate, I went through some of the key features of the Bill. There will be major changes to the way in which the board handles infrastructural consents, including the possibility of pre-application discussions with the applicant and more flexibility in the decisions the board can make on these applications. This provision is inappropriate to the board as it gives an inside track to developers and creates a serious disadvantage for individuals and communities concerned about such major infrastructural developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">The Bill also gives power to the board to amend decisions on major infrastructural projects, subject to requiring any major additional environmental impacts to be assessed. It also empowers the board to require infrastructure providers to provide direct benefits to local communities affected by major infrastructural projects. I will come back to that point later. It also requires the board to have regard to the national interest and any effect a decision may have on issues of strategic economic or social importance to the State as well as to the national spatial strategy, and any regional planing guidelines in force for the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">Section 35 of the Planning Act is to be amended to make it easier for authorities to reach a decision to refuse a consent without recourse to the High Court. Instead, it will be a matter for the applicant who is refused permission, to seek confirmation of the High Court that the planning authority must reconsider its initial decision. I welcome that provision. While local authorities are allowed to take into account the history of developers concerning previous contacts, dealings and planning applications, they were required to go to the High Court to refuse a consent. This is a good provision in so far as it puts the onus on the applicant to go to the High Court to seek a ruling that the planning authority must reconsider its initial decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">The Bill is flawed overall, however, and I have serious concerns and reservations about it. Far from expediting the planning process, the Bill is an attack on democracy and will undermine local authorities, while sidelining small people who need to have their planning concerns addressed. The Bill looks after big developers but sidelines individuals and communities who require the support of the planning process. The thrust of the Bill reduces the involvement of local authorities and members of the public who are concerned with planning matters. Effectively, the Bill gives big wheels access to power and privilege, while undermining community and individual rights in this respect. It is difficult for an individual or a small community to take on big private developers, local authorities or State agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">The Bill should be dealing with a series of areas in the planning process but fails to do so. They include the implementation of the Kenny report which was published in the early 1970s. I was a young clerical officer in South Tipperary County Council at the time and I know there was a big welcome for that report by local authorities, public representatives and the general public. The report recommended methods for dealing with rezoning and developers' windfall profits. Had it been implemented, the report would have avoided the debacle of the various tribunals that have arisen as a result of rezoning controversies, particularly in the Dublin area, thus rendering them unnecessary. At no stage was it suggested that the Kenny report was unconstitutional. Indeed, it was always, and still is, believed that the report's recommendations were constitutional. Even at this late stage, the report's key elements should be included in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">The Minister and the Government should take this opportunity to deal with estate management companies, which are now being included by every local authority in planning permissions. It is a rip-off for individuals who have purchased houses in private estates. Even this morning, the Taoiseach agreed this provision was not meant to apply to private housing estates. It may have been meant for apartment complexes which needed specific management owing to the number of apartments. The opportunity provided by the Bill should be used to deal with the question of management companies. There is no doubt that significant costs are being met by individuals who buy houses in private estates but who never understood they would be lumbered with these charges which can range from €500 to €2,000 per annum. The charges are included in the initial contract of purchase of houses and young couples purchasing houses in difficult circumstances and under financial pressure are not aware, in the majority of cases if not all, that these charges arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should immediately instruct county managers to desist from putting this condition regarding the management of estates into planning permissions. He should then take advantage of the opportunity provided by the Bill to change the law in this regard and stop management companies effectively ripping off young house buyers.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">The enforcement procedures in place in local authorities are inadequate. I am dealing with a case where a complaint made in February 2005 has not yet been finalised and has not even reached the courts. There should be a streamlining of the enforcement procedures, possibly through a separate enforcement section in local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">I would like to refer to many other issues but, owing to time constraints, will not have the opportunity to do so. I will hand over to Deputy Sargent.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_282">
          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_831">For many, the Bill marks a sad day. It is an admission by Government that it has not managed to bring the people with it in regard to projects and infrastructure that it believes strongly need to be developed. It is, therefore, taking away the consultation and planning element that would otherwise have ensured maximum participation. That is not just to be regretted but is also a recipe for crude decision making in the future. It will lead to decisions that will have to be revisited in time.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">The issues of transport, energy, airports, harbours, landfills, incinerators, waste and water projects are all covered by the Bill. The legacy of the Government has been to favour developments which are very energy intensive and ultimately unsustainable. For example, transport spending has an unbalanced ratio of 4:1 in favour of the roads programme. We need roads but we also need a balance, in particular given the high cost of energy, so rail, which is needed, will become an energy efficient means of transport. We are not getting the rail infrastructure we need, such as the western rail corridor or the railway to Navan with links to Kingscourt, as Deputy Crawford noted. The re-opening of the railways would not cost as much as building new roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">Much of the infrastructure that has been developed would indicate that the Bill is a recipe for driving a coach and four through the sustainability that should be at the heart of Government decision making. In my constituency, a new runway at Dublin Airport will compound the imbalance between development in the east and the west while Shannon and Cork are crying out for increased business. The runway at Dublin Airport will compound the Minister's problems, as well as problems in my constituency in terms of congestion. The Bill will not answer the needs of the country given the track record of the Government to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">The Government favours a big is beautiful approach. It favours a large landfill instead of many smaller segregation, recycling and recovery operations. It favours a large incinerator rather than waste reduction technologies, composting and smaller-scale operations that would make better use of energy.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">There is a policy issue in this regard, which is opposed by my party, but there is also a legal issue in the context of the Aarhus Convention, based on Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration of 1992, which states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_836">Environmental issues are best handled with the participation of all concerned citizens, at the relevant level. At the national level, each individual shall have appropriate access to information concerning the environment that is held by public authorities, including information on hazardous materials and activities in their communities, and the opportunities to participate in decision-making processes. States shall facilitate and encourage public awareness and participation by making information widely available. Effective access to judicial and administrative proceedings, including redress and remedy, shall be provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">That convention was enacted in 2005 by an amendment of EU Directive 2003/35/EC, which regulates how we assess the environmental impact of proposed developments. Article 10<i>a</i> of that directive states that, first, “members of the public [shall] have access to a review procedure before a court” or other impartial body, second, environmental bodies shall be deemed to have an interest in this decision-making process and, third, the “procedure shall be fair, equitable, timely and not prohibitively expensive”.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">On the last point, a judicial review is seen as being available if one is dissatisfied with a development. However, the cost of going through a judicial review would mean it is against the Aarhus Convention. I ask that the Government would rethink the Bill and consider the position in other countries, for example, Sweden, where there was a national plan to get away from reliance on oil. The Bill is moving in the opposite direction. It suggests that we want to proceed with the motorway programme and incinerators, and it does not rule out nuclear power, although the Government has stated that is not on the agenda. However, a thermal plant as proposed in the Bill could easily fit under that description.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">The "big is beautiful" approach is not the energy efficient approach. Whatever one's political viewpoint, there is a geological reality which must be dealt with, either willingly or eventually by recognising that the writing is on the wall. The big is beautiful approach includes Thornton prison, for example. A sum of €30 million of public money has been spent just to buy the agricultural land. This is not a good use of public money; it is not good for the people who are supposed to be rehabilitated and it is not good for the local community. The Bill is an attempt to drive a coach and four through the best interests of local communities, a move that must be opposed.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DennisODonovan" eId="spk_283">
          <from>Mr. O’Donovan</from>
          <p eId="para_840">I welcome the Bill. It is important to bear in mind its principal objectives and the reason it was introduced. Approximately two years ago the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, which I have the privilege of chairing, published an extensive report on planning, private property, compulsory purchase and infrastructural development generally. It assessed how our current legislative and administrative arrangements ensured balance between the private and public good, as laid down in the Constitution. It made recommendations for constitutional and legislative changes where considered necessary or desirable.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">The committee comprises 14 members and is the biggest committee in the House. It was enlarged following a request from the Taoiseach to incorporate representatives of the smaller groups, including the Green Party, Independent Members and Sinn Féin. We unanimously agreed to this approach. It was felt the current regime did not favour progress and development in Ireland. However, we excluded the building of nuclear plants and incinerators.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">The report was the result of the gathering of a great deal of information and analysis provided by key development bodies such as the National Roads Authority, the Railway Procurement Agency, the Dublin Transportation Office and Forfás, as well as professional bodies, including the Institution of Engineers, the Irish Planning Institute, the Society of Chartered Surveyors and the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland, among others. We gathered the information and analysed it.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">Deputy Healy mentioned the Kenny report and said no action had been taken on it. After approximately 16 months of deliberation, the committee came to the conclusion that the Kenny approach was not too bad.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">The report recommended that land be acquired for schools, roads, water schemes and so forth at market value, that is, agricultural value plus25%. I am of the view that it should be double the market value, given that it is based on agricultural values. I am aware of several instances where major infrastructural developments were delayed.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">In addition to this information and direction, the committee received the best available advice on the Constitution, as well as having the benefit of both written and oral submissions from the law reform committee of the Law Society. Naturally, I urge Deputies to read the ninth progress report of the committee. I am glad it is no longer gathering dust because some of our recommendations have been taken on board in the Bill. As I do not wish to be accused of over-burdening colleagues, I draw their attention to chapter 3 of the report, a relatively short chapter which deals with the planning system.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">It was clear to the committee that the existing planning system, whether for major or rural development, was not serving the common good and the public. Recently I discovered an alarming situation. I fight hard for the electoral area I have represented for almost 20 years, Bantry and Schull. It now holds the record for the highest number of objections to one-off rural housing. The objections are made by An Taisce. In fact, somebody at managerial level in the council told me recently that it accounted for almost 50% of all the objections to rural housing which go to An Bord Pleanála. Approximately 95% of the objections made by An Taisce are upheld by An Bord Pleanála.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">For many years people from the Sheep's Head Peninsula, the Mizen Peninsula and the Beara Peninsula were forced to emigrate. This continued through the years of my youth. Now, people can get jobs and want to stay. They should be allowed to build houses, play in the local football team, get involved in the community and rear their families. I was recently in a place called Ahakista where six planning permission applications were granted for local people by the county manager. These applications were from young couples, some of whom had young families and others who intended to start families. According to the last census figures, there was a 16% decrease in the population of the area. The number of pupils at the local national school in Ahakista is down to 13. On the one hand, the CLÁR programme tries to retain and maintain rural communities, while, on the other, An Bord Pleanála rejects the applications of persons who wish to live in their communities. However, there are many holiday homes in Ahakista; the ratio is 2:1 against the homes of local people. Council policy in this area must be examined and addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">A section of that chapter in the report deals with the provision of infrastructure and covers major infrastructural work being undertaken for the provision of roads, rail services, waste management schemes, broadband and so forth. Also covered is an analysis of current planning procedures and the need for co-ordination and consultation between Departments and agencies involved in infrastructure delivery. The vexed subject of infrastructure delays is also examined. These delays happen and I can offer an example.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">In 1985 the planning process commenced for a new regional water scheme for the Bantry area, covering a population of up to 17,000, which has probably increased. There were public hearings and full inquiries. In 1989 a plan was submitted to dam Drumbrow Lake but an environmental group found a rare underwater lily which has since vanished and the project had to go back to the drawing board. In 2006, 21 years later, that regional water scheme is still delayed. That is not right.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">There is an important hospital in Bantry which serves the community of west Cork. A factory owned by Rowa Pharmaceuticals Limited employs approximately 140 people. It is a huge bonus to west Cork. Due to the dangers of e.coli contamination of the water, two years ago the company was obliged to spend €150,000 to provide a purification system to ensure the water quality was right. The area has suffered. I believe 50% of people in the general area, myself included, are buying water if they do not have bored wells. It has taken 21 years to plan this project. There have been objections and various problems during the years. The current plan is funded under the 2003-06 infrastructural development measure of the national development plan. The initial stage will cost €16 million and I expect the overall project to cost double that amount when it is extended to places such as Durris, Glengariff, Kealkill, Kilcrohane and the surrounding area. It is a disgrace and an indictment of our planning system that 21 years after the process was started, we still do not have a regional water scheme. That is the reason I welcome the Bill. I am sure Bantry is not unique. There is plenty of water in the sea but it is not potable.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">There is an endeavour to build a new community college in Skibberreen. Three schools are due to amalgamate and the new school will provide capacity for more than 1,100 children. For the past 15 months the Office of Public Works has tried hard to find a site in or around Skibberreen and has now looked at its 13th site. There should be a mechanism, whereby the local council or the OPW, in the case of important community facilities such as schools, hospitals, crèches and so forth, can compulsorily acquire land to provide them.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">There is a similar problem for a national school in Kinsale called Summercove. It has been established for almost ten years and needs a new school building. When one mentions the price of land in Kinsale and the surrounding area, various figures come to mind. It could be millions. If we do not control the situation, ordinary people in our society will suffer because they will not be provided with facilities. If this problem is acute in west Cork, Skibbereen, Bantry, Kinsale surely it is much more acute in Kildare and areas outside Dublin which are expanding.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">Members of the committee were impressed by the level of progress achieved in the provision of major infrastructural projects in the past decade and by the investment in infrastructure under the national development plan. We also recognise that in several respects we are lagging behind European norms. We identified a number of infrastructural deficits that should be addressed. I am happy to note that many of the key recommendations of the committee are effectively addressed in the Bill. My good friend, Deputy James Breen, from the Independent Group has challenged the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Taoiseach on why that report was not being implemented. I am sure he will recognise we are making progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">A key recommendation of the committee was that major strategic infrastructural projects in transport, sewerage, or in water supply such as the project in Bantry, should be regulated by statute and there should be a one-stop shop approach to planning procedure for them. The Bill achieves that objective and for that reason I support it wholeheartedly.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">In examining delays in delivery of infrastructure and in seeking to improve matters it is important to state that not all infrastructural projects have been delayed. It is a pity the acknowledged delays in some high profile projects have obscured the fact that a large number of projects have been delivered efficiently and on time. The Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, will recognise that the Ballincollig bypass was delivered under the original projected cost and nine months ahead of time. Such details are sometimes missed when we hear of delays in other projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">The committee notes in particular the urgent necessity for improved compulsory purchase procedures. It recommended that the legislation on compulsory purchase should be updated and standardised in a way that would make identifying property to be acquired much simpler and less subject to delay than in the past and would achieve better outcomes in assessing compensation. In this regard the council provided almost €1 million last year to kick start a relief road in Bantry. The need for such a relief road has been apparent for almost 20 years. There are problems with the acquisition of land for same. The Bill will go some way towards addressing such problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">Deputies will agree it is necessary going forward with infrastructural projects to dispense with the traditional cumbersome referencing system that caused so many headaches and delays for the Railway Procurement Agency during the early purchase stages of the Luas project. For that reason the committee recommended a change in the procedure for identifying compensatable interests in lands to be acquired in order that owners rather than the acquiring authority should be obliged to identify their interest to the acquiring authority. In other words, the land owner should be obliged to identify his property rather than Luas or the local authority wasting weeks, months and sometimes years in trying to identify who owns the property. This could be achieved simply by posting a notice on the property and in the local media for a specified period stating that a project is being carried out and inviting the land owner to come forward and identify himself with a view to dealing with the compensation issue. It should be emphasised that the owner is entitled to compensation on the basis of the market value of his or her property. The owner should not be at a loss. What we are seeking is a regime that is fair to the individual and the community and which is as clear, simple and speedy as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">Much of the committee's findings and recommendations are reflected in the Bill. It is recognised that less than 5% of our energy needs are provided in Ireland. Nobody cuts turf anymore. We have some hydro electricity but it is frightening that more than 90% of our energy, gas, oil or coal, is imported. This cannot continue. We all agree that the price of oil is spiralling. Experts say that in 40 years' time there will be a huge problem with diminishing oil and gas reserves while the US and other superpowers such as China, which is expanding at an alarming rate and recently completed the largest hydro dam, are still dependent on huge coal excavations. However, that cannot continue into the future. If Ireland which is minuscule is to comply with the Kyoto agreement and others, the notion of burning coal in cities will be a major problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">What concerns me is the not-in-my-backyard attitude that appears to have developed in Ireland. As a councillor in the western committee of Cork County Council I advocated, almost 15 years ago, the need for wind and wave energy in Ireland and all kinds of biofuels from whatever source. I am glad that in my area a project supported by the west Cork community partnership and backed by the Department is carrying out tests on growing elephant grass which can be used to produce alternative energy. I am concerned that everywhere there is a proposal to build a wind farm it will be proposed by public private partnerships but there must be an input into the building wind farms by the business community and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">The Electricity Supply Act was passed in 1927. In the pocket of the Sheep Head's peninsula where I grew up we got a telephone in 1967 because my mother had a bed and breakfast and we got electricity in 1976. This was probably one of the last regions to be connected, bar the Black Valley in Kerry. In this day and age even with a population explosion we are still objecting to wind farms. One incident in my area that caused uproar is still continuing and went to the courts and there was blame on all sides. The council and the ESB, as the developer, should have found a route through farms, across approximately 16 km of countryside, that, as far as possible, did not impact on people's farmyards, houses and so on. A route was suggested but the local authority backed off because it went through an old cillíneach, where nobody had been buried for more than 100 years, and was a special area of conservation. Yet it had no difficulty in building either pylons or planting huge poles or a 38 KV line, within 50 m of a person's house or yard. I am assured from a health perspective of the seriousness of these concerns which create much local unease. Those in the cillíneach, the little graveyard, would not create any problem while the birds and the bees in the special area of conservation should be looked on less favourably, with all due respect, than people and children. There was much local concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">There is a need for more wind farms in Ireland. Whoever is in Government in 20 years' time will have to guarantee to the next generation that in 15 or 20 years' time at least 60% of our energy will come from our island. Given that we are surrounded by water and wind I fail to see why we do not make greater demands in this area and get a greater input from the public. There is a good deal of money around. Rather than invest in foreign shores more should be done to develop wind farms and to explore the area of wave energy. Wave energy has hardly been touched. The French have pioneered a system whereby the <i>modus operandi</i> for wave energy would be submerged 5 m or 6 m under the water and there would be revolving troughs where waves go in and out and keep rotating and create electricity. Ireland is an island with a huge coastline and many season harbours and we should create more energy without interfering with fishermen or their rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">Deputy Sargent mentioned the notion of nuclear power. The people rejected that long ago, but we should note that Argentina is commissioning its sixth nuclear plant in the past decade. That is how it regards nuclear power, of which France is also in favour. Our neighbours in Great Britain will pursue a similar path.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">It should be noted that, in the 25 to 30 years since the involvement of Judge Kenny, there has been a notion that such a Bill, if introduced, would be struck down as unconstitutional. We achieved at least one thing in the 15 or 16 months of deliberation of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, of which I was Chairman, namely, bringing this report to fruition. All-party agreement was involved and members of all parties were deeply involved in the process. We concluded that, weighing up the exigencies of social justice and the common good, such legislation as we have before us is likely to be upheld by the High Court and the Supreme Court. We should have had this Bill a number of years ago, but it is now coming through and I hope its principle will find all-party support. The Opposition parties may want to tease out different issues, but the principle of the Bill is good and timely and, going by our research, will stand any constitutional test in the courts. I am quietly confident of that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DavidStanton" eId="spk_284">
          <from>Mr. Stanton</from>
          <p eId="para_864">I congratulate Deputy O'Donovan on his fine speech, except for where he seemed to soften on the nuclear energy issue. That could be explored another day and it would be interesting to hear what the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will say later.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">I am glad to speak on this important legislation. I will quote from the Constitution two Articles which we should all remind ourselves of on a regular basis, especially Ministers, who from time to time seem to lose touch with what is going on. Article 6 of the Constitution states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_866">All powers of government, legislative, executive and judicial, derive, under God, from the people, whose right it is to designate the rulers of the State and, in final appeal, to decide all questions of national policy, according to the requirements of the common good.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">Deputy O'Donovan mentioned the common good initially. Meanwhile, Article 16 of the Constitution states that "Dáil Éireann shall be composed of members who represent constituencies determined by law." As Members of this House, we are here to represent the people and must not forget that. We do not represent big business or anyone else other than the people. We are sent by the people to represent them in this House. If we forget that, we are on a loser.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">I will note an example of planning. In 1997, when I was standing for election, a major controversy arose in Cork, of which the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, is well aware. The ESB wanted to build a series of pylons around Cork harbour to bring power from the Aghada station to the other side. The ESB obtained planning permission from the local authority and the permission was upheld by An Bord Pleanála. Council members then rejected the project and the issue went to the courts, which decided the council members acted <i> ultra vires,</i> outside their powers, and overturned the decision. There was a danger that the council members could have been personally liable for the costs involved. The courts granted permission and the project was set to go. However, the people in the area were not happy, and parallel to the legal application, a major campaign opposing the project was ongoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">Initially, the ESB did not engage, but the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment at the time, the then Deputy and now Senator O'Rourke, intervened and convinced both sides to accept a mediator, which they did. To give all sides their due, they thrashed out the issues together. The pylons have not been constructed and will not be, but a compromise was reached. It took ten years for common sense to prevail.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">The point is that we must not lose sight of the fact that we represent the people. I would like to see in this Bill a provision for an early attempt at mediation where there is a dispute. I know the Minister of State can imagine the agony, heartache, worry, time, energy and expense ordinary people had to go to in order to take on the ESB at that stage, a semi-State company with almost infinite resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">This Bill is in part meant to speed up the planning process. The example I have given shows the process could have been speeded up in a sensible way if common sense had prevailed initially regarding those pylons. Speaking to some groups in my constituency recently, I noted that when a project is proposed and people find out about it, it takes time for them to inform themselves about it and its details, and to begin to learn and become educated about what is proposed. Often, the learning takes place during the campaign process. If one speeds it up too fast, that learning process can get lost.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">What is crucially important regarding this issue is that public confidence must be maintained at a high level. If it is lost, we are all sunk because people will not agree to major projects being pushed through unless they have confidence in the process and in the projects being put forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">There is another proposal close to the heart of the Minister of State, namely, the construction of two commercial incinerators in Ringaskiddy. I received a letter from the chairperson of an action group in Cork which opposes the construction of such incinerators. The letter gives an idea what the people think about planning, what they are going through and have gone through, and the fears they have regarding this legislation. With respect, it is up to us to address and allay those fears. That is our job. We are elected to this House by the people. If we do not do that, we all fail.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">The chairperson of the group said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_875">I am writing to you as chairperson of Cork Harbour Alliance for a Safe Environment, CHASE, a community group that represents over 30,000 people in the greater harbour area of Cork, who are opposed to the construction of two commercial incinerators in Ringaskiddy.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_876">In addressing the incinerator proposal at Ringaskiddy, CHASE feels it has followed the democratic process for the planning and environmental control of these developments to the letter. We engaged at every level, wholeheartedly participating in both a planning oral hearing and an EPA oral hearing.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">The chairperson notes that among the issues of most concern to the group is what it describes as "the threat this development poses to public health". I have gone through this Bill and see no reference to health. When he makes his response, I hope the Minister of State will correct that. With regard to ESB pylons, of which Deputy O'Donovan spoke, incineration and other such projects, one of the issues people are concerned about is the threat to public health. We must recognise that people are afraid for their children and themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">The CHASE group chairperson noted that the other issues of most concern to the community are the threat to public safety, conflict with the development plan and the Cork area strategic plan, overturning democratically made local decisions to refuse planning permission, ignoring site selection criteria, and an unsuitable site.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">The chairperson's letter continues:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_880">In his report to An Bord Pleanála, the inspector gave 14 reasons why this facility should not get planning permission, one of them being that he could not guarantee this development did not pose a threat to public safety. This is a major worry to the community and justifies our concerns to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">The inspector, the expert agent sent by An Bord Pleanála, conducted an oral hearing and came up with 14 reasons the project should not go ahead. Nevertheless, An Bord Pleanála approved the project because of Government policy. What was the point in having an oral hearing in the first place? How can the public have confidence in the process when this occurs?</p>
          <p eId="para_882">I challenge the Minister of State, or any Minister, to answer these points, if they can.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">The process does not make sense to me or to the 30,000 people in Cork represented by CHASE. People are concerned that it will become even more streamlined, meaning they will not have time to research applications and marshal their arguments. The letter continues:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_884">At the recent EPA oral hearing we learned that no risk assessment on health or the environment has ever been done by Indaver Ireland, the company proposing the development. Despite [slick] presentations by this company for the last four years, it was only when searching questions were asked by the community and some cogent facts and figures were presented, that the truth finally emerged.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_885">One of our worries is that neither Indaver Ireland or the EPA have taken the care and due diligence that befits an application of this magnitude. Without intervention by community groups like ours, the planning and other issues on which the State makes decisions on behalf of all of us, would in this case have been set aside in a headlong rush to facilitate this development. The protection of people's health and environment are fundamental to the principles on which our Constitution is based, and therefore we feel fully justified in our challenge to this development.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_886">As you are probably aware, there is a Government proposal to "fast track" developments such as this via a new infrastructure board. While we do not yet know the terms of reference or structure of such a board, it will almost certainly mean that public consultation and a truly democratic decision-making process would be seriously undermined. The idea of fast tracking can only lead to corners being cut and any meaningful participation by communities who are to host such facilities will be seriously eroded.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_887">Central to the planning system in this state is the concept that planning decisions should be based on a democratic consensus between the stakeholder groups rather than the autocratic imposition of a single point of view "in the common good". We are worried that the fast tracking of major development proposals will seriously undermine the democratic and consensual principles of our planning system. It is totally at odds with the principles of planning not to view all aspects of planning in a holistic manner.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_888">Community groups like ours have a serious vested interest in fully evaluating applications for major facilities. It is in our interest to evaluate the safety, health and environmental implications of such developments on our lives and the quality of the lives of our children and future generations. Communities are uniquely positioned to identify problems, as they are the main stakeholders. The value of this unique perspective cannot be understated in the planning process.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_889">It was the public consultation process that allowed the truth about our particular application to be exposed. This process must not be lost. Local planning policies such as county-city development plans and CASP in relation to Cork county, are policies that have been agreed and drafted in consultation with the people and those we elect at a local level to represent us. A national infrastructure board will simply facilitate "present Government policy" at the cost of national policy and indeed local county policy.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_890">The pressure on our environment arising from rapid economic growth is such that we cannot afford the erosion of our democracy any further. We have seen far too often in recent times too many decisions being made in favour of the lobbyists at the expense of sound planning principles.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">Hence the establishment of the tribunals. The letter continues:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_892">While the present system has its problems in relation to objections to some proposals, we feel it would be far more helpful for the Government to look at why this is so. Further isolating communities from the decision-making process is not, in our opinion, the answer. A quote from a Government commissioned report sums up the issue well:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_893">Public trust, whether it is placed in the regulators, in compliance with the regulations of in the information provided, will be fundamental in achieving even a modicum of consensus for any future developments in waste policy in Ireland. (Health Research Bureau summary, 2003).</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_894">This infrastructure board comes at too high a price for the development of a healthy and balanced society and is a price that many people may not be willing to pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">These are the views and concerns of the CHASE group on the Bill's proposals, based on its past experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">Section 3 provides for an amendment to the principal Act to provide for any relevant policies of the Government, the Minister or any other Minister of the Government to be taken into account by the board. No indication is given as to how these will be weighted. The other provisions in the amending section relate to "the provisions of a development plan or plans for an area, the provisions of any special amenity area order relating to the area, the national interest, the national spatial strategy" and so forth. No indication is given as to how the board should weigh up these factors. Does one take precedence over the other? Does the relevant Government policy take precedence over all other matters? The board must be guided in this respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">The amending section also provides for the construction or the financing, in whole or in part, of the construction of a facility, or the provision or the financing, in whole or in part, in the area. If a facility is to be constructed in a particular area, the developer must compensate the people affected. Planning permission, however, may be required if it is a building.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">The amending section states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_899">(8) A condition attached pursuant to subsection (7)(<i>d</i>) shall not require such an amount of financial resources to be committed for the purposes of the condition being complied with as would substantially deprive the person in whose favour the permission operates of the benefits likely to accrue from the grant of the permission.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">It does not, however, specify how such a bond will be ascertained.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">During the consideration of an application, the expenses incurred by the board must be paid by the person making the application or objection. Does that apply if the permission is refused? If the permission is refused, could difficulties arise? Can the board make a decision to help an individual or group pay costs in such a scenario? The ESB pylon and CHASE groups in Cork incurred considerable costs to their own expense. It is a David and Goliath situation — the local community versus a major developer. The State must set up a mechanism to balance this and make independent finance available to a responsible objector to enable him or her to carry out research to put his or her case. It can be an extraordinarily expensive process. Many groups have had to raise enormous sums of money to secure expert witnesses, some from overseas, for oral hearings.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">The enforcement of regulations concerning planning breaches is weak, a concern held by many groups. If a planning application gets the go-ahead who will independently enforce test emissions, for example? The resources must be made available to enforce regulations. For example, if a building is put up near an individual's house and he or she objects, he or she then must give his or her name and address. This is available to the developer. If the developer is not particularly pleasant, he or she can make life difficult for the objector. This often prevents people from complaining about unauthorised developments. I accept there is the danger of frivolous objections but a balance is required. People are afraid to make complaints for fear a brick will be thrown through their windows at night.</p>
          <p eId="para_903">A provision preventing the construction of nuclear power facilities must be included in the Bill. There is a chance such projects may be fast-tracked, which is not what the people want.</p>

          <from>Mr. Stanton</from>
          <p eId="para_905">Delays are not always caused by objectors but are also caused by administrative, legal and judicial factors. I welcome the provisions that will prevent these delays. I also welcome the provision in section 9 by which a local authority can refuse planning permission to a developer based on past record. If a cowboy built an estate, made a mess of it and walked away, leaving a nuisance and all manner of problems, the local authority can refuse him or her if he or she seeks planning permission at a later stage. That is an important element of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">The Bill could incorporate the taking in charge of estates by local authorities as this appears to take forever. This matter should be examined. Auctioneers' signs sometimes appear to stay in place for long periods following the sale of a property and are a blight on the landscape. Will the Minister endeavour to ensure auctioneers take down signs once a property is sold?</p>
          <p eId="para_907">Legislation does not appear to cover the requirement to seek permission for mobile hen houses. This is an unusual matter. If a person wishes to produce organic eggs or chickens, a hen house on wheels can be used and moved around a field. These can be reasonably large structures. Will the Minister examine the matter with a view to having it included in the legislation? A person approached me in this regard but I could not find any reference to the matter in the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_910">Déanaim comhghairdeas leis an Aire as an mBille seo a thabhairt os ár gcomhair inniu. Tá sé an-tábhachtach, agus tá pleanáil an-tábhachtach don ghnáthdhuine, do mhuintir na tuaithe agus mhuintir na cathrach mar aon.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">I congratulate the Minister for bringing forward the Bill. Since I was elected to the House, planning has probably been the third most important issue I have come across, after crime and the health service. It affects practically everyone in rural and urban areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">The Bill amends the Act of 2002. Many years ago I studied the 1963 Act when I was a student in UCD. The Act of 2002 must be amended in order that strategic infrastructure can be put in place. The Bill provides for this by allowing for a single stage process and a rigorous assessment of all projects, including their environmental impact, public consultation and, above all, certainty of timeframes. It takes so long to get full planning permission for an infrastructural project that the proposal is often rendered uneconomic. If a private investor has to withdraw, he or she is at a significant loss because the pre-planning process costs so much before plans are even drawn up. If the State or a local authority is involved, the taxpayer picks up the bill, often unfairly.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">I hope the Minister will go further and also examine smaller projects that are less important on a national scale but of great importance to an individual or a locality. The time taken to acquire planning permission for these projects must also be examined, in addition to their socio-economic and environmental impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">An Bord Pleanála already has responsibility for roads, motorways, waterways etc. and the Bill correctly extends its remit. The most difficult aspect of planning is the delay in the timeframe. No one knows how long the process will take. One cannot operate in that way in the 21st century. Currently, planning decisions can be appealed from the county council to An Bord Pleanála and then to judicial review. It is important that everybody should have his or her say. However, I would like to see the Bill addressing what I regard as malicious objectors, those who persistently and routinely object to proposals. Such people do exist. One can have a person from County Donegal or outside the country objecting to a project in County Wexford. I accept we are all part of a big European Community but there must be a balance between economic necessity and environmental desirability. Too often projects fall down in spite of their economic necessity. In many cases, those who have been to the forefront with their objections pack their bags and leave the country once a project has been refused permission. Every delay causes significant loss, not just to private developers but also to taxpayers.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">It is important that the rights of the individual are protected and the proposed public consultation process takes this into account. In getting rid of the local authority planning stage it is important to ensure the specialist division of An Bord Pleanála will be properly financed to consider projects of strategic infrastructural importance. In future An Bord Pleanála will decide on what is strategically important.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">The Bill proposes to give a specific role to elected representatives. I compliment Deputy Stanton on his contribution because on at least three occasions he referred to the reason we were here. Public representatives are elected to local authorities or the Dáil to represent and give effect to the aspirations of the majority of ordinary people. In many cases in the past the aspirations of ordinary people were not part of the planning process. Too often the views of the minority take precedence over the views of the majority who elect us, irrespective of which party we come from.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">A balance must be struck between economic necessity, job creation in rural Ireland and the protection of, for example, badgers and foxes. I make no apology for stating people and their needs should always take precedence over the needs of the environment. I am not someone who would like to see the environment destroyed. As a teacher, I was involved for many years in environmental preservation. However, it is important that if a project will create jobs or get us from A to B more quickly than would otherwise be the case, that these should be overriding concerns of planners.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">I am delighted to refer Deputy Stanton to a provision in the Bill that gives a new specific role to county managers who will be required to obtain and forward the views of the elected members of the council to the board. That is one of the most important aspects of the Bill and reflective of a Minister who is in touch. I am sure not a day goes by when Deputies from every party, including Ministers and Opposition spokespersons, receive people who give them first-hand accounts of the frustration they experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">I hope the Minister, Deputy Roche, who has been most proactive and the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, will look not just at major projects but also at the ones which concern the lives of ordinary people. Very often this may relate to the desire of a farmer who has worked hard all his or her life to provide a site for his or her children. Given the state of farming, very often farmers have little else to give their children. The position of such a person must be reflected in what we, as elected representatives, do. In my short experience in the House, this does not always happen.</p>

          <from>Mr. P. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_920">I compliment Deputy Dempsey on his contribution. The last point he made is one that is brought home to me on a regular basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_921">I have heard it discussed by many colleagues. This is the difficulty of securing planning permission for one-off houses in rural areas for people indigenous to the locality such as local farmers' children and cottagers. Such persons encounter major difficulties in securing planning permission in the areas in which they have lived all their lives. Many are treated in an appalling manner. It is sometimes the case that speculators manage to get around the planning laws, while a genuine person from the locality cannot get permission to build a house a few metres down the road. As the previous Deputy correctly said, people in rural areas are not cash-rich and many farmers cannot afford to provide their children with cash to help them purchase a house. What they have, however, is the valuable commodity of a potential site which may be crucial in helping their children to set up their own homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">We are rapidly losing sight of what is happening. A year ago the Taoiseach indicated that he would address the issue of rural planning by issuing new guidelines to local authorities. Even taking account of the long lead-in time in terms of county development plans, I see little evidence that these guidelines have filtered through to rural localities. Throughout the 20 years I have spent in public life I have encountered many who were dissatisfied with their dealings with local authorities on planning matters. Even some of those who secure planning permission are left with a sour taste in their mouth because of their perception that they were put through the wringer and that obstacles were placed at every turn to thwart their intentions. Something must be done about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">My party has indicated its general support for the Bill, while pointing to some difficulties arising from it. The Bill is something of a reactionary response to delays that have occurred in providing several infrastructural projects. I am not convinced it will address these issues, although the Minister may be able to reassure us on that point.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulMcGrath" eId="spk_292">
          <from>Mr. P. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_925">Most of the problems that have emerged in major infrastructural projects have revolved around the architectural Acts implemented over many years which deal with such matters as the protection of archaeological sites. It is the provisions of this legislation which have resulted in many of these cases going to court. It is still possible that legal challenges may be made to proposed major infrastructural projects because a person who is not satisfied with a decision of An Bord Pleanála may seek a judicial review. In addition to the challenges arising in regard to archaeological sites, there have been significant delays in project planning, overshoots, delays and so on. To what extent will the Bill address these difficulties?</p>
          <p eId="para_926">We must be conscious of striking the correct balance between local democracy and the need for ongoing infrastructural developments. As we get older as a democracy, it seems we are intent on passing over more of the decision-making duties to entities over which we have no control, perhaps because we no longer want the responsibility of making decisions. When I first became a Member of this House, for example, one could have asked the Minister for Transport about the N4 or N6 and received an update report on developments, whether funding was likely to be available and so on. Now, however, the Minister can refer such questions to the National Roads Authority. Questions to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform about the Garda are now directed to the Garda Commissioner. Likewise, questions on most aspects of the health service are passed to the Health Service Executive.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">We are abandoning significant decision-making powers to others who are not accountable in the same way as elected politicians. In this context, we must strike the correct balance between retaining public confidence in the system and ensuring the system is fair. When there was a crisis in regard to incinerators and waste management some years ago, the Government of the day decided county councillors could not be trusted and that responsibility in this area should be given entirely to the county manager. This is not a good way of conducting business. If we are to enhance local democracy by allowing councillors to draw up county development plans and so on, we should not reduce their powers by saying they are not competent to make decisions about waste management, the location of dumps and so on. Unfortunately, that unsatisfactory system is already in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">Many have little faith in the planning process. It is regularly the case that apparently strange decisions are made by both An Bord Pleanála and local authorities. For many the conditions attaching to planning permission, whether imposed by An Bord Pleanála or the local authority, and the enforcement thereof are a cause of aggravation. I could give many examples. St. Mary's in Mullingar, for instance, was a beautiful traditional stone-built Famine hospital, constructed in 1841, and one of only two of its type from that period. When a monument was being built in France some years ago to commemorate the soldiers who had died in the Second World War, somebody decided the stone from this hospital would be ideal for the purpose and proceeded to knock down an unused part of the building. With others, I protested about this and eventually the matter was referred for adjudication to An Bord Pleanála, which body in its wisdom decided that the Midland Health Board was incorrect to knock down the building and instructed that it be restored to its original state, even though the stone had been transported to France and used in the construction of a commemorative round tower. Not much has happened to rectify the matter since. This leaves a sour taste in the mouth.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">In the example I have given why was the building allowed to be knocked down in the first instance? Why did a State body, the health board, act without permission? Will it now set aside and disregard a decision of An Bord Pleanála? It is a question of enforcement. One can call to mind many decisions throughout the State that remain unenforced. I am sure all Members are inundated with contacts from residents' associations complaining that their housing estates have not been completed, street lights have not been installed, footpaths are not up to standard and so on. It seems to take an eternity to have something done about this. However, one will also meet the ordinary individual building a single house who feels he or she is being treated badly by the local authority in terms of its enforcement of the conditions attaching to the planning permission. If the ordinary person receives a letter from the local authority to the effect that he or she must comply with certain conditions or the authority will take action, the person panics and does something about it. What happens with a developer? He cocks up his nose, walks away and throws the letter in the bin. What happens with regard to seasoned campaigners who are used to dealing with such matters? They do likewise.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">The case of a house in County Louth was brought to my attention recently and I brought it to the attention of the Minister. Planning permission was sought by a small-time developer to build a house in a rural area. Permission was granted but he proceeded to build the house at total variance to the conditions attached to the permission, in terms of elevation and position <i>vis-a-vis</i> the road and adjoining properties. The case went on for a considerable amount of time. The developer applied for retention but was refused, twice. He appealed to An Bord Pleanála and was refused. What happened at the end of the day? He persisted and eventually he obtained permission for the house as constructed.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">In that context, one can understand why a man who wanted to build a house on the adjoining site but was refused by the local authority is angry. He is asking what the developer has that he has not got. He is wondering what the developer did to enable him to build a house that was totally at variance with what was planned. Situations like that cause people to become very disillusioned with the planning process and result in the loss of public confidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">On foot of a freedom of information request I reviewed much of the information relating to that planning application. The Minister will be interested in the final decision, because he wrote to me regarding this matter. The final decision was not to pursue the matter because the local authority received legal advice to the effect that if it took the case to court, there was a chance it would lose and there would be a cost associated with that. The local authority acknowledged that what the developer did was totally wrong, that its job was to enforce planning guidelines and conditions, but chose to set the case aside because a lawyer suggested that it could be dodgy. That is not the way to do business and I know from my dealings with the Minister over a long period that he would not want that kind of situation pertaining either.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">To restore confidence in the planning process, we must examine situations such as the one outlined and decide how we can learn from them and how can we improve matters in the future. A balance must be struck between what is good for the local community and the national community, the ordinary individual and the big multinational company, particularly as the latter may be in a better position to go into court and fight a case.</p>

          <p eId="para_939">Another balance needs to be struck in the context of public, private partnerships. We must be careful that the private element of those potential partnerships does not piggy-back on the public body, with the latter pushing through developments under the section 10 arrangements which will simply facilitate the private developer. This could happen in the case of decentralisation projects. We must be careful that we strike the right balance, particularly in the context of such once-off projects. If one decentralises a Department to Mullingar, Tullamore, Arklow or wherever, it is a once-off project. For that reason, we must ensure that it is done properly and that the private element is not piggy-backing on the local authority. I am not sure whether those types of arrangements could go through under this Bill and perhaps the Minister will clarify that matter in due course. I see that he is shaking his head and look forward to his clarification——</p>

          <from>Mr. Roche</from>
          <p eId="para_942">No. They are not strategic infrastructure. Nor are housing estates, which could also be built under public private partnerships.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulMcGrath" eId="spk_300">
          <from>Mr. P. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_943">I am glad the Minister has clarified that offices are not covered as they are not considered to be strategic infrastructure. Therefore, decentralisation projects could not be considered in that way either. That is good because decisions on such matters must be made at local level. Councillors must continue to be involved in what is happening in their areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_944">Toll roads are obviously infrastructural developments that would fall under the remit of this legislation. I urge the Minister to have a study conducted on the toll road on the N4 between Kilcock and Kinnegad and the costs involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">Let us imagine that I approach the Acting Chairman and invite him to go into business with me. He agrees and I outline the business plan. I explain that I will put up 35% of the money required for the project and he will put up the remaining 65%. He agrees, assuming that he will get a good return. I then explain that even though he invests 65% of the money initially, over the next 30 years he will also have to pay a further €600 million, at least, for the project while I keep all the profits. I will look after the project and at the end of 30 years, we will review the situation again. That is exactly what has happened with the N4 project. The State, through the taxpayer, put in €268 million. The private developer put in €40 million up front and took a loan of €150 million. The taxpayer and the users of the road will pay, at present-day usage and costs, at least €600 million over the next 30 years on that road. All of the profits that accrue from the road will go to the developer, the company who put up the money. At the end of 30 years, the developer might give the road back to the State. However, given what happened with the M50 toll bridge, it is likely that just before the 30 years are up, the developer will add another lane and renew the contract for a further 30 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_946">If that project was re-examined in terms of annual returns on investment it would be clear that it should have been kept in-house. Failing that, at the very least, money from the National Treasury Management Agency, which sets aside money to invest in public private partnerships, should have been used because the return the agency would have received would have made it worthwhile.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulNicholasGogartyGP" eId="spk_301">
          <from>Mr. Gogarty</from>
          <p eId="para_947">Obviously many Members have spoken already and it is difficult to come up with something new to say. We all want to get our tuppence worth in on this Bill, me included. The Minister has been very gracious to some of my party colleagues in his remarks. As my colleague, Deputy Cuffe, said, if the Minister is praising the Green Party, he has something up his sleeve — an example of his political skill.</p>
          <p eId="para_948">Democracy is being moved upwards, away from Demos, a retrograde step. There have been stories in the tribunals about corruption, bad planning and decisions made by councillors that were, at worst, spurred on by corrupt payments from developers and, at best, amounted to bad or incompetent planning. However, the Bill will not end incompetent planning but bring it to another level. It will create a situation where the public will feel less connected with the planning process and a decision will not be seen to have the imprimatur of the man or woman in the street.</p>
          <p eId="para_949">People have spoken about objectors coming from all over the place, about people from County Roscommon objecting to projects in County Waterford, even about someone from outside the country objecting. Anyone should be able to object to anything; it is a democratic right. Deputies have a right to oppose anything they like. The Green Party is accused of opposing everything when it proposes solutions other parties do not agree with. Anyone who disagrees with something, even spuriously, is still entitled to make his or her point.</p>
          <p eId="para_950">When I go around doors, people give their opinions. In a small minority of cases the person concerned will be most arrogant and obnoxious possible but I try not to get involved in an argument. I listen carefully, taking his or her views on board, and try to leave on friendly terms, even if he or she says he or she would not vote for the Green Party in a million years or shouts that we are all the same. That person might be cynical about the political process because of past events but he or she is entitled to be contemptuous of politicians and express his or her view. That is democracy, hearing that voice at the door and opinion expressed through the ballot box.</p>
          <p eId="para_951">The planning process is another wing of true democracy, where a person can say he or she does not like a development because it will hamper his or her view and, therefore, objects to it. It could be a case of NIMBY but even such individuals are entitled to submit planning objections. If they were not allowed to do so, where would it end? There is a statutory period for applications to local authorities, appeals to An Bord Pleanála and support observations. It does not matter how many object; the statutory process will not delay anything.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">The same applies to larger scale developments. We have seen arguments about Carrickmines and the Hill of Tara. I was involved in campaigns on large-scale planning issues in Adamstown, proposals by the Railway Procurement Agency and the M50 bridges and widening scheme. In all cases members of the public made their views known and the projects often went straight to An Bord Pleanála.</p>
          <p eId="para_953">Rather than moving more of these large-scale projects up the scale in order that there is no local input, we must increase it. We must provide more power for the elected members of local authorities instead of handing it to unelected managers who can ignore motions tabled by councillors as they see fit. Directly elected mayors are needed, with councillors given more power to make decisions at local level, with the possibility of a regional level for the decentralisation of national decisions. True decentralisation gives power back to the people and the regions, rather than relocating a Department in Parlon country in County Laois. It is still a centralised Department, where people get frustrated trying to contact someone no matter what. A regional system gives people a real input into decision-making; they feel they are being listened to. If they do not have proper recourse, they can approach a local councillor who can then tell the directly elected mayor that a project will be opposed or should be amended.</p>
          <p eId="para_954">The underlying fears in the Bill relate to councillors being swayed by the corruption of the past or by public protest. If there are plans for a incinerator in a certain area, it makes sense for the regional waste plan to be adopted or for An Bord Pleanála to call the shots instead of the local authority. In my constituency if councillors decided to build an incinerator, it would be difficult to see it ever happening. That might be because of cowardice on the part of the representatives or it might be because they acknowledge the implications for their constituents. Sometimes leadership is necessary. That is where councillors must stand up and be counted.</p>
          <p eId="para_955">It is not a question of taking power from the little boys and girls because they might not use it responsibly; power is being abused at every level of the State and that will continue as long as power is absolute. It is necessary, therefore, to bring it to the lowest level to ensure everyone is accountable for the decisions he or she makes. There may be an element of moral cowardice in some cases but local input, excluding the NIMBY filter, tends to be good.</p>
          <p eId="para_956">There are reasons people in Palmerstown, Lucan and Quarryvale objected to the widening of the M50. This large-scale project was originally costed at €300 million and increased to €850 million. The Taoiseach now estimates its final cost at €1 billion. While the M50 will be three lanes wide and there will be proper interchanges at the N4 and N7 junctions, there will still be congestion. It is in that context local democracy could be shown to work. Councillors could have tabled amendments to these proposals, stating they would support the project if the Government provided a cast iron commitment to provide a Luas system or 400 buses in tandem with the widening of the M50. Under the rehashed Transport 21 plan there is a promise of public transport infrastructure long after roads structure. Thanks to the National Toll Roads decision to close off the M4 link to the M50, we have congestion virtually eight hours a day coming from the west towards the M50 toll bridge. That will get worse when the M50 is widened, a decision made by the board, which could not be influenced by people's views, rather than by local elected representatives. People's views were expressed to the board directly, and it made decisions in the context of existing Government guidelines and regulations, which is why in one sense it was anti-democratic.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">The board will always uphold the democratic decisions of the Government of the day, but there is no opportunity for local representatives to have those guidelines amended on the basis of local democratic input. Were that democratic input considered, people on the ground would realise that one can argue in principle that widening the M50 is necessary in the long term, but if one still has congestion thereafter, one must have something else to promise people.</p>
          <p eId="para_958">The same is true of one of the largest strategic development zones in the country, which is being established in Adamstown. It went to An Bord Pleanála, which decided on the basis of community input, but there was no chance for elected members of the local authority to attach conditions requiring the Government to provide trains and buses. There were conditions that one could not have additional development until a temporary train station had been provided by the developer, or until four tracks had been installed, but it did not in put an onus on the Government to provide those services.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">As a result, although Adamstown is in one sense a very ambitious project, and may work when totally full, as it is filling up it will only add to congestion. There will be great deficits in public transport infrastructure since, while the train station will be provided, there will not be enough space on the train for people to board. Not until 2015 is it planned to electrify the Kildare route past Adamstown and Lucan and on to Hazelhatch. In that context, there will not be the requisite capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">If local representatives had the power to make decisions and attach conditions to planning such as that for Adamstown, stating that they would not permit a single house to be built until, as a requirement of the planning permission, the Government committed itself to a certain number of carriages or buses, that would be workable local democracy in action. It could force the national Government to provide the services needed to make planning work.</p>
          <p eId="para_961">The story is similar with schools. An Adamstown developer would provide school buildings, but under normal circumstances developers would provide a site and the building would appear ten years later, when the children's situation was at crisis point. If one had real local democracy regarding all planning, including issues covered under schedule 7, such as energy infrastructure, industrial installations for electricity, and wind turbines, at least one would get input that might prove valuable. If one had primary input, one would still be able to go to An Bord Pleanála and overrule decisions seen as outside the local authority's remit. However, decision-making should be at the lowest effective level upwards rather than imposed from above.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">In that regard, the Irish Planning Institute submitted comments fairly late on this Bill. They were passed to my colleague, Deputy Cuffe, and some other Deputies may also have received them. It makes some relevant points on this Bill. I do not necessarily agree with its support for a one-stop shop, but it has salient points to make on the Bill and why it is flawed. It stated that, if passed, the new proposals would undermine key principles of the planning system, particularly regarding issues such as the absence of a clear link to the hierarchy of planning policy instruments such as development plans and local area plans that are normally at the core of our planning system. I would add SDZs such as Adamstown to that list. The absence of right of appeal on substantive planning issues for all parties with recourse to the courts only on points of law strikes at the principles of fairness that underpin our planning system.</p>
          <p eId="para_963">From a personal perspective, I reiterate the perceived threat to the impartiality of An Bord Pleanála if the board is required to facilitate consultation with parties to a proposal. We already have situations where the inspector reports in favour of the community, only for board members to overrule him or her — the very people who were not there on the ground and did not listen to all the submissions. That will throw further cold water on the perception of impartiality that one must have. There must be faith in the planning process, which is why one must give more power to local authorities and let councillors fall on their swords or live by their bravery. That is the first level, after which a case would obviously go up to An Bord Pleanála in any case.</p>
          <p eId="para_964">The Irish Planning Institute made the general comment that a plan must go through a proper public consultation process before going to An Bord Pleanála. It listed examples where the spatial planning merits of a project have been considered in principle, including regional planning guidelines, the city or county development plan, or the local area plan, for reasons of democratic participation and proper integration. I hate to use the word, since it is somewhat hippy-like and corny, but there must be a holistic approach to infrastructure projects regarding overall link to county, regional, and national spatial strategies.</p>
          <p eId="para_965">Another concern that I have is with section 3, which amends section 37A of the principal Act. An example to which the IPI refers arose in my constituency, namely, the proposed national distribution park in Clondalkin. As it stands, the Bill allows for projects that are primarily profit-driven and not necessarily in the public interest. It should not be used as a back door for controversial private projects to avoid the normal planning process, for example, in subsections 37A(1) and 37A(2). There are concerns on section 3 that there could be situations such as regarding the national distribution park in Clondalkin or even private incinerator proposals, as in Kilcock.</p>
          <p eId="para_966">This Bill might have been better, providing much more clout to local authorities and their elected members. Had it done so, people would have had more faith in the democratic process. They would not mind then having An Bord Pleanála make impartial decisions on major infrastructure projects. The time lag is not a major factor, since we have seen such lags in national projects that had more to do with successive Governments' incompetence than flaws in the planning process. If one wishes to make a plan that has an impact on future generations — possibly 100 years from now — as my colleague, Deputy Boyle said, one must get that plan right. That is why, at the first level, one must start as locally as possible, taking all those concerns on board, sifting out some of the nimbyism and making decisions based on proper planning. One must at least give people an input into proper planning by allowing them to express their views.</p>

          <from>Mr. English</from>
          <p eId="para_967">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak about this Bill. The Minister criticised the fact that so many Members spoke about the Bill but I am disappointed that more Members did not speak about it. Approximately one-third of Members have spoken, which is not very much when one is talking about such an important Bill. Nearly every speaker said the same thing and much of what was said did not relate to this Bill. I hope the Minister will note everything else that was said and introduce a few more Bills to correct these problems and save 55 speakers from having to peddle the same arguments. This shows the frustration caused by the planning system.</p>
          <p eId="para_968">Much of this frustration is caused by a bad system and a lack of staff. There are insufficient staff levels in the various sections. Planning itself is a grey area and will vary. Everyone's story will be different. Mr. A's planning case will differ from that of Mr. B but to the average Joe Soap, they are the same. Ordinary people do not have the time to read why a decision was made in favour of one individual but not in favour of another individual. The system is complicated and the lack of sufficient staff makes the problem twice as bad. It makes it very difficult to work with the community, council and planning department in respect of various types of infrastructural projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_969">I welcome this Bill, although it requires some changes, because it might help fast-track certain developments. I do not agree with the Minister of State's assertion in his opening speech that it is the key to delivering the infrastructure we need to sustain and improve our quality of life. The Bill is not that important, although it may help. However, it is more important to put more staff into planning departments and An Bord Pleanála to ensure that we get proper and quick decisions. This Bill might advertise the importance of planning and getting things done but it is not a magic wand that will save this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_970">In Meath, which I will use as an example because I know it best, planners are attempting to produce local area plans. A total of five plans are being produced in Navan, where I live, while two plans are also needed for Trim and Kells, respectively. However, only one planner is working on this process yet we expect to receive quick decisions and answers and good planning. We cannot expect our planners to do this. Planners will take cases akin to the army deafness cases against the State for driving them insane. They are being driven insane trying to carry out serious work in terrible conditions. It is not good enough. None of these Bills will make a difference if we do not give them additional resources and staff. An Bord Pleanála is to receive an additional €270,000 to cater for this Bill if it is introduced this year. This amount will not achieve much. We must be realistic. It is possible to pass some of these development charges back to the developer. The council can increase its charges. There are ways of doing this so that it is not a financial burden on the State. We must examine the matter because the lack of trained staff is affecting our quality of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_971">It has led to a lack of faith in the system. The Irish people are already doubting Thomases but a system that is not working properly gives people ammunition to object to every development and bring their objections to every level of the planning process. They do not believe in our system because it is hard to figure out. This fuels ideas of conspiracies. It appears that the big players always win. One rarely encounters a case where a minor player wins even if he or she is in the right. No wonder people have no faith in our system because it does not appear to work. I have a great deal of faith in some areas of it but it does not appear to work generally, which is the key factor. Introducing a Bill which is perceived to push projects through the process without consultation adds to people's lack of confidence in the system. I am confident the Bill does not really do this but this is what people think, which allows them to scaremonger. This shows the importance of not doing things too quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_972">I agree with the Minister's assertion that people deserve a better planning system. However, it is the Government to which he belongs and which has been in power for a long period that presides over the current planning system. This Bill has been discussed for a long time but nothing has been done. Even in the absence of this Bill, much more could be done to sort out the planning system.</p>
          <p eId="para_973">The Bill is supposed to help us power our homes and businesses, deliver people to their places of work and study and goods to market and provide clean water and solutions to waste problems. These are all the projects this Bill is supposed to fast-track. Taking power and waste as examples, what prevented any Government, regardless of who was in power, coming forward with a plan a few years ago that argued that this country needed between one or three incinerators or whatever was needed; that it intended to convince the Irish people that the plan was safe and could work, as has happened in other countries; and it planned to state where it planned to locate these incinerators? No Government ever took a lead on this question. Incinerators sneaked in over councillors' heads and were put to one side. Incinerators are allowed in this country but nobody takes a lead on the question. We are now faced with a raft of applications from all over the country to build eight or nine incinerators when the country does not need them, although it might need two or three of them. Proper planning is about leadership on any key infrastructural project, be it an incinerator or a more popular project. The Government has no problem announcing popular projects, such as the national spatial strategy or decentralisation plans which might bring jobs in their wake, but when it comes to bad news, it is very slow to take the lead and engage in proper planning.</p>
          <p eId="para_974">If people stood up and stated that Ireland needs power and waste management facilities and other necessary projects, such as two or three incinerators, they could be developed. The Government could then decide that there needs to be one in each region or county, whatever is necessary. The Government should take some difficult decisions. The Minister talks about giving power back to councils after the Government took power from them in many decision-making processes relating to power and waste management. The decision to take power from councillors was correct in certain circumstances because many councillors do not want the power to introduce unpopular decisions. It suits them to be able to blame the Government or the EU. There is no point taking power away and then stating that it needs to be restored. We need a concise approach to the matter that will always involve local authority members and give them a proper say in both popular and unpopular decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">According to the Bill, councillors will have access to the executives of An Bord Pleanála, a provision with which I have no difficulty. This access is present in oral hearings but councillors have not been listened to. One oral hearing with which I am familiar was held on a strategic development zone, SDZ. This is another great planning concept to deliver fast development that involves planning and developing a piece of land all at once rather than one field at a time. The idea behind it was sound but SDZs have yet to be introduced so there is something wrong with the system. We have all these great ideas but the system lets us down. At the oral hearing, we had access to the staff of An Bord Pleanála. The local councillors, who knew about local traffic and infrastructural problems, knew most about the number of vehicles the roads in the town could take but were told by An Bord Pleanála that they were wrong in their estimation of phasing for traffic. We were told that our roads could take more than 1,000 more cars. An Bord Pleanála did not believe there was any point in listening to local councillors but they are the ones who deal with problems on the ground. There is no point stipulating in this Bill that local councillors will have a greater chance to have a say if they will not be listened to. Planners think they know everything but they do not. They do not live in all these towns so they cannot know everything. They should listen and make some changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_976">If an inspector from An Bord Pleanála visits a site, be it that of a major infrastructural project or house, and submits a report that is overruled by the board, people are surely entitled to an explanation. It does not make much sense if the evidence collected by the expert sent out to investigate the matter is set aside and the decision is taken anyway. This does not boost faith in the system. This is what is wrong with this country and why people object to every development. They feel they must object because they do not trust those in charge to do the right thing on their behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_977">Any new Bill or changes must guarantee that proper procedures will be followed for the right reasons. The Minister of State spoke about how the Bill will help deliver the national spatial strategy. This strategy passed over the county and town I represent. It forgot to mention County Meath and its main town, Navan. The town was referred to in one line in the section dealing with the greater Dublin region. The greater Dublin region is not doing anything for Navan. The strategy gives it houses, but no proper developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_978">Interestingly, the Minister said the economic success of the greater Dublin region is based on rail connectivity. Navan is the only town that does not have rail connectivity and will not have it for at least ten years under this Government. There is a plan, which we are told is great, but we do not act on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_979">Rail is a separate issue and I will revert to it with the Minister for Transport. Counties such as Meath and towns such as Navan are ideal spots to provide springboard links from the city of Dublin to the hub towns. What do we call the other ones?</p>

          <from>Mr. English</from>
          <p eId="para_981">Yes. Monaghan, Cavan and Dundalk are out further. What would have been wrong with using the towns on the outskirts of the city and linking them inwards? They could develop economic links to the city and the other marked areas. Such would comprise a proper plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_982">Will the spatial strategy be re-examined and will the Government consider places such as Meath, Navan, Kells, Trim and other towns? The last strategy bypassed us. A proper spatial strategy does not skip over some of the main areas under such pressure. When there was no spatial strategy, they endured the pain and counties Meath, Louth and Wicklow experienced a great deal of housing and other developments. There was no proper plan to direct those developments elsewhere. When this spatial strategy was introduced, it should have corrected the problems in those counties around Dublin. Such would have been proper planning.</p>
          <p eId="para_983">In its current form, the planning system can act as a blockage and delay projects. My County Meath colleague, Deputy Johnny Brady, mentioned the M3 motorway. Other areas where there have been delays were also mentioned. On the events surrounding the M3, objectors have delayed it by a certain period, but not by seven years. At my first council meeting in July 1999, which will be seven years ago next month, members were shown the four or five potential routes for a new dual carriageway through County Meath. The process started seven years ago and no one in this House could tell me it has been delayed for seven years by objectors. It will shortly be in its eighth year of delays. The matter went through the courts and has been delayed for the past six months by objectors, but until that point no objectors had delayed it. It spent six or seven years in the system of An Bord Pleanála hearings, evaluations and route selections.</p>

          <from>Mr. English</from>
          <p eId="para_989">I am not going in circles. I will make my point clear now that the Minister of State has woken up. In simple terms, the Bill is supposed to do away with delays caused by objectors. The road, which is badly needed in County Meath, was not delayed by objectors for seven years. They probably delayed the project for the past year and will possibly do so during the next six months or eight months, which comprise two years of the seven to eight years. What happened during the other five years? The system is wrong in this respect and no other.</p>
          <p eId="para_990">The Bill might help to speed up the last process, but that is only part of the matter. The Minister of State should not tell me I am going around in circles. I am clear in what I am saying. I represent an area that has suffered the most from pathetic planning, particularly in terms of housing, infrastructure or any key component in a good quality of life. I wish I could speak on this matter for hours. The Bill will not solve all our problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_991">One section provides for face-to-face consultations between An Bord Pleanála and those proposing developments. It makes sense if one is to put money into development, one will speak with those who make the final decision. However, this would only be right if the opposite side also got its say with the same people. Currently, it is wrong that people cannot get access to decision makers even at county-level planning. While pre-planning measures are a step in the right direction, they do not do a good job.</p>
          <p eId="para_992">The proposer of the development has a chance to appeal a planning decision, but objectors never receive the chance to meet the decision makers. It is important to have a balance, which is a change Fine Gael would support in the Bill. It makes sense for opponents of developments to meet decision makers. Consequently, one will have faith in the system, which is a key aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_993">As the Minister said, a streamlined process for the public is important. I welcome that local authorities will promote growth and that they will go straight to An Bord Pleanála. The prior situation made no sense to me. We should go a step further, as councils make decisions on their own projects, such as on one-off housing. This is a waste of time because the councils will not refuse themselves permission. It is good that they will go straight to An Bord Pleanála so that people can add to the issue and fast-track some of the projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_994">There is a great deal of talk on the part of the Minister and others about badly put together applications. I agree with this, but the Bill does not necessarily address that matter. The Bill would address it if An Bord Pleanála sent back the application and did not want to deal with it any further, but not in general. We need a higher standard of development applications. We should put in law the requirement for stakeholders who are negatively or positively affected to be involved from day one. Clever private industries know this and do such from an early stage, but others do not and try to sneak applications through by placing notices that will never be seen in newspapers. The system does not work that way.</p>
          <p eId="para_995">There should be a legal requirement that from day one, one's neighbours should be involved in any planning decision one is making. Neighbours should be told what is happening, what right of say they have and what can change. The response might not be negative, as they might have some good ideas. However, we do not have this provision. We have touched on it in terms of environmental impact statements. With scoping areas, one must consult stakeholders, but this does not really happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_996">To get fast-track planning, one should sit down with the people affected, deal with them and try to address their concerns in one's early application. It is the clever way to approach the matter and might even delay many objections. I welcome the provision to attempt negotiations when there are problems. In the case of a road, what one is allowed to do when negotiating is amazing. If I read the Bill correctly, a little negotiation and change is allowed. It should be encouraged, particularly at council level. People should be allowed to engage in proper mediation to solve the problem. They have better things to do in their lives than to complain and object, but they feel they must.</p>
          <p eId="para_997">The Bill frequently refers to how environmental impact statements must accompany applications. The statements are of poor standard and not many people in the local authorities and An Bord Pleanála are trained to assess them. As a rule, as soon as an EIS accompanying an application passes the door of a planning authority, it should be sent to be assessed and graded with an A, B, C or D. If it does not reach C, it should be thrown back for not being good enough, as we should not accept shoddy work.</p>
          <p eId="para_998">An EIS is an important document. For €1,000, it could be independently assessed, we would know it was good enough and could then accept it. If it is not good enough, it would be sent back to be redone. We should not accept bad workmanship.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">In respect of planning, who is in authority? It does not seem to be the councils. There was a chance to review the Planning and Development Act 2000 in this Bill. In that Act, councils were given the right to refuse applications based on a person's or developer's previous history, but only after they went to the High Court. That provision should be removed, as councils should not need to go to any court. If a local authority believes a developer's track record is so bad that his or her application should be reviewed, it should be able to refuse the application there and then instead of taking the risk and going to the expense of going to the High Court, which could cost €500,000. Councils cannot afford this cost because it would mean less money for footpaths, lights and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">If councils are to be in control, we should let them deny planning permission to a developer who has done a bad job or not finished an area until the problem has been addressed. The Minister of State lives in Dublin and I live in County Meath, but my local authority cannot go to the High Court every second week, as it might lose. This grey area should be addressed. I will accept correction if I am wrong.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_29">—the national and international legal consensus that a state cannot rely on diplomatic assurances alone to discharge those positive obligations, and, in particular, the statement of the secretary general of the Council of Europe that ‘mere assurances by foreign states that their agents abroad comply with international and national law are not enough. Formal guarantees and enforcement mechanism need to be set out in agreements and national law in order to protect ECHR rights';</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_30">—the Legal Affairs Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has adopted a report from Senator Dick Marty to the effect that the United States has progressively woven a clandestine ‘spider's web' of disappearances, secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers, spun with the collaboration or tolerance of Council of Europe member states;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_31">—the Marty report concludes that certain Member States, including Ireland, could be held responsible for active or passive collusion (in the sense of having tolerated or having been negligent in fulfilling the duty to supervise), involving secret detention and unlawful inter-state transfers of persons whose identity so far remains unknown, and that Ireland in particular could be so responsible for permitting Shannon to be used as a stopover for flights involving the unlawful transfer of detainees;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_32">—the secretary general of the Council of Europe has commended the Marty Report and stated: ‘Senator Marty has made some serious allegations about the involvement of several European countries.

        <summary eId="sum_33">—the Irish Human Rights Commission has stated that: ‘the report of Senator Marty is persuasive if not conclusive, and gives credence to the concerns already raised by the Irish Human Rights Commission. It strengthens the case for a fundamental rethink, especially on the reliability of diplomatic assurances. Reliance on diplomatic assurances is at the very heart of the Irish case and in this context the Human Rights Commission is strongly of the view that the only form of diplomatic assurances that could meet our constitutional and international human rights obligations would be ones which were fully legally enforceable and were accompanied by an effective regime of monitoring and inspection of aircraft suspected of involvement in the rendition of prisoners.';</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_34">—committed to full engagement and co-operation with other states to counter international terrorism and in that regard recalling the EU Presidency statement of the 11th May, 2006 that: ‘We share the view that effective counter-terrorism measures and the protection of human rights are not conflicting goals, but complementary and mutually reinforcing.

          <from>Mr. T. O’Malley</from>
          <p eId="para_1007">I will speak for approximately ten minutes. The other Deputies will speak for approximately five minutes each and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, will conclude.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008">I welcome the opportunity to open the second night of debate on this motion. Although yesterday evening's debate was characterised by some heated exchanges, I am encouraged by an emerging consensus that evidence, expert opinion and common sense do not support the suggestion that any prisoner has ever been brought through Irish territory as part of an extraordinary rendition operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009">The debate, it seems, is rather about the best method of ensuring that Ireland's obligations under international law are fulfilled. Some of those on the opposite side of the House have argued this should be done by searching aircraft randomly. As my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, outlined cogently yesterday evening however, despite the cosmetic attractiveness of such a course of action, its efficacy at preventing this sort of action is deeply flawed. It could not be said, in any meaningful sense, to fulfil the Government's positive obligations under international law. I will come back to this point later in my speech, but I will first reinforce a point made last night about the assurances Ireland has received from the US authorities in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010">The assurances that Ireland has received from the US authorities in the area of extraordinary rendition lie at the heart of the Government's policy in respect of extraordinary rendition, and with good reason. Ireland is in the fortunate position, partly because of the urgency it attached to the matter, of having obtained assurances from the US authorities that are unparalleled, both in terms of their content and the level at which they have been confirmed. It is not possible to conduct a debate on this matter without acknowledging that fact, and those who attempt to group Ireland with other countries in Europe without giving due weight to this fact, as I am sorry to report that Senator Marty appears to have done, undermine public confidence in the comprehensiveness and credibility of their investigations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011">The Government has made it clear from the very beginning that it will co-operate fully with the Council of Europe and the European Parliament in their investigations into this matter. In particular, we were pleased to have an opportunity to set out in great detail our approach to these matters for the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, Mr Terry Davis. Copies of this document were, of course, distributed to all Deputies. At no stage did the Secretary General indicate that he took issue with Ireland's approach. Senator Marty, on the other hand, conducted his investigation without once contacting the Irish Government. As a result, we feel his remarks about Ireland were based on an incomplete understanding of the facts of the Irish case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012">The contrasting approaches of the Secretary General and Senator Marty — of engagement on the one hand and isolation on the other — underline the value of our policy of engagement with the United States on this issue. Through this policy we have a channel to express our concern in a number of different frameworks and to ensure that our concerns are met in respect of this matter. This type of approach — engagement rather than confrontation — creates an atmosphere in which concerns can be raised openly, and incidents, such as the inadvertent transfer of a US marine through Shannon last weekend, can be discussed frankly, to ensure the appropriate remedial steps can be taken. It is also, as I have already stated, the best way of ensuring the fulfilment of our positive obligations under international law in respect of this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013">Some of yesterday's speakers argued strongly in favour of searching aircraft to ensure they are not carrying, and have not carried, prisoners. However, it is clear from what was said yesterday, and from a number of international reports, that the aircraft that are alleged to have been involved in this activity are identified months, at the very earliest, after they land. Furthermore, civilian aircraft of the type in question are not under international law required, as the Minister for Transport has explained to the House on several occasions, to apply for permission to land. This means that a transited State such as Ireland may have very little notice of the arrival of such aircraft. In this context, a regime of random search and inspection would clearly be of very limited value in achieving the desired goal, and questions would rightly be raised about its efficacy in meeting a State's positive obligations. Moreover, given that at most the allegations are that such aircraft passed empty through Ireland, it is impossible to see how, even if such aircraft were to be identified and searched, the outcome of such searches would shed any particular light on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014">It is the Government's firmly held view that our positive obligations in this area are best met by our approach of having obtained at the earliest opportunity clear, unqualified assurances from the US authorities. These assurances have since been confirmed by the Secretary of State of the US, Condoleezza Rice. This twin package of specific, bilateral assurances, combined with confirmation from the highest levels of the US Government, fulfils in the most effective manner the Government's positive obligations in this area. To the best of my knowledge, no other State is in the fortunate position of having its assurances confirmed in this manner.</p>

          <p eId="para_1017">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter but first offer sympathy on the death of the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">I thank Deputy Michael Higgins for raising this matter and for giving us the opportunity to respond. I listened very carefully to what the Minister said last night, which sums up the Government position:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1019">The Government's position on the issue of extraordinary rendition is, therefore, quite clear. We utterly condemn it, we in no way facilitate it and we are willing, with our partners, to consider carefully any practicable and specific proposals which the Council of Europe, the European Parliament or any other body may make to reduce the possibility of future cases occurring. At the same time, we do not accept that we have failed to meet our obligations. We utterly reject allegations of collusion, either passive or active, with this practice. I believe we have done and are doing all that is possible and practicable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020">I welcome those words. I have made it very clear on other occasions in the Dáil that I utterly condemn violence and war. My grandfather died in war and other members of my family suffered. It is very important that colleagues on the other side understand that I share concerns which they have expressed. I, my colleagues from the west and the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, from Limerick, are always careful to acknowledge that America is our friend. I am probably the only Member of the House who has never been to America and I do not know whether I will correct that in my lifetime. I see that country as a friendly nation. I have had many contacts with American politicians and I know where we stand in that regard. At the same time, this issue is such that we must say to the Government that spot checks are required. Having read the reports over recent days, I wondered how a cleaner could just ramble onto a plane and see that situation. If this man only stole some clothes and was being brought home, I cannot understand the American logic as to why he had to be chained and handcuffed. It seems to me that the Americans might be watching too many movies. I do not think it would happen in most places, including Ireland, but if they have nothing to hide, that is fair enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">I was cheered up by the front page of <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning which reported that US military-linked flights might face inspections at Shannon. We should record the fact that the Government is to reconsider introducing inspections on US military related flights.</p>

In fairness, the Government has made its position clear and I am glad the Minister of State has reiterated that. We should dispel the myth that colleagues on this side of the House would condone wrongdoing. We should speak out about it. I am glad the Minister of State has given us assurances in that regard. Like other colleagues, I will follow it through. We can all get hysterical about these issues and, while I am not suggesting that the Deputy would do so, we should be clear about the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">I listened carefully to the Minister yesterday and the Minister of State today. I am bound to say that they know more than I do about this matter and I am impressed by the assurances they have given. They are making it clear to the American authorities that it is not good enough. It was a profound act for the Minister to summon the American ambassador and seek an explanation from him. The ambassador's assurances were sought on the matter, which will please many people. We are a sovereign state and are entitled to do that.</p>

          <from>Mr. P. Power</from>
          <p eId="para_1031">I thank my colleagues for sharing their time on this important debate. I welcome the opportunity to address the issue of extraordinary rendition, a practice which is virtually unknown outside the context of the US war on terrorism. The concept of extraordinary rendition is alien to me. It is also alien to the legal system which we operate in Ireland. As a country, we cannot agree in any shape or form with the movement of people from one jurisdiction to another other than by international legal agreements, that is, by extradition, not extraordinary rendition. The debate is welcome because it gives us the opportunity to re-state that position or, perhaps, to state it in the House for the first time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032">At the heart of this debate is a wider discussion on the central allegation that, either passively or actively, Ireland has colluded with the practice of extraordinary rendition. As a country, we wholly reject that practice. The Labour Party's motion refers strongly to this fact in the preamble. Notably, it makes no specific allegation that extraordinary rendition has occurred here. If we were to be found guilty of colluding in extraordinary rendition, we would also be guilty of gross hypocrisy, not alone because of our expressed opposition to extraordinary rendition but also because of our long-standing and steadfast opposition to collusion in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033">Members of the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights have examined the issue of collusion regarding the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and other incidents including the security forces in the North. We have a clear insight into what constitutes collusion in this respect. It leads directly to the question of how one defines collusion in the context of this debate concerning extraordinary rendition. The Labour Party motion refers to active or passive collusion "in the sense of having tolerated or having been negligent in fulfilling the duty to supervise". The question is whether we have a duty to supervise or, in other words, to board and inspect flights. Regardless of whether it exists, that duty is at the heart of this debate.</p>

          <from>Mr. P. Power</from>
          <p eId="para_1035">In the same way, it is simply not permissible in this country for our authorities, in any shape or form, to enter and inspect any property or premises without due cause. They can only do so when there is concrete information on the basis of a warrant obtained through the judicial process. Are we to abandon the concepts we apply to entering property in this State and apply different ones for aircraft entering and leaving the country?</p>
          <p eId="para_1036">In the absence of definitive information to the contrary, are we entitled to rely on the categorical and unequivocal assurances of a friendly country? That question is at the heart of this issue and how we answer it is fundamental to this debate. The situation is not clear cut and needs ongoing monitoring depending on the information and reports available, such as the one we are discussing. On balance, I believe we can and should rely on such assurances. We should also be in a position to apply the same standards for aircraft as we apply to inspecting and entering property in our country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037">I wish to address the episode that occurred in Shannon the other night. That matter was regrettable and we object to it in the strongest possible terms. However, it would be wrong to confuse that with the much more important debate centering on the Labour Party motion. While the episode at the weekend was regrettable and ought not to recur, it is in a very different category. In that context, I welcome the Minister's remarks yesterday when he said the Government was willing carefully to consider with its partners practical and specific proposals which the Council of Europe, the European Parliament or any other body may have to reduce the possibility of such cases recurring. At the same time, we do not accept we have failed to meet our obligations under international law and we utterly reject the allegations of active or passive collusion. For the reasons I set out earlier, I do not believe we are involved in collusion, which is the allegation of which we, as a country, stand accused. We are not guilty of collusion in these circumstances.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimGlennonFF" eId="spk_332">
          <from>Mr. Glennon</from>
          <p eId="para_1038">I wish to preface my remarks by stating that this is my first contribution in the Chamber since the death of the former Taoiseach and leader of Fianna Fáil, Mr. Charles Haughey. I wish to associate myself with the tributes paid to him yesterday. He was a constituent of mine, as well as everything else. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039">Before anybody from this side of the House speaks on an issue such as this, particularly on a motion tabled by Deputy Michael D. Higgins, it is appropriate to pay tribute to him for his long career in the area of human rights and the passion he brings and has always brought to the issue. As a mere spectator for many years in the sport of politics, I found his contributions were not only worth listening to but also worth re-reading and giving due consideration. I pay tribute to him for that. However — after those opening remarks, there must be a "but" — this unusual issue seems to be black and white. There is little grey area. The Government's position is clear, although the Opposition position appears, to it, to be clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040">The clarity of the Government's position deserves to be repeated, and it can be set out in a few short and simple sentences. It is that, first, the Government is totally opposed to extraordinary rendition and has made this clear to the US authorities at the highest level — it was made clear to President Bush by the Taoiseach and to Secretary of State Rice by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern. Second, in the context of extraordinary rendition the Government has received clear, factual and categorical assurances from the US authorities that prisoners are not transported through Ireland. That position is simple and is summed up in those two sentences. To suggest otherwise is an injustice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041">My colleague, Deputy Carey, put the case particularly well earlier in the debate. He stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1042">Extraordinary rendition is an issue on which the Government has taken a great deal of unwarranted flak, largely I suspect at the hands of people who are determined to look more at rumours than at facts. In the matter of extraordinary rendition, having received assurances, as the Minister has, of unsurpassed quality obtained early on from the US authorities and confirmed by the US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, the Government is in an extraordinarily strong position, especially in the European context. Are we to ignore these on the basis of a series of unsubstantiated allegations? I believe we cannot do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">In tandem with Deputy O'Connor, I am no apologist for George Bush or his regime. Even if he were standing again and I was in a position to offer electoral support, it would not arise.</p>

          <p eId="para_1051">Ireland has a long and noble tradition of adherence to fundamental human rights and freedom. One aspect of this commitment is our membership of the Council of Europe, a parliamentary assembly to which the Oireachtas sends representatives. The European Convention on Human Rights has become a cornerstone of European policy in this area and its basic tenets were also to be enshrined in the draft EU constitution. Another aspect of Ireland's foreign policy has been its policy of military neutrality, a policy to which the vast majority of Irish people subscribe.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052">The Government and, through it, the Oireachtas, has received assurances at the highest diplomatic level that Shannon is not being and has not been used for the illegal rendition of terrorist suspects. These assurances have been given in good faith and should be accepted in good faith. Ireland and the USA have a long and valuable history of friendship and solidarity and there is an obligation on us to accept assurances when they are given at such a high level. In this context, I welcome the Minister for Foreign Affairs' speech in this debate and I applaud his active role in raising this matter with the US Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053">At European level, the recent report from the Council of Europe with regard to rendition flights throughout Europe simply cannot be ignored. Most of us agree that many aspects of this report are disturbing. From an Irish standpoint, it is clear there has been no collusion between the Irish authorities and the US authorities with regard to illegal rendition. The Minister for Foreign Affairs correctly pointed out that Senator Marty's report produces absolutely "no new evidence to implicate the Government in the practice" of extraordinary renditions. However, given the paramount importance of the fundamental issue of human rights, there is an obligation on all of us to examine this issue very closely indeed. Accordingly, I have suggested that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Joint Committee on European Affairs should invite Senator Dick Marty to a joint meeting of the two committees, where his investigation and its findings can be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054">As Europeans, we must be concerned with alleged human rights abuses on our Continent. As Irish citizens, a close scrutiny of this report would provide us with the opportunity to close the door on this issue once and for all. If Senator Marty has any evidence of Irish involvement he should let us know this in plain language. If he does not, it would provide us with the opportunity of slaying this particular dragon and moving on to other business.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055">In any event, the time has come for new protocols to be established with regard to the usage by US and other military authorities of Shannon or other Irish airports. These protocols should contain a clear and transparent set of rules, setting clear guidelines for the transfer of military personnel through Irish airports. This should allay public anxiety that Shannon is being used directly or indirectly for purposes which are inconsistent with the principles contained in the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

          <p eId="para_1060">Sinn Féin supports this motion. I believe all Deputies with a conscience will vote in favour of it and against the Government amendment. Sinn Féin actively pursued this issue since it was first brought to light by human rights NGOs and concerned individuals monitoring flight patterns.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061">I brought a book of evidence to the Garda Síochána earlier this year and held a meeting with two members of the force to discuss what could be done by them to stop Irish complicity in the US illegal rendition programme. The outcome of that meeting was very disappointing. It became clear that an unsatisfactory catch-22 situation exists. The gardaí said they need the very evidence that they might find on the aeroplanes to get permission to search them in the first place. This grave shortcoming is recognised by the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062">However, I would go even further. At this stage and in recognition of the fact that the US assurances have now been proved untrustworthy by the incident in which a prisoner, albeit a US marine, was spotted in chains on an airplane in Shannon Airport without the required prior notice being given to the Irish authorities, we should simply refuse the use of Irish airports and airspace to every and any flight associated with the US military or the CIA. After all, we are purportedly a neutral country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063">Extraordinary rendition is just one part of Bush's self-styled, so-called war on terror. The facilitation of this illegal war compromises our neutrality, which requires that belligerents not move munitions of war across the territory of a neutral state. We must also ask what else we are involved in through Shannon Airport. Documentation that has come into my possession shows that not only is Shannon Airport being used as a pit stop for US troops on their way to and from their war in Iraq and that it has been used by aeroplanes involved in the illegal extraordinary renditions programme but also that it facilitates the sale and transfer of arms to human rights abusers throughout the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064">The arms embargo on the Indonesian Government, for example, and other arms embargoes have been breached. In September last year, at least six months before the lifting of the embargo on Indonesia, the Office of Antiterrorism Assistance in the United States State Department ferried ammunition, explosives and arms through Shannon Airport, via Canada, and onwards on a chartered military transporter to a Bulgarian airport used by the military. From there it was flown to the US Embassy in Indonesia. This was supposed to be for an anti-terrorism training course for a government whose human rights violations, according to Amnesty International, remain a serious concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065">According to Amnesty International's report, this year in Papua cases of torture and arbitrary detention were reported and across the country the police use excessive force against demonstrators. Ill-treatment in detention facilities and police lock-ups was widespread. At least two people were executed by firing squad and at least ten people were sentenced to death. According to a large number of human rights NGOs, the Indonesian military remains unreformed, wielding tremendous political power and terrorising the very people it is supposed to protect.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066">Other flights involving the same airplane during September and October last year, for which I do not have complete details, suggest that this is regular traffic with 2,600 kg of dangerous goods going back and forth from Canada, via Shannon to Bulgaria. The exact origin and final destinations of these flights cannot be confirmed at this stage. They occurred on 15, 17, 21 and 28 October. On 3 September another one of these flights had an undisclosed content of three boxes weighing 6,985 kg. On 8 October, M16 rifles were ferried through the airport. Sikorsky helicopters were also ferried through Shannon Airport to another human rights abuser, Turkey, on 30 October. This is in addition to details which emerged of Shannon Airport being used to facilitate the sale of Apache attack aircraft to Israel from the United States last February.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067">Will the Minister clarify whether the Government and the Ministers for Transport and Foreign Affairs are aware of the details I have disclosed? Did the Department of Transport give the required authorisation for the activities I have outlined? Did the Department of Foreign Affairs, upon consultation as required under the 1973 order, approve the use of Shannon Airport for those activities? Does the Minister agree that the role played by this State in the sale and transfer of arms to human rights abusers is absolutely unacceptable and must cease immediately? What steps will he take to ensure that this affront to Irish neutrality is brought to an immediate end?</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Breen</from>
          <p eId="para_1068">As an elected Member of the House for County Clare, I am keenly aware of the depth of feeling regarding the matters to which this motion refers. I welcome the business and income generated by the use of Shannon Airport by the US military. This business led to the establishment of many American industries in the mid-west and helped sustain Shannon Airport for decades, in far tougher economic times. However, I do not condone the use of Shannon Airport for rendition flights, refuelling of such flights or such flights travelling through its air space.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069">It is all very well for Members of the House to state that they accept assurances given by Condoleezza Rice and other US representatives. However, if there is nothing to hide, why not invite gardaí to inspect their aeroplanes and finally put suspicion to rest? The Marty report clearly states: "There is no formal evidence, at this stage, of secret CIA detention centres in Council of Europe member states, even though serious indications continue to exist and grow stronger." Much of the rhetoric of the report is based on the evidence of insider sources, past employees, innuendo and media reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070">Since the 11 September 2001 attacks on America and subsequent attacks throughout the world we have a duty as politicians to robustly attack terrorism. Our citizens expect this of us. However, plans and legislation put in place to do so must respect undertakings given in previous international treaties. If we are to defeat terrorism we must do so while maintaining national and international rights, integrity and values.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071">As members of the EU the stance we share on torture is clear: it is wrong, in all circumstances. We should not forget that in late 2005 the US Congress passed a ban on torture and on any treatment that is inhumane or degrades an individual. To ensure rendition flights are not accommodated in Shannon, the Minister for Foreign Affairs should arrange with the US authorities for random checks of aircraft by gardaí to be allowed. At present, such checks can only be carried out if gardaí are invited to board the airplane. If we allow actions in our country which erode human rights, we will shatter our integrity, independence and democracy.</p>

          <p eId="para_1072">Extraordinary rendition is an illegal act and is inconsistent with international law. It is inconsistent with our Constitution and is inconsistent with the American Constitution. It is no more than kidnapping and internment without trial. No legal framework allows it to occur.</p>
          <p eId="para_1073">Of the three detainees at Guantanamo Bay who committed suicide last week, one was 17 years old when he was taken into custody four years ago. He had neither been charged with nor convicted of a crime. The cage in which he was held in Guantanamo Bay was his life. Amnesty International has long been concerned that some prisoners at Guantanamo Bay are so psychologically damaged by being held for years without charge or trial that they are becoming suicidal. Three years ago the International Committee of the Red Cross stated its concern that the indefinite detention regime at Guantanamo was having severe psychological repercussions on the detainees.</p>
          <p eId="para_1074">The lack of humanity in the response by some US official spokespersons to the incident demonstrates a dangerous mind set. US Navy Rear Admiral Harry B. Harris stated that the detainees had not killed themselves as a result of depression but as an act of asymmetrical warfare. The deputy assistant Secretary of State for public diplomacy called the act a good PR move to draw attention. These are people to whom we are giving passive support by refusing to inspect flights.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075">If the US has nothing to hide, it should have nothing to fear. It should welcome inspections. We require and seek due process for our citizens. We should expect no less for the citizens of the world. The least we should ensure is that we are fully compliant with international law. That cannot be done by diplomatic assurances alone.</p>

          <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
          <p eId="para_1076">I commend the Labour Party, especially Deputy Michael D. Higgins, on bringing forward this motion. "Hear no evil, see no evil" and "out of sight, out of mind" appear to be the policy of this Government. It does not have the moral compass required properly to address this critical situation. Like doubting Thomases, its members want to put their hands into the wounds before they will believe.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077">This Government is not about people but about supporting big business and superpowers. If there is even the slightest chance that somebody is being tortured or rendered, we must deal with it. However, like ostriches, we have been burying our heads in the sand. We will not deal with it just as we will not deal with other situations here. This Government will not deal with people dying on hospital waiting lists. Thousands of people on waiting lists for eight or more years develop cancer and die due to neglect because of the Government. Half the population got a service while the other half did not and hundreds will die in the meantime when money, which is not being made available, would put it right. Successive Governments ignored all these issues just like when thousands of beds were taken out of the system in former years and they thought nothing would happen and expected everybody to be well and to live happily ever after.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078">If the shoe was on the other foot and if we thought there was something wrong with our planes going through Kennedy Airport we could not fault the Americans for wanting to check our planes. The evidence is there but the Minister says it is not. It has been proven that Ireland is part of the CIA network. Just because nobody is necessarily caught on a plane does not mean nobody was on the plane shortly before or afterwards. We know some planes were used to transport people for rendition and these have stopped in Ireland before or after that. That is a fact with which we must deal.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gregory</from>
          <p eId="para_1079">I support the motion. The Council of Europe report refers to secret and unlawful inter-state transfers of prisoners but the Government amendment bases its case solely on assurances from the United States that unlawful transfers have not happened and do not happen on Irish territory and that they would not do such a thing without our permission. This is totally contradictory and farcical. If something is secret and unlawful would those involved readily admit to it? Would they seek our permission to do it? What a load of nonsense. This is what the Government amendment terms "all appropriate steps to ensure that the territory and facilities of this State are not used for...human rights violations". How ironic that the dishonesty of the United States authorities and the meaninglessness of our Government's disposition was exposed yesterday by a vigilant cleaner who discovered the manacled prisoner on a US plane at Shannon.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080">The Government is contemplating reinvigorating verification procedures when such procedures simply do not exist. The only way to deal effectively with this important issue as the motion states is to introduce an appropriate regime of inspection of aircraft at Shannon. Why has the Government been so reluctant to do this? Why all the meaningless lip service? Is the Irish Government reluctant to offend the United States? The failure of the Government to act decisively on this issue already amounts to passive collusion. If rendition is not happening, if there is nothing to hide, what is the problem with an inspection regime?</p>

          <p eId="para_1081">I declare an interest, I speak as a member of the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe. In that capacity I regret that the Marty report is being given much more credence in Ireland than it deserves and specifically I object to its conclusion, claim or innuendo that Ireland is guilty of collusion in extraordinary rendition. There is absolutely no shred of evidence in his report to support such a claim. In my view Senator Marty has undermined substantially the credibility of his report by making such unfounded, unsubstantiated claims in regard to Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082">The Secretary General of the Council of Europe in commending the Marty report stated, "Senator Marty has made some serious allegations about the involvement of several European countries". By that phrase the credibility of the report is further undermined. The Secretary General of the Council of Europe is commending a report simply because it makes serious allegations, not because it has come up with evidence or proof of wrongdoing. I regret the assertion in the Marty report on Ireland. Such a charge is reckless in the extreme, recognising the instability of some of the elements involved in international terrorism and how they might react to such an assertion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083">While I welcome the debate on extraordinary rendition in the Labour Party's Private Members' time, because of the unfounded claims made in the Marty report in regard to Ireland it is unfortunate the Labour Party has used it as a basis for Private Members' time. By so doing a certain credence is being bestowed on it that it does not deserve.</p>

          <p eId="para_1094">There is doubt about whether there were prisoners on board because we have not checked. This is the issue. I say directly to the Minister that these planes landed and refuelled at Shannon. Did the Government facilitate this? I find it difficult to believe it did not. The Government must have known. Amnesty International has a list of CIA plans as long as one's arm. Is the Government saying it did not know? If the Government knew nothing it stands indicted of negligence, incompetence and culpable ignorance. If it did know it is guilty of straightforward collusion. We need some commitments from the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095">Will the Government maintain and update a register of aircraft operators whose planes have been implicated in rendition flights and require them to provide detailed information before allowing them landing or flyover rights? I have a list from Amnesty International of CIA planes and their registration numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096">Recently I travelled to the United States and had to go through some rigmarole to get in. We should demand the same from the United States. Irish people are finger printed at Shannon. Why are Americans not put through the same wringer? This is only something we should expect. Will the Minister ensure the detailed information includes the full flight plan of the aircraft, including onward stops and full itinerary, full names and nationalities of all passengers on board and the purposes of their travel? If any passengers are listed as prisoners or detainees, more detailed information about their status and the status of their flight should be required, including their destination. Will the Minister refuse access to airfields and airspace if the requested information is not provided?</p>
          <p eId="para_1097">Regarding diplomatic assurances, as they have become known, will the Minister make these assurances, or the correspondence comprising such assurances, public as Amnesty International has requested? Up to now that request has been refused. Will he affirm that such assurances are not an effective substitute for the Irish State's responsibility to exercise due diligence in the prevention, investigation and punishment of violations of international human rights law? Will the Minister and the Government disown any arguments that the Irish State's economic and diplomatic interests in maintaining good relationships with the United States should be the paramount interest here? Will he state clearly that international law and human rights standards must be upheld and that statements made by Senators from his party, when an investigation by the Seanad into CIA flights was scuppered earlier in the year by Fianna Fáil Senators, are not reflective of official practice? Did Senators Dooley and Mooney reflect Government policy when they claimed a select committee on the matter would "insult a friendly nation" and that it would be "extremely dangerous" to the relationship between this country and America to challenge what was going on and that jobs and economic interests would be jeopardised? This is what they said and that is at the root of it. This is why the Government has turned a blind eye to human rights abuses.</p>

          <from>Ms McManus</from>
          <p eId="para_1098">"Extraordinary rendition" is an invented phrase used to disguise the brutal transfer of prisoners and the defamation of human rights. In its motion, the Labour Party expressly calls on the Government to recognise its legal responsibility to ensure that the national territory is not used to facilitate human rights abuses. We also call for a fully independent investigation into whether any agreement. formal or otherwise, was made between Irish and American authorities on these flights.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099">Ireland is one of 14 European countries named in the recent report drawn up by Dick Marty of the Council of Europe as having colluded with the CIA in the operation of secret flights delivering terrorist suspects for interrogation to places, including Afghanistan, where they may face torture. It was reported that, while not actively involved in rendition flights, many EU countries, including Ireland, "ignored them knowingly or did not want to know".</p>
          <p eId="para_1100">Growing concerns that Shannon Airport may have hosted, and may continue to host, CIA rendition flights carrying prisoners to countries where they could be tortured requires an urgent and thorough investigation. It is an obligation of this State to protect people from torture, not just under international law. This is a right guaranteed under the Constitution for every person in the State. The Government cannot and must not be allowed to turn a blind eye for political expediency, or in this case to remain friendly with the current US regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_1101">The Irish Government also has obligations under the EU Convention on Human Rights not only to ensure people are not tortured but also to ensure that allegations of torture are properly investigated. Instead, this Government has hidden behind a wilful excuse of lack of information.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102">The recent case where a US military prisoner was found held in chains on board a civilian aircraft that landed in Shannon Airport is a clear example of the difficulties on relying on assurances by the US that prisoners "had not been nor would be transferred through Irish territory without the express permission of the Irish authorities". That is a quote from a letter sent by the Minister of Foreign Affairs to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe on 20 February 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_1103">Even though it was a civilian aircraft which was involved, the Irish Government has claimed it could not board a plane to investigate allegations of torture in this country, but this case has shown that a cleaner in Shannon Airport could do so. This Government is clearly hoping that someone else will mop up this mess. The Government has hidden behind international air law by saying it cannot board foreign state aircraft, but the Government could also make it clear that it reserves the right to protect fundamental human rights for all persons travelling through this State. It should be made clear that only planes that allow for such investigations are welcome in Irish airspace.</p>
          <p eId="para_1104">It is interesting to use the comparison that if Ireland were extraditing people in the same manner as the US is alleged to be rendering prisoners, it would be illegal under Irish law. At present, Ireland cannot extradite someone to a country where that person may be tortured. This includes sending someone to death row in the United States, for example. This is illegal under both the European Convention on Human Rights and the UN Convention against torture. Similarly, under Irish deportation law, Ireland cannot return someone to a country where that person may be tortured. This is under the principle of <i>refoulement </i>which ensures that no refugee or asylum seeker should be driven back from the country of refuge or asylum to any country where he or she is likely to face persecution or personal danger to life or security or torture. By using this analogy, another country should not be allowed to use Irish facilities to do the same such things.</p>
          <p eId="para_1105">The Government's choice to ignore the brutal reality of these flights has been a conscious one. The Labour Party is determined to hold the Government to account for that decision and to ensure the practice is put to an end. Reassurances, diplomatic or otherwise, do not take away from people's suspicions. People feel actions are taking place on the margins of legality and worse. Diplomatic assurances are no longer sufficient. The Government must now take proactive steps to ensure that information gathering takes place to allay fears and ensure torture and other forms of ill-treatment are not taking place during or after these flights.</p>

          <p eId="para_1106">As a small, neutral country which has a Constitution and commits itself to freedom and human rights, Ireland must have a position which seeks to vindicate fundamental principles of human rights as manifested in the Constitution, in international law and in the various treaties to which Ireland has signed up. We also have a long-standing framework of support for the institutions of the United Nations and the instruments associated with that body. There is a duty on our Government to vindicate, in so far as it can and in the most active way possible, the protection of human rights of all those who may be on our territory at any time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107">There is a broader political context. The war in Iraq was wrong and the Irish Labour Party said so repeatedly. The Government eventually indicated it was opposed to the war but in effect it looked both ways. It sought to offer some reassurances to the position of the United States while also offering an ear, so to speak, to the clear view of the majority of Irish people that the war was wrong. That is not to say that we do not have complete sympathy for the situation in which the United States found itself in the context of 11 September 2001 and the subsequent terrorist attacks on American soil.</p>
          <p eId="para_1108">The Government is right to acknowledge and remember the long-standing friendship between this country and America, and between people of all political parties in Ireland and the citizens of the United States. There is nothing wrong in that, but the Government should bear in mind that there is a great deal of legal, non-governmental organisation and political opinion in the United States which is equally opposed to the war in Iraq and to the manifestations to which it has given rise.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109">The extraordinary structure of detention which exists in Guantanamo Bay is wrong. In the long run, the very strong judicial and legal structures of the United States will uphold that view, as the courts have begun to do in the United States on a number of occasions when given the opportunity to do so. Extraordinary rendition as practised by the United States current Government is wrong. We need from our Government a clear statement of principle on the situation in which we find ourselves as a small, neutral country with a particular record and mandate on the defence of human rights and the prevention of torture.</p>
          <p eId="para_1110">When one waits for flights in American airports and sees groups of hundreds of young US soldiers bound for Iraq or sees them in Shannon Airport half-dazed from their flights back from Iraq and, it is hoped, going home in one piece, there is no one who does not feel for what has happened. However, this does not make the war and all the manifestations to which it has given rise any less wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_1111">It is wrong for the Government to have a two-faced approach. On the one hand we accept the assurances of Condoleezza Rice because of her exalted position and our wish to have a positive dialogue with the US on the war. On the other, from the troop levels going through Shannon Airport and the worldwide documentation on extraordinary rendition, we know in our hearts it is wrong. The Government claims it is the friend of the US and it understands from where it is coming, yet it is trying to reassure a sceptical public that what it is doing is above board. The Labour Party has laid out a mechanism which meets the requirements of Irish and international law. It is regrettable the Government avoids discussing these proposals in a serious way.</p>

          <p eId="para_1112">I compliment Deputy Michael D. Higgins on tabling this timely and pertinent motion, particularly considering the recent revelation that a US marine soldier was discovered being transported through Shannon Airport. It makes a nonsense and a mockery of the Minister's assurances on Shannon Airport. He has assured the House that on the best authority no prisoners have been transported to the US through an Irish airport. It is ironic that it was cleaning staff, who boarded the aircraft during its refuelling stop <i>en route</i> from Kuwait to the US, who discovered a prisoner handcuffed and manacled on board. It transpired no permission had been sought or obtained from the Irish authorities. This is a serious infringement of Irish law. The US action was a crime against a sovereign state. A further irony is that on learning of the prisoner, the airport authorities contacted the US Embassy about the matter rather than the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the Department of Foreign Affairs. This speaks volumes. Why should the Shannon authorities decide to first contact the embassy rather than the Department with responsibility in this area?</p>
          <p eId="para_1113">The protestations by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the US authorities had assured him repeatedly that no prisoners have ever been transported through Shannon Airport rings very hollow. The Minister can no longer insist to the House that Ireland is not a hub for extraordinary rendition. The Minister can no longer accept the word of the US authorities as gospel. The Government is obliged to conduct random inspections of aircraft passing through Shannon Airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_1114">In light of the recent Council of Europe report by Dick Marty that Ireland is engaging in passive collusion with the US Government on the extraordinary rendition of prisoners, combined with our international obligations and our neutral status, there is an urgency on the Government to introduce random inspection and monitoring procedures at Shannon Airport. We have been told a sovereign state does not question the word of another. We have done this for many years. However, when a suspicion arises, apart from the existing circumstantial evidence of rendition, Ireland, as a neutral state, is obliged to ensure it is above reproach on this matter. The Minister quoted a document sent by the Minister to the Secretary General of the European Commission, but it is more a work of fiction with circular arguments that do not address the issues. It merely states Ireland simply takes the word of the US Government. Real action is needed.</p>

          <p eId="para_1115">I commend Deputies Michael D. Higgins and Gilmore on proposing the motion. As a public representative from the Shannon region, I record my objection to the Government's simple reliance on diplomatic assurances rather than ensuring international law is observed at Shannon Airport. It is not enough to adopt the three wise monkeys approach — see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. We need to be reassured that international law is being complied with at Shannon Airport. Enough evidence exists from Amnesty International, the Council of Europe and the Irish Human Rights Commission to indicate that just accepting the word of the US Government is not enough. We have an obligation not just to take a position that we are against extraordinary rendition but to establish the procedures to ensure it is not assisted in our airports.</p>
          <p eId="para_1116">Ireland's reputation as a staunch defender of human rights is at stake in this regard. Either we believe in international law or we do not, and if we do, we have specific obligations. As a friend of the US, we have an obligation to do all we can to ensure it obeys international law, especially on Irish soil. Deputies Gilmore and Michael D. Higgins stated airplanes with identifiable numbers have been used for the unlawful transfer of persons to places where torture has taken place. These airplanes have landed at Shannon Airport although it is not known who was on board. That is enough evidence to ensure inspections of all US planes using the airport. The Minister for Transport has acknowledged these planes landed in Shannon. Why then did the Government not ask the US Government what these planes were doing at the airport?</p>
          <p eId="para_1117">The Government's position has changed since yesterday's revelation of a prisoner on a US plane at the airport. If the cleaner in question had not gone on the plane, would the Government have ever found out about the contravention of the Irish regulations? This proves the case made by the Labour Party that it is not enough to take the word of a friendly country. An obligation exists for us to ensure international and Irish laws are not broken. In today's newspapers the Minister for Foreign Affairs is quoted as saying "we would put the gardaí on notice that perhaps they should start inspecting on a case by case basis". The Labour Party has succeeded in making its point to the Government that it is not enough to continue with the current approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_1118">Last week, the Minister for Transport repeated his mantra that the diplomatic assurances were given that nothing was going on at Shannon Airport. Reputable international organisations such as Amnesty International and the Council of Europe have clearly indicated it is not enough to simply accept diplomatic assurances. What is more, our international obligations, especially in regard to the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, oblige us to do more than simply seek diplomatic assurances. We are obliged to ensure this kind of practice is not going on in our airports. As a representative of the Shannon region, I strongly urge the Government to change its approach on this matter.</p>

        <speech by="#MartinCullen" as="#Minister_for_Transport" eId="spk_365">
          <from>Minister for Transport (Mr. Cullen)</from>
          <p eId="para_1119">As the final speaker on the Government side, I welcome the opportunity to support the counter-motion. A degree of clarity has emerged from the debate, and I especially welcome the emerging consensus that the use of Irish airports for the purpose of covertly transferring prisoners as part of an extraordinary rendition operation is highly unlikely to have taken place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120">I wish to reiterate some key points made by Government speakers. The suggestion that prisoners may have been transferred through Ireland as part of an extraordinary rendition operation is not supported by any of the investigations, whether of the Government, the Council of Europe or the European Parliament. Essentially, as Amnesty International has emphasised, the debate is not about prisoner transfer, rather about how best to fulfil Ireland's positive obligations to ensure this does not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_1121">On one side of the House, the argument is made for searches, that aircraft landing at Irish airports should be searched to ensure that they are not carrying, and have not carried, prisoners for the purposes of extraordinary rendition. However, the debate has shown that the aircraft that are alleged to be involved in this activity are identified only months, at the earliest, after they land. Furthermore, civilian aircraft of the type in question are not, under international law, required to apply for permission to land, meaning that a transited country may have very little notice of the arrival of such an aircraft. In this context, a regime of random search and inspection would be of limited value in achieving the desired goal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1122">Moreover, given that, at most, the allegations are that such aircraft passed empty through Ireland, it is impossible to see how even if such aircraft were to be identified and searched, the outcome of such searches would shed any light on the matter. It is the Government's firmly held view that its positive obligations in this area are best met by its approach of obtaining, at the earliest opportunity, clear, unqualified assurances from the US authorities in this area. These assurances have been confirmed by the US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice. This unparalleled combination of bilateral, specific assurances, combined with confirmation from the highest levels of the US Government, fulfils in the most effective manner the Government's positive obligations in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1123">On the incident on Sunday, where it transpired that a US marine convicted of a petty crime had inadvertently been transferred back to the US on an aircraft transiting through Shannon, while this was clearly not a case of extraordinary rendition, the Government, as Members have heard already, treated this incident with the utmost gravity. The US authorities are fully aware of the seriousness with which the Government treats this matter, and a thorough review of procedures, both in Ireland and on the US side, is under way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1124">While I take little consolation in the matter, the fact that even a critic of the Government's policy like Amnesty International could describe our response as "swift and decisive" indicates the Government's firm intention to ensure that all our obligations under international law are met. It is and will remain the Government's policy that we are opposed to the practice of extraordinary rendition.</p>
          <p eId="para_1125">We attach the utmost importance to fulfilling our obligations under international law, and it is our firm view that our current policy does this best. We have acted decisively over the past week to maintain the integrity of our systems, and Deputies can rest assured that we will do so again whenever necessary.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_366">
          <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_1126">I thank all the Deputies who contributed to this debate. I will begin by referring to the speech of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern. Half his speech last night concentrated on recent events in Shannon Airport that were not germane to the main business of this motion. The event that took place at Shannon Airport involving a US marine who was in transit from Iraq to the United States is relevant to what I have to say only to correct the Minister for Foreign Affairs on a misleading matter to which he referred.</p>
          <p eId="para_1127">In the Article 52 questionnaire which the Government returned to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, it was stated that there are only two grounds on which a prisoner can be transferred: extradition and an interstate transfer. This was stated unequivocally in the questionnaire that was returned to the Secretary General, Mr. Terry Davis, yet last night the Minister stated that what was wrong about Sunday's event was that permission had not been secured from the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_1128">The marine in question was always in the custody of the United States. It was not an interstate transfer, nor was it an extradition, but I do not have the time to waste on this matter except to suggest that whoever advised the Minister is making it up as they go along. They were either right last night or they were right when they submitted the questionnaire to the Council of Europe. They cannot have it both ways. It is simply wrong. It was not an interstate transfer, nor was it an extradition.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129">The nub of this matter is that we are asked to make a choice in a robust identification with the principles of international law, specifically two fundamentals in it: the prohibition against torture contained in the United Nations convention and Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. That article, which is known as <i>jus cogens, </i>is part of those rocks of law and all the Community that subscribe to it and ratify it undertake not to participate in acts that are forbidden and to ensure they never take place anywhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_1130">I need not delay on matters on which there is no disagreement. In our motion, we did not accuse the Government of being involved in torture or of being involved in extraordinary rendition. However, I wish to place firmly on the record and to correct again the Minister's speech. We are not part of any consensus that something has been agreed to the effect that Ireland is innocent.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_1132">We are not in a position to say that we are not involved in the process because we have chosen not to know. Again, I speak about a matter of fact. The Chicago Convention, which governs the international passage of civilian aircraft, is very clear. It does not prohibit us from examining any aeroplanes. The Air Navigation and Transport Act 1988, the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act 1998 and Article 49 of that convention allow us to inspect aeroplanes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1133">I did not have an opportunity to reply to the scurrilous remarks of the Minister for Foreign Affairs last night when he referred to my time as a Minister. He stated: "There is no legal bar to the search of civilian aircraft of the type allegedly involved." That is correct, but it is not what two senior gardaí told Senator Norris and me on 25 January. They took refuge in the fact that the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention Against Torture) Act 2000, in incorporating the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, had not given a right of entry, search and arrest. I do not say they were correct; I say that is what they told us. It appears that nobody can give clear instructions to the Garda. Neither the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, nor the Minister for Transport has established how the Garda is to act.</p>
          <p eId="para_1134">The Minister for Foreign Affairs also stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1135">With regard to Deputy Michael D. Higgins's remark that the Government has not sent in the gardaí, he has a somewhat twisted view of the power of the Government. Perhaps it was the case that when he was a Minister he could send gardaí hither and thither[.]</p>
          <p eId="para_1136">That is a shameful remark. I never abused the Garda while I was a Minister——</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_1140">That is something the Minister's colleagues cannot say.</p>
          <p eId="para_1141">I wish to turn to some of the fundamentals of this matter. Given that we are talking about basic principles of international law, one of those that has evolved, and includes all the family of nations in regard to torture, inhuman or degrading treatment and punishment, is whether and how we are compliant. The issue revolves around whether we can be satisfied with the diplomatic assurances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1142">Those who suggest we should not be satisfied with diplomatic assurances include the Secretary General of the Council of Europe; the United Nations Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; the Irish Human Rights Commission, which advised the Government to this effect last December; the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe, which comprises legal experts who advise signatories on how to comply with their legal obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights; and the temporary committee of the European Parliament. However, we are saying that none of these opinions matters. What matters is the assurance we received from the United States Government. It is such a valuable assurance it has never been put in writing, but it is apparently categorical and specific. We were told today that we are the only state to receive such an assurance but yesterday we were informed that three other countries enjoyed the same benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1143">I wish to correct something the Minister for Foreign Affairs said yesterday in reference to his correspondence with the Irish Human Rights Commission. On the question of the relevance of diplomatic assurances, he suggested the assurance we got from the United States is different to those arising in the two specific cases stated before the European court. Interestingly, the Minister did not refer to the Agiza case upon which he was specifically asked to comment by the Irish Human Rights Commission. Why will he not comment on this case, where the Egyptian Government gave specific assurances to the Swedish Government, including an assurance that the Swedish ambassador could visit Mr. Agiza in Egypt? These assurances were not honoured. Because it suited them to do so, the Minister and his advisers dropped the Agiza case from their correspondence with the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Minister did not refer to it yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144">A fundamental issue is at stake. In its approach to diplomatic assurances, the Government seems to say it is only necessary to dispose of such assurances when they are shown to be unsound. This means it is necessary to decide whether diplomatic assurances fit the issues in question. I am willing to accept the Government's good faith in many matters. Moreover, I accept it may well have raised the issue of extraordinary rendition with the United States Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1145">However, the Government is required under its positive, non-derogational obligations to do more than rely on diplomatic assurances on an issue such as this, which involves the snatching of individuals. We must bear in mind the reality of every step in this process, from the moment of apprehension to the moment of detention, the destruction of <i>habeas corpus</i> and the absence of legal provision. It involves launching a person into an indeterminate disciplinary process and subjecting them to an uncertain detention. It has been established by one international lawyer after another that enforced disappearance is the equivalent of torture.</p>
          <p eId="para_1146">To ensure we are not complicit in this process, we must establish a regime that enforces three standards in this area. First, we must investigate what has been taking place in the past two years. Second, any permission given in regard to civilian, military or state aircraft must include a requirement that the recipient be in full compliance with international human rights law. Third, a system of monitoring and inspection must be in place to ensure we fulfil our human rights obligations. That is the substance of the motion we are discussing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1147">It is important to clarify that civilian aircraft are not immune. There is nothing in the Chicago Convention to prevent us from investigating civilian aircraft. This is an important issue but we have heard nothing of it from the Government benches. When is a civilian aircraft not a civilian aircraft? I understand the CIA leases 33 aeroplanes and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, has told us that some of them landed at Shannon Airport 15 or 20 times. We know the so-called "Guantanamo express" landed there 15 times.</p>
          <p eId="para_1148">We were not told yesterday, however, what any of these aeroplanes were doing when they landed at Shannon Airport. Instead, we got a type of theological argument to the effect that if the authorities had boarded the aeroplane and found no detainees, we would have wasted our time and that the subsequent discovery of the presence of a detainee would be, in any case, merely something that had taken place in the past. We know the flight plans of these aircraft from Euro Satellite information. We are aware that four of them were involved in extraordinary rendition.</p>
          <p eId="para_1149">I do not contend that Mr. al-Masri and others were on board when the aeroplanes landed in Shannon Airport. The question is whether we were part of the process of rendition. If the aeroplane that lands at Shannon Airport is returning home from a rendition task, does its presence at Shannon mean we are complicit in that task? The Government has taken refuge in the claim that the onus is on civilians to show there has been a breach of the law. According to international law, however, the obligation falls not on the civilian but on the state. Under domestic law, the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1988 and the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act 1998 give the State the capacity to take action in this regard. It is confusing that the Garda has investigated two out of five United States aeroplanes landing at Shannon Airport, asked cleaners and mechanics whether they noticed anything unusual and sent this information in a file to the DPP only for the latter to miraculously conclude there is no basis for any charge in this regard. That is nonsense.</p>
          <p eId="para_1150">Instead of making allegations against me in my time as Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs would be better served by answering questions about the purpose of the aeroplanes landing at Shannon Airport and why flights from Rabat, Cairo and Amman are landing there. It has been proved that these were routes used for the transportation of people for torture. Instead of making allegations against me, the Minister should set down rules in this area. Civilian aircraft must be included in new inspection procedures. This means we will be in perfect harmony with the Chicago Convention and it will allow the public, EU and others to know we are a country that values UN protections and that we wish to establish a distance between ourselves and those countries, including our neighbour Britain, which — although signatories to the European Convention on Human Rights — offered up their citizens to the indeterminate process that ends up in Guantanamo.</p>
          <p eId="para_1151">It is time for us clearly to say that the definition of Irish foreign policy is based robustly on the defence of human rights. It is important for us, for example, to be able to take a principled position in coming weeks in regard to the non-proliferation treaty, when we will be asked, as members of the nuclear suppliers group, to vote on the MBUs agreement. Is Irish foreign policy based on expediency, is it something to be trimmed and adjusted, something about which we can be clever? This is not a time for quibbling about whether we are compliant but rather a time for showing we are genuinely compliant, that we know what we mean about positive obligations. We must prove we are willing to say to friendly countries that they must operate within the framework of international law and that we will speak unequivocally against the idea of bringing into existence a parallel, extra-legal and inhumane system called rendition. No more than Guantanamo is a great blotch on the face of humanity, its appalling dark presence a reflection on the international community, so also is extraordinary rendition.</p>
          <p eId="para_1152">I have made no false accusation against the Government, I have simply said it has been appallingly negligent in not allowing us to say we have had no part in this process because we have chosen to know and we can prove that we were not part of it. That is not the position now.</p>
          <p eId="para_1153">I ask the House to support the motion.</p>

          <heading>Employment of People with Disabilities.</heading>
          <speech by="#PaudgeConnolly" eId="spk_375">
            <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
            <p eId="para_1410">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this item for debate. I have been approached by a number of families who find that there is no work outlet for the disabled member of the family. Such people can avail of sheltered employment for a period of time but this eventually comes to an end because the idea behind sheltered employment is to prepare people for employment in the real world. Yet when it is time to move on, there are often no vacancies available. This is despite the fact that these people want to work, as do able-bodied people. We all want to work because a job gives us a sense of dignity, esteem and purpose in life. We believe we can make a worthwhile contribution to society if we have a job. A job also provides a wage package at the end of the week, which helps people to socialise, lead as normal a life as possible and integrate into society.</p>
            <p eId="para_1411">Statistics show the poor position of people with disabilities within the job market. The unemployment rate among people with disabilities is 70% in an economy with an unemployment rate of approximately 4.5%. Ireland effectively has full employment but people with disabilities are very badly treated by society. In the mid-1970s, a policy was introduced whereby 3% of people with disabilities were to be employed in the public service. Some organisations in the public sector have met this target and have been seen to make an effort and some have reached rates of 2.7% or 2.8%, but others have not. The organisations that have met the 3% target will not exceed it and cannot be accused of not having made an effort. They appear to regard the target as sufficient. Despite the holding of the Special Olympics and the activities of the Year of the Disabled in 2003, a large section of society is being left behind.</p>
            <p eId="para_1412">People in organisations that have met or are close to the 3% target will remain in the workforce and, therefore, no new vacancies will arise. People with disabilities who are now coming on stream find it impossible to secure employment. It is time to review the 3% target. Organisations that have not met the target should strive to meet it. However, the target should be upwardly reviewed to come closer to the European average, which, for the most part, is way above the Irish target. The target is 4% in Austria, 6% in France, 7% in Italy and 5% in Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Portugal. Ireland lags well behind these countries. Only 15% of people with disabilities are unemployed in Germany, a country with an unemployment rate of 7%. People with disabilities are not as badly off in Germany as they are here, a situation which we must address.</p>
            <p eId="para_1413">I share the concerns of the Irish Wheelchair Association, which claims that the Government is guilty of discriminating against people with disabilities who want to return to the workforce. It claims that when a person with a disability returns to work, his or her carer loses entitlement to the carer's allowance, regardless of the number of hours worked or the money earned. However, a carer can earn €125 per week — €200 in the case of a married couple — and still qualify for the carer's allowance. Therefore, people with disabilities are being discriminated against.</p>
            <p eId="para_1414">The report of the working group on the review of the illness and disability payment schemes issued recommendations in a number of key areas that should be targeted to improve the situation of people with disabilities. The report recommended reducing the drop-out rate from education among young people with disabilities and increasing job retention rates after the onset of a disability. We must address the issues I have raised because there is a large section of society which is coming into the job market but is being left behind because we do not have jobs for them.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelAhern" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_376">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1415">I thank Deputy Connolly for raising this matter. Responsibility for the policy in respect of the employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service lies with the Minister for Finance. Responsibility for the policy in respect of employment of people with disabilities in the public service lies with the Ministers for Finance and Justice, Equality and Law Reform under the Disability Act 2005. Under the Act, other Ministers are given the power to specify compliance targets relating to the recruitment and employment of persons with disabilities in the public bodies accountable to him or her.</p>
            <p eId="para_1416">Part 5 of the Disability Act 2005, which came into effect on 31 December 2005, established a new statutory framework for the implementation and compliance monitoring of the 3% employment target in the public sector. The Act provides that the Minister for Finance, with the consent of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, may specify compliance targets in respect of the Civil Service. Compliance targets in respect of the wider public sector may be specified by the relevant Minister, with the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_1417">To review the operation of the policy on the employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service, the Department of Finance commissioned independent research from Goodbody Economic Consultants. The research, which was published as employment and career progression of people with a disability in the Irish Civil Service, included a detailed study of a number of Departments which showed that 7% of existing Civil Service staff have disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1418">In light of the consultants' recommendations, the Government looked in detail at the policy in this area and decided to emphasise two aspects, the continued recruitment of people with disabilities to work in the Civil Service and the need to ensure that there are proper supports tor all staff with disabilities. Given the importance of offering employment opportunities to people with disabilities in the Civil Service and in light of the research and the independent consultants recommendations, I understand that the Department of Finance is discussing a programme of recruitment with the Public Appointments Service to maintain work opportunities for people with disabilities in the Civil Service. It is expected that a work programme will begin in the autumn.</p>
            <p eId="para_1419">The Department of Finance has also employed a disability advisory officer who is preparing guidelines for monitoring, reporting and recording arrangements for staff with a disability in the Civil Service. Work is also taking place between the Department of Finance and the National Disability Authority to identify new approaches to supporting staff with disabilities, including the possible use of a survey based on voluntary self-disclosure for new and existing staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_1420">On the employment of people with disabilities in the private sector, my Department promotes a policy of flexibility and supports for employers in regard to the employment of people with disabilities. Under the Government's mainstreaming policy, my Department, through FÁS, seeks to increase the participation of people with disabilities in the private sector through a three-pronged approach involving facilitating progression into sustainable employment through skills development, stimulating awareness among employers of the contribution disabled people can make and encouraging their recruitment and providing specific employment supports for disabled people and employers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1421">The Department, through FÁS, prioritises training and employment supports for people with disabilities within available resources. This includes a range of schemes and grants aimed at promoting or facilitating the employment of people with disabilities within the private sector, including a wages subsidy scheme. This scheme was launched in July 2005 and is currently being implemented by FÁS. It operates by offering subsidies to employers under three separate strands and employers can benefit under one or all simultaneously. Strand one involves a wage subsidy based on the employee's agreed productivity level, strand two involves grant assistance to cover additional supervisory, management and other work based costs where a company employs more than two disabled people and strand three involvesgrant assistance to employ an employment assistant officer where an employer employs 30 or more disabled workers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1422">Eligible employees can benefit from the Department of Social and Family Affairs back to work allowance scheme, which allows the retention of a percentage of their social welfare payments and medical cards for three years. Unlike other schemes, the potential exists for both the employee and employer to benefit financially.Other schemes include the supported employment programme, a workplace equipment-adaptation grant, a job interview interpreter grant, a personal reader grant, a disability awareness training support scheme and the employee retention grant scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1423">In addition, the sectoral plan my Department is finalising under the Disability Act 2005 will, in conjunction with sectoral plans being finalised by a number of other key Departments, set the agenda for addressing remaining issues for people with disabilities participating in the labour market. It is an agenda the Government is committed to implementing.</p>

          <speech by="#SeamusHealy" eId="spk_377">
            <from>Mr. Healy</from>
            <p eId="para_1424">Will the Minister for Education and Science immediately earmark a three-acre site on the Tipperary institute campus on the Frank Drohan Road in Clonmel, which has been identified as the preferred option by the Office of Public Works for the gaelscoil site?</p>
            <p eId="para_1425">Parents, teachers and pupils in Gaelscoil Chluain Meala are frustrated with the long delay in identifying a site for a new school. The school was founded on a temporary basis in 1994 and received permanent recognition in 1995. When it began, there were approximately 41 pupils and there are now approximately 240 pupils. At the time, South Tipperary County Council made available the old engineering offices, as we called them, in Irishtown, Clonmel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1426">While everyone was happy to have the building, it was provided on the basis that it was a temporary arrangement for a small school. The building was founded as a school in 1830 but has seen various uses since, including the county engineering offices for south County Tipperary. No one considered the gaelscoil would still be there 12 years later with no site in view. It is an historic building, but it does not conform with the needs of Gaelscoil Chluain Meala.</p>
            <p eId="para_1427">The parents, teachers, pupils and community are urging the Minister to earmark a site, as they believe the quest for a site has gone on for too long. The building is old, inadequate and dangerous. A recently completed whole-school evaluation states: "Moladh don bhoird dul i dteagmháil leis an Roinn láithreach maidir le cabhair a lorg chun an leath den díon nár deisíodh sa bhliain 2001 a dheisiú anois".</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#TomHayes" eId="spk_378">
            <from>Mr. Hayes</from>
            <p eId="para_1428">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for providing the opportunity to discuss this matter, which has been an issue for a considerable time. As a member of the county council 12 years ago, I remember its decision on whether the building would be knocked or left to the gaelscoil for a year or two. The council voted on the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1429">We have been waiting for an alternative site for 12 years. It is unrealistic to expect anyone to wait that length of time. I do not know what the Minister of State will say in her reply, but I urge her to listen to our comments. This matter has been ongoing for 12 years. It was the first gaelscoil in the county, but more have mushroomed, including beautiful new buildings opened by the Minister for Education and Science while Clonmel has been left on the long finger.</p>
            <p eId="para_1430">If the Minister of State's answer is not positive, will she explain the matter to her superior? This is the longest saga of any gaelscoil and is unfair. There is agreement across the different parties involved that the site should be provided. It is for the Department to make a move. I impress on the Minister of State the need to do something to get the project moving.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Miss de Valera)</from>
            <p eId="para_1431">I thank the Deputies for affording me the opportunity to outline the proposals of the Department of Education and Science in respect of the provision of a new facility for Gaelscoil Chluain Meala in Clonmel, County Tipperary.</p>
            <p eId="para_1432">As the Deputies have said, the school opened in 1994 with provisional recognition and was granted permanent recognition in November 1995. Enrolments for the school year 2005-06 totals 211 pupils. The school is currently occupying a former school building rented from South Tipperary County Council. The cost of site and schoolroom rental is grant aided by the Department of Education and Science at the rate of 95%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1433">The property management section of the Office of Public Works, which purchases sites for new schools on behalf of the Department of Education and Science, was requested to explore the possibility of acquiring a site for the school. Following an advertisement placed by the OPW seeking proposals of possible sites, a number of responses were received. Six sites have been visited and their technical suitability as a location for the gaelscoil was considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_1434">The preferred location for the new school development is a three-acre site on the existing Tipperary Rural and Business Institute site, which is in the ownership of Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute Limited. However, the TRDBI has proposed to the Department of Education and Science that its campus in Clonmel be relocated to a largescale technology park. Approval from the Department of Education and Science to this relocation proposal is conditional on, <i>inter alia</i>, the institute assisting the Department in the matter of the provision of a site for the gaelscoil.</p>
            <p eId="para_1435">Expressions of interest were sought by TRDBI in June 2005 from private sector property developers to determine what exactly could be provided at the technology park in exchange for the institute's current property in Clonmel. The expressions of interest sought required the incorporation of a suitable site for the gaelscoil on the current campus or on an alternative site approved by the Department of Education and Science and the Office of Public Works. The expressions of interest received by TRDBI are currently being evaluated.</p>
            <p eId="para_1436">Having regard to the process under way in TRDBI and the ownership of the site, it is not appropriate for me to earmark a site for the gaelscoil on the TRDBI site. When a firm decision on the future of the TRDBI site in Clonmel is made, the details of the availability of a site for the gaelscoil can be confirmed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1437">Meanwhile the Department of Education and Science has requested the property management section of the Office of Public Works to revisit the other remaining site options to clarify their availability and suitability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1438">I assure the Deputies that the permanent accommodation needs of this school are being addressed and that the provision of a permanent building for the school will be progressed in the context of the school buildings and modernisation programme when a suitable site has been acquired.</p>
            <p eId="para_1439">I thank Deputy Healy and Deputy Hayes again for raising this matter.</p>

          <heading>Compensation Payments.</heading>
          <speech by="#PaulConnaughton" eId="spk_380">
            <from>Mr. Connaughton</from>
            <p eId="para_1440">I thank the Minister for his presence. The farming community in the Shannon callows area, in the general Clonfert, Esker and Eyrecourt areas of County Galway and in areas of Roscommon, Westmeath and Offaly which are in the Shannon callows area, is extremely annoyed about the lack of action on what it sees as rightful compensation. This low-lying area was very badly flooded during the downpours last month and many farmers have seen their silage and hay crops ruined this year. The farmers are up in arms because of the protracted nature of the deal being negotiated with Dúchas. Representatives of the farming organisation and of Dúchas have been meeting for a long time to try to settle this long saga. My understanding is that compensation rates have already been agreed for the corncrake land to secure its preservation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1441">The Shannon callows is a unique area with environmental features not seen elsewhere in Europe. Everybody wants to see the corncrakes propagate and survive for the enjoyment of generations to come. The farmers in the area take their responsibilities very seriously in that regard. Some of the stipulations surrounding the compensation are reasonable from the point of view of the plight of the corncrake but others will not allow farmers to cut a hay crop on the Shannon callows after 15 September each year for many years. I am sure the Minister is fully aware that, given the weather patterns in Ireland, particularly in the west, a farmer could hardly be expected to cut silage after 15 September, never mind hay. It is out of season and the land seems to have been handed over to the environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1442">The Department of Agriculture and Food also had a say but not in this specific scheme, which is why I am delighted the Minister is present. It will be interesting to see how soon he expects the deal to be finalised, and in what circumstances. We are talking about the land owned by the farmers not designated for the corncrake. At recent meetings officials from Dúchas, under the direction of the Minister's Department, seem to have suggested that the payment per hectare will be subject to a ten hectare limit, meaning that more than ten hectares will not qualify for payment. I know what I am talking about and know the area extremely well.</p>
            <p eId="para_1443">I do not want to fudge the specific issue by raising many other issues in the area which are not specifically within the Minister's remit, such as the age-old question of flooding and the draining of the Shannon. There is, however, a huge case to be made for a maintenance programme on the Shannon. There have been several pilot projects and plans over the years but one or two recent reports suggested a pilot project to take the silt out of the Shannon river over a two or three mile stretch on the Clonfert side, to see if it would create more room for the water.</p>
            <p eId="para_1444">I await the Minister's response with open ears.</p>

            <from>Mr. Roche</from>
            <p eId="para_1447">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. The Shannon callows is designated as a special protection area, SPA, for birds under the EU birds directive. The SPA has an area of some 6,000 hectares running through five counties. In former times the corncrake was widespread in Ireland. However, over several decades, a combination of the intensification of farming practices and, in particular, the change from hay-making to silage-cutting, have resulted in the species being left only in the coastal areas of the north and west, and in the more extensively farmed floodplain, or callows, area along the Shannon.</p>
            <p eId="para_1448">However, in the callows, the number of corncrakes has declined greatly over the past 20 years. A prescription for corncrake-friendly farming was drafted using best current practice. This involves late cutting of the meadow and cutting from the inside of the field outward to allow the young to escape.</p>
            <p eId="para_1449">Up to and including 2006, payments to farmers for corncrake-friendly farming in the callows and other areas have mainly been made under a voluntary scheme referred to as the corncrake grant scheme, operated by BirdWatch Ireland with funding from my Department. Last year, landowners in the callows received €102,000 for some 20 pairs of nesting corncrakes, which is expensive nesting. Farmers have also been paid under REPS.</p>
            <p eId="para_1450">In May of this year, the callows flooded and many of the remaining corncrakes were driven off their nests. Because this threatens the total loss of the Shannon callows corncrakes, my Department is funding BirdWatch Ireland to offer payments at especially high levels to farmers who voluntarily undertake late cutting in September. The money offered under the corncrake grant scheme is the highest ever. I hope this will encourage farmers to provide the necessary habitat for the corncrakes to successfully raise this year's young.</p>
            <p eId="para_1451">In the future, compensation will be paid to an individual land owner for actual costs or farming losses incurred, either through the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, as administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food or via the farm plan scheme of my Department. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government's farm plan scheme was launched in February last following agreement with the farming organisations. However, it has not been possible to agree terms for the corncrake prescriptions for the Shannon callows, despite numerous meetings that have taken place between officials from my Department, officials from the Department of Agriculture and Food and farming representatives over recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1452">I regret that it has not yet proved possible to resolve this matter. My Department is maintaining contact with the farming representatives to see how agreement might be reached in the context of the new farm plan scheme.</p>

            <from>Mr. J. Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_1453">Gabhaim buíochas leis an Cheann Comhairle as ucht an ábhar tábhachtach seo a roghnú le haghaidh díospóireachta. The Pallaskenry-Kildimo community in west Limerick comprises approximately 1,200 homes. For 50 years it has had a natural supply of spring water from neighbouring Bleach Lough. Currently, Limerick County Council is attempting to force on the Pallaskenry-Kildimo community a new supply of water from a sometimes heavily polluted source, the River Deal. This means that the supply is heavily chemically treated. Unfortunately, Limerick County Council has resorted to bullying the local community. On Monday this week, a young mother from the community came close to being imprisoned by the High Court. The council adjourned the case until tomorrow and there may be another adjournment until next week. The residents' resolve to protect their natural spring water supply is strong and they will not give up their environmental right in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1454">Why is Limerick County Council pushing this agenda? The arguments do not add up. Limerick County Council said there was a danger that Bleach Lough might be polluted in the future, but the River Deal is polluted. The council said there may not be sufficient water in Bleach Lough for the community in future. I was on the lake ten days ago and there is no sign of a water shortage. There has not been a shortage for 50 years and it is quite clear that, even with additions to the residential community in the area, there is sufficient water for the future. Bleach Lough and the neighbouring lough beside Dromore Castle comprise approximately 100 acres.</p>
            <p eId="para_1455">Local residents feel there is a hidden agenda, about which the county council has not been up-front and honest. The agenda may be to take water from Bleach Lough. The Aughinish Alumina plant, which is a major industrial enterprise, has applied for a major extension which will need massive extra water supplies. Residents have noted in the past that the River Deal water supply goes down in summer time. The council's agenda may be to take water from Bleach Lough to supply Aughinish Alumina with the extra water it requires. If so, why is the council not being up-front and honest with the community? It could sit down and discuss the matter with the community without forcing water from a polluted source on residents or joining up the supplies. There has been no genuine consultation. There was some consultation with neighbouring parishes but not with Pallaskenry-Kildimo.</p>
            <p eId="para_1456">The Kilcornan neighbourhood beside Pallaskenry-Kildimo has had terrible water for many years. The council has attempted to blame the community of Pallaskenry-Kildimo for not allowing the River Deal water in, but that is totally false. I investigated the matter and travelled the route. The council could have supplied Kilcornan with water from Bleach Lough decades ago and could immediately give it water from the River Deal. It is not necessary for the community in Pallaskenry-Kildimo to have this water foisted upon it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1457">I ask the Minister to intervene in this situation. He should ask Limerick County Council to pull back from the course of confrontation on which it seems to be resolutely set. I read in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> today that in another village in County Limerick, Kilfinney, people are spending a fortune on bottled water every week because they cannot drink the local water supply. Why does the county council not give those people water from the River Deal or elsewhere, rather than imposing a supply on a community that does not want it?</p>
            <p eId="para_1458">The county council has said that it will bring the water pipe into the village but will not connect it until a High Court action is heard. Why does the council put itself to all this extra cost when the High Court may order a public consultation and maybe at the end of the day the council will not be allowed to join it up? The pipe may be useless in that case. The arguments do not add up. I do not know what the Minister's officials are telling him but he should ignore their advice. I am asking him to intervene directly in this situation. The Minister knows from what he has heard that the people have an absolutely valid argument.</p>

            <from>Mr. Roche</from>
            <p eId="para_1459">I thank Deputy Joe Higgins for raising this issue. He spoke to me privately about the matter. I am used to being pressed by Deputies about the need to put new water infrastructure in place to improve people's living standards and the economic conditions of communities. The situation described by the Deputy is an unusual one, taken against this background. I am particularly conscious that the dispute in this case has been, and will be again, before the courts. I do not want to say anything that will be regarded in any way as prejudicial. The Deputy has raised the issue, however, and will be aware that the elected members of Limerick County Council, who are closer to the situation than either of us, have formally endorsed the new scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1460">The council is the sanitary authority for the area and the work in this case is being carried out under contract to it. The council is the owner of the water scheme the Deputy has described. This scheme is being funded by the Department on the basis that there is an objective need for the new infrastructure to service new areas, to improve the reliability of the supply to existing consumers and to provide a source for a number of group water schemes that have suffered from substandard water quality for many years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1461">My Department was aware of objections to the decommissioning of the current Bleach Lough source in favour of a new supply. It suggested to Limerick County Council as far back as 2001 that the council should establish what the view of the proposal was on the ground. The consultation meeting referred to by the Deputy was held in November 2002. The Department was supplied with a report about that meeting from Limerick County Council which stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1462">8.6% of the people who attended the public consultation and completed the questionnaires were against changing their water supply source, 34.6% had general or no comments and almost 57% required the new water supply source. In total, over 91% of people either had no comment or were in favour of being provided with a new water source because of difficulties experienced with the reliability of water quality, pressure, etc. of their existing supply.</p>
            <p eId="para_1463">I know that Deputy Joe Higgins has some views on the process and he has mentioned these to me. However, I was told that at least some of those who are currently objecting were at that meeting and people were aware that it was taking place. In that light and in view of the pressing need for additional water capacity to facilitate development in the area, the capacity limitations of the Bleach Lough supply, its vulnerability to pollution, and the position of a number of group water schemes that were suffering from serious water quality problems and needed a new source, my Department confirmed to Limerick County Council in May 2003 that Exchequer funding would be available for the extension of the Shannon estuary scheme to Pallaskenry and Kildimo as planned, approved and requested by the council.</p>
            <p eId="para_1464">There have been references in recent days to the new scheme replacing a community scheme, as if something owned by the community was being taken away from it. In fact, that was my personal understanding until I inquired into the matter. I can now clarify that the existing Bleach Lough scheme is owned, managed and operated by Limerick County Council. It is not a group water scheme. The new Shannon estuary scheme is also owned, managed and operated by Limerick County Council. The water supplied to the local community, whether from Bleach Lough or the Shannon estuary scheme, will be treated to the exact same standards required by the EU drinking water directive. It will be treated by Limerick County Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_1465">I understand that there will, in fact, be a combination of the two sources, at least for the time being, in terms of the local supply. I also understand that other consumers already connected to the Shannon estuary scheme have consistently enjoyed a high quality water supply which has always been compliant with the quality standards. On the other hand, and despite claims that the council is wrong about the vulnerability of the Bleach Lough source to pollution, I am advised — in fact, I specifically raised this issue — that the intake had to be moved some years ago to take it away from a section of the lough.</p>
            <p eId="para_1466">As I said at the outset, this is a local issue and it will have to be resolved at local level. I am not particularly anxious to take sides. However, I am appalled at the idea of anyone being imprisoned over a dispute like this. I urge everybody involved to allow good sense to prevail and to work towards a satisfactory outcome. At the end of the day, this issue will be resolved by dialogue and not by court action. Dialogue is the way forward.</p>

            <p eId="para_1470">As I have already indicated in response to similar Questions in this House, the need for the development of a clear statement on the part of the Government in relation to the Irish language and its importance as a whole has emerged as a key issue in the deliberations of Fóram na Gaeilge thus far and considerable work is in hand in order to further advance this important issue. I hope to be in a position to elaborate further on this matter in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1471">Meaningful and significant advances have continued to be made to further strengthen the position of Irish since the publication of the Gaeltacht Commission's Report in 2002 and the commencement of the implementation of the Official Languages Act. Substantial advances have also been secured regarding the status of Irish in the European Union. A number of new initiatives have been introduced in Gaeltacht areas, including the development of public awareness measures aimed at the Gaeltacht community in particular, as well as the continuing roll out of the language planning initiative. These practical initiatives, as well as further measures being taken in co-operation with Údarás na Gaeltachta, will help to further consolidate the position of Irish as a community language in the Gaeltacht. The Deputies will also appreciate that significant resources continue to be made available to support the work of Foras na Gaeilge in promoting Irish on an all-island basis.</p>

            <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_1489">I propose to take Questions Nos. 55, 171, 178 and 181 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1490">As Deputy Crawford states, the population included in the extended CLÁR Programme has almost doubled. However, I would like to assure him that there has, in fact, been a corresponding pro-rata increase in funding for the Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1491">The provision for the original Programme in the 2006 Abridged Book of Estimates was nearly €14m. This equates to an average provision of over €1m per month in the full year. I announced the extended areas in April 2006 and the additional funding of €9m that I secured allows for a similar level of investment in the extended areas for the remaining 8 months of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1492">The breakdown of the €22.95m available for the Programme in 2006 under the various headings and expenditure to date (approx. €3.35m) under the Programme on a county basis are detailed in Tables A and B respectively. I am confident that a comprehensive work programme will be completed in all the areas included in the Programme from the funding available this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1493">No specific allocations are made to community groups from each year's Estimates provision for the Programme. Measures under the Programme with a particular community emphasis are — Sports Capital Top-up Grants; Gaeltacht Sport and Community Top-up Grants; Village and Countryside Enhancement Scheme; Bi-lingual Signage Scheme and Community Initiatives of a Capital Nature. These measures are, in the main, demand-led and projects are approved for CLÁR funding on the recommendation of the relevant Departments, State agencies or LEADER groups. With the exception of the Sports Capital Grants for 2006, communities in the extended CLÁR areas can benefit immediately under these measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1494">In relation to LEADER funding being allocated to projects eligible for CLÁR funding, this is primarily a matter for each LEADER Company. I have already made additional funding available to LEADER companies, over the allocation in the NDP. Consideration will be given to allocating further funding available to LEADER companies as the year progresses.</p>

            <p eId="para_1556">I refer the Deputy to my replies to Questions Numbers 105, 342 and 343 of 16th May 2006 in relation to spending to date from the Dormant Accounts Fund. Disbursements from the Fund in 2004 amounted to €14 million. In 2005 disbursements from the Fund were €14.4 million and €7 million has been paid during 2006 to date. It is anticipated that during the remainder of 2006 further significant amounts will be disbursed from the Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_1557">It is difficult to say what the expected future expenditure from the Fund will be on an annual basis. The Deputy will be aware that actual expenditure on funding programmes, such as dormant accounts, does not mirror grant approvals. The drawdown of funding by successful organisations is subject to individual groups satisfying specific contract conditions. In this regard payments are normally made on a phased as groups satisfy contract conditions and provide ongoing verification in relation to project progress.</p>

            <p eId="para_1561">The main contact between Local Drugs Task Forces, and projects developed under their aegis, with third level institutions is through engagement by projects with those institutions to facilitate the development of an appropriate range of education and training courses. Among these are addiction studies courses that are accredited by the National University of Ireland. Many Task Forces also provide education bursaries, either directly or through their projects, for individuals to access training and further education. Local Drugs Task Forces, again through projects, have also facilitated the commissioning of research that has been undertaken in conjunction with third level institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1562">The Regional Drugs Task Forces undertook a broad open consultation process when developing their strategies. Furthermore, the Western Regional Drugs Task Force has outlined a pilot project to provide partial funding for counselling supports in regional third level institutions as part of their Action Plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1563">The actions outlined in the National Drugs Strategy pertaining to the education system generally have been progressed with the significant input of the Department of Education and Science.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1565">I have not had discussions with the Michael McDowell, T.D., Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform specifically on the "Drugs and Crime in Ireland" report published in late May by the Health Research Board. However, it should be noted that this report was discussed at some length at the meetings of the Consequences Sub-committee of the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, on which officials of our respective Departments sit. Moreover, I am confident that any issues arising from the report will be tackled with the on-going co-operation of both our Departments through the structures of the National Drugs Strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1566">The report states that it cannot be said conclusively through the data currently available whether most drug users do not commit crimes other than those of possession. After considering the matter at some length, the report concludes that the link between drugs and crime is an issue that needs further examination.</p>
            <p eId="para_1567">The report highlights that, while drug possession offences account for most drug offences recorded, the exact link between drug misuse and crime figures as a whole is not readily identifiable. While An Garda Síochána compile statistics for drug offences such as possession or intention to supply, they are not in a position to register crimes committed by offenders while on drugs, or for the purpose of facilitating the purchase of drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1568">Irish research was considered in the report through the application of four principal explanatory models — the psycho-pharmacological, the economic-compulsive, the systemic and the common-cause models. The first three models make a direct link between drug use and offending behaviour, while the fourth suggests that the relationship between drugs and crime is less clear. These models throw up contradictory results meaning that careful consideration is needed before making a definitive affirmation on the subject.</p>
            <p eId="para_1569">Taking all this into account, I do not think that we are in a position yet to conclusively measure the role drugs play in the overall crime figures. As indicated in the report, further research on the matter would be required before we can make such conclusions.</p>

     <b>Mr. Naughten</b>
      asked the 
     <b>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</b>
     his views on the opinions expressed recently by the Western Development Commission that the gap between east and west continues to grow; the measures his Department intends to take to address this problem; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_1571">I presume the Deputy is referring to the recent submission made by the Western Development Commission (WDC) to the Department of Finance with regard to the National Development Plan (NDP) for the period 2007-2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_1572">Notwithstanding the WDC's comments, data from the Central Statistics Office and other sources suggests that the income gap between the BMW and the Southern and Eastern (S&amp;E) regions is, in fact, closing. For example, the gap of 11.02% in 2002 has narrowed from 12% in 2001 and 13.4% in 2000. Furthermore, differentials in the cost of living and housing between the regions would suggest that the gap in living standards between the regions is considerably narrower than the data for disposable incomes suggests.</p>
            <p eId="para_1573">Convergence between the two regions has also occurred in respect to employment. Between the end of 2000 and the end of 2005, the number employed increased by 20% in the BMW region compared to 13% in the S&amp;E region. In addition, the labour force grew by 19% in the BMW region compared to 14% for the S&amp;E region and the participation rate grew by 6% compared to 3% in the S&amp;E region.</p>
            <p eId="para_1574">The BMW region has also benefited significantly in terms of infrastructural investment. Up to December 2005, €1.5 billion had been invested in National Roads in the region. Major projects have included the Kinnegad by-pass, the Carrickmacross by-pass, the Ballina/Bohola, the Sligo Inner Relief road, the N5 Strokestown/Longford, the Boyle/Carrick-on-Shannon, and the Ballyshannon/Bundoran. Major road projects under construction or due to begin construction in the Region in 2006 include Kinnegad/Athlone, Monaghan By-Pass, Castleblayney By-Pass, Dromod/Roosky, the Edgeworthstown By-Pass and the Charlestown By-Pass.</p>
            <p eId="para_1575">In addition more than 26,000 kilometres of non-national roads have been improved, restored or maintained with a total investment of €1.1 billion up to December 2005 in the Region.</p>
            <p eId="para_1576">Transport 21 announced by the Government late last year is also important in this regard. The Plan, worth €34bn over the period, will build upon the investment made in the current NDP and for the BMW region includes significant investment in developing the Atlantic Corridor road network running from Letterkenny through Sligo, Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford and the re-opening on a phased basis of the Western Rail Corridor, the development of Galway commuter rail services, QBC development for Galway and the extension of the Rural Transport Initiative over the life of the investment plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1577">In terms of my own Department, we will continue to promote and maintain living and working populations in rural areas by helping to foster sustainable and culturally vibrant communities there. In that context, my Department's rural development initiatives include:</p>
            <p eId="para_1578">•the continued implementation of the Clár and LEADER Programmes and the Rural Social Scheme;</p>
            <p eId="para_1579">•advancing the work of Comhairle Na Tuaithe;</p>
            <p eId="para_1580">•working in close co-operation with the Department of Agriculture and Food and the EU Commission in the negotiations on the adoption of the draft EU Regulation on Rural Development for the period 2007-2013;</p>
            <p eId="para_1581">•supporting projects under the Rural Development Fund;</p>
            <p eId="para_1582">•continuation of cross-border co-operation in rural development;</p>
            <p eId="para_1583">•participation as appropriate in inter-departmental committees on issues appropriate to rural development, such as the National Spatial Strategy; and</p>
            <p eId="para_1584">•continued support for the Western Development Commission in the discharge of its functions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1585">•Development of Waterways Ireland</p>
            <p eId="para_1586">•Investment in Gaeltacht and islands</p>
            <p eId="para_1587">I am confident that through the work that is on-going in my own Department and across other areas that the gap between the two regions will continue to close in the coming years.</p>

            <p eId="para_1665">I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 71 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1666">My Department has overall responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008. This Strategy contains 108 individual actions, under the four original pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research, with rehabilitation added as a fifth pillar. The various actions fall to be implemented by a range of Departments and Agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1667">The Deputy will be aware that the National Alcohol Policy is the responsibility of the Tánaiste, Mary Harney T.D., Minister for Health and Children, who is pursuing a number of initiatives in this area. The National Drugs Strategy calls for increased links between both policies in terms of cross-representation on the relevant committees and working groups to ensure complementarity between the different measures being taken. This is being done on an on-going basis. Also, the intertwining of the use alcohol and drugs is acknowledged in the context of polydrug use generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1668">There are no plans at present to merge the alcohol and drugs policies. This could involve a broadly common approach to tackling issues around legal and illegal substances where different policy responses may be required. However, this issue was raised previously during the consultation process of the Mid-Term Review of the National Drugs Strategy and there is scope for reviewing the situation as it evolves.</p>

            <p eId="para_1693">The current year's allocation to my Department for expenditure on Drugs Initiatives and the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund is €43m which represents a substantial 37% increase on the 2005 initial allocation and an increase of 61% on the 2004 figure. These figures emphasise that tackling the drug problem is a key Government priority and that it will remain so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1694">Local Drugs Task Forces (LDTFs) are well established and are now implementing the second round of Action Plans at an annual cost in excess of €16m. Since 1997, nearly €125m has been allocated to support this work across the 14 LDTF areas. Over 400 community-based projects have been established, employing more than 300 staff, and delivering services such as advice and support for drug misusers and their families, community drug teams offering treatment, outreach and crisis intervention services and drug training programmes for community groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_1695">Twelve of the 14 Local Drugs Task Forces are located in Dublin, with the others in Bray and Cork. Ten Regional Drugs Task Forces (RDTFs) have been established in the areas not covered by Local Drugs Task Forces. Thus a Drugs Task Force now services all parts of the country with consequential support for community based groups. The Action Plans drawn up by the RDTFs have been approved and funding has been allocated to facilitate their implementation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1696">Additionally, under the Emerging Needs Fund, which was devised to provide a flexible and timely response to evolving needs in regard to drug misuse in Local Drugs Task Force areas, I recently announced the approval of €2.27m for 39 projects, bringing the total approved to date from this Fund to just over €3.1m.</p>
            <p eId="para_1697">The Young People's Facilities and Services Fund was established in 1998 to assist the development of youth facilities (including sport and recreational facilities) and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists, or has the potential to develop. I was pleased to announce further allocations of €1.5m for eight projects this week under the Fund. This announcement of projects in Waterford, Dún Laoghaire area, Blanchardstown and Tallaght brings the total commitment from the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund to over €103m since its establishment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1698">Overall I am satisfied that the implementation of the LDTF and RDTF Action Plans, along with the range of additional funding initiatives available, represents a comprehensive range of support to community based groups involved in combating the problems of drugs misuse.</p>

            <p eId="para_1700">The National Advisory Committee on Drugs and the Drug and Alcohol Information and Research Unit (Northern Ireland) commissioned the first Drug Prevalence Survey in 2002/2003, the purpose of which was to establish the population prevalence of drug use on the island of Ireland. This study surveyed over 8,000 people aged 15-64 in Ireland and Northern Ireland between October 2002 and April 2003 and examined the prevalence of a number of drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1701">That work provided us for the first time with robust statistical information on the prevalence of drug use in the general population. It covered any lifetime use of drugs by respondents, as well as more recent use in the previous year and month.

            <p eId="para_1702">It is intended that the Drug Prevalence Study fieldwork will be carried out from late 2006 to mid 2007. Preliminary analysis will be done in the months following, with a first report of national prevalence figures and trends expected in late 2007.</p>

One of the key goals of my Department is to promote and maintain living and working populations in rural areas by helping to foster sustainable and culturally vibrant communities there. Implicit in this statement is the recognition, now widely accepted, that farming alone cannot sustain the rural economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1710">The Mid-Term Review of the National Drugs Strategy was published in June 2005. This report was the culmination of a comprehensive review, which included extensive consultation with Government Departments and agencies, the community &amp; voluntary sectors and the public in general.</p>
            <p eId="para_1711">The review was overseen by a Steering Group, chaired by my Department, and made up of representatives of the relevant participants in the National Drugs Strategy, including representatives from the community and voluntary sectors. The Steering Group found that the current aims and objectives of the Drugs Strategy are fundamentally sound. It was confirmed that there are encouraging signs of progress since 2001, when the Strategy was first launched, suggesting that our approach to tackling the drug problem is proving to be effective. At the same time, however, the review highlights the need to re-focus some priorities and to accelerate the roll-out and implementation of various key actions in the remaining period of the Strategy up to 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1712">The actions outlined in the National Drugs Strategy are being progressed with the significant input of other Government Departments and agencies — e.g. the Health Services Executive, Dept Health &amp; Children, Dept Education &amp; Science, Dept Justice, Equality &amp; Law Reform, An Garda Síochána, the Irish Prisons Service, the Customs Service of the Revenue Commissioners and FÁS — as well as the community and voluntary sectors. All these parties are playing important roles in the implementation of the overall Strategy. The structures put in place under the Strategy facilitate the sorting out of any issues that arise in relation to ongoing implementation, the identification of any emerging changes in the nature of the drugs problems facing us and the formulation of responses to such changes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1713">The National Drugs Strategy runs to the end of 2008. It is envisaged that a further comprehensive review will take place at that stage prior to the formulation of the next phase of Ireland's drugs strategy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1727">My Department, with the support of Pobal, has overall responsibility for the co-ordination of the RAPID programme. It is a matter for each Department to respond to recommendations in respect to their area of responsibility. The Deputy will be aware that Pobal commissioned an evaluation of the RAPID programme with the support of my Department. The Programme aims to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within the 45 designated RAPID areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1728">The final report of the evaluators was launched on 1 June last. The report indicates that the experience of the RAPID Programme has been very positive in many areas and the evaluators have concluded that the Programme has made substantial progress in identifying the needs of disadvantaged communities and in implementing important local projects in response to those needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1729">The evaluation highlights a weakness in strategic planning and project implementation in some RAPID areas. This has resulted in an ad hoc and reactive approach to developing projects and, in the view of the evaluators, makes it difficult to establish a holistic view of the needs of these areas. The evaluators make a number of recommendations to address this weakness and other issues. The report also highlights some gaps in terms of additional local investment needs for education, training and employment which it states are due, in part, to a lack of leverage funding for education related projects and a lack of planning at national level with regard to employer education programmes and the facilitation at local level of initiatives aimed at promoting employment and training within the community. The evaluators recommend enhanced monitoring structures, the adoption of annual work programmes, and improved corporate and business planning in agencies to prioritise RAPID areas for investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1730">I will be considering all evaluation findings and recommendations set out in the Report. Because some of the recommendations relate to areas outside the remit of my Department, I will be working with other Departments and agencies over the coming months in determining appropriate responses.</p>

            <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_1758">I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 180 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1759">As the Deputies are aware, the Rural Social Scheme (RSS) was established to provide income support for low income farmers and fisher persons who are in receipt of long-term social welfare payments, as well as providing essential services to their communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1760">There are currently 2,299 participants on the RSS, of whom 658 are from the Southern and Eastern (S&amp;E) region. In addition, there are 33 supervisors employed in the S&amp;E region and 79 in the BMW region. While the numbers on the Scheme in the BMW region are higher, this tends to reflect the higher numbers of people on farm assist in that region compared to the S&amp;E region.</p>
            <p eId="para_1761">I am pleased that the number of participants in the S&amp;E region and, indeed the BMW region, has increased considerably in the last month or so. I believe that this is due, to some extent at least, to the recent changes that I have made to the Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1762">As part of the changes, the categories of people eligible to participate in the Scheme have been extended and now include:</p>
            <p eId="para_1763">•children/siblings of qualifying herd owners;</p>
            <p eId="para_1764">•recipients of One-Parent and Widow(ers) payments with a herd number; and</p>
            <p eId="para_1765">•adult dependents of non-contributory old age pensioners, who themselves are under 66, and have a herd number.</p>
            <p eId="para_1766">The recent changes also include the removal of the tapering of the adult dependent payments in respect of qualified adults and replacing this with a full qualified payment where earnings are below the upper threshold of €250 p.w.</p>
            <p eId="para_1767">In addition, participants on the Scheme are no longer prohibited from undertaking any other form of paid work. A wide variety of valuable work is being undertaken under the RSS, including:</p>
            <p eId="para_1768">•Projects relating to maintenance and enhancement of waymarked ways, agreed walks, bog roads etc;</p>
            <p eId="para_1769">•Energy conservation work for the elderly and the less well off;</p>
            <p eId="para_1770">•Village and countryside enhancement projects;</p>
            <p eId="para_1771">•Environmental maintenance works — maintenance and caretaking of community and sporting facilities;</p>
            <p eId="para_1772">•Projects relating to not for profit cultural and heritage centres; and</p>
            <p eId="para_1773">•Social care and care of the elderly, community after-school support groups and community pre-schooling support groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_1774">Funding of €43.322m has been provided in my Department's Estimates for the Programme in the current year, which represents an increase of 70% over 2005 expenditure. Going forward, I can assure the Deputies that I will continue to closely monitor the number of participants on the Scheme and its on-going funding requirements.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1776">As I advised the Deputy in answer to Question 111 recently, the Young Peoples Facilities &amp; Services Fund was established in 1998 to assist in the development of facilities (including sport and recreational facilities) and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem existed or had the potential to develop.</p>
            <p eId="para_1777">To date, the focus of the Fund has been in the 14 Local Drugs Task Force areas (12 in Dublin and the others in Bray and Cork City) which were established in the areas experiencing the worst levels of drug misuse, particularly misuse of heroin, as well as on four other urban centres, Limerick, Waterford, Galway and Carlow. In the intervening years approximately €103 million has been allocated to support over 450 facility and services projects in these locations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1778">The possibility of expanding the number of urban areas that are eligible for funding from Young Peoples Facilities &amp; Services Fund may fall to be considered in the coming period. Any decision in that regard would be based on evidence of a significant existing drug problem in a particular centre, or the potential for a drug problem to develop there. I cannot say at this point whether Clonmel would qualify for inclusion under the Young Peoples Facilities &amp; Services in such circumstances.</p>

            <p eId="para_1850">The Government is fully committed to significant additional investment in cancer control based on the reform programme now being implemented by the HSE. Additional investment will be addressed from within the annual financial allocation approved by Government commencing in 2007. To this end, I have asked the HSE to prepare a robust needs assessment for cancer control for the next five years to reflect priorities in cancer control, equitable distribution and priority setting that maximises efficiency and reduces dependancy on hospital in-patient care.</p>
            <p eId="para_1851">The HSE has announced the establishment of a National Cancer Control Programme to implement the new Strategy, details of which will be outlined by the Executive over the coming weeks.

It will be led by a National Programme Director and will host a single national budget for all cancer control activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1852">Since the implementation of the National Cancer Strategy commenced in 1997, approximately €920 million has been invested in the development of cancer services. The Vote for the Health Service Executive in 2006 includes a sum of €9 million to continue to meet the additional service pressures in cancer care, improve the quality of care, facilitate better access to radiation oncology services and to continue the preparation for the national cervical screening programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_1906">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for tax relief on certain health expenses incurred by a taxpayer in respect of the provision of health care for him or herself and/or his or her qualifying dependants. However, the relief is only available to the extent that tax has been paid. For example, if a person makes a claim for relief for net health expenses of €800 but has only paid €400 in tax in the year to which the claim relates, then the extent of the tax relief in respect of the claim can be no more than €400.</p>
            <p eId="para_1907">Expenditure incurred on routine dental treatment (meaning the extraction, scaling and filling of teeth and the provision and repairing of artificial teeth or dentures) does not qualify for tax relief.</p>

            <p eId="para_1921">Relief cannot be claimed for any expenditure, which has been or will be reimbursed by a medical insurer. In addition, tax relief is not due in respect of the first €125 of any medical expenses incurred in any tax year. In the case of an individual claiming relief in respect of two or more persons, the first €250 is not allowable.</p>

            <p eId="para_1929">For the purpose of Gift and Inheritance Tax, the relationship between the person who provided the gift or inheritance (the disponer) and the person who received the gift or inheritance (the beneficiary), determines the maximum tax-free threshold — known as the "Group threshold". Apart from the total exemption of transfers between spouses, there are three Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer and these Group thresholds are indexed annually by reference to the Consumer Price Index as published by the Central Statistics Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_1930">The indexed Group thresholds for 2006 are as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1931">Group A: €478,155. This applies to gifts/inheritances received by a child, a step-child and a foster child from a parent. Group A also applies in certain circumstances to gifts/inheritances received by a parent from a child and by a grandchild from a grandparent.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1932">Group B: €47,815. This applies to gifts/inheritances received by brothers, sisters, nephews, nieces, grandchildren and parents.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1933">Group C: €23,908. This applies to gifts/inheritances received by a beneficiary who does not come under Group A or B.</p>
            <p eId="para_1934">Any prior gifts or inheritances received by a beneficiary since 5 December 1991 from within the same Group threshold are taken into account when calculating whether gift/inheritance tax is payable on the current gift/inheritance. A niece or nephew who receives a gift or inheritance is entitled to the Group A threshold of €478,155 provided certain conditions are fulfilled. These conditions are that the niece or nephew has worked substantially on a full-time basis for the disponer in the 5 years ending on the date of the gift/inheritance in carrying on the business of the disponer and the gift/inheritance consists of property, which was used in connection with the business.</p>
            <p eId="para_1935">However, under Section 151 of the Finance Act 2000, an exemption from gift/inheritance tax is available for certain dwelling houses. The purpose of this exemption is to benefit individuals who had been living in a house for a period prior to taking the benefit, either by way of gift or inheritance. The main conditions attaching to the exemption are that the beneficiary of the dwelling house must have resided in the house for a minimum of 3 years prior to the gift or inheritance and must not have had an interest in any other dwelling house. In addition, the beneficiary must continue to occupy that dwelling house as his or her only or main residence for a period of 6 years commencing on the date of the gift/inheritance. This exemption ensures that what may be the family home for many people will not be the subject of gift or inheritance tax when it is transferred.</p>

     the circumstances in which co-ordinated pensions apply in relation to the pension schemes of State sponsored bodies; the rules governing portability of pensions between State sponsored bodies and public service bodies such as the armed services and State sponsored bodies; and if he plans to relax any of these rules.

            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1937">While pension scheme terms for State bodies are a matter for the State bodies, subject to the approval of the Minister and the consent of the Minister for Finance, the general policy is that co-ordination applies in the case of public servants who are fully covered for Pay-Related Social Insurance (PRSI). As a result of a Government decision that all public servants appointed on or after 6 April 1995 should be in full PRSI class, co-ordinated pensions apply to those public servants.</p>
            <p eId="para_1938">Portability of pensions between State sponsored bodies and public service bodies, including the armed forces, is provided for under arrangements known as the Public Sector Transfer Network. Persons who move from one member organisation to another may transfer their pensionable service to their new employment for superannuation purposes, subject to certain conditions. Membership of the Transfer Network is voluntary and organisations opting to join are designated by the Minister for Finance under Section 4(1) of the Superannuation and Pensions Act 1963.</p>
            <p eId="para_1939">The provisions of the scheme are quite lengthy and the following is a brief summary:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1940">The scheme provides that a person employed in a member organisation who had earlier service in another member organisation may transfer that earlier service to their current employment for superannuation purposes. At the request of the individual, the current employer arranges the transfer of the service with the previous employer. There are certain conditions which must be met before the transfer is allowed. Among these are:</p>
            <p eId="para_1941">•the service in question must have been pensionable service at the time it was given or, if not pensionable at that time, could subsequently be made pensionable;</p>
            <p eId="para_1942">•any refund of contributions or other superannuation lump sum payment given in respect of the service must be repaid with compound interest;</p>
            <p eId="para_1943">•all of the service in the earlier organisation must be transferred;</p>
            <p eId="para_1944">•a transfer is not allowed where it would involve dual credit for the period in question;</p>
            <p eId="para_1945">•transfer is precluded if a pension has already been paid in respect of the service. (Note: this point is particularly relevant in the case of personnel who retire from the Defence Forces and who subsequently take up employment with a Network organisation.)</p>
            <p eId="para_1946">I am satisfied that the Public Service Transfer Network operates to the benefit of employees of those public sector bodies which are members of the Network. I have no plans to amend the rules under which the Network operates.</p>

HRI have also made representations that, as it is the intention that all-weather floodlit horse racing would commence at Dundalk during 2007, they would, in the financial interest of horse racing, favour betting offices being allowed to open during the hours when such fixtures are being held. Any decisions on these issues will be made in the context of next year's Budget and Finance Bill.</p>

Instead, it is the purchasers of the individual units and apartments let to students who may claim tax relief. Relief is, however, conditional on a particular development meeting various conditions set out in guidelines published by the Department of Education and Science. These conditions include requirements in relation to design, layout and minimum facilities. They also require that a development must be certified by an approved third level institution and be situated within 8 kilometres of that certifying institution.

            <p eId="para_2114">Duncannon Pier is owned by Wexford County Council and responsibility for its repair and maintenance rests with the local authority in the first instance. In 2003 Wexford County Council submitted a proposal to the Department for an extension of the existing pier, dredging and reclamation works and the provision of ancillary services at an estimated cost of €2.5 million. There has been no funding available for this project to date. The question of providing funding for Duncannon Pier in the post-2006 period will be considered in the context of the amount of Exchequer funding available for works at fishery harbours generally and overall national priorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2115">I should point out that the funding available to the Department under the Port Infrastructure Improvement Programme of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 is directed at projects that improve infrastructure and facilities (including ice plants, landing and storage facilities) at key strategic fishery harbours and the construction and improvement of berthage and related facilities at smaller harbours and landing places, with a key role in maintaining jobs in fishing, aquaculture and ancillary activities.</p>

This order was renewed for a further six months in November, but reduced to four months on review in December 2005. On 20 March 2006, the detention was renewed until 20 July. An appeal against the renewal was turned down on 10 May.</p>
            <p eId="para_2152">The Government, and our EU partners, are very concerned about the practice of administrative detention in Israel and the Occupied Territories. We are working to ensure that these concerns are addressed in the EU's continuing political dialogue with Israel. Most recently, our concerns about administrative detention were raised at the meeting of the EU-Israel Association Council which took place in Luxembourg yesterday. In direct contacts with Israel, and in cooperation with its EU partners, the Government continues to raise its concerns about the human rights implications of Israeli security policies and the need to ensure full compliance with international law.</p>

While the development of professional football is a matter for the Eircom league and the FAI itself, my Department has been active in providing grants under the sports capital programme to Eircom league clubs to assist with improvements to league grounds. In the period 1998 to 2002, over €11.4 million has been allocated in funding to seventeen Eircom league clubs of which about €10 million of this amount has been paid out to date. Following the advent of club licensing in 2004, which aims to improve standards across all aspects of the Eircom league, I announced further funding in 2005 of €5.275 million in respect of sixteen Eircom league clubs.</p>

            <p eId="para_2168">On 21 December 2005, the European Commission adopted new Regional Aid Guidelines for 2007-2013. The Regional Aid Guidelines govern the areas in which Member States may grant regional aid, more commonly known as investment aid. Investment aid is intended to promote the economic development of certain disadvantaged areas within the European Union in order to redress regional disparities. The Guidelines specify rules for the selection of regions that are eligible for regional aid and define the maximum permitted levels of this aid. In line with EU cohesion policy and European Council requests for less and better targeted state aid, the new Guidelines re-focus regional aid on the most deprived regions of the enlarged Union.</p>
            <p eId="para_2169">Given Ireland's economic performance since the current Regional Aid Map was approved by the European Commission in 1999, it was to be expected that our scope to designate areas for regional aid for 2007-2013 would be significantly reduced. Nevertheless, Ireland has secured entitlement under the new Guidelines to maintain regional aid qualification for areas accounting for 50% of the country's population for the period 2007-2013. The BMW Region qualifies automatically as a result of its level of economic development. The South East sub-region also qualifies automatically for designation on the basis of unemployment criteria specified in the Guidelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_2170">The remaining areas that may qualify for designation for 2007-2013, within the permitted 50% population threshold, must meet the strict requirement in the Guidelines that they are relatively more in need of economic development than other areas on the basis of recognised economic indicators. The Southern &amp; Eastern Regional Assembly was consulted by my Department in relation to this designation. To ensure that the most deserving regions are designated in line with the Guidelines, Member States have to submit their proposals for designation to the European Commission for approval. Details of the Regional Aid Map for 2007-2013 will be published following approval by the Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_2171">Any area no longer entitled to Regional Aid will continue to qualify for other forms of State aid, including SME Aid, Aid for Research and Development, Training Aid, Employment Aid and Aid for Environmental Protection, which will continue to be available in all areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_2220">Under the Pensions Act the Pensions Ombudsman has the power to investigate and determine; complaints made by or on behalf of beneficiaries of occupational pension schemes or Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) who allege that they have suffered financial loss as a result of maladministration by those charged with managing these arrangements; any dispute of fact or law brought to his attention that arises from the actions of those administering occupational pension schemes or PRSAs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2221">The Pensions Ombudsman is able to give such directions as he considers necessary or expedient to resolve a dispute. His directions can include a financial settlement to cover the actual financial losses incurred by the person making the complaint.

            <p eId="para_2223">The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support to people who are providing certain elderly or incapacitated persons with full time care and attention and whose incomes fall below a certain limit.</p>
            <p eId="para_2224">The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one weekly social welfare payment is payable to an individual. Persons qualifying for two social welfare payments always receive the higher payment to which they are entitled.</p>
            <p eId="para_2225">In Budget 2006, I provided for a significant increase in the rate of carer's allowance. From January this year, the rate of carer's allowance increased to EUR200 per week for carers aged 66 years and over. This rate of payment would be higher in many instances than the rate of old age pension or qualified adult allowance payable to a person.</p>
            <p eId="para_2226">In addition, from June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care regardless of their income. Those persons in receipt of other social welfare payments, excluding unemployment assistance and benefit, are entitled to this payment subject to meeting the full time care condition. This arrangement was introduced to acknowledge the needs of carers especially in relation to respite. Provision was made in Budget 2006 to increase the amount of the respite care grant from EUR1,000 to EUR1,200 from this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_2227">I am always prepared to consider changes to existing arrangements where these are for the benefit of recipients and financially sustainable within the resources available to me. Those recommendations involving additional expenditure can only be considered in a budgetary context.</p>

            <p eId="para_2241">Child dependant allowances are paid in addition to weekly social welfare payments in respect of over 256,700 children at full rate and almost 84,500 at half rate. The rate of child dependant allowance was last increased in 1994. The current rates of payment are EUR16.80, EUR19.30 and EUR21.60. The following appendix shows the rates of child dependant allowance for each scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2242">The policy direction followed by successive Governments has been to concentrate resources for child income support on the child benefit scheme rather than child dependant allowances, as the loss of child dependant allowances by social welfare recipients on taking up employment can act as a disincentive to availing of work opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2243">Over the period since 1994, the monthly rates of child benefit have increased by EUR124.61 at the lower rate and EUR155.80 at the higher rate, increases of 390.7% and 433.5% respectively, while inflation increased by 42%. Over the same period the personal rate of the lowest weekly social welfare payment has increased from EUR78.79 to EUR165.80, an increase of110.4%. From April 2006, child benefit rates are EUR150 per month for each of the first two children and EUR185 per month for the third and each subsequent child. At the end of May 2006 child benefit was in payment to over 556,000 families in respect of approximately 1,076,000 children.</p>
            <p eId="para_2244">In addition, my Department provides cash support by way of weekly payments to families at work on low pay, through the family income supplement scheme. A number of improvements have been made to the scheme over the years, including assessment of entitlement on the basis of net rather than gross income and progressive increases in the income thresholds, making it easier for lower income households and larger families to qualify for payment. As a result, there are currently 18,647 families receiving a weekly FIS payment, reaching approximately 35,000 children.</p>
            <p eId="para_2245">Over the last decade, some 250,000 people (including 100,000 children) have been lifted out of poverty. Child poverty is clearly a complex area requiring coordinated action across a range of government services and income support payments and the Government is committed to taking further appropriate measures to address this issue.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_2280">As the Deputy is aware, the Report of the Steering Group on the Mid-term Review of the National Drugs Strategy was published in June 2005. The review sought to assess the impact and direction of the Strategy at this mid-point stage and, in this regard, the Group concentrated on identifying any necessary adjustments to the existing Strategy and on highlighting priorities for the second phase up to 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2281">In overall terms, ten of the Strategy's existing actions were replaced, a further seven of the existing actions are being amended and there are eight new actions which aim to address issues such as family support and rehabilitation. In terms of progress, the review found that: 49 of the original 100 actions outlined in the Strategy are completed or of an on-going nature; progress was on-going on a further 45; and there were 6 actions on which considerable progress has to be made. Of these six, actions 61 (relating to respite facilities and halfway houses) and 72 (drugs training for professionals) are of a long-term nature and work is continuing on their advancement. The other four actions in this category are action 11 dealing with Community Policing Fora; action 23 on the prison strategy in relation to drugs: action 63 relating to a pilot community pharmacy needle and syringe exchange programme and action 77 on meetings with the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2282">Prompted by action 11, Community Policing Fora have been piloted in a number of areas and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has now forwarded a copy of the Community Policing For a Guidelines to the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights and informed the Committee that he intends to issue the guidelines on 16 June, thereby enabling further committees to be established.</p>
            <p eId="para_2283">In relation to action 23, a new Irish Prisons Service Drugs Policy and Strategy, "Keeping Drugs out of Prisons" was launched in May and its implementation is beginning. Regarding action 63, the health services are prioritising the expansion of needle exchange and other harm reduction services over the remaining timeframe of the Strategy. An additional €3 million was provided for this in 2006. In relation to action 77, I am happy to attend before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to discuss the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy whenever this is suitable to the Committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_2284">Finally, the Strategy will continue to be monitored through the Inter-Departmental Group on Drugs (IDG), which I chair, and through the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion. The IDG meets quarterly to assess progress by Departments and Agencies in achieving the targets set for them and any obstacle to the implementation of the Strategy are brought to light and discussed at these meetings. Furthermore, reports on the implementation of the Strategy are presented to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion on the periodic basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_2304">It is difficult to give a categoric response to this question in view of the broad range of supports to communities provided by my Department and the unspecific nature of the question. One example of my Department's support for communities attempting to counter the effects of anti-social behaviour is the RAPID Leverage Funds scheme. Specifically, these funds support projects aimed at housing estate enhancement, traffic calming measures, and community CCTV. If the Deputy has a specific matter in mind, I am happy to provide assistance.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_2341">I propose to take Questions Nos. 173 to 175, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2342">My Department has overall responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008. The setting up of treatment programmes is a matter for the Health Services Executive and the Tánaiste Mary Harney, T.D, Minister for Health and Children. The current year's allocation to my Department for expenditure on Drugs Initiatives and the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund is €43m which represents a substantial 37% increase on the 2005 initial allocation and an increase of 61% on the 2004 figure. These figures emphasise that tackling the drug problem is a key Government priority and that it will remain so.</p>
            <p eId="para_2343">Local Drugs Task Forces (LDTFs) are well established and are now implementing the second round of Action Plans at an annual cost in excess of €16m. Since 1997, nearly €125m has been allocated to support this work across the 14 LDTF areas. Over 400 community-based projects have been established, employing more than 300 staff. These projects deliver services such as community drug treatment programmes as well as advice and support for drug misusers and their families, outreach and crisis intervention services and drug training programmes for community groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_2344">Twelve of the 14 Local Drugs Task Forces are located in Dublin, with the others in Bray and Cork. Ten Regional Drugs Task Forces (RDTFs) have been established in the areas not covered by Local Drugs Task Forces. Thus a Drugs Task Force now services all parts of the country with consequential support for community based groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_2345">Additionally, under the Emerging Needs Fund, which was devised to provide a flexible and timely response to evolving needs in regard to drug misuse in Local Drugs Task Force areas, I recently announced the approval of €2.27m for 39 projects, including a number of initiatives to support treatment/rehabilitation programmes in Local Drugs Task Force communities. I also was pleased to announce further allocations of €1.5m for eight projects this week under the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund. This announcement of projects in Waterford, Dún Laoghaire area, Blanchardstown and Tallaght brings the total commitment from the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund to over €103m since its establishment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2346">Overall I am satisfied that the funding now available facilitates the provision of a comprehensive range of drug treatment interventions including supports for such work by community based groups.</p>

            <p eId="para_2361">The views expressed in the correspondence referred to represent one of a range of perspectives put forward by stakeholders to my Department concerning regulation of the veterinary medicines market in Ireland. Some stakeholders would prefer a more restrictive approach to that outlined in the document while others have urged a more liberal regime.</p>
            <p eId="para_2362">I do not accept that the Animal Remedies Regulations which I signed into law last November in order to transpose EU Directive 2004/28 are anti-competitive. These regulations provide for a number of innovations, including a requirement for mandatory written veterinary prescriptions and identifying alternative treatments on prescriptions, designed, inter alia, to foster competition in the marketplace, thus giving farmers greater choice as to where they source their supplies of prescription medicines. I have also extended the range of retail outlets to include Licensed Merchants which can, from 1 January 2007, supply a limited range of ‘prescription only' veterinary medicines on the basis of a veterinary prescription. I do not intend to modify this latter measure as proposed in the document referred to by the Deputy, as I believe that it would reduce competition, without any concomitant improvement in the protection of public or animal health and welfare.</p>
            <p eId="para_2363">I do, however, accept that it would be detrimental to competition in the market to confine the writing of prescriptions to veterinary practitioners in a situation where the vast majority of medicines became prescription only. I have clearly indicated on a number of occasions that, if that is the outcome of the process currently under way at EU level on the exemption criteria, I will permit persons other than veterinarians, such as pharmacists and other suitably qualified persons to prescribe some of the medicines which become prescription only from 1 January next. I should point out that my preferred option continues to be to avoid the medicines concerned coming under any form of prescription control in the first instance. In this regard, my Department is still awaiting formal proposals from the European Commission on the exemption criteria. In the interim, my Department is continuing to engage with the Commission to secure a speedy and favourable outcome to this process.</p>

            <p eId="para_2374">The compensation package forms part of the agreement on reform of the EU sugar regime reached by the Council of Agricultural Ministers last November and subsequently adopted by Council Regulations on 20 February 2006. There are three elements to the compensation package.</p>
            <p eId="para_2375">The first element is the compensation to beet growers of up to 64% of the reduction in the minimum price for beet. This compensation, which will be incorporated in the existing Single Payment Scheme and will be payable from this year, is worth approximately €123m to Irish beet growers over the next seven years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2376">The second element is the restructuring aid covering the economic, social and environmental costs of restructuring of the sugar industry involving factory closure and renunciation of quota. In Ireland's case, this would be worth up to €145m. This aid is subject to the submission by the processor of an aid application including a detailed restructuring plan for the industry following consultations with the beet growers. Where restructuring takes place in the first year of the new sugar regime, as in Ireland's case, the application must be submitted by 31 July 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2377">The third element of the package is the diversification aid, worth almost €44m in Ireland's case, which would be drawn down in the framework of a national restructuring programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2378">With regard to the second element of the package, the Council Regulation provides that at least 10% of the restructuring aid shall be reserved for sugar beet growers and machinery contractors. That percentage may be increased by Member States after consultation of interested parties provided that an economically sound balance between the elements of the restructuring plan is ensured. In that context, my Department issued an open call for submissions last month with a closing date of 2 June. These submissions are subject to scrutiny by Indecon International Economic Consultants, who have been appointed by the Government to provide me with independent expert advice on matters relating to the implementation of the restructuring fund. A final decision on the percentage will be made in due course having regard to this advice and the recently-adopted Commission Regulation laying down detailed rules for the implementation of the restructuring aid. It is my intention that the restructuring aid will be implemented in a fair and equitable manner and strictly in accordance with the relevant EU regulations.</p>

            <p eId="para_2386">The person named has received considerable correspondence since December 2005 from my Department in relation to the special discounted buy out scheme introduced by me on 1st January 2006. This discounted scheme provides Land Purchase annuitants with the opportunity to buy out their annuities at a reduced price. The person named received circa 36.78 acres of agricultural land from the Land Commission but has consistently failed to make payments in respect of his land purchase annuity repayments and as a result he has accumulated substantial arrears. The person named made no repayments from May 1993 to January 1999, when he was advised in a letter dated 14 January 1999 that his subsidies would be set-off without further notice with a view to reducing the current level of his arrears if he did not make payments. Some IR£7,700 was set off from subsidies to be paid by the Department to the person named up to the end of 2001. Further set off was made for the period January 2002 to October 2005 and a figure of €8871.57 was recovered by way of set off. The person named was advised in January 2006 as to the capital repayment required to participate in the discounted buy out scheme. If the person named wishes to avail of this reduction he must pay in full the amount, capital and arrears, notified to him as the amount required to buy out his annuity under the terms of the Scheme. His current arrears stand at some €48,289.64. The capital discount available to the person named amounts to some €22,576.88. The full redemption payment due by the person named amounts to €116,020.18. The scheme is voluntary and will end on the 30th June 2006.

Cleaning contractors have already been invited to tender for the project and it is anticipated that the clean-up work will commence in the latter half of July 2006. The allocation for the programme in 2006 is €3 million. The pilot project will be overseen by a steering group comprising representatives from the three Departments and an independent evaluation of the programme has been commissioned in order to determine the programme's effectiveness. Should the programme prove successful in eliminating or significantly reducing the incidence of graffiti, consideration will be given to extending it to other areas.</p>

This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June 1997 and represents an increase of 1,939 (or 18.1%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. I am advised that the personnel strength (all ranks) of the Carlow/Kildare Division as at today's date is 358. This compares with an equivalent figure of 281 as at 31 December 1997, and represents a very significant increase of 77 (or 27.4%) in the personnel strength of the Division since that date. I am further advised that an additional Garda is to be allocated to Maynooth Garda Station next month. The personnel strength of Maynooth Garda Station is currently 16 (all ranks), an increase of 7 (or 43.8%) on the equivalent strength of the Station as at 31 December 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_2405">The Deputy will be aware that Maynooth is not a 24-hour Garda station. I am advised that when it is not open, P.A.C.B. (Public Access Call Box) and call diversion systems are in operation to the District Headquarters at Naas.</p>
            <p eId="para_2406">As regards the specific incident referred to by the Deputy, I have asked the Garda Commissioner for his observations on the matter and I will be in contact directly with the Deputy when these are available. It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas. These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs. Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy. This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_2407">I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. The second group of newly attested gardaí under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in on 8 June, and further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested gardaí will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of Maynooth will be given the fullest consideration.</p>

            <p eId="para_2411">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. One of these conditions is that the applicant has had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, has had a total residence in the State amounting to four years. Applications for certificates of naturalisation from the persons referred to in the Deputy's question were received in the Citizenship section of my Department in April 2004. These applications were examined by my officials in February 2006. Both applicants stated in their application forms that they first arrived in the State in December 1999. Since it was not possible for the couple to have met the above mentioned five year residency requirement when they applied in April 2004, their applications were deemed ineligible. However, my officials also established that the couple had the necessary residence in February 2006, when the applications were examined. In line with my Department's general policy for such cases, the couple were afforded the opportunity to make fresh applications which would be processed on their existing cases files, thereby exempting them from having to wait the full processing time again. New applications were received from the couple on 18 May 2006 and these are due to be dealt with in the near future. I will inform the Deputy and the applicants when the cases are finalised.</p>

            <p eId="para_2417">The Community Alert programme is a community based crime prevention initiative in rural communities which was set up by Muintir na Tíre in association with the Garda Síochána in 1985. It is a national movement with its network comprising approximately 1,285 local Community Alert groups of which there are 53 schemes in Kildare dedicated to improving the quality of life of people in rural communities who are vulnerable, in particular the elderly, by crime prevention, neighbourliness and self reliance, general community safety and well-being, accident prevention, promotion of personal safety and having an anti-poverty focus awareness of social inclusion.</p>
            <p eId="para_2418">The Neighbourhood Watch scheme was established in 1985 as a crime prevention measure. In common with other community based schemes, it enlists the voluntary help of the community in co-operation with the Garda Síochána and is most suitable for urban areas. There are some 2,600 Neighbourhood Watch schemes in operation nation-wide with 151 schemes in Kildare urban areas. The scheme is currently administered by the Garda Síochána Community Relations Section. I am strongly of the view that community organisations have, through their support and co-operation with the Garda Síochána, an important role to play in crime prevention and the promotion of community safety and I very much support the work in this area being carried out by Muintir na Tíre through Community Alert and the Garda Síochána through Neighbourhood Watch.</p>

It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas. These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs. Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy. This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_2494">I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. The first group of newly attested gardaí under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March and the second such group did so on 8 June. Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested gardaí will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete. The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of the areas referred to by the Deputy will be given the fullest consideration.</p>

His application was considered at first instance by the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, both of whom concluded that the person concerned did not meet the criteria for recognition as a refugee. The person concerned was notified, by letter dated 22 November 2005, of my decision to refuse to give him a declaration as a refugee. He was also advised of the options open to him at that point in time vis a vis his position in the State i.e. to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to deportation or to submit, within 15 working days, written representations setting out reasons as to why he should be permitted to remain in the State. Representations were submitted on behalf of the person concerned.</p>

Consideration was also given to the representations submitted on behalf of the person concerned. Following this detailed examination of the application of the person concerned for permission to remain in the State, I signed a Deportation Order in respect of him on 20 March 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2516">On 8 May 2006, further representations were submitted on behalf of the person concerned.

These further representations were considered under Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) and under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) following which a decision was taken that the Deportation Order issued in respect of the person concerned should be affirmed. The enforcement of the Deportation Order issued in respect of the person concerned is now an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB).</p>

Pupils may only avail of concessionary transport if spare seats are available on school buses and this is determined on a term-to-term basis by reference to those who are fully eligible for transport under the terms of the school transport scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2525">Significant investment has been made by the Government to address capacity shortfalls arising from the phasing out of the three for two seating arrangement on school buses. A programme for Bus Éireann to acquire a number of new and modern second-hand buses is well advanced. In addition, Bus Éireann has hired-in over 220 additional vehicles from the private sector and the general situation is being kept under review.</p>

            <p eId="para_2530">The OECD Review of Higher Education in Ireland made a compelling case for the reform of the higher education system and this has been strongly endorsed by Government and key partners across the sector. It is acknowledged that institutions need to embrace reform in order to allow them to rise to the challenges prompted by the changing economic and social environment while retaining and building upon existing excellence in their historical mission to advance and disseminate knowledge. The sector is acknowledged as an engine for economic growth and is also expected to be an instrument for a fair and equitable dispersion of the benefits of that growth to promote social cohesion and inclusion.</p>
            <p eId="para_2531">I announced the Strategic Innovation Fund last April as one element in a programme of investment and reform in higher education that will enable the sector to deliver on national priorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2532">The SIF key objectives are —</p>
            <p eId="para_2533">—to enhance the delivery of core activities of education and research, through effective and creative institutional and inter-institutional collaboration and including where necessary, appropriate internal restructuring and rationalisation efforts</p>
            <p eId="para_2534">—to support enabling measures to prepare for the expansion and development of post-graduate education (including expansion and development of graduate schools), including both intra- and inter-institutional collaboration</p>
            <p eId="para_2535">—to support innovation and quality improvement in teaching and learning, including enhanced teaching methods, programme re-structuring, modularisation and e-learning</p>
            <p eId="para_2536">—to support access, retention and progression at both individual institutional and through inter institutional and sectoral level collaboration.</p>
            <p eId="para_2537">I recognise that the development of a strong, modernised and reformed third level will underpin the creation of a fourth level which has been identified as the cornerstone of Ireland's future economic development. The Strategic Innovation Fund will enable institutions to enhance their delivery of education which will benefit all those in the sector, especially students, and enable them to reach their full potential in our changing society. It is expected that a call for proposals by the Higher Education Authority from the third level institutions will issue shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_2538">I should point out that the three Third Level Student Support Schemes, administered by the Local Authorities and the Vocational Education Committees on behalf of my Department, offer financial assistance to eligible post-graduate students attending approved courses. Students entering approved courses for the first time are, generally speaking, eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2539">An approved post-graduate course for the purpose of the Higher Education Grants Scheme and the VEC Scholarship Scheme is a full time postgraduate course of not less than one years duration pursued in an approved institution in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2540">In December 2000 clause 7.7 of the Higher Education Grant Scheme 2000 was amended to provide financial assistance to eligible candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and who wish to enter a further postgraduate course at a higher level, which represents progression from the level at which the first qualification was attained.</p>
            <p eId="para_2541">Section 473A, Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including certain approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in E.U. Member States and postgraduate courses in non EU countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_2542">Tax Relief on tuition fees is claimed directly from the Tax Office using an I.T. 31 Form. Details of approved colleges and courses are also available on Revenue's Internet site at www.revenue.ie.</p>

            <p eId="para_2587">The issue of child protection and ensuring that all children in every primary school are aware of child protection issues are high priority areas for my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_2588">The ‘Stay Safe' programme is a personal safety programme for children. It is designed to give children the knowledge and necessary skills to help them deal with potentially abusive or threatening situations. However, it is also recognised that the programme must cover those individuals closely involved with children on a daily basis: parents/guardians and teachers. To this end, professional in-service courses for teachers and parent awareness seminars have been put in place at individual school level. This is in addition to the teaching of a personal safety skills programme to pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_2589">The training of teachers, parents and Boards of Management in the ‘Stay Safe' programme and the development of guidelines and procedures for a school policy on child protection is provided by a network of thirty-one regionally-based teachers who are available to the programme on a part-time basis. This support supplements the assistance provided by the Department of Health and Children which maintains an administrative office for the ‘Stay Safe' Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2590">An initial one-day in-service training seminar on the ‘Stay Safe' Programme has been provided for all primary schools. Since the Programme was introduced, 99.7% of primary schools have participated in this training.</p>
            <p eId="para_2591">In relation to schools in County Wexford, and indeed all other counties, my Department is currently conducting a questionnaire survey in all primary schools to find out the number of schools implementing the ‘Stay Safe' Programme. When all the questionnaires are returned and the data analysed, my Department will then be in a position to state more accurately the position in relation to the implementation of the programme in schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_2593">As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in primary school staffing in recent years. Next September there will no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002. Not only is the average class size in our primary schools down to 24, but there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc. Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.</p>
            <p eId="para_2594">Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Over the next two school years even more teachers will be put in place both for the above priority areas of disadvantage and special education and also under a reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule.</p>
            <p eId="para_2595">All schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that, with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the school. Next year this is being reduced to 28 children per classroom teacher and in 2007/2008 it will be reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.</p>
            <p eId="para_2596">So, as I have pointed out the general rule in the current school year is that at least one classroom teacher is provided for every 29 pupils. Furthermore, the actual average class size nationally is 24.</p>
            <p eId="para_2597">The data requested by the Deputy in relation to class sizes in Carlow for the 2005/06 school year is as follows.</p>

            <p eId="para_2610">The Deputy will be aware that the number of children in large classes has been reduced dramatically by this Government. Furthermore, what really puts the decrease in large classes in context is the fact that in 1996/97 five times more children were in classes of 35+.</p>
            <p eId="para_2611">It is important to appreciate that there are a number of different reasons why a particular school may have a large class in a given year. Reasons why there are large classes include a significant fluctuation in enrolments from one year to the next and/or a decision by the school principal not to have multi-grade classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2612">Regardless of the reason why there is a large class in a particular school one year, it should be noted that in the majority of cases this is not the situation in the following year. In the main, the same schools do not have large classes year after year and so the same children are not in large classes year after year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2613">Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is often because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes. Indeed, I often find that when I look into why a particular school has a class of 35 in a particular grade, the answer is because there is another class in the same school with a much lower than average number of pupils in it.</p>
            <p eId="para_2614">I appreciate that splitting classes may not always be an option for a particular school, because for example there might be a large group in junior infants and a small group in sixth class and so on. But where it is possible, I believe that principals should consider the benefits of having smaller multi-grade classes as against having large differences in class sizes at different levels in the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_2615">This Government has clearly demonstrated its commitment to improving staffing in our primary schools by hiring thousands of extra teachers in recent years and we will continue to make progress on this issue.</p>

I wish to advise the Deputy that the practice of issuing child-specific contracts ceased in September 2005. All newly appointed special needs assistant posts are related to the special needs of one or more pupils in respect of whom posts are sanctioned, and may be utilised by the school having regard to those pupils and the duties of the post.</p>
            <p eId="para_2619">A special need assistant's ranking for seniority commences from the date that he/she commences duty as a special needs assistant in the school.

A copy of the Circular is available on my Department's website <i>www.education.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_2620">I wish to clarify that the recruitment and deployment of special needs assistants within a school are matters for the individual principal/Board of Management.

The teacher allocation for the school for the 2006/07 school year is Principal and 8 teachers in total, including 5 mainstream class teachers.

            <p eId="para_2747">The school submitted a review application under the review mechanism which has been put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in the School Support Programme but regard themselves as having a level of disadvantage which is of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the Programme. This mechanism will operate under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review.</p>
            <p eId="para_2748">It is intended that the review process will be completed by the end of the current school year. In addition to the provision being made under the new School Support Programme for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage, under DEIS, financial support will also continue to be provided for other primary schools where the level of disadvantage is more dispersed. This support will be based on the results of the identification process completed under DEIS and schools will receive support in line with the level of disadvantage among their pupils. The arrangements which will apply in this regard will be notified to schools early in the autumn.</p>

            <p eId="para_2750">Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP). The School Support Programme will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage.</p>
            <p eId="para_2751">The process of identifying primary and second-level schools for participation in the SSP was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and the Inspectorate. As a result of the identification process, 840 schools were invited to participate in the SSP. These comprised 640 primary schools (320 urban/town schools and 320 rural schools) and 200 second-level schools. I am delighted to say that 833 of the schools invited to join the new programme accepted the invitation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2752">A review process has been put in place for primary and second-level schools that did not qualify for participation in the SSP and that regard themselves as having a level of disadvantage which is of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the Programme. The closing date for receipt of review applications was Friday, 31st March, 2006. Over 360 review applications from schools have been received.</p>
            <p eId="para_2753">The review process is under way and is directed by Dr. Seamus McGuinness, who is being supported in processing review applications by a nominated staff member from the Educational Research Centre (ERC) and a nominated staff member from my Department's Social Inclusion Unit. The review process applies only to those primary schools that participated in the ERC survey in May 2005 and only to those eligible second-level schools for which data were available from the relevant databases. Review requests must be evidence-based and based on the variables and reference dates used in the identification process for the SSP. It is anticipated that the review process will be completed before the end of the current school year.</p>

            <p eId="para_2759">The office of Ombudsman for the Defence Forces was established as an independent statutory office under the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004. The appointment of a person to the office is made by the President, acting upon the recommendation of the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_2760">The specific parts of the Act relevant to the establishment of the Office of Ombudsman for the Defence Forces were brought into operation with effect from 31 August 2005 by the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004 (Commencement Order) 2005. All other provisions of the Act were brought into operation with effect from 1 December 2005 by the same Commencement Order.</p>
            <p eId="para_2761">On 19 September 2005, Ms Paulyn Marrinan-Quinn SC was appointed by the President, upon the recommendation of the Government, as the first Ombudsman for the Defence Forces, in accordance with Section 2 of the Act. The function of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces is to act as the ultimate point of appeal for, and administrative investigation into, complaints made by members (and former members) of the Defence Forces against another member (or former member) of the Defence Forces, or against a civil servant of the Department of Defence.</p>
            <p eId="para_2762">Subject to the terms of the legislation, and her own independent personal judgement and discretion, the Ombudsman may undertake an independent investigation into a complaint made to her and will issue a written report and recommendations arising from such an investigation to the relevant parties, including the Minister. The Ombudsman for the Defence Forces may investigate a complaint in respect of an action or decision which may have adversely affected the complainant personally. The action or decision complained of must have occurred no earlier than the 1st December 2005, the date for the commencement of the functions of the office. The Ombudsman functions independently in the performance of her statutory duties and has a wide discretion in the discharge of those duties, subject to the terms of the Act. She will, however, have due regard to the operational requirements of the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_2763">Where the complainant is serving in the Defence Forces, the complaint must have been within the internal military ‘redress of wrongs' system for at least 28 days before the Ombudsman may initiate an investigation. The Ombudsman, on receipt of the complaint from the complainant, must form an opinion that the complaint is not likely to be resolved within that internal redress forum and that the other necessary criteria as set out in the Act are satisfied. Complainants who are former members of the Defence Forces apply directly to the Ombudsman in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2764">The Ombudsman will typically investigate and ascertain if the action/decision complained of was:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2765">(i) taken without proper authority and/or on irrelevant grounds;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2766">(ii) negligent or careless;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2767">(iii) based on erroneous or incomplete information;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2768">(iv) improperly discriminatory;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2769">(v) unreasonable (notwithstanding consideration of the context of the military environment);</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2770">(vi) based on undesirable administrative practice; and-or</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2771">(vii) contrary to fair or sound administration.</p>
            <p eId="para_2772">There are specific exclusions within the legislation in respect of certain specific areas and matters which are outside the remit of the Ombudsman e.g. terms and conditions of employment in the Defence Forces within the scope of the existing statutory schemes of Conciliation and Arbitration. A complaint must be made to the Ombudsman not later than 12 months from the date of the action/decision complained or from the date on which the complainant became aware of the action/decision complained of, which ever is the later.</p>
            <p eId="para_2773">An important component of the work will consist of the making of formal written reports and recommendations to the Minister on foot of investigations undertaken in various individual cases and in following up the official administrative response to these reports and recommendations. Complaints in relation to any actions/decisions which occurred before 1st December 2005 are being dealt with under the previous ‘redress of wrongs' arrangements under Section 114 of the Defence Act 1954, as agreed with the representative associations in 1996, providing for the examination of complaints by the civilian Complaints Inquiry Officer. This separate stream will continue in parallel on a transitional basis until all remaining complaints about pre 1st December 2005 matters are cleared from the system.</p>
            <p eId="para_2774">The Ombudsman for the Defence Forces is temporarily located at The Distillery Building, 145/151 Church Street, Dublin 7 (tel 817 5690).</p>

            <p eId="para_2776">With effect from the 1st October 2005, in the context of the reorganisation of the Reserve Defence Force under the RDF Review Implementation Plan, revised arrangements for the payment of motor travel allowances to Reserve officers for the use of their own motor cars in the course of official duties were introduced. It was subsequently discovered that a substantial number of the claims received after that date were not in accordance with the relevant regulations and these were returned to the units concerned for amendment or clarification, as appropriate. This has temporarily resulted in a higher than usual level of unpaid claims on hand. Claims found to be in order are being paid on an ongoing basis and to date in 2006 my Department has paid €22,285 in respect of motor travel allowance to Reserve officers. (This sum includes some payments due under the pre-Oct 2005 arrangements).</p>

            <p eId="para_2814">While the trend is upwards, the figures must be interpreted with caution. Firstly, they are not a precise measure of the number of bags supplied — each year's figure will also include levies recovered in respect of earlier periods on account of retailers filing late returns and the recoupment of levies due following Revenue audit findings. Secondly, the increase in income is also likely to be due in part to increased enforcement by local authorities and audit activity by the Revenue Commissioners. Enforcement efforts have been stepped up and a special network of local authority officers has been established to monitor and co-ordinate the enforcement drive.</p>
            <p eId="para_2815">I have previously indicated that I am anxious to ensure that the levy's positive effect on our environment is maintained. To that end, I am currently reviewing all aspects of its operation, including the level at which the levy is set.</p>

          <speech by="#DickRoche" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_559">
            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Roche)</from>
            <p eId="para_2817">Ireland has had a long-standing concern about nuclear activities at Sellafield since they began in the late 1940's. These concerns were significantly increased following the Windscale fire in 1957 and an incident at Sellafield in 1983 which caused widespread radioactive contamination of the adjacent beaches. In December 1986 Dáil Éireann unanimously agreed a motion calling on the British Government to arrange for the immediate closure of Sellafield, and successive Governments have repeatedly conveyed this view to the UK Government. The objective was restated in the Agreed Programme for Government of 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_2818">The Government instituted two international legal actions against the UK Government in relation to Sellafield. One case was taken under the OSPAR Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic and the other was taken under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The costs in respect of legal, economic and scientific advices and representation incurred to date in respect of these legal actions is approximately €2.637m.</p>
            <p eId="para_2819">Oral hearings in relation to the OSPAR proceedings took place in the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague in October 2002. The objective of the OSPAR action was to bring about the disclosure of certain information which had been excluded from two economic reports commissioned by the UK on the MOX Plant.</p>
            <p eId="para_2820">The Permanent Court of Arbitration Tribunal issued its award on 2 July 2003. Although Ireland failed to gain access to the confidential information withheld from the UK public consultation papers, the Tribunal did establish an important international legal precedent. It determined that Ireland has a right under the OSPAR Convention to access to information on the marine environment, that the U.K. has an obligation to make such information available and that Ireland has a right of redress under the Convention to vindicate its rights to such information.</p>
            <p eId="para_2821">The hearing of the substantive case under UNCLOS took place in The Hague, in the Permanent Court of Arbitration from the 10 to 21 June 2003. The issues in this case include the threat to the marine environment from the continued operation and expansion of Sellafield including security issues, the threat to the Irish Sea from shipments of nuclear materials and the inadequacy of the 1993 Environmental Impact Statement for the MOX Plant. However, at the beginning of the hearing the Tribunal were concerned with arguments raised by the United Kingdom that the issues in dispute before the Tribunal were matters of European Community competence and should fall for decision by the European Court of Justice.</p>
            <p eId="para_2822">The Tribunal took the view it would be inappropriate to go on to consider the merits of Ireland's case while uncertainty remained as to the division of competences in respect of UNCLOS between the European Community and its Member States. In the circumstances, the Tribunal postponed hearings on the substantive case to facilitate a resolution of the issues relating to jurisdiction between the European Community and UNCLOS. However, the Tribunal did hear an application by Ireland for Provisional Measures pending the hearing of the substantive case.</p>
            <p eId="para_2823">The Tribunal issued an Order on 24 June after hearing an application by Ireland for Provisional Measures. This Order called upon both Parties to develop suitable secure arrangements at inter-Governmental level to improve co-operation and consultation. In relation to the issue of competency between UNCLOS and the European Community, the European Commission initiated proceedings against Ireland in the European Court of Justice (ECJ) on 31 October 2003. The Court issued its Judgment on 30 May last, which inter alia declared that Ireland, by instituting proceedings against the UK under UNCLOS, failed to fulfil its obligations under Community law. The judgment also establishes that certain provisions of UNCLOS form part of the Community legal order and that the ECJ has jurisdiction to determine disputes on their interpretation and application.</p>
            <p eId="para_2824">The Judgment represents a significant development and clarification of Community law. It means that the resolution of disputes between Member States in relation to a wide range of international agreements, particularly in the environmental field, comes within the jurisdiction of the ECJ. The Judgment presents Member States, such as Ireland, with new mechanisms for holding other Member States to account in relation to their transboundary obligations towards the environment. These and other issues consequent on the Judgement are being examined in detail by Ireland's international legal team, led by the Attorney General. Ireland's strategy in pursuit of the objectives of this case will be considered and determined by Government, based on this examination and analysis.</p>

            <p eId="para_2826">The local authority sector has exceeded the Government's target of 3% for the employment of people with disabilities in the public sector each year since 2001. Local authorities are required to make every effort to maintain or exceed this level of employment of persons with a disability.</p>
            <p eId="para_2827">The employment target will be reviewed by the Monitoring Committee to be established later this year under Part 5 of the Disability Act 2005 to report, annually from 2006, on the employment position in respect of public bodies accountable to my Department.</p>

This assessment is the Council's most up to date and complete statement to my Department of its water and sewerage infrastructure proposals. It was taken into account in the framing of subsequent phases of my Department's Water Services Investment Programme, including the most recently published Programme for 2005 to 2007 (which is available in the Oireachtas Library and sets out details of all currently approved schemes).</p>
            <p eId="para_2989">Local authorities have recently been asked by my Department to produce new assessments of needs and to submit the results to the Department by 31 July 2006.
