            <p eId="para_4">It is important to ascertain what lessons can be learned from these events. For that reason, I requested a full report from the Garda Síochána and I expect it to be delivered to me by Friday, 8 November. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has similarly requested a full report from the HSE on the matter and it is expected to be delivered to her within the same timescale. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and I have requested the Ombudsman for Children, Emily Logan, to carry out an examination of the matter. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and I have confirmed to the Ombudsman that we will provide the two reports requested from the Garda Síochána and the HSE upon their receipt on 8 November.</p>
            <p eId="para_5"> In order to ensure that the Ombudsman for Children is in a position to comprehensively and independently address all issues arising out of these events in so far as An Garda Síochána is concerned, I have already announced my proposal to appoint her, in accordance with section 42 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 as amended by section 42 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007, to conduct an inquiry. This is intended to ensure that she has sufficient powers to carry out an inquiry and is in a legal position to access all information that she may require from An Garda Síochána. She is already vested with legal powers in respect of any engagement she may undertake arising out of these matters with the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_6"> I am not in a position to inform the Deputy of the exact timeframe for the completion of the Ombudsman for Children's report. The Deputy will appreciate that the Ombudsman for Children will be carrying out an independent investigation and will take the time she believes she needs to ensure that her investigation is comprehensive so that her report can address these matters fully to her satisfaction. Upon the completion of this important task I look forward to receiving from her a detailed report containing such observations and recommendations as she may make. I believe this is an appropriate response to the issues that have been raised and I am grateful to the Ombudsman for Children for agreeing to undertake this task.</p>
            <p eId="para_7"> Child protection cases can, of their nature, involve complex and difficult choices. It is important now that an appropriate period of time be allocated to allow this process to take place and that people do not prejudge its outcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_8">
              <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_9"> It is also important that we do not undermine faith in the child protection services. Of course people should report to the authorities any reasonable concerns they have about the safety of children. However, in seeking to ensure that the welfare of children is safeguarded and that every child in this State is afforded, where necessary, the protection of the State, it is important that no group or minority community is singled out for unwarranted attention, or indeed suspicion, in child protection issues.</p>

          <speech by="#NiallCollins" eId="spk_4">
            <from>Deputy Niall Collins<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T14:05:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_10">We all agree it was difficult in this situation for An Garda Síochána to get the balance right. Obviously, protecting vulnerable children and children at risk is a priority for all of us, but we also have to recognise people's basic human rights. As I stated in my introduction, there were two cases, in Athlone and Tallaght.</p>
            <p eId="para_11"> It must be pointed out that there are also data protection issues, because those children were no sooner taken into care than it was fully across the media. I ask the Minister whether he has contacted the Data Protection Commissioner in that regard. He might comment on the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_12"> For me it is not about the allocation of blame, but there must be proper accountability, given that there is impending legal action or that it has been flagged.</p>
            <p eId="para_13"> The Minister stated that he is awaiting the Garda Commissioner's report, which I believe he will receive on Friday next. Specifically, that report needs to spell out what was the immediate risk based on which An Garda Síochána engaged section 12 of the 1991 Child Care Act, why the HSE was not asked to conduct an assessment and why other children in the same locations from the same community were not taken.</p>
            <p eId="para_14"> The Minister stated that he had asked the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, to produce a report. Why has he not tied in the Garda Síochána Ombudsman to conduct a joint report, given that office's expertise in investigating the activities of An Garda Síochána? Both offices have dovetailed on previous assignments.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_5" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality">
            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T14:05:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_15">I have not been in contact with the Data Protection Commissioner. It is a matter for him if he wants to investigate an issue. However, I agree with the Deputy that it is a matter of concern that these matters concerning two children appeared in newspapers in the context of an issue that, under the child care legislation, should be dealt with confidentially. That is one of the matters that I will be asking the Ombudsman for Children to look into.</p>
            <p eId="para_16"> The purpose of asking the Ombudsman for Children to engage with this matter is that, essentially, this relates to child care and also to the question asked by the Deputy - that is, the immediate risk to the children which warranted the invocation of section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991. The Garda Ombudsman Commission would normally investigate allegations of Garda misconduct. This concerns actions taken in respect of two particular children, the appropriateness of the actions, the obligation on An Garda Síochána to protect the welfare of children and the powers the Garda exercises under section 12 of the Child Care Act. I do not want in any way to prejudge the consideration of the Ombudsman for Children but I anticipate that whatever report she makes will be published and will be available for people to consider and comment on, and if there are any recommendations arising from her report they will be taken with great seriousness.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#NiallCollins" eId="spk_6">
            <from>Deputy Niall Collins<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_17">It merits consideration by the Minister and his Department to complete such an investigation in the first instance. Serious consideration should be given to a joint assignment by the said two ombudsmen, Ms Emily Logan and the Garda Ombudsman. The Garda Ombudsman has a lot of experience in dealing in detail with investigations into An Garda Síochána. I do not wish to attribute blame, but there is a lot of disquiet in the community about what happened. We all recognise that the Garda must try to get the correct balance to protect vulnerable children.</p>
            <p eId="para_18"> In as much as possible within the constraints of the current issue, I ask the Minister to describe the particular advice he may have received from the Attorney General on the impact on any child protection legislation. Has the Minister discussed the matter with the Attorney General and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs? Does he intend to amend child protection legislation?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_7" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality">
            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_19">Under section 42 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007, the Ombudsman for Children will have all the powers she requires to fully and properly look into this matter. I know it is also of concern to the Deputy that we protect the welfare of children. We could swap a whole range of questions on which we would agree that answers were needed. Was it in the interests of the welfare of these children that this action be taken? What was the immediate risk to their safety that resulted in a judgment that the action be taken? What was the connection in the context of each of the cases between An Garda Síochána and relevant HSE personnel? Were relevant HSE personnel available to An Garda Síochána? In this context, the Deputy needs to understand - I know he is aware of the fact - that this provision, section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991, has been utilised on many occasions to provide immediate protection for children whose safety is at risk. It is very important that members of the public make these reports if they genuinely believe a child's safety is at risk. It often falls on the shoulders of members of the Garda force in a very short time to have to make judgments on whether children will be taken into temporary care. These matters end up being dealt with by the District Court at Children Court level, which is appropriate. However, I will not prejudge any aspect of this matter. It may well be more a matter of judgments supplied and procedures than there being a frailty in section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991. I will not prejudge whether any amendment is required to that Act. I will await the Garda's report which I will furnish to the Ombudsman for Children. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, will furnish the HSE's report. We will then consider the outcome of that report.</p>

            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_25">This is the first time I have heard anyone on the Opposition side of the House complain he or she has been given a speaking slot. I think it is for the benefit of those who actually watch these proceedings and those who are in the Visitors Gallery in order that they know what the question is about. It is welcome that the Deputy is doing this within the rules of the House. It may well be in the context of the question tabled that the Deputy wishes to extrapolate. It is my understanding this is an option, but it is for Deputies to decide how they want to use the new procedures available.</p>
            <p eId="para_26"> I very much welcome the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report on the Garda fixed charge processing system. The report followed the report by Assistant Garda Commissioner, John O’Mahoney, on allegations of the improper cancellation of fixed charge notices. I published the O’Mahoney report and also a related report by the Garda professional standards unit earlier this year and referred them to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.</p>
            <p eId="para_27"> There are some differences in the extent of the reports in that the O'Mahoney report was an examination of specific allegations rather than a general examination and it covered a longer period than the report by the Comptroller and Auditor General, of three and a half years compared to two years. However, both reports identified approximately the same rate of cancellation of fixed charge notices of up to 5%.</p>
            <p eId="para_28">Most importantly, the O’Mahoney report broadly identified the same key issues of concern relating to the operation of the fixed charge processing system identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General - namely, a failure to follow cancellation procedures in a significant number of cases, a lack of adequate record-keeping, and what in some cases was quite frankly too great a readiness to accept unconvincing justifications for speeding and other road traffic offences. The Deputy will recall that when the O'Mahoney report was published, I referred to some of the decisions made as being "exotic".</p>
            <p eId="para_29"> There is no doubt that the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General reinforce the concerns identified by the O’Mahoney report about weaknesses in the fixed-charge notice system. What is needed now is corrective action to tackle the concerns identified by these two reports, and I am glad to say that action has been and will continue to be taken. Disciplinary proceedings have been taken against a number of members of the Garda Síochána, and a number of others have been advised of the requirement to follow correct procedures. A new Garda directive on the cancellation of fixed charge notices was issued to the entire force on 30 August 2013.</p>

            <p eId="para_30">The Comptroller and Auditor General's report revealed that half of summonses were not served and one in five motorists facing fixed-charged notices were getting off. It was much clearer than the previous report carried out by An Garda Síochána, and that is why we must have an independent examination of the issue. Just as important, there are ongoing reports in the media about judges, a State solicitor and senior journalists who allegedly had penalty points terminated. I am not aware of any court cases being taken by the people who have been accused of this, so until court cases are taken I can only assume the reports are correct.</p>
            <p eId="para_31"> For public confidence to be restored to the system, people must see that the same rule applies to everybody no matter who they are. The vast majority of gardaí in Garda districts enforce the law properly, as was made clear in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, but some, unfortunately, do not. In some areas, people of influence were able to get points terminated, which is unacceptable. It is not acceptable to the Minister, to me or to anybody else. Could we have an independent examination that could clear up the issue once and for all so that we can start afresh?</p>

            <p eId="para_32">At this stage we have had an examination as published in the O'Mahoney report, another Garda report and, now, the Comptroller and Auditor General's report. There is a need to significantly tighten procedures for cancellation and that should result from the instructions given on 30 August 2013 by the Garda Commissioner. He has accepted and will implement specific and helpful recommendations contained in the report by the Comptroller and Auditor General on further improving the fixed-charge notice system and how it interacts with the Courts Service and driving licence system.</p>
            <p eId="para_33"> In the context of the Deputy's reference to people getting off, the courts are independent and there have been a number of instances in which people have been summonsed and gone to court but judges have not imposed fines on them. That is a matter to be dealt with by the courts, with judges exercising their independent judicial discretion. It is certainly not an issue into which it would be appropriate to conduct any inquiry.</p>
            <p eId="para_34"> As I previously indicated, I have referred the two Garda reports to the independent Garda inspectorate to seek advice on any additional measures that may be desirable, and I expect to receive a report from the inspectorate in the near future. As I have also mentioned, reports have been referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, which is independent. If it has anything further to say on the issue or recommendations that have not already been made, they will be given serious attention.</p>

            <p eId="para_35">Is the Minister concerned about allegations made by a number of media outlets, including <i>The Guardian</i>, which is one of the most respected international media outlets, that senior journalists who worked directly with gardaí had penalty points terminated? Is he concerned about media reports that at least two judges allegedly had penalty points terminated? There was also a report about a State solicitor. No person in the State could accept it if what has been alleged actually happened, particularly as these people are supposed to hold justice and democracy to account. How does the Minister feel about those allegations?</p>

            <p eId="para_36">As the Deputy should know if he has ready the O'Mahoney report and the larger report furnished to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, all of the issues he has raised have been addressed. There is nothing new in any of these matters as far as I am aware.</p>
            <p eId="para_37">Nothing new has been reported in the media other than a look back at matters that were the subject of public comment and controversy earlier this year. These are all issues that are addressed within the O'Mahoney report and the detailed report that was published subsequently. The Deputy is a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and if issues arise from the report that he believes are appropriate to pursue in the public interest, he should pursue them. I would be interested in any conclusions the joint committee reaches on what are issues of importance, but let us not exaggerate the situation. The vast majority of fixed-charge notices are paid and no issue arises. In 50% of the notices that were cancelled there were incontrovertibly valid reasons for their cancellation, such as cases in which a person received a notice and it turned out that the registration number of the car in question was not the same as that of the person's car. A range of issues of that nature arose where fixed-charge notices were issued to what turned out to be unmarked Garda cars on duty and in pursuit of individuals.</p>

            <p eId="para_41">I raise the issue in the context of events in recent days of which the Minister is well aware - that is, the actions and violence that have taken place on our streets among these criminal gangs. There is huge concern among the public, particularly in the wider community. Their concerns are based on public safety. What action is the Minister taking to deal with this major crisis?</p>

            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T14:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_42">The Deputy has used his 30 seconds well in raising a serious issue. It is an important matter. I can assure the Deputy that violent crime, including the brutal murders related to the activities of criminal gangs, is being tackled aggressively by An Garda Síochána with all necessary resources deployed in the investigation and prosecution of these appalling incidents. The organised criminal activity which gives rise to this violence is also being targeted by An Garda Síochána across a number of fronts, including through the use of focused intelligence-led operations by specialist units such as the serious and organised crime unit and the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau.</p>
            <p eId="para_43"> While the challenges posed by gangland and organised crime remain clear to all, week in, week out, An Garda Síochána is making arrests and bringing persons before the courts, with substantial sentences handed down in many instances. The drug trade is being tackled relentlessly, with drugs valued at €220 million seized by the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners between 2011 and 2013, as well as substantial seizures of the other trafficked and counterfeit goods from which organised crime profits. The Garda has also had considerable success in disrupting the activities of paramilitary groups which are inextricably linked to organised crime and which remain intent on thwarting the democratic will of the Irish people, North and South.</p>
            <p eId="para_44"> These law enforcement operations are underpinned by a comprehensive framework of criminal law measures which are being fully utilised by the Garda. I have, however, made it clear to the Commissioner that I will look positively at any legislative changes he may wish to make which would render our efforts more effective. I also draw attention to the recent publication of new legislation to provide for the establishment of a DNA database to assist the Garda Síochána in tackling crime. The intelligence generated will be invaluable to the Garda and will greatly assist in the investigation of a wide range of serious crimes, including homicides.</p>
            <p eId="para_45"> The Deputy will also be aware that the most recent recorded crime statistics, which were released at the end of last month, show that crime is falling in most categories, including homicide, kidnapping, weapons and explosives and drug offences. In fact, total recorded crime was down 8% over the 12 months to the end of June 2013, which reflects well on the work of An Garda Síochána. The crime figures show that those involved in criminal gangs and the evil drugs trade which funds their operations are being robustly opposed, and the Commissioner and I are united in our determination that these efforts will be vigorously maintained.</p>

            <p eId="para_46">I thank the Minister for his response. I wish to focus on three major questions. First, in light of what has happened in recent days, with evidence of young people being shot and their body parts being found in rivers and streams, does the Minister accept that for many of those people life is very cheap?</p>
            <p eId="para_47">When the Garda is tackling these crimes, are there sufficient resources on the ground to deal with the criminals and criminal gangs in question?</p>
            <p eId="para_48"> The Minister mentioned confiscated drugs worth €220 million. I warmly welcome this, but a huge amount of drugs is getting through. The Minister referred to crime rates dropping, but he is referring to reported crime. Much of the gangland crime is under the radar and has not been reported. Communities are being intimidated, as are young people, and this does not even reach the Garda station. How can the Minister respond to these trends in the real world?</p>

            <p eId="para_49">There is no reason to believe crime is reported less or more now than it was in the past. This island endured 30 years of violence perpetrated by subversive groups, in addition to gangland criminals.</p>
            <p eId="para_50"> On the resources issue, I am assured by the Commissioner that the Garda Síochána is devoting all the necessary resources to the investigation and disruption of serious crime. It is wrong to characterise this in any way as a budgetary issue. There have been serious gun and gang crimes for several years in the State, including a higher number of gangland murders when the number of gardaí was higher than it is now. The Deputy will be aware that there are a number of gangs in our midst that will stop at nothing. This demands a determined and targeted response from the Garda and that is what the force is engaged in. I agree with the Deputy that there are individuals engaged in gangland crime for whom life is cheap, who have no moral compass and who are completely and utterly lacking in insight as to the devastation they cause. There are gangs at war with one another. The Garda is targeting these gangs and it has been enormously successful in bringing before the courts individuals engaged in murders on the streets. I condemn totally the barbaric incident to which the Deputy referred and which resulted in the body parts of an individual known to have a criminal background being found in recent days. There is no excuse or explanation of any kind for such conduct. It is of the greatest importance to the Garda that it have the support of all the community in its work.</p>

            <p eId="para_51">The Minister must ensure this matter does not go off the political agenda. Many people, particularly those in disadvantaged communities, seem to believe it has gone off the radar. The gangs must be targeted and driven out of business because they are creating havoc, much of which is not seen and only some aspects are noted in the courts, particularly in sentencing and such issues. Much of the damage is never seen. The destruction of many families and much of the intimidation never reach the headlines.</p>

            <p eId="para_52">From the many arrests that have taken place in recent months and the many successes of the Garda, not only in detecting crime and arresting individuals but also in the seizure of the goods to which I referred, no one could possibly think this matter has gone off the agenda. This is a central agenda of An Garda Síochána and it results in the very specific and successful targeting of gangs and individuals. As the Deputy knows, the difficulty is that when individuals from a gang find themselves sentenced to a term of imprisonment, others appear on the scene and seek to take their place. Gardaí, with great bravery, put their lives at risk in facing individuals who have no moral compass or compunction about taking life. The Garda, with my full support and that of the Commissioner, is extremely effective in tackling the individuals in question, bringing them before the courts and securing convictions.</p>

            <p eId="para_54">For the benefit of those watching, I will outline my question which relates to the work to date of the Insolvency Service of Ireland. My concern arises because we missed a number of deadlines in getting the service up and running. There is a question mark over the appointment of personal insolvency practitioners who numbered so few at the outset of the service.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_26" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality">

            <p eId="para_55">I can advise the Deputy that as of 1 November 2013, a total of 72 personal insolvency practitioners are currently authorised by the Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI. In addition, as of the same date, 18 Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, companies, representing 47 individuals, are authorised to act as approved intermediaries. The location and contact details of approved intermediaries and personal insolvency practitioners are publicly available on the relevant registers on the ISI's website, <i>www.isi.gov.ie</i>. It is expected that the number of authorised approved intermediaries and personal insolvency practitioners will increase further over the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_56"> It might be noted that the ISI has added a statistics page to its website which provides key information such as the number of approved practitioners, the number of information requests to the ISI and associated pertinent information. I am advised that the statistics page will be updated on a monthly basis and I would encourage Deputies to consult that page in order to get the latest information.</p>
            <p eId="para_57"> The ISI began accepting applications for the three new debt relief solutions introduced by the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, as amended, on 9 September 2013. The ISI is currently processing a number of applications. As I have previously advised the Deputy, the ISI has stated that, in the interest of confidentiality, it will not be providing details or breakdowns of the numbers of applications for the various debt relief solutions received or being processed at this time. The ISI fully intends to provide quarterly statistics once a statistically meaningful number of applications have been processed.</p>
            <p eId="para_58"> During the course of the Personal Insolvency Bill's passage through the Oireachtas, I originally indicated provisional estimates of applications in one full year of operation of the three new debt relief solutions to be 15,000 for debt settlement arrangements and personal insolvency arrangements and 3,000 to 4,000 for debt relief notices.</p>
            <p eId="para_59"> It is a welcome development that the Circuit Court recently issued the first protective certificate for a debt settlement arrangement. As the Deputy will be aware, debt settlement arrangements and personal insolvency arrangements are conducted in a two-stage process. The protective certificate at stage one offers a 70-day window for practitioners to develop a proposal to the satisfaction of the debtor and creditors. This means that the first debt settlement arrangements and personal insolvency arrangements will issue in the near future, that is, approximately 70 days after a protective certificate has issued. </p>
            <p eId="para_60">
              <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_61"> The Deputy refers to completed cases in his question. However, given the nature of the processes involved, cases will not actually be completed by the end of the year as the arrangements in question are processes that can range in duration from three years up to seven years. It is important to note that as soon as the protective certificate issues, debtors are protected from any action that creditors, subject to the protective certificate, may be inclined to take.</p>
            <p eId="para_62"> The ISI continues to engage with key stakeholders on a number of issues and is working on standardising a personal insolvency arrangement template, establishing a complaints panel for complaints of improper conduct by personal insolvency practitioners, establishing a personal insolvency practitioner education oversight committee and personal insolvency forum facilitation, the integration of the Office of the Official Assignee and is preparing for the anticipated increase in bankruptcy cases.</p>

            <p eId="para_63">I am sure the Minister will agree that with only 72 personal insolvency practitioners operating, the service is wholly inadequate. If one averages that out across the counties of Ireland, that amounts to only three personal insolvency practitioners per county. There are approximately 120,000 mortgages in arrears of more than 90 days and there is another large cohort of people who are struggling with personal debt. Red C published some interesting statistics in <i>StubbsGazette</i> recently, which estimated that up to 25,000 people will seek to avail of the service. It is wholly inadequate.</p>
            <p eId="para_64"> When the service went live the number of personal insolvency practitioners was extremely low. There are now 72 practitioners registered. What does the Minister intend to do to incentivise more people to become personal insolvency practitioners? As with the old adage, 'justice delayed is justice denied', if people cannot get this service, their problems will not be resolved. It was reported on news bulletins this morning that AIB has come to an arrangement with the Irish Mortgage Holders Association whereby a parallel type debt solution system will operate, outside of the personal insolvency legislation. It will be an independent arbitration process. Will the Minister indicate what he intends to do - assuming he can do something - to increase the number of personal insolvency practitioners in the country?</p>

            <p eId="para_65">I welcome the arrangements that AIB have put in place. One of the great difficulties that all Members on both sides of the House have referenced in recent times has been the slowness of the banks in entering into permanent debt settlement arrangements with their customers. There have been tens of thousands of temporary or interim arrangements entered into but very few permanent arrangements. I always said when the legislation was going through the House that a sign of its success would be if it forced the banks and other financial institutions into finally addressing, on a permanent basis, the indebtedness of individuals who have no possibility of addressing their debt issues unless appropriate arrangements are put in place. The intention always was that the personal insolvency legislation would be used as a last resort, not a first resort. In that context, I welcome the fact that this step has been taken. I hope there are many individuals whose debt issues will be resolved through that process, without having to resort to the personal insolvency legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_66"> As far as I am aware, there are hundreds of cases in the pipeline in the context of work that is being done by personal insolvency practitioners. As my initial reply indicated, more personal insolvency practitioners are expected to be licensed in the coming weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_67">One could also view this morning's news of AIB’s arrangement with the Irish Mortgage Holders' Association, an arrangement set outside of the parameters of the insolvency legislation, as pointing to a perceived failure of the legislation. The point is that the banks still have a veto in the whole process, while all the cards are stacked against those who find themselves in mortgage arrears and who are being strangled by personal debt. How will the Minister get more personal insolvency practitioners? He said he understands there are more in the licensing and application process. What is he doing to incentivise people to become practitioners? There are 120,000 mortgages in arrears of more than 90 days. These people will need to be able to avail of the insolvency service.</p>
            <p eId="para_68"> If the marketplace for personal insolvency practitioners is being controlled by a small number of people, the Minister knows there will be less competition and they will charge more. There is an obligation on the Minister to address this concern. What will he do to address it?</p>

            <p eId="para_74"> The Deputy has been bleating around the House for the past several years, ignoring the fact that his party, when in government, created the disaster that is now affecting the lives of tens of thousands of people. While making his presentation, he was anxious that the banks would engage and resolve mortgage issues. The banks have been engaging for some time with more than 75,000 people who have temporary arrangements in place to facilitate their dealing with financial difficulties with mortgages. The banks, however, have been unnecessarily slow - I have been critical of them in this regard - in putting in place permanent arrangements to address people’s indebtedness in circumstances in which practical outcomes could be brought about.</p>
            <p eId="para_75"> I welcome the fact that the existence of the insolvency legislation has resulted in the development of a mechanism by AIB with the Irish Mortgage Holders' Organisation. I note the individual who heads up the organisation was extremely critical of everything to do with the insolvency legislation. The Deputy can be sure that AIB, or any other financial institution, would not be making a financial contribution of €150,000 to any organisation to independently represent those in financial difficulty whose difficulties need to be addressed by the bank unless they felt they would be put under pressure by the insolvency legislation. I welcome the fact that this has happened, and Deputy Niall Collins should see that as a positive outcome of the enactment of the insolvency legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_76">65. <b>Deputy Thomas Pringle</b> asked the <b>Minister for Justice and Equality</b> his views on the recently published report of the child care law reporting project in cases of children in direct provision; if he will consider allowing families in direct provision to live in the community in the interests of the children and families; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_77">This question arises from the publication of the Child Care Law Reporting Project, which examined 30 cases of child care before the courts. Three of those cases related to asylum seekers and direct provision. In one of the cases, the judge was not happy to allow the children to go back into the care of their mother in direct provision because of the circumstances in which they had to live. Will the Minister consider allowing families with children to move out of direct provision?</p>

            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T14:35:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_78">This question refers to the third volume of reports of proceedings taken under the Child Care Act 1991, which was recently published by the Child Care Law Reporting Project on its website <i>www.childlawproject.ie</i>. The aim of the project, which was established to examine and report on child care proceedings in the courts, is to provide information to the public and to policy makers on child care proceedings and to promote debate. The project aims to report on a sample of approximately 10% of cases taken under the Child Care Act 1991.</p>
            <p eId="para_79"> Three of the cases reported in the third volume related to emergency care orders sought for children in asylum accommodation centres which are operated under contract with the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, of my Department. In all such cases, it is the Health Service Executive, HSE, which makes an application to the court for an emergency care order. The RIA is not a party to the proceedings. In two of the reported cases, the issue was the mental health of the mother; in the remaining case, the issue arose from the detention of the mother.</p>
            <p eId="para_80"> There is no evidence, either from this project or from the HSE, that there are a disproportionate number of cases under the Child Care Act 1991 involving asylum seekers in the direct provision system relative to the population generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_81">Moreover, as with the mental health cases cited in the report, centre managers and RIA's child and family services unit are often in a position where they have a better oversight of a family’s situation than would be the case if the family were residing in the wider community. Even without knowing the full details of these cases, it is clear from the reports that the child protection policy and processes within RIA and the HSE worked properly. Regarding the suggestion that families living in direct provision be allowed to live in the community, it is important to note that of the 4,344 persons living in 34 direct provision centres around the country, approximately two thirds live in family units. The direct provision system remains a necessary feature of the State's asylum and immigration system and I have no plans to end it at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_82"> Since I took up office in March, 2011 the number of persons being accommodated in direct provision has fallen by over 25%.</p>
            <p eId="para_83">
              <i> Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_84"> Nonetheless, I accept that the length of time spent in direct provision accommodation and the complexity of the asylum process are issues that need to be addressed. My resolve, therefore, is to continue to deal with the factors which lead to delays in the processing of cases in order that asylum seekers spend as little time as possible in that accommodation system. An amended Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill will be published next year which will substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements for asylum, subsidiary protection and leave to remain applications. This, along with new arrangements for the processing of subsidiary protection applications, should shorten the process and, thereby, the length of time which asylum seekers must spend in the direct provision system.</p>

            <p eId="para_85">I thank the Minister for his response. Unfortunately, anybody who has worked with asylum seekers and who is familiar with the direct provision system, and all the NGOs involved, knows the direct provision has serious implications for people's mental health. For many years I was involved with a support group in Donegal Town and there were serious mental health issues for the residents in the direct provision hostels there as a direct result of the direct provision system. Earlier today there was a protest outside the gate against institutionalised racism that has taken place in this country and the direct provision system is a very stark example of institutionalised racism where people are not dealt with humanely or as human beings. In some cases children are born into direct provision and have lived under it all their lives. There is no doubt in my mind that direct provision is harmful to the mental health of the residents of the hostels, and many NGOs across this country agree. In the interests of children and their families we should urgently seek to change that.</p>

            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T14:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_86">I reject Deputy Pringle's allegation that direct provision is institutionalised racism. Direct provision provides accommodation to individuals, children and families who claim asylum in this country. Without direct provision they would have no accommodation. Direct provision provides better accommodation than is provided in many other EU member states. It provides not only accommodation but subsistence and additional benefits. Direct provision ensures people have accommodation that is necessary pending their asylum applications being dealt with. I would much prefer if these applications were dealt with much faster.</p>
            <p eId="para_87"> One of the issues is that we have a system whereby one first applies for asylum and if that fails one applies for leave to remain, and if that too fails one might, on humanitarian grounds, be asked to stay. The process is too long and a substantial proportion of those in direct provision are people who have been denied asylum, because it has been determined that they are not in need of asylum but are economic migrants who are challenging those conclusions in the courts by taking judicial review cases. There are more than 1,000 such cases. I want to introduce legislation which allows all these decisions to be made in the first instance without the current long delays, allows those who are genuinely entitled to asylum to stay in our country and be part of the overall community, and allows the State to remove from the country those economic migrants who seek to get around visa and immigration requirements.</p>

            <p eId="para_88">We have been awaiting the legislation the Minister mentioned to streamline and speed up the process since this Government came to power and there is still no sign of it. Many people are in limbo because their cases have come to a standstill while we wait for this legislation. That is further compounding the difficulties they are experiencing. The direct provision system as I have experienced it over 12 years of working with asylum seekers is a system of open prisons.</p>
            <p eId="para_89">It is not a system of which we should be proud, and we should not claim it is better than those of most other European countries. What we should do is to put in place a humane system that would allow people, after a reasonable period of time, to live and participate in the community. This would also encourage integration and go some way towards reducing racism in this country. We should deal with cases expeditiously, and if people must be sent home we should do so quickly rather than putting them through the torture they are going through.</p>

            <p eId="para_90">I remind the Deputy that no individual seeking asylum is required to live in direct provision accommodation. Quite a number of individuals end up living outside that system, but it is there in circumstances in which asylum seekers have no resources of their own.</p>

            <p eId="para_92">The Deputy seems to suggest that every individual who comes to Ireland without a visa, in violation of our immigration laws, and who is an economic migrant should be provided automatically with housing, social welfare payments, free education for their children and free health care. If the Deputy wants between 50,000 and 100,000 economic migrants to descend into this State in circumstances in which the State must meet all these financial obligations, will he identify where the resources will come from to provide for that? What we have is a duty - which I believe is hugely important - to ensure that where an individual is genuinely in need of asylum or protection, the State provides that protection. We have a system that extends that to them and that deals with matters with reasonable speed and allows them to live in the wider community. However, we also have an obligation to everyone who lives in the State to ensure that our systems are not abused.</p>
            <p eId="para_93"> I agree with the Deputy that the production of the legislation has taken an undue length of time, but we will see it in 2014. The delay in producing it has been as a result of the obligations on the State to implement various other legislative measures which have had to be given priority in the Office of the Attorney General.</p>

            <p eId="para_96">Regulation (EC) No. 810/2009 establishing a community code on visas, known as the Visa Code, regulates the EU common visa policy. I am not aware of any formal legislative proposals for reform from the European Commission Directorate-General for Home Affairs, which has responsibility for policy in this area. The Deputy may be referring to an article published by the Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry recently which put forward some proposals in regard to visas and tourism. In any event, the relevant regulation falls within the scope of Title V (Area of Freedom, Justice and Security) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and, therefore, Ireland was not automatically bound by the provisions of the regulation. Ireland has not to date exercised its option to participate in the regulation and does not, consequently, participate in the current common visa policy which is the subject of the Deputy's question. </p>
            <p eId="para_97"> It is long established Government policy that Ireland will only participate in immigration-related measures falling under Title V to the extent that is compatible with the common travel area, CTA, shared by ourselves and the United Kingdom. Participation in the common visa policy would mean that Ireland would, in turn, be required to participate in the Schengen Agreement on border controls. The fact is that the CTA could not continue to operate if Ireland were to participate in the Schengen Agreement while the United Kingdom did not.</p>
            <p eId="para_98"> This is particularly relevant given the Government's focus on maximising to the greatest possible extent the potential of the CTA. This is evidenced by the Irish short-stay visa waiver programme for holders of certain categories of UK visa, which this Government introduced in July 2011. In the 18 months following the introduction of the programme, visits from the countries covered by it increased by approximately 38%. Building on this measure, work is ongoing on the development of short-stay CTA visa arrangements which would allow tourists and business visitors to travel to the CTA, with first arrival in either jurisdiction, and thereafter to travel freely both within the island of Ireland and between Ireland and the UK. In other words, the outer perimeter of the CTA would operate like a mini-Schengen zone. This would represent a historic breakthrough in the manner in which the CTA operates. It is planned for the roll-out of such arrangements to take place in 2014. Prior to their introduction, the necessary technical and operational arrangements, including the capture of biometrics for visa applicants, need to be put in place between the two jurisdictions.</p>
            <p eId="para_99"> All of this having been said, my Department keeps under review Ireland's position as regards all measures adopted under Title V of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in line with Government priorities and policies as necessary and participates in discussions on the common visa policy at the visa working party of the Council.</p>

            <p eId="para_100">With regard to the short-stay visa waiver programme, some time ago the Minister told one of my colleagues that he did not keep data for visitors who had first come through the United Kingdom on a UK visa. Is this still policy? The Minister read a figure showing the increase in tourists from some of the 17 countries involved such as India and China. Clearly he is liaising closely with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, in that regard. It was introduced initially as part of the jobs initiative plan in the middle of 2011. Does the Minister have any intention of changing this and seeing how we can maximise the amount of additional visitors? It was in <i>L'Express</i> that the Commission first mooted this proposal for a wide-ranging programme for the European Union in general for the areas not covered by the Schengen agreement. It was part of the European economic recovery programme to boost tourism revenue by €500 billion.</p>

            <p eId="para_101">I have a simple view which is that we should do whatever is practical and possible to increase the number of tourists and business visitors to the country, but we must do so in the context of agreed arrangements with the United Kingdom for the common travel area. This is the subject of ongoing discussions and as I stated, I expect new announcements to be made in this regard in 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_102"> The Central Statistics Office figures for tourist visas in respect of the countries covered by the visa waiver programme indicate that such visits increased by almost 21% in the 12 months after the introduction of the programme compared to the number in the 12 months preceding it. Comparing the figures for 2010, the last full year before the programme was introduced, with those for 2012, the increase is 38%. The programme has been widely welcomed by tourism promotion agencies and tour operators. The retail sector has stated an increase in tourists from the countries mentioned is visibly apparent and some major retail outlets are now starting to employ individuals with the linguistic skills to facilitate our additional new visitors from some of the relevant countries. I will maintain a continuing interest in considering what we can do to extend the number of visitors to this country and participate closely with our European Union colleagues. We must do this in the context of preserving the common travel area. The last thing we need to do is create a situation where borders will be reimposed between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. These are all important considerations in how we deal with matters.</p>

            <p eId="para_124">The GPSU report dated April 2013 clearly sets out, as one of its 12 concluding recommendations, that an entirely revised fixed charge processing manual, to include the 24 relevant documents the GPSU had to examine to find out what the fixed charge policy actually was, be compiled, distributed and communicated to the Garda Síochána. Unusually, the GPSU report set out a strict time limit of three months for this to happen, but the Minister and the Garda Commissioner have failed to comply with this recommendation. Seven months on all that has issued is a four page circular dated 30 August, almost five months after the date of issue of the report. Will the Minister tell the House when he expects to be able to comply with the GPSU recommendation to revise the fixed charge processing manual-----</p>

            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T14:55:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_126">I propose to take Questions Nos. 77, 87 and 101 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_127"> The report dated April 2013 from the professional standards unit in the Garda Síochána looked at the processes and systems in place for the cancellation of fixed charge processing notices. The report complements the report prepared by Assistant Commissioner John O'Mahoney on his examination of the allegations of irregularities in the operation of the fixed charge processing system. The two reports recommended a number of changes aimed at ensuring tighter administrative procedures were correctly followed throughout the force in the cancellation of fixed charge notices.</p>
            <p eId="para_128"> The two reports were published on my Department's website on 15 May. In publishing the reports I welcomed their recommendations for enhanced safeguards to ensure integrity in the fixed charge processing system.  In addition, in order to provide even further public reassurance on the effectiveness of these changes and with the agreement of the Garda Commissioner, I asked the independent Garda Síochána Inspectorate to review the changes and make any necessary supplementary recommendation and then to review their implementation after 18 months.  The inspectorate is making progress in this work and I expect to receive its report shortly. Its assessment of the recommendations made in the two Garda reports and any further recommendation in this area which it feels is warranted will be put in the public domain via its website.</p>
            <p eId="para_129"> The Garda Commissioner issued a directive with revised cancellation procedures in regard to fixed charge notices to all members of the Garda Síochána on 30 August. The revised fixed charge processing user manual and procedures must await the report of the Garda Inspectorate as it will be necessary to take account of any recommendation from that source. I also provided the two reports for the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for its consideration and advice on any further recommendation or procedural or legislative change which is desirable in this area. I have also consulted my colleague the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport on the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_130"> I am absolutely committed, as is the Commissioner, to the introduction of whatever improvements are necessary to ensure continuing public confidence in the fairness and integrity of the implementation of road traffic laws by the Garda Síochána.</p>

            <p eId="para_131">The Minister did not really explain why it had taken more than the three months the GPSU had set down. One could be forgiven for thinking the recommendations of the GPSU have been disregarded by the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_132">When the GPSU issued its 12 recommendations, the Minister chose seven and stated that they contained vague principles with which he could possibly work and to which he could perhaps give consideration. Does he have the appetite to give a commitment - on the record of the House - to the effect that he will implement the 12 recommendations set out in the GPSU report? I accept that matters take time but given that the GPSU imposed a strict time limit of three months, I am baffled as to why - some seven months later - nothing has been done. One could be forgiven for thinking that there is a lack of seriousness on the part of the Minister in the context of dealing with the recommendations of the GPSU.</p>

            <p eId="para_135">The Garda Commissioner issued his instructions on 30 August in order to ensure that the relevant procedures would be tightened up and that any issue of concern would be addressed. I am sure that when it has completed the work it is undertaking, the Garda inspectorate will report to me. When we receive that report, it will be considered with the utmost seriousness. In the meantime, the Deputy may rest assured that the relevant issues of concern were addressed in the Garda Commissioner's report on 30 August. The Deputy was not in the House earlier when I made reference to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the acceptance by the Garda Commissioner of the recommendations made by him. The matter has substantially moved on but it appears the Deputy may be locked in something of a political time warp, particularly as he feels the need to continually and obsessively raise and pursue this issue on each occasion on which I am present to reply to questions to the Department of Justice and Equality.</p>

            <p eId="para_140">As I was saying, I am somewhat taken aback that the Minister would ever be of the view that I might think the worst of him. That is a little unfair. All I am seeking to do is ensure that a level of accountability will be introduced in the context of certain aspects of policing. I apologise for not being present earlier and for missing the Minister's reply to an earlier question. Will he confirm whether GSOC has direct access to the PULSE computer system? It may have been granted such access but I have not heard whether that is the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_141"> Does the Minister have any intention of publishing the appendices to the internal review that was carried out in respect of the penalty points episode? Rather than being informed that someone said that X or Y happened, we would love to know from where the evidence came and the facts relating to the position on this matter. It is bad enough that the report was carried out internally and was not independent. It would be good if we could identify from where the relevant evidence came. I do not think the worst of the Minister at all. I have actually met worse individuals than him.</p>

            <p eId="para_142">I appreciate that the Deputy is in search of his appendix. The appendix to the report was made available to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in order to facilitate any deliberations in which it may engage in the context of dealing with the O'Mahoney report. Unless I am very much mistaken, I presume this is the appendix to which the Deputy refers. It is the responsibility of the joint committee to report on the material it has received and to hold any hearings it deems appropriate. As I stated earlier and as the Deputy would know had he been present, should the joint committee make any recommendations on foot of any deliberations in which it might engage, these will be considered with great seriousness.</p>

            <from>Deputy Clare Daly<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_143">The problem with the Minister's answer is that the relevant information has been in the public domain for months. What has emerged in the interim is a new four-page circular in which it is acknowledged that all was not well in the state of Denmark. Said acknowledgement runs contrary to the Minister's assertion to the effect that everything was fine. Changes were recommended but what the GPSU suggested, namely, that an entire set of procedures should be introduced and made available to all on the website, has not come to pass.</p>
            <p eId="para_144">The other problem the Minister has is that one of the individuals who blew the whistle on this issue is out of a job, while the other is not entitled to do his job appropriately because he drew attention to this matter. The Minister indicated that if there were problems they would be addressed, and that procedures had been tightened up. The problem with his statement is that he also told us there were no problems with the procedures in the first instance. We are telling him again that there were problems with procedures, as has been acknowledged by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Garda Professional Standards Unit and many other organisations. There is still a problem and the Minister has not addressed it or given a commitment to do so, as he said he would.</p>

            <p eId="para_147">The position is simply that important changes were required to address issues that had arisen, as I made explicit and as the O'Mahoney report detailed, and in respect of which proper procedures were not complied with in some instances. In this regard, disciplinary action has been taken against some members of the Garda. I described as exotic some of the substantive decisions made where procedures were properly complied with. However, some of the more serious allegations that were made - for example, that road fatalities resulted and people lost their lives because of Garda failures in this area - proved to be untrue and unsubstantiated. One of the individuals to whom the Deputy referred retired from the force and was not pushed out, as the Deputy put it.</p>

            <p eId="para_150">The Minister has made incredibly derogatory remarks about somebody who served his time as a garda. His comments amount to a complete dismissal of the difficulty that a serving garda is currently enduring in seeking to carry out his job. The Minister can hide behind various smart-alec remarks but the reality is that he has not committed to the measures he said he would introduce to address these issues. The reports that were commissioned, including the O'Mahoney report, sought at every stage to minimise and downplay the claims made by the individuals in question, and the Minister is continuing that tradition today.</p>

The Garda Commissioner made it very clear that measures had been implemented and steps taken to ensure proper procedures are applied in dealing with an issue that is of importance and that I regard as important.

            <p eId="para_170">I am pleased to inform the Deputy that planning for Ireland's first national missing persons day is at an advanced stage with an inaugural event to be held at Farmleigh House, Dublin on the morning of Wednesday, 4 December 2013. I am pleased we have been able to advance rapidly a proposal from Davis College and missing persons representative groups, who also sought such an event. The initiative of Davis College was extremely important.</p>
            <p eId="para_171"> The missing persons day is being developed with a number of objectives. First and foremost, it is intended the day will recognise and remember those who have gone missing and the lasting trauma and impact on their families and friends. The day will also draw public attention to open or unsolved missing persons cases with the possibility that new information may come to light. It is also intended to highlight information on the range of support services available and to recognise the contribution of the voluntary groups that provide support in the community to families, as well as the many organisations involved in land, mountain, sea and river rescue. It is also my intention to promote the proposal I made during the Irish Presidency for a European-wide event and to call attention to Ireland's missing persons day as the basis for similar initiatives across Europe. We have had contacts with a number of our European partner countries in this context. I look forward to joining the Garda Commissioner, the families and friends of missing persons, and the many voluntary organisations working in our communities on this important occasion of remembrance and support.</p>

            <p eId="para_173">In the context of the planning for the event, we are engaging generally in the lead-in to it with the media and we hope the broadcast and print media will be encouraged to contribute to the importance of the event and to draw attention to individuals who are missing in the hope that information will be made available to the Garda Síochána or family members. In the days leading up to the event, I hope there will be increased public knowledge in the area to the benefit of the families concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_174"> It is my hope that this will be the first event of this nature. It is my hope that, as our European Union colleagues look in, we can get to the point where we agree a missing persons day across the European Union. When people go missing in Ireland, it may well be that they are in other European Union countries. Engagement across the EU of the broadcast and print media may well result in the whereabouts of individuals becoming known when their whereabouts have not been known for some time. I look forward to the event. After the event on the designated day, I look forward to feedback about changes or initiatives that we should include in the event when we run it for the second year.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T15:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_175">People are angry enough with the decision of the Government to double the property tax in 2014. Many people face bills of on average €400 and many face bills of €600 and beyond. People became even more angry and annoyed with the letters that issued from Revenue last week in respect of the method of paying the property tax. Essentially, those who wish to pay by debit card or credit card will have to pay four months earlier and must pay the 2014 property tax in 2013. Notwithstanding the anger of people, it will have an impact on a fragile domestic economy, coming into the critical period of Christmas time when spending power is everything and consumer sentiment is so important.</p>
          <p eId="para_176"> The response of the Government has been incoherent and almost split down the middle. The Labour Party has taken a stance of calling in the Revenue and the Tánaiste saying it should change its policy. The Taoiseach has stood firm, while the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, is nonplussed and cannot understand what Revenue is at. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have supported Revenue. The reason is that the Taoiseach said the Government sets policy and the Revenue implements it. The Taoiseach is correct in that respect. The legislative template, in the form of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act, gave the framework for Revenue to issue letters in respect of credit and debit cards. The policy is wrong because the legislation was rushed. It was rammed through the Dáil with no time for people to tease out issues in the Bill or table amendments. It is a good example of why the Government should not have rushed through the legislation, given the lack of a deadline.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">The questions I have to put to the Taoiseach are as follows. Will the Taoiseach clarify for me whether he, the Minister for Finance or the Department of Finance were aware that these letters were to be issued by Revenue?</p>
          <p eId="para_178"> Second, does he agree that those who wish to pay by credit or debit card should be able to do so in 2014 and does he agree to bring forward an amendment to the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012? If the Labour Party believes that the policy is wrong and that those who are obliged to pay a bill for 2014 should not be required to pay that in 2013, the Government can table an amendment to section 12(1) of the Act to ensure that Revenue not require any person to make payment prior to 1 January of the year following the liability date regardless of the payment method that he or she chooses. It is simple and straightforward. Would the Taoiseach agree to such an amendment which would clarify this, once and for all, and put the policy framework right?</p>

          <p eId="para_180">First, I thank those who have paid their property charges for 2013 for the half-year that applies. As Deputy Martin will be aware, this property charge was introduced instead of income tax increases as an important element of growing the economy and funding local services.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> It is important to clear up a number of matters here. The tax for 2014 is due in 2014. There is no legal obligation on anybody to pay any property charge for 2014 in the remaining weeks of this year. It does not prevent somebody from doing so, if he or she wishes.</p>
          <p eId="para_182"> I would remind Deputy Martin that section 119 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, as amended, sets out the dates for payment of the local property tax and for the year 2014, the payment due date is 1 January 2014. The legislation also makes provisions for property owners to pay the tax for 2014 in equal instalments over the period, 1 January 2014 to the end of December 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_183"> The Minister for Finance has made it perfectly clear that the preference of the Government and the Department of Finance is to receive the payments for 2014 in 2014 and there are a number of options set out there by the Revenue Commissioners so that persons can give effect to that principle in the law, that the 2014 property tax is due in 2014 and not now.

          <p eId="para_193"> I would point out to Deputy Martin that there is a difference between the debit card and the debit mandate. For those who go online, they can choose the option of giving the Revenue Commissioners authority to have a debit mandate, which is effective from 21 March 2014, where all they must do is put in their sort code and bank account number because those who have a chequebook, a credit card or a debit card must have a bank account. Therefore, the simplest way, as one of the many options available, is to give that authorisation as a debit mandate, effective from 21 March, for payment of the property charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_194"> Nobody has to pay the 2014 property charge in 2013. Deputy Cowen may laugh at it, but that is the fact of what the law is and persons have numerous options to give effect to that.</p>

          <p eId="para_202">As an aside, the Taoiseach might explain all of that to the Tánaiste and to the Chairman to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Ciarán Lynch, who, off his own bat, went off and stated he was hauling in the Revenue because something terrible had happened and something needed to change. Likewise, the Tánaiste said the same. That incoherence has been at the heart of Government on this topic. Would the Taoiseach explain it to the Tánaiste in the first instance?</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> There is an issue here in terms of payment method. That is the core of the point. If one pays by debit or credit card, one will be paying this year and one will be penalised for choosing that particular method of payment. There was no basis for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> Simply, the Government can amend the legislation, if the Tánaiste is serious. There is no point in dragging in the chairman of the Revenue before a committee and having an optical exercise showing how the Government is great in fighting on behalf of the people when the answer lies in the Tánaiste's hands in terms of amending the legislation by stating that Revenue shall not require anyone to pay the property tax in 2013 by virtue of the particular payment method that he or she adopts.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> There is an important reason for this, which is that the domestic economy is still fragile and needs maximum consumer spend coming into Christmas. The reality is the Government is taking more money out of the economy as a result of this than is necessary at this particular point in time.</p>

          <p eId="para_279">Mar a duirt an Teachta Martin, le laethanta beaga anuas tá neart daoine ag léiriú a gcuid mearbhaill i leith an cháin mhaoine áitiúil. Tá a fhios ag an Taoiseach gurb í sin an fhírinne. Tá saoránaigh trasna an Stáit faoi a lán brú faoi láthair. Go háirithe, elderly citizens and those who are struggling financially are in a state of distress after receiving letters from the Revenue Commissioners demanding payment of the 2014 property tax bill - the very unjust family home tax - by the end of this month. That is a fact. Contrary to the Taoiseach's protestations, that is what is in the letter. The Revenue Commissioners have reportedly issued 960,000 of these letters. The Tánaiste has said that the Revenue needs to reconsider the payment deadline. I am a huge fan of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and I marvel at his communications skills and his intellectual ability, but he has confessed that he cannot explain the Revenue letter. An Teachta Martin makes the case that this policy is wrong because it was rushed; the policy is wrong because it is wrong. It is totally and absolutely unfair. The Taoiseach misses the point if he avoids the issue of this very unfair property tax. It is unfair to ask people to pay next year's tax this year but it is also unfair to ask people to pay tax on their family homes and get no return for it in terms of local services. The fundamental unfairness is rooted in his Government's austerity policy. I also wish to give the Taoiseach the opportunity to answer the question he failed to answer earlier. Was the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance aware that the Revenue Commissioners were going to demand that those who have to pay or who choose to pay this tax by debit card or credit card pay it this year? That is a very straightforward question. Was the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance aware that citizens who wished to pay by credit or debit card would be asked to pay this year?</p>

          <p eId="para_293">-----but I was well aware that the Revenue Commissioners had sent the letters to people who were not on direct debits and for whom there would be no change in the system because those payments would continue. It was necessary for the Revenue Commissioners, in their independence, to remind people that the 2014 property tax is due and due only in 2014. There was no intention - as has been said in some quarters - to execute some sort of Government money-grab before the end of 2013. The Minister for Finance has made it perfectly clear that the preference of the Department of Finance and of the Government is to have a steady stream of income through 2014. The seven options set out in the letter from the Revenue Commissioners allow people to do that. I will repeat for Deputy Adams, as I did for Deputy Martin, that payment of the 2014 property tax is due from 1 January 2014 only and can be spread out in a variety of ways or by single debit mandate effective from 21 March 2014. Again, I thank all those people who paid their property taxes in 2013 for the half year in a variety of ways. All the Revenue Commissioners have said is that they have asked people to let them know which payment option is being chosen, which will allow payment of the property tax in 2014.</p>

If I understand his answer - when we eventually got around to it - he said he was aware that the letter would be sent to those not paying by direct debit. Therefore, he did know. He was aware that the letter was going to go out to 960,000 citizens demanding that they pay the tax before the end of the year, because that is what it says in the letter. This is a very controversial issue. The Taoiseach may think it is done and dusted, but this is a very controversial tax. It is a very blunt, unjust and unfair revenue-raising exercise.</p>

          <p eId="para_304">The issue with rates in the North is that people get services for those rates. When this was introduced the Taoiseach promised that 80% of the money collected through the property tax would go to support local services. Last week he reneged on that promise. People will not get any benefit in local services by paying this very unfair tax. This is the first admission that the Taoiseach knew this. Did the Tánaiste not know it? Did the Tánaiste not see the letter? Did the Tánaiste not know what was coming? Why did the Tánaiste then ask for the deadline to be relaxed? Why has the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, a member of a Government party, called the Revenue Commissioners in to explain all of this? This is the Taoiseach's law and his tax. Once again, it is austerity, austerity, austerity. I ask the Taoiseach for a yes-or-no answer. Will he not now acknowledge that austerity is designed to run down wages, to do away with social protections, to do away with the social and economic rights of citizens? Will he not now accept that austerity is wrong, unjust and unfair?</p>

          <p eId="para_349">Last week's web summit demonstrated the huge opportunities for Ireland in digital technology. It is very important for our economic recovery and future prosperity that we are a global leader in technology and, critically, are recognised as such internationally. Unfortunately, a very important piece of Government policy is putting this at risk - the continued reduction in funding to third level institutions such as colleges and universities. As the Taoiseach knows, Government funding this year for third level institutions will fall by €25 million. We all welcome the creation of new jobs such as those announced at the summit, but if we want to see these announcements continue, we must start to have a very honest conversation about what is happening in the education sector. In the same week as the web summit the OECD released a report on adult education in Ireland and what it indicates should be taken very seriously. Among 24 assessed countries, in the literacy section we came 17th; more worryingly for the future of the technology sector in Ireland, in the section on numeracy we were ranked 19th. Three years ago we had two universities ranked in the top 100 in the world, but now we have none. The one university which managed to move up the rankings this year, UCD, got to 161st place and its president, Dr. Hugh Brady, stated in the <i>Irish Independent</i>:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_350">A tipping point has been reached. The State must now either choose to empower its higher education institutions to compete with the world's best or continue to pursue a policy of central "command and control" and underfunding.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">I am not sure people understand the extent of the underfunding. If one tracks State funding per student in our third level institutions, between 2008 and what is projected in 2015 under the Government's plan, the level of funding will halve. No country can aspire-----</p>

          <p eId="para_357">We cannot aspire to being a global leader in technology while halving the level of funding per student. I hope the Taoiseach agrees. He got a ride in Elon Musk's car to the summit and I am sure he heard him say that for technology companies, there must be engineers. Does the Taoiseach agree with Mr. Musk that for Ireland to continue to build its reputation in this area, we must have engineers and graduates of science, technology, engineering and mathematics? Does he agree that these graduates must be among the best in the world? Does he agree, therefore, that it is essential for us to stop the continued cuts in funding for third level institutions? Will he reverse the latest €25 million cut in the budget?</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_358">Last weekend was a signal moment in the sense that Ireland was recognised as one of the leading global centres of the digital technology world. For all those involved in the digital web summit in Dublin, it sent an international message of absolute excellence. Many of the people I met from all over the world would belie the argument made by the Deputy about the quality of our young people and graduates, particularly their innovative capacity and entrepreneurial skills. Many of the people involved in smaller companies might see their work explode in terms of its global reach in the next few years.</p>
          <p eId="para_359"> I agree very much with the Deputy that this issue requires some considerable debate in the Oireachtas. Central command and control has always been with the Department of Education and Skills, although the various third level colleges, universities and institutes of technology raise very considerable sums outside the remit of the State. We can consider what is happening in universities across the country, by way of expansion in the areas of science and engineering, as well as relationships formed in various parts of the world, including the Far East, the Middle East, the United States, etc., which means that there are very encouraging signs. It is true that we must get our act together for colleges of technology in terms of technicians. It is important that we supply engineers from our universities and that there be a relationship between the world of academia and the commercial sphere. There are massive online open courses, or MOOCs, which will change the way education is structured in the next decade. Lecturers will not be in the position they have been in up to now and will have to become much more observant mentors of students because of the vast quantity of information available for students of any subject. The relationship will change.</p>
          <p eId="para_360"> When I speak to people in companies investing in Ireland or when Enterprise Ireland is dealing with young companies exporting services, we can see how they are blown away by the capacity of our young entrepreneurs to measure up. No matter how hight the bar is set, young Irish people can meet the challenge. It is very important that we understand the fundamental importance of having quality engineers coming from our universities and technicians from the institutes of technology. We must move on to get the best from all of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">Considerable amounts are raised outside the State in terms of support for third level colleges. The basis of the Deputy's case merits discussion because it is all about jobs and opportunities for the future and I share strongly that sentiment.</p>

          <p eId="para_362">I thank the Taoiseach for taking the matter seriously. I urge him to examine the issue in the current budget. It is one of the issues that is going below the radar in this country, that year-on-year we are eroding the funding to third level institutions. The presidents of those universities are saying loudly, clearly and publicly that something must change. Dr. Hugh Brady has described it as a tipping point. I spoke to the ex-president of one of our biggest universities recently, who described the process of the continued reduction in funding and cuts as the asset stripping of our third level system. We know that universities are pulling back on teaching resources and research and development activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> I was in a fantastic start-up company this morning in UCD, the NovaUCD centre. What those involved are doing is coating material that will be used on a satellite the European Space Centre will soon send up to explore the sun.</p>

          <p eId="para_365">I said I would be talking to the Taoiseach later today and asked what message I should give. I was asked to say that this employer is continuing to hire some of our good graduates in spite of Government policy. The person said that investment is required and that we need more connection between small businesses and universities. The universities cannot continue to fuel the future economic growth of this country if we in this Parliament halve the per student funding over a seven year period. I would very much welcome the Taoiseach's response to my question. Will he take a look, specifically, at the €25 million that is meant to come out of budget 2014?</p>

          <p eId="para_366">The budget will stand. I was in the University of Limerick recently where the Bernal project - J. D. Bernal was a world famous engineer from Nenagh many years ago - is under way. It is funded in part by Atlantic Philanthropies. The intention is to bring in ten world class researchers - five of whom are <i>in situ</i>. The project will have a significant output. I have been in UCD, Trinity College, UCG and UCC and all of them look forward in their own way to the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_367"> Grangegorman in Dublin city centre will be the forerunner of a new kind of technological university in the country. That is why it is important that colleges of technology get together in terms of their specialties, as they see them, to gain technological university status for the future. It is very important that they engage in that process. Otherwise, the world will pass us by. I see opportunities for considerable numbers of technicians graduating from institutes of technology and engineers of exceptional quality coming from universities. The future is very bright when one relates that to the cluster movement between the world of academia and the commercial world. All of those people who were in Dublin last weekend see Ireland as a melting pot for ideas for change and transformation for the future. Let us have a discussion about the matter in due course. I respect the sentiment of what Deputy Donnelly said but in response to his question, the budget decision in respect of university funding will not be reversed.</p>

            <p eId="para_396">The final sentence in the reply speaks volumes. The Economic Management Council, which is composed of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform met 11 times, which is a multiple of many of the other committees. Is it the case that in this Government, Cabinet committees are surplus to requirement because the EMC has assumed such dictatorial powers? It appears that it is frog-marching the Government in whatever direction it wishes. Is that not obvious from what happened in 2011 when the president of the European Central Bank, Mr. Trichet, screamed at the Taoiseach and dictated that he would not burn bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank or that an economic bomb would go off under him in Dublin? The Taoiseach capitulated in an hour without reference to the Cabinet, which apparently had agreed that such burning of bondholders would take place. What is the purpose of the committees when any decisions or reports they make to the Cabinet can be apparently overturned by a very short meeting, perhaps even in the corridor, of the Economic Management Council? Where does that leave any role for the democratic input of elected representatives in this country?</p>

            <p eId="para_397">When I was elected as Taoiseach I examined the issue and I found that Cabinet sub-committees used to meet on an irregular basis perhaps once a quarter. Given the state of affairs in a number of areas I felt it was appropriate that we should devote one day in the month exclusively to Cabinet sub-committees. I do that on a Monday from 8.30 a.m. right through until 6 p.m. I find it is a very effective way to focus on a number of issues in regard to the remit of any of the Cabinet sub-committees. I find they are more valued now than they ever have been because people are subject to timelines and therefore focused on particular issues to move them along and not let them drift, as might happen if they meet only on an irregular basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_398"> The answer to Deputy Higgins’s question is that Cabinet sub-committees are more important than ever from my point of view and we devote a particular focus to issues relevant to each of them on one Monday every month. I could not do it effectively, given the proceedings of the Dáil, on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. I find the sub-committees very effective in terms of being able to move issues along.</p>
            <p eId="para_399">The EMC is not a dictatorship. It is a facility whereby the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I consider emerging issues that need to be dealt with. If we make a recommendation, we bring it to the Cabinet to make a full formal decision, if appropriate.</p>

            <p eId="para_404">I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. That the social policy committee has met only twice sums up the orientation of Government policy. The social policy committee exists to oversee the broad thrust of the Government's decisions in this area. An objective assessment of the past three budgets by the ESRI and others clearly demonstrates that they have been weighted against the weaker sections of society, including those on the lowest incomes and the most vulnerable. The budgets have been fundamentally regressive and unfair. That the committee has met only twice is a factor in all this.</p>
            <p eId="para_405"> In recent weeks, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, launched a media campaign to present themselves as the leaders of a clampdown on welfare abuse. The Taoiseach published a major article on this. He said he personally was driving forward this agenda. While everybody supports attempts to deal with fraud in the social welfare system, we should be honest and realise this campaign is more about politics than substance.</p>

            <p eId="para_407">It is a distraction from the mean and petty cuts to health and social supports. In this regard, one should bear in mind what has happened in the budget in the areas of health and social policy, and the lack of any proofing of the budget's measures affecting single or separated parents, for example. The tax credit allowance was taken, which can impose a hit on families in the order of €2,500 to €3,000. This is a very severe hit on top of other welfare cuts.</p>

            <p eId="para_421">I will do that and will be very effective. By the way, Standing Orders did affect questions last week very substantially, as the Ceann Comhairle knows. Deputies are already complaining about the limitation on time now. It is all designed to give the Government pre-eminence in the Chamber and to reduce accountability. That is the key point. I am referring to social policy. The committee meets only twice. Fine Gael is operating according to an old-school Tory strategy, which is basically to attack those on low incomes. That the deputy leader of the Labour Party is a party to it is a problem.</p>

            <p eId="para_424">The Cabinet committee on social policy met on six occasions this year, namely 11 February, 12 February, 15 April, 24 June, 22 July and 30 September. It is due to meet again on 25 November, this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_425"> The Deputy may well ask the role of the Cabinet committee on social policy. It provides a basis for cross-departmental co-ordination in the areas of social inclusion, poverty reduction and service delivery. There is a sense of coherence across various Departments in that they are not all individual entities. The committee has the key task of driving social policy commitments in the programme for Government. Essentially, the committee focuses on the fairness objectives and the social policy priorities in Government for National Recovery 2011–2016. It assesses and presents Government options or alternative measures to achieve better outcomes and to address barriers to achieving social policy priorities. It guides the development and management of cross-departmental activities and prioritises service delivery in a range of areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_426"> Through the social policy committee recommendations, the Government has protected the primary weekly social welfare rates, put in place a proactive approach for people who are unemployed through the provision of a radically transformed system for employment services, Intreo. This amalgamates staffs from community welfare offices, social welfare offices and FÁS. If one visits any of the services - in Dundalk or Sligo or in the others to follow - one will note a remarkable transformation in the way people on the live register are engaged with, both individually and as groups. A social inclusion clause is now required for so many capital works approved to take people off the live register who are capable of doing a very good job. This is demonstrated by a drop, over 16 consecutive months, in the number on the live register, which is now below 400,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_427"> There was analysis in the run-in to the referendum on children's rights. Child protection was strengthened through the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 and the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Adults) Act 2012. That was processed through the social policy committee. It published the national implementation framework of the value for money and policy review of the disability services programme. It committed €2.5 million through its recommendation to fund a new area-based approach to child poverty. It completed 43 surveys on school patronage, launched new junior cycle reforms and increased time spent on literacy and numeracy in all primary schools. It launched a comprehensive action plan on bullying and ended the practice of sending 16-year-olds to St. Patrick's institution. It was behind a new combined community service programme and commenced a strategic review of penal policy. Eighty-one citizenship ceremonies were held, at which 42,275 applicants were granted a certificate of naturalisation. People will recall that a person who qualified for naturalisation used to have to attend at the District Court or Circuit Court and could have had his or her application processed in the middle of cases taken for various misdemeanours. That has all changed. The committee published National Positive Ageing Strategy, a very important document given the ageing population. It published the national disability strategy implementation plan and announced a package of measures to address alcohol misuse arising from the report of the substance misuse strategy group. That report will be debated in the Dáil on Friday. The present discussion-----</p>

            <p eId="para_429">I cannot answer that for the Deputy now but will revert to the Deputy on when it is expected to be available for publication.</p>
            <p eId="para_430"> Committee priorities concluded advancing the work on publishing the strategy dealing with dementia, which is so important. It continued to advance legislation for the Child and Family Support Agency, which will take over the responsibilities from the HSE on 1 January and progress the legislation to put Children First guidance on a statutory basis. Another objective is making progress on the implementation of the early actions on the national literacy strategy, including the appointment of literacy and numeracy advisers to support teachers and the development of the new education passport to alert schools where a student requires additional supports on having transferred from another school. This has been around for a while.</p>
            <p eId="para_431"> In respect of alcohol misuse, the Government approved the drafting of the legislation in the form of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill to provide for minimum unit pricing for retailing of alcohol products.</p>
            <p eId="para_432">That cannot come into effect until the court case currently before the European Commission, taken as a result of a decision by the Scottish Assembly, is dealt with. Other areas relate to the advertising and marketing of alcohol, with the intention of limiting advertising of alcohol on television to evening hours from 2016 and so forth. We are also dealing with the regulation of sports sponsorship - specifically, devising a way to place the existing voluntary code on sports sponsorship on a statutory footing. The Department of the Taoiseach is chairing a group which will discuss and report within 12 months on the question of sports sponsorship in the longer term. </p>
            <p eId="para_433"> These are just some of the issues that the Cabinet committee on social policy has engaged with recently. Clearly, the committee deals with a volume of complex and sometimes sensitive work. It is certainly much more effective than it used to be, when meetings were held on a very irregular basis, with no real focus or requirement to get things done.</p>

            <p eId="para_434">Does the Taoiseach agree that it would seem extraordinary to most people that the social policy committee has met only once since the recess, particularly in the context of a draconian budget that had severe effects, with further cuts to those dependent on social protection payments? In that regard and against a background of just under 400,000 people who are unemployed or seriously underemployed, with many living in very difficult circumstances, it betokens very little concern for that segment of our people. Is it not the case that the Minister for Health is a member of the social policy committee? Is it not incredible, with the crisis facing tens of thousands of people whose medical cards have been withdrawn, that this matter has not been deemed sufficient to call an emergency meeting of the committee, if this committee is worthy of its name and really dealing with social policy? The reality is that the troika, as an agent for the European financial markets, has far more input into social policy in this country than any social committee of the Cabinet which is supposed to represent the elected Government of this country. That is the reality and is manifest in the savage cuts the Government has made to young people's jobseeker's allowance, to maternity benefit and so forth.</p>
            <p eId="para_435"> I ask the Taoiseach to stop repeating the mendacious statement that core rates of social welfare have not been cut or hit by this Government. For young people aged between 22 and 25, the small amount they receive in jobseeker's allowance is very much a core payment. It gives them a life that is far from that of a Cabinet Minister in terms of income and lifestyle, but that is the reality and the cut is a savage blow. Similarly, there is the cut to maternity benefit, which is a core payment for young women who are expecting children and trying to survive in the face of the plethora of taxes and cuts this Government and the previous one under Fianna Fáil and the Green Party have imposed on them. The same is true of the cut to rent supplement. The Taoiseach should at least do us the favour of explaining how language has changed suddenly to allow him to make such statements and square them with the reality of what people are experiencing due to the austerity his Government is inflicting upon them.</p>

            <p eId="para_436">Deputy Higgins is right to refer to those aged between 22 and 25, but what do they want? They want an opportunity to have a decent job, to better themselves and get to a different place if they are unemployed. The fact is that the number on the live register, which was almost at 500,000 when this Government took office, has now gone below 400,000. This year, 113,000 people left the live register and while many were replaced by others, that illustrates the extent of movement in the labour market.</p>

            <p eId="para_439">Unfortunately for Deputy Higgins, core payment rates in social protection have been protected. In the recent budget, the Minister for Finance provided €500 million in incentives for small businesses to improve and develop opportunities to take on extra staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_440"> Today the Minister for Education and Skills attended the first meeting of SOLAS, which replaces FÁS. I like to think we can engage in a very different way with young people. That is why incentives have been put in place specifically for unemployed young people who might want to start their own businesses. They will have the opportunity to claim back up to €40,000 in income tax paid in previous years. It is also important to ask what the economy will be built on in the future. It will be built on small and medium-sized enterprises. It is a lot easier to have 50 small firms take on 20 extra staff apiece than to continuously attempt to land big companies with 1,000 jobs, welcome though they are. In that sense, the budget was unashamedly focused on the opportunity for job creation. Those young people about whom Deputy Higgins rightly speaks deserve to be engaged with properly and not just seen as a statistic on the live register. We should not just say to them, "Come in and sign for your dole and then go away." It is different now because there is an engagement with them. They are asked what is their experience, what it is they would like to do, what course they would like to follow-----</p>

            <p eId="para_468">I am astounded by this. If the social policy committee had met more often, the budget would not have been unfair to old people or disproportionately and dramatically unfair to single parents. The hit the latter group will take on tax credits is extraordinary and shows that there was no poverty-proofing by any social policy committee. The savings of €666 million to €1 billion in the health sector were not proofed by the social policy committee. Policy on discretionary medical cards was changed in the budget, meaning that people with multiple conditions, some with motor neuron disease, have to obtain letters from professors in various clinics to get their medical cards back. Even last week, people were still getting letters informing them their medical cards were to be withdrawn. The taxing of maternity benefit would not have happened either if there had been a strong social policy dimension informing and poverty-proofing the budget. Where was the social policy committee of the Cabinet when all of these decisions were being made?</p>
            <p eId="para_469"> I hold no brief for any other Deputy in the House. However, more honest language would be more appropriate. Taking €44 from young people is not about creating jobs. The majority of young people want to work. However, the Taoiseach said in his earlier replies to Deputies that they really did not want work and that the only way to get them a job was to take €44 from them. In the budget this measure was described as a new rate that would apply to 18 to 21 year olds and it was stated it would now apply to those over 21 years. It is insulting of the Government to tell people that it does not believe they want a job and cut their social welfare rate by €44. What the Government is actually doing is trying to raise revenue. It would be better if the Taoiseach were more honest and admitted that this was what it was about. However, dressing it up as a job activation measure is dishonest. </p>
            <p eId="para_470"> Will the social policy committee be meeting more often? The one big fact which blows a hole in the Taoiseach’s proposition of the so-called youth guarantee is that there are only about 18,000 places available through it when there are 66,000 young people unemployed. It is very dishonest and insulting to young people to tell them that their welfare payment is being cut by €44 to get them working when there are insufficient job placements or social welfare inspectors to assist them in these placements. It is all a mirage, rhetoric and spin.</p>

Please, will he call it this and not anything else? Will he not dress it up as something to do with job activation when it patently has nothing to do with this? If he was more honest and upfront with people about the decisions the Government has made, he might get more respect. Will the social policy committee meet more frequently to give a stronger social dimension to the budget proposals that have been emerging and ensure the next budget will not be as regressive and unfair as the past three have been?

            <p eId="para_483">The health committee met three times to deal with health issues and actually called in the HSE to ask it about the position on dealing with the exceptional cases of refusals of medical cards and appliances as highlighted on television and radio and in the newspapers. It asked how it would sort out a system that would work effectively and in a caring way for those who needed medical cards.</p>
            <p eId="para_484"> In 2013 the social policy committee met six times and is due to meet again on 27 November. It will continue to meet in the new year and beyond.</p>
            <p eId="para_485"> Everyone recognises that a system in which young men and women leave secondary school and get on to the conveyor belt of unemployment assistance only to be left there is not healthy for society or the young people in question. When Deputy Martin is going around the country, he should pay a visit to an Intreo office to see how it engages with people now. Those on the live register are asked what job they would like to do, what experience they have and what courses or apprenticeships they would like to take. Supports are then provided for them accordingly.</p>
            <p eId="para_486"> The numbers of young people in work have increased in the past 12 months. It is not all down to emigration, as some claim all the time. We are now in a happier position, with in excess of 3,000 jobs a month being created in the private sector. Last week at the Dublin web summit I noted the energy coming from the young people and companies in attendance. Some will fail, but some will succeed to an enormous extent. Owing to the fact there has been an increase of 30,000 people in employment since we launched An Action Plan for Jobs, I want to see the Government in 2014 focus relentlessly on what else can we do to create employment. We need to ensure small and medium-sized enterprises, the indigenous economy, know what State agency supports are available to them and the incentive for them to take people off the live register. I have great faith in the measure introduced by the Minister for Finance for the reconstruction sector. Many qualified tradesmen and smaller contractors, over 100,000 of whom were unemployed in the past few years, will be able to find work with a tax credit over two years. This will also assist those householders who want to avail of energy conservation retrofitting. This measure will pay dividends across the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_487"> Employers told us the tax relief scheme for taking on workers from the live register was far too bureaucratic and filled with red tape; therefore, we scrapped it.</p>
            <p eId="para_488">Now, if one employs somebody who has been out of work for 12 months there is a direct injection of €7,500, and one receives €10,000 for a person who has been out of work for two years. It helps cashflow, is very simple and operates well. That, together with the other programmes such as Momentum, JobBridge and JobsPlus, give people the opportunity to get into something they might be interested in and that, hopefully, might lead to a more permanent position.</p>
            <p eId="para_489"> One would like to wave a wand and put everybody back to work, but that is impossible. However, so many opportunities are building up that if we achieve the 2% growth rates projected by the Government - others have forecast higher rates and it remains to be seen what 2014 will bring - we will be out of the programme with whatever decision the Government makes. The rest of Europe will make its own decisions. If the eurozone can rise it will be important for us as exporters and suppliers of indigenous elements of services.</p>
            <p eId="para_490"> It is a case of not lying down under this challenge. We do not have all the answers by any means, but elements of those answers come from engaging with people. The ideas and proposals that come from people are listened to and if they are worthwhile they should be implemented. There is an element of challenge for the Government to make employers and potential employers aware of what is available. We need to work on that constantly.</p>
            <p eId="para_491"> I met with Connect Ireland representatives 18 months ago and they said there are Irish people working in companies all over the world - in Australia, South America or wherever - from receptionist to chief executive. Many of those companies may want to expand into Europe. Some company representatives may never have heard of Ireland. All we say is, "If you are going to invest in Europe, think of Ireland." That pipeline is very busy. When one gets ten jobs in Kinvara or 80 in Portarlington, or other places around the country where the IDA, with due respect to it, may not have a particular focus, that is important. I would like to think we could have a full pipeline of such investment coming through and follow it with our indigenous economy where the support the Government puts in will help employers take on two or three more employees. That is why it is important to be able to say with some degree of certainty that there will be no income tax or VAT increases for the next period, so they can plan within that range how they might improve the situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_492"> In due course the people will decide whom they wish to elect, but we will strive with all our might and main to open those doors in the period ahead. I hope that when we exit the bailout, put up the shutters behind us and move on in a different way, we will send a signal to our people that we are never going back to that sort of culture and that we will move forward by sending signals to the markets internationally that this country is on the move and that we see an opportunity for brighter days ahead. That is the challenge of politics and everybody here contributes to that in their individual ways.</p>

            <p eId="para_493">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for letting me speak. The Taoiseach itemised, among other elements, that the Cabinet sub-committee on social policy had a responsibility for poverty reduction and social inclusion. Then he gave us a long litany of measures, some of them perhaps very commendable, but he was not able to tell us whether the sub-committee had dealt with the need for a poverty impact report on the budget. Sinn Féin has long argued for equality-proofing. That happens in the North and it is quite effective. There is a need to assess the social impact of different measures brought in by the Government. The European Commission has criticised the Government for not doing this, so this is not just a Sinn Féin criticism. It acknowledges that this is done in a limited way after a budget but it argues for such assessment to be broadened and done before a budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_494"> The Commission also criticised the fact that budgetary measures on health or education, and the impact of indirect taxes, are not assessed. That is a fundamental element that is missing from the report the Taoiseach has given us today. Will the Cabinet sub-committee commission a piece of work on the implications of last month's budget? What would the Government's attitude be to that? If such a report called for these measures to be reversed or changed because of the social impact, in keeping with the committee's remit of poverty reduction and social inclusion, one would think there would be an onus on the Government to follow it through.</p>

            <p eId="para_499">It is a red herring which means the Taoiseach is not taking the debate seriously. The Cabinet sub-committee on social policy meets far less frequently than the Economic Management Council, which is the committee for inflicting pain and the priorities of the troika on people and the economy. Does that not reflect the bad priorities of this Government in dealing with such issues as job creation? How can the Taoiseach say that reducing the social welfare entitlement of jobseekers from €188 to €100 will help them find a job? Very evidently, it will drive them into poverty. When seeking a job one needs resources to do it, such as a computer, Internet access and bus fares. One needs to interact with other human beings who might be in a position to give one a job. That costs money. How does impoverishing jobseekers support them in seeking jobs? It self-evidently does not.</p>
            <p eId="para_500"> Is the sub-committee examining emigration as a social policy issue? The facts make it clear that the consequence of the Government's policies of attacking young people and its failure to provide jobs for them is creating an incentive for young people to leave. Is the real subtext of the Government's policy to create pan-European flexibility and drive young people out of the country because that is what Europe wants? They do not have enough young people in Germany, so we will drive them out of Ireland to Germany or somewhere else in Europe. Is that the real policy - to impoverish people such that they have no choice but to leave the country?</p>

            <p eId="para_502">Deputy Adams raised the question of a poverty impact report. I will ask the Minister for Social Protection to carry out such an exercise. We will publish it in due course and debate it here. In the last year there has been an increase of 33,800 in the number of people in employment and of 20,000 in the number of people in full-time employment. Many of those people are on social protection of some sort or another. When one speaks to them one cannot put a price on their joy at having the opportunity to do a full-time job and thereby better their circumstances. They feel the dignity of employment and an opportunity to work and, maybe, change direction through that.</p>
            <p eId="para_503">The best way to deal with and reduce poverty is to create employment and opportunities for jobs. If we had not taken the initiatives we took in the budget to provide for businesses, employment, access to credit and employers to take people off the live register, we would not have done our duty. Some 113,000 people came off the live register, although they were replaced by others. This shows the extent of movement in the labour market. </p>

            <p eId="para_512">I would like to think the Deputy might come up with an initiative like the living city initiative, for places like Dún Laoghaire with older houses in need of reconstruction, that would provide employment. The Deputy makes a point that is a red herring about us wanting to keep people on the dole and I understand him doing that.</p>
            <p eId="para_513"> When Fine Gael had its annual think-in, I was speaking to a young woman working in the hotel who told me that there were ten people from her village in Spain working in the same locality as her in Ireland. She said there was nobody of her age left in her village because they had all emigrated. Nobody wants to see people leave our country. In my county, there is not a household without a family member in other lands because of emigration. There is no subtext for having some sort of pan-European flexibility, as the Deputy terms it, to drive people out of the country. It is a fact that when one goes to Munich now, there is a shortage of 150,000 workers. In Bavaria, there is a shortage of 200,000 workers now - engineers, technicians and trades people. There are signs outside the towns saying they need 100 mechanics or whatever.</p>
            <p eId="para_514"> Unfortunately, we are not in that position in Ireland. Until we get our economy into good shape and our public finances back in order, we cannot have that economy. We must take it step by step and that is the reason I believe it is important to have a business focus in the budget that engages with the social policy committee, through the Intreo offices. Deputy Boyd Barrett made the point that a young person needs access to the Internet. That is what happens in the Intreo offices. Young unemployed men and women who come to Intreo offices are interviewed individually and are also met in groups and access to information and the Internet is available to them. </p>

            <p eId="para_516">Genuine assistance is offered to them to help them get to the next step or level. This is being done completely differently from how it was done before. We recognise that everybody has a contribution to make and that many of these young people have a talent or flair in a particular area. Some of them have considerable experience, but have lost out. It is a case of providing motivation and incentives to get them back into the system so that employers can see they are bright people and will take them on. The fact that 20,000 people got full-time employment in the past 12 months and that 33,000 jobs were created is positive.</p>
            <p eId="para_517"> When I look at companies like Glanbia, Kerry Group and others who are exporting increasing amounts and when I see investments such as that in Naas by the Kerrry Group of €100 million, and the new opportunities coming from Bord Bia in cheese making and in providing new flavours to other countries, I see the opportunities are enormous. These opportunities are for young people across the country in many walks of life. We do not have all the answers. I do not ridicule anything the Deputy says, but I would be very happy to hear any constructive suggestions the Deputy has for employment, based on his experience in his constituency. That applies to Deputy Higgins also.</p>

            <p eId="para_528">The Taoiseach's response sums it up. The Cabinet committee on climate change and the green economy has met only once in 12 months. The last time this committee met was on 5 November 2012, over a year ago. In the meantime, we have had major work by the UN and the climate change panel and definitive conclusions in terms of human responsibility for a dramatically changing planet, with grave consequences for agriculture, food production and so on. The impact of climate change already being felt in many countries across the globe is devastating. We have seen changes in climate, drought in Africa, wars arising from drought and so forth.</p>
            <p eId="para_529"> In the Irish context, much as I regret to say it, it seems the Government will be known as the one that cared least about climate change in recent times. There is no sense that the Government has a climate change agenda. It is as if this is something we can dismiss and put to one side. This is reflected in the Climate Change Bill. The failure to include strategic targets for 2050 is a further exposure of failure on the part of the Minister, Deputy Hogan, to rise to the challenge of climate change. I accept the fact that climate change is a challenging issue, but the fact the committee has only met once speaks for itself.</p>
            <p eId="para_530"> People have roundly condemned the Climate Change Bill, but I do not know whether the committee will meet to discuss it again. The previous Government published a far more ambitious Bill, into which many people had an input, in 2010. When the Labour Party was in opposition in 2009, it produced legislation with clear targets and argued strongly for legislation that would include objectives, targets and goals. </p>
            <p eId="para_531">Will the Taoiseach confirm that the committee will meet far more often in the coming 12 months and that the Government will become far more engaged than it has been with the climate change agenda? An attempt has been made to demonise people involved in the climate change and green agenda generally in the past 12 to 15 months, to which the Government has been a party, as has the Minister. The fact that the committee has met only once speaks volumes for the Government's lack of commitment to tackling this very serious issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_532">The Taoiseach's answer that the committee on climate change and the green economy has met only once gives the lie to the claims he made earlier about the Government's commitment to employment creation because clearly when it comes to doing the practical work to deliver on promises the Taoiseach made in the programme for Government about the potential to create a huge number of jobs in the renewable energy sector, the green economy and through NewERA - a figure of 100,000 jobs was mentioned - the committee is not even meeting on a regular basis to discuss how the Government can deliver on them. Contrary to the Taoiseach's earlier suggestions, some of us on this side of the House have been very specific in making suggestions on how the Government could deliver on its own promises to deliver jobs in the green economy. During the debate on the Private Members' motion I tabled on forestry we argued about the huge potential to create tens of thousands of jobs if we delivered on our own agreed targets for afforestation, a public works programme in this regard, provided for investment through semi-State companies in areas such as renewable energy and afforestation. The Government speaks about the pay-as-you-save scheme, but it has not rolled it out. Many jobs could be created through a major installation programme and it could contribute to meeting our climate change targets for 2020 and 2050 which the EPA now believes we will not do because the Government is not taking it seriously as an environmental issue or an area in which we could generate desperately needed employment. The hope that it will arrive from the heavens in the form of foreign direct investment if we are nice and do not ask companies to pay any tax is not materialising. We have told the Taoiseach that we need to use semi-State companies as major vehicles for public investment in public works programmes in strategic areas of industry, particularly the green economy. The Government is failing to do this and even failing to meet to discuss it. This is useless.</p>

            <p eId="para_533">This is appalling in view of all that has happened in the past six to 12 months with regard to climate change and all the signs that urgent action is needed to control and modify the effects of industrial capitalism and the hunt for profit at the expense of our environment and resources. We need to curb, control and change this, yet the committee has met only once. Is it not the reality that just about the only policy the Government could trot out on climate change was to increase the price of petrol? That sums it up. Is this not lazy and unimaginative and imposing hardship on people who need their cars for work? Is it not clear that we need proactive policies and investment to structurally reduce emissions and pollution in the economy? I suggest to the Taoiseach, notwithstanding his attempt to deride rather than to answer serious points from the socialists in Parliament, that a programme of retrofitting homes throughout the country with regard to energy saving insulation and water saving measures should be undertaken to be financed by a 1% emergency tax on the wealthiest 1% or 5% which would raise €2.9 billion. This could create 60,000 to 70,000 jobs for such projects. Is this not a constructive proposal, but one which the Taoiseach will not entertain because it would affect the wealthy supporters of his party and his ideology and he will not afflict them as opposed to afflicting the working class and the poor?</p>

            <p eId="para_534">Cabinet committees generally meet if an issue will arise before the Government. We have already dealt with the climate change Bill and rather than having specific targets which will lead to one being in court on a regular basis if they are not achieved and given that the target date is 2050, it is better to set principles and objectives at which a Government can aim. The Minister published the outline heads of the climate action and low carbon development Bill. He is co-ordinating the development of national and sectoral low carbon road maps and much work is ongoing at interdepartmental level with the United Nations in respect of the Warsaw conference due to take place later this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_535"> We are all cognisant of the scientific response on new commercial waterways being opened in the Arctic because of melting, changes to the jetstream, the fluctuations in temperature in the Atlantic, the beginning of a European and US response to a study of the ocean, the movement of waters, the management of stocks, the fluctuations on the seabed and mortality rates among fish. All of these issues are important.</p>
            <p eId="para_536"> I agree with Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett for once. The pay-as-you-save scheme is not as simple as it looks. The Government made available €35 million to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources for the scheme, but it is not as simple to implement it in reality as was originally intended. Water saving is an issue. On the Continent people have had to install collection tanks for rainwater for many years as part of the normal planning process. One will find it happening here too to a far greater extent as time passes. Water meters are being installed, a process which will employ 5,000 people and have consequences.</p>
            <p eId="para_537"> When we speak about the €7 billion bill for the importation of fossil fuels, people always tell me that they want jobs by the thousand throughout the country, but we have a marked reluctance to deal with the importation of gas and the provision of pylons and turbines. People have every right, of course, and there must be sensitivity for the environment, but there must also be practicality in the sense that one cannot provide power without cables and we will not have the jobs and prosperity we need unless we invest in infrastructure and facilities to deal with this investment. It is a case of having a good compromise worked out in everybody's interests. I will raise this issue at the next meeting of the Cabinet committee on climate change which is due to meet on 25 November.</p>

          <p eId="para_541">It is not agreed. While I do not propose to call a vote on this, I want to say to the Taoiseach that the Ombudsman has turned out to be a very important position in modern society, raising many issues with regard to the interaction between the citizen and the State, particularly in terms of health, welfare and so forth, and, likewise, the position of the Information Commissioner is very important. From the perspective of Dáil Éireann and of proper deliberation on the role of the offices of the Ombudsman and the Information Commissioner, to have 20 minutes of discussion is very unsatisfactory and does not speak well for the Dáil in terms of treating these offices seriously and with the consideration they deserve. These offices go to the heart of how our system of Government works in regard to the rights of the citizen. Very often, they can be critical of the Government, irrespective of who is in power, and of the arms of Government, including Departments and Government agencies, and how they interact with citizens. The proposal that Opposition spokespersons have five minutes to discuss all of that should have been reflected on further. We could do with far more time to discuss these two very important offices, given that the appointment of the Ombudsman and the Information Commissioner are opportunities for the House to debate the role and work of those offices.</p>

          <p eId="para_547">I have two issues in regard to the programme for Government. First, on the subject of Northern Ireland and the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and St. Andrews Agreement, it is important to acknowledge the excellently produced programme "The Disappeared" which was broadcast last night on RTE and BBC and which was an excellent example of public service broadcasting. It was a very sad programme to watch, harrowing in its detail and in the portrayal of the individual stories the programme dealt with. The families and friends of the disappeared deserve great credit for taking part in the programme, for their bravery and, indeed, for their perseverance in endeavouring to recover the bodies of their loved ones who remain unaccounted for. I put it to the Taoiseach that far more needs to be done to seek information for these families who still do not know where their loved ones are hidden or buried. It is also important to acknowledge that we have universal jurisdiction for murder and manslaughter committed by citizens on the island of Ireland in the context of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act. The Good Friday Agreement, which the programme for Government-----</p>

          <p eId="para_549">I will come to the legislation shortly. In terms of the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement, we amended the Constitution, particularly at Article 29.8, where a new section was introduced stating: "The State may exercise extra-territorial jurisdiction in accordance with the generally recognised principles of international law." In that context, I ask that every effort be made to pursue the case of the murder of Jean McConville and that all involved should be in a position to co-operate fully and honestly with the Garda, as well as with the PSNI, so the remaining bodies can be located.</p>
          <p eId="para_550"> The programme for Government, on page 17, under the title "Victims Rights", states: "We will enact legislation to strengthen the rights of victims of crime and their families, to ensure that victims and their needs are at the heart of justice process and that rights to information, advice and other appropriate assistance are met effectively and efficiently." I would appreciate if the Taoiseach could indicate where lie the legislative proposals in regard to that commitment in the programme for Government. In particular, I ask if he would accept there is a crying need, in the context of last night's programme and the issues it revealed, to ensure that the victims and their needs are at the heart of what we do in this jurisdiction, particularly given that the body of Jean McConville was found in this jurisdiction and that crimes were committed within this jurisdiction which need to be pursued vigorously-----</p>

          <p eId="para_554">I do not disagree with Deputy Martin. I happened to see the programme and it speaks for itself. The television shot of the mother with the hands speaks for itself in terms of Irishness, motherhood and the loss of loved ones. It is an important programme from the point of view of engagement with the independent commission that has been set up for information in respect of those who are still missing. I note the comments of the Deputy First Minister, Mr. McGuinness, in this regard. My understanding is that it appears as though those who are still missing are either in Meath or in Monaghan. It may well be that people out there do know or recollect these tragic incidents unfolding on their land or close to where they might have been. It is a long time ago but the hurt is obviously as palpable and as relevant now as it was then, so I share Deputy Martin's view.</p>
          <p eId="para_555"> On the Bill referred to by Deputy Martin, the Minister for Justice and Equality has met with members of the families of the disappeared. The Bill will probably be published in the second half of next year.</p>

          <p eId="para_556">I want to raise three issues. The first is with regard to the commission for the recovery of the bodies of the disappeared. I saw the programme last night and I took part in the programme. I took part in the programme in order to try to focus on the necessary effort to get those whose remains have not been recovered retrieved as quickly as possible and returned to their families. I ask the Taoiseach to join with me in assisting very actively the work of the commission, which was established under the last Government. I worked very closely with the commission and will continue to work with it. The programme last night should be a huge motivation to anyone who has any information whatsoever to bring it forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_557"> Second, I want to raise the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act. The Government, under that tax Bill, is able to deduct family home tax or property tax directly from bank accounts. Does the Government also have the ability to automatically deduct other charges, such as water charges?</p>

          <p eId="para_559">My final question relates to the child and family recognition Bill. I welcome the announcement to the effect that the Government intends to hold a referendum on marriage equality. This is a very progressive step and Sinn Féin will actively support it. The civil, religious and legal rights of lesbian and gay people, include the right to marry, must be fully protected in law. Will the Taoiseach indicate when the relevant legislation will be introduced in order to give effect to the referendum, the date on which the referendum will be held and the proposed date on which the Minister for Justice and Equality proposes to publish the child and family recognition Bill?</p>

          <p eId="para_560">In respect of the Deputy Adams's first comment, I note that he took part in the programme broadcast last night. I accept what he said about having a genuine interest in seeing that those in possession of information relating to this matter should make it known and available in order that closure might be achieved. The fact is that somebody ordered that Jean McConville be murdered, someone instructed that people take her away, someone instructed Dolours Price to drive the vehicle used across the Border and that someone gave the instruction in respect of what took place. It may be that those people are still around and that they know what happened. The Deputy's appeal - from this House - may well have some effect and I hope it does. In the context of others who were made to disappear in a similar fashion and who are laid to rest - in tragic circumstances - in County Meath or County Monaghan, there are people out there who know that happened to these individuals. It is time that those to whom I refer engaged with the commission established for this purpose by the previous Government. I do not believe anyone here would disagree with that. I hope the programme broadcast last evening will stimulate the people in question into making available the information in their possession. A number of very direct comments were made about the Deputy's presence on the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_561"> The family home tax is collected by the Revenue Commissioners, which have the authority to debit any moneys owed directly from the bank accounts of those who do not pay. That is different from the position with regard to water charges, the collection of which by local authorities was organised by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. Local authorities do not have the same constitutional authority as the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_562"> Deputy Adams also referred to the proposed referendum on gay marriage. The Government considered this matter this morning and accepted the recommendation of the Constitutional Convention to the effect that a question on gay marriage should be put to the people. This is one of eight recommendations the convention has put forward in respect of matters it considered. The convention has made recommendations to the Government in the three reports it has submitted. The Deputy will be aware that, following its most recent deliberations, the Constitutional Convention recommended change in respect of the articles in the Constitution which deal with blasphemy. The Government has decided that the matter raised by the Deputy and a number of others should be put to the people by mid-2015. On gay marriage, the preparatory legislation in respect of family support and other issues will, hopefully, be published by the Minister for Justice and Equality before Christmas. The question that is often posed in respect of this issue relates to adoption. This is a matter on which the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs will follow through. There is no referendum planned for 2014. However, this and a number of other proposals made by the Constitutional Convention will be considered by the people by mid-2015.</p>

          <p eId="para_563">As the Taoiseach rightly noted, the Constitutional Convention has done a considerable amount of work and has made recommendations to the Government on a number of issues. At this point, the Government's intentions with regard to the holding of the various referenda are unclear. The Taoiseach has just indicated that no referendum will be held during 2014 and that the next one might possibly be held in 2015. The window of opportunity for the holding of referenda, where appropriate, in respect of the recommendations made by the convention is narrowing, particularly in the context of the forthcoming general election.</p>
          <p eId="para_564"> The Constitutional Convention is currently considering its programme of work. Will the convention remain in place and are there other issues which it will examine? Where stands the Government in respect of this matter? Is it of the view that the convention should continue its work or should it simply close down operations until such time as some of its recommendations have been addressed by way of Government action?</p>

          <p eId="para_565">I have already answered most of the questions posed by Deputy Kirk. The Constitutional Convention has made a number of recommendations. The Government indicated that a response would be given to the convention's reports within four months. It also indicated that if it were inclined to accept a recommendation made by the convention, then an indicative timeline would be provided. I have provided such a timeline. The Constitutional Convention is dealing with matters under the heading of "any other business" at present. It may well seek to be allowed to examine a number of other propositions which it considers to be important. Obviously, the Government will give the convention scope in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_566"> I am aware of the comments made by the chairman of the convention with regard to the level of engagement among members of the public with referenda in general. This is an issue which I intend to discuss with him. The convention will also need to reflect on the structure of the ballot papers used in future referenda. The latter is always a cause of concern to people.</p>
          <p eId="para_567"> In the context of the particular matter to which reference has been made and arising from the recommendation made by the Constitutional Convention - 79% of the members of which strongly support the holding of a referendum - the Minister for Justice and Equality is currently dealing with a range of family law matters which are quite sensitive and which need to be the subject of comprehensive discussion both in this House and at the relevant Oireachtas committees. In addition, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is dealing with the general question of adoption. In the context of the timeline, this and a number of other propositions put forward by the Constitutional Convention will - as the Government considers - be dealt with by mid-2015.</p>

In the context of the changes which have been made with regard to people renewing their driving licences, the centralising of the relevant offices under the National Driver Licence Service, NDLS, is causing extreme distress, particularly to young people who have been obliged to emigrate.</p>

          <p eId="para_572">Committee Stage of the Companies Bill 2012 is being taken this week and next week.

          <p eId="para_573"> The issue regarding driving licences and the centralisation of the offices will sort itself out over a period. It is clear that large numbers of people reported to the relevant offices in order to have their photographs taken for driving licences. As has been the case with Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, I am sure the matter will be resolved over a period. I suggest that the Deputy seek to have the matter dealt with by way of a Topical Issue debate. If his request in that regard is approved by the Ceann Comhairle, he will then be in a position to obtain full details from the Minister.</p>

          <p eId="para_574">When will the housing (miscellaneous provisions) Bill be introduced and will it deal with the frightening situation relating to homelessness in cities throughout the country? The position in respect of the latter is particularly bad in Dublin, where there has been an 88% increase in the level of homelessness during the past 12 months. I am sure the Taoiseach is aware that not far from the gates of Leinster House one can see homeless people sleeping rough. In view of the fact that harsh weather conditions will soon be upon us, might it be possible to expedite the introduction of the Bill to which I refer?</p>

          <p eId="para_582">Two years ago, the Government promised to use €6.3 billion of the National Pensions Reserve Fund to stimulate the economy. The legislation to provide for this has still not been presented to the House. When will the relevant Bill be introduced and enacted?</p>
          <p eId="para_583"> When will the Water Services (No. 2) Bill 2013 be enacted? I commend the Government on its job creation strategy, particularly in my home county of Donegal, where a JobBridge position paying €150 is being offered to candidates who will install the water meters to be rolled out as a result of the Bill. It is a disgrace that the Department is signing off on places on the JobBridge scheme which will pay €150 per week for nine months' worth of work going around the roads of County Donegal installing water meters.</p>

          <p eId="para_585">I have asked on numerous occasions about a commitment given by the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, to publish the 1926 census. The Government made an announcement to this effect on taking office and legislation was supposed to be introduced to allow for the publication of the census. As the Taoiseach is aware, census information is subject to a 100-year rule. The reason for publishing the 1926 census was to enable people visiting Ireland in the year of The Gathering to trace their roots. It is now close to the end of 2013 and the relevant legislation does not even feature on the legislative programme. Has this commitment been ditched or will legislation be introduced to enable publication of the 1926 census?</p>

          <p eId="para_586">No, the commitment has not been ditched. This is a very costly process to which the 100-year rule applies. The Minister, Deputy Deenihan, has reported on this matter on a number of occasions. The commitment has not been ditched.</p>
          <p eId="para_587"> The water services Bill is due for publication in this session and I expect the NTMA Bill to give effect to expenditure by the National Pensions Reserve Fund of approximately €6 billion to be published either by the end of the year or in early January.</p>

        <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_437">
          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T17:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_589">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_590">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Finance Act of 2011 by raising the current income thresholds of persons liable for payment of the universal social charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">That is the Long Title of the Bill, whereas the Short Title is the Protection of Minimum Wage Earners 2013 Bill. </p>
          <p eId="para_592"> As the Taoiseach will be well aware, the universal social charge, which was introduced in a panic by an incompetent Fianna Fáil-led Government, was a very blunt instrument which placed a considerable burden on ordinary working people. One of the most unfair features of the measure was its impact on low earners. As I have stated previously, the current Government has lifted this burden from a substantial number of people on low incomes. It has not gone far enough, however, and this legislation would go further by removing the requirement to pay the universal social charge from all those earning below the minimum wage. </p>
          <p eId="para_593"> The minimum wage is exactly as described - in other words, the bare minimum a worker earns. Including minimum wage earners in the universal social charge net is unfair and undermines the concept of the minimum wage. If this Bill were passed, it would remove the burden of paying the universal social charge from the shoulders of 296,000 workers. The measure would cost €94 million to implement in the first year. The money saved by those on the minimum wage would then be used to invest in the domestic economy, because those on low incomes, including workers earning the minimum wage, spend more of their income proportionally in the real economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_594"> This is a progressive and positive measure which would stimulate the economy while creating a fairer taxation system. The proposal stems from Sinn Féin's alternative budget, which we published in advance of budget 2014. I note again that we are the only Opposition party to produce an alternative budget that has been fully costed by the Department of Finance. Our proposal highlights that alternatives are available, even within the confines of the troika programme and the restrictions it imposes. Sinn Féin's budget proposal would reduce the tax burden on ordinary families, while also protecting jobs and public services. Our alternative budget contains many options for recouping the €94 million cost of lifting this burden from the shoulders of 296,000 minimum wage earners. </p>
          <p eId="para_595"> The deficit needs to be closed. Sinn Féin has shown in its alternative budget that this can be done fairly through measures such as that proposed in the Bill. Our budget adjustment was more or less identical to that introduced by the Government, the difference being that the Government's budget failed the fairness test. Removing minimum wage earners from the universal social charge would be a positive move that would be very much welcomed by the 296,000 people who are burdened by the charge. It would also start to unravel the disastrous policies pursued by the Fianna Fáil Party in government. </p>
          <p eId="para_596"> This week, the House will discuss the Finance Bill, which, with the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill, will bring more misery and hit persons on lower incomes disproportionately hard. The track record of this Government has been to introduce measures under which the brunt of budget adjustments falls on the lowest income earners. The constant austerity to which the Government remains wedded has damaged the economy and is not working. Today, for example, the European Commission again lowered its growth forecast for Ireland. </p>
          <p eId="para_597"> I note the Minister for Justice and Equality is either tweeting or texting. I hope some of my comments are sinking in because his Government's austerity programme is simply not working and its budgets have made life harder for ordinary people. The Government's forecasts for growth are being constantly revised downwards and they fail to make the link between these downward revisions and its policy of attacking lower income earners by imposing additional cuts and taxes, whether increases in direct taxation or new indirect taxes such as the property tax and the water tax that will be introduced from next year onwards. </p>
          <p eId="para_598"> We must not accept that the universal social charge is here to stay, especially for those who earn below the minimum wage. I commend the Government again on removing more than 300,000 people from the scope of the universal social charge and restoring the minimum wage to the level at which it stood before the previous Administration reduced it. In doing so, I acknowledge that the Government has undone some of the damage done by previous Fianna Fáil Government to those on the lowest incomes. It has not yet finished the job, however, because this would necessitate removing the remaining 296,000 people who earn the minimum wage from the universal social charge net. I commend the Bill to the House. </p>

          <p eId="para_603">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_604">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend and extend the Parental Leave Act 1998.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">I thank the House for the opportunity to move the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">I commend the change in Standing Orders that allows for these statements. It is very welcome. The expert advisory group report on the early years strategy was published a number of weeks ago. It set a realistic and achievable target that, by 2018, we would have 52 weeks paid parental leave. My Bill is a bridge towards achieving that.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> I acknowledge the limitations of the Bill. There are restrictions on legislation placing a charge on the Exchequer so the extension of parental leave I propose, to 36 weeks, will not be paid. When the Government reads and studies my Bill, I hope the Minister will work with me to ensure the Bill can be amended as it moves through the Stages of the House so that it is paid parental leave, which is my ambition. As a first step to stimulate debate and discussion about the need to extend parental leave, I have published the Bill and look forward to it being debated. As we develop social policy into the next decade, the need for family friendly policies is crucial. International evidence tells us the early years are crucial in terms of the psychological, physical and other development of the child. Where possible, parental leave should be extended so that parents can spend as much time as possible with children in the important early weeks. My Bill allows both parents to decide how to allocate the extension of leave.</p>
          <p eId="para_608"> People will be concerned about what happened in practice with regard to the Government's commitment to the early years and previous decisions to reduce maternity leave payments and to tax them. There seems to be a division between what is said about the early years, making sure the workplace is family friendly and making sure people's incomes are protected, and what is happening on the ground. Regrettably, the Government continues to target families and reduce incomes related to the early years. The Government cut child benefit and other payments to families. That is a regrettable and regressive policy. In proposing the Bill, I do so in a constructive way. I hope we can engage across the House to see parental leave extended. I hope we can work together to use the mechanisms of the House to ensure this is done on a paid basis. I look forward to debating the Bill in detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, supports in principle the extension of paid parental leave. It is a challenge to the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and to the Government. If they are really interested in proposals rooted in evidence-based policy, they will engage with this Bill and support it as it moves through the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_618">The main thrust of the Bill is to make the nomination for judicial appointments process more transparent, accountable and merit-based. That means removing the Government's role under the Constitution as sole nominator and replacing it with the Dáil, the Seanad and-or a duly nominated committee. However, I am conscious of the fact that the business of the Dáil for many decades has been dominated by the Government of the day, which on a daily basis uses its majority to pass motions notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders. These set aside Standing Orders for the taking of business. The Bill is drafted in such a way by having the nomination process in a manner provided by law. It is placed constitutionally beyond the reach of the Government to suspend or modify the process as it would be able to if it were left confined to Standing Orders under Article 15.10°. This is an important new principle being established and it is not anti-parliament. Rather, it recognises the reality of how business is done. The nomination process is therefore, under the Bill, in sharp contrast to the existing situation, put on a transparent and accountable footing openly in Parliament, the details of which are to be set out in statute.</p>
          <p eId="para_619"> A second, important principle being set out in the Bill is that constitutionally, the Houses or the parliamentary committee is being given a nomination role in an area of significant importance, namely, judicial appointments. Currently, the Dáil committees are given a backhanded role in having a chat with the prospective chair of a public body. Most recently, the Chairman of a committee, Deputy Charles Flanagan, complained at the hearing of the Ombudsman that his committee should have been given a greater role in the nomination of the Ombudsman. Therefore, I am sure he will fully support the Bill on that account. The Houses, therefore, will be given a new role for nominations for judicial appointments, which will give the Parliament a new dimension in keeping with parliaments of more developed democracies, such as the United States.</p>
          <p eId="para_620"> The purpose of the Bill is quite clear. It is to take the issue of judicial appointments as far as possible out of the hands of Government. The reason is that successive Governments have abused the power by stuffing the Judiciary with their friends, ex-Deputies and people who have loyalties to the party and are chosen on a basis that is not transparent. One of the problems that exists is that the nominating body, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, is not a transparent body with the power to appoint judges. It is ignored for the most part. The Government makes the recommendations and can ignore the nominating body. For many decades, judges have been appointed partly because of their political affiliations and not necessarily because of their judicial acumen. That is something I wish to put an end to.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> Another issue that is very important is that there is no sanction of judges. We only have to read the newspapers this morning to see two issues highlighted in a high profile case. One is the closeness of politicians, particularly Government politicians, to the Judiciary. The second is that, if a judge admits that he or she has done something wrong, there is no sanction bar impeachment. The impeachment process has not been used successfully in the history of the State. It is time we looked seriously at improving the appointment of judges and the regulation of judges. This constitutional Bill will be followed by legislation that will open the gates to people other than judges, who will not be allowed on the appointing body, and politicians appointing the Judiciary. We are talking about something that is one of the last bastions of insiders in the country. I want to see judges being appointed by a broad section of society and being interviewed and approved by an Oireachtas committee, not by the Government. This Bill takes the Government out of the equation and gives power to the Oireachtas. That is an important constitutional change and is something many people will sympathise with. It gives the Members of this House power and the details in the Bill give rights to the Opposition, which means the Government cannot ram it through.</p>

            <p eId="para_647">Táim buíoch as an deis labhairt ar an ábhar seo anocht agus as deis a fháil ceisteanna a chur agus, tá súil agam, freagraí a fháil. I am grateful that this topic has been chosen tonight.</p>
            <p eId="para_648"> The time for speeches is over and I will not be making a speech as such. I will be as brief as I can be.</p>
            <p eId="para_649"> The Department of Justice and Equality stated on 25 June last, as reported on 21 October in a newspaper, that the Government, on 25 June, approved the immediate implementation of a cash lump-sum payment scheme based on duration of stay in laundries recommended by Mr. Justice John Quirke and tasked an interdepartmental group with giving further detailed consideration to the steps necessary to implement the other recommendations, some of which are complex and will require legislation. The Department stated that more than 150 applications had been received and were being processed and that it was expected that the first offers of payment of a lump sum would issue within four to six weeks of the Government decision. That was similar to the reply I received from the Minister in September to a question.</p>
            <p eId="para_650"> I will make one point before I ask the question. Since the apology of February last two of the ladies from the laundries have passed away and as of today, Tuesday, 5 November, no woman who has been in a laundry has received the lump-sum payment or any other entitlement.</p>
            <p eId="para_651"> I noted that the Minister for Finance stated in the Budget Statement that the lump sums would be tax free. I would have assumed that such was a given.</p>
            <p eId="para_652"> We all have feelings of compassion and understanding of what went on in the laundries. I acknowledge that under this Government more has been progressed than at any other time but I want to know about the Government decision. Has it been made? If not, when will it be made so that one can then count the four to six weeks from that decision. That is the basic question I want to put to the Minister and I would prefer to use the time for his reply.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#AlanShatter" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_458">
            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T17:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_653">I thank Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan for raising this important matter and for giving me the opportunity to speak on the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_654"> The House will be aware that the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and I announced a scheme of lump sum payments on 26 June 2013 for women who were admitted to and worked in the Magdalen laundries, St. Mary's Training Centre, Stanhope Street, and House of Mercy Training School, Summerhill, Wexford. This followed the publication of the report by Mr. Justice Quirke, President of the Law Reform Commission, on the establishment of an <i>ex-gratia</i> scheme and a comprehensive range of supports for the women involved. As the Deputy mentioned, the Government tasked an interdepartmental group with giving further detailed consideration to the steps necessary to implement the other recommendations in Mr. Justice Quirke's report.</p>
            <p eId="para_655"> Pending completion of that report, arrangements were put in place in my Department to invite and process applications from the women involved. To date, more than 600 application forms have been received and more than 250 of these have been processed to an advanced stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_656"> The report of the interdepartmental group was discussed and the final details of the scheme agreed at Cabinet this morning. Full details of the scheme will published over the next few days.</p>
            <p eId="para_657"> The payment of lump sums, as recommended by Mr. Justice Quirke, will be made by my Department. In cases where application forms have been completed and records verified and subject to the clarification of a few legal issues by the Office of the Attorney General, I expect that my Department will be in a position to issue the first offers of payments within the next four to six weeks. The Deputy now has the date.</p>
            <p eId="para_658"> The provision of other benefits, including weekly payments from the Department of Social Protection and medical services to be provided through the Department of Health, will be dependent on the introduction of administrative and legislative measures. Work has already commenced on these measures and they will be progressed as soon as possible. So that no individual is prejudiced by the time required to give effect to the Government's decision, weekly payments to be made pursuant to the scheme are to be backdated to 1 August 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_659"> As announced in the budget, these <i>ex-gratia</i> lump-sum payments will be exempt from income tax as well as the weekly payments, and this will be provided for in the Finance Bill. It had to be provided for in the Finance Bill. It could not have happened without express provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_660"> Mr. Justice Quirke recommended that as a precondition of receiving benefits under the scheme, the women concerned should sign a waiver not to take proceedings against the State. Before signing the waiver, the women will be encouraged to receive independent legal advice. Applicants will be facilitated to engage their own choice of solicitor and will be provided with a maximum amount from the State of €500 plus VAT as a contribution to the cost of obtaining legal advice on the signing of the waiver.</p>
            <p eId="para_661"> I am pleased that payments of the lump sums will commence shortly and as already stated, full details of the scheme will be published over the next few days.</p>
            <p eId="para_662"> It was particularly appropriate that the Deputy raised the matter for today. She was very prescient. The matter was pending to be dealt with by Cabinet and has been dealt with today. There is a formal announcement being made on foot of the Cabinet decision and, of course, I am very anxious that we progress matters further. There remains a considerable number of applications to be dealt with still. There are also various verification procedures to be dealt with.</p>
            <p eId="para_663"> The final issue the Deputy raised was the passing away of two individuals. It is envisaged under Mr. Justice Quirke's scheme that if someone passed away between the time of the announcement of the scheme and the lump sums becoming payable, a payment would be made to the estate of the individual concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_664">I very much welcome what the Minister stated so that the countdown can begin from today. His point about the independent legal advice that the women can get is an important one.</p>
            <p eId="para_665"> I have another question. There have been discrepancies between the McAleese report and Mr. Justice Quirke's report, particularly on physical abuse of the ladies and duration of stay. I note in the McAleese report that 61% of those he interviewed were in the laundries less than one year but 58% of the admissions were not recorded in his findings, whereas in Mr. Justice Quirke's report there were 27% whose length of stay was less than one year. According to Mr. Justice Quirke's report, the length of stay of 68% of those with whom he spoke was one to five years, of 13% was five to ten years and of 9% was ten years or more. Given those discrepancies regarding length of stay and the issue of physical abuse, will the Minister be committed to holding an independent forum for survivors so that they can offer testimony regarding the length of stay and the physical abuse that they suffered?</p>

            <p eId="para_666">Many of the former residents of the Magdalen homes very much welcomed the engagement of former Senator McAleese. They very much welcomed the careful consideration and sensitive engagement that he had with them. They were generally very pleased with the report that was published.</p>
            <p eId="para_667"> Many of them do not want to revisit this issue. They were anxious that the State accept its responsibilities. The Taoiseach, on behalf of the State, apologised for the suffering that they experienced and our focus now is on implementing the scheme for their benefit. We do not believe there is anything additional that would be beneficial to anyone that can be achieved by further inquiries to individuals who have been through stress in their lives again being required in some way to recount past events.</p>
            <p eId="para_668"> Former Senator McAleese conducted a careful investigation. In the context of what the Deputy says as between Mr. Justice Quirke and former Senator McAleese, it was not Mr. Justice Quirke's job to investigate the background to the Magdalen laundries.</p>
            <p eId="para_669">What Mr. Justice Quirke was asked to do, based on the findings of Professor McAleese, was to propose the most appropriate <i>ex gratia </i>scheme that could be put in place to assist the women concerned. He had contact with numbers of them, but he was not asked nor did he attempt to make a definitive decision on the exact percentage of women who had experienced different difficulties. Of course, the issue in the context of the scheme is that the women concerned have to establish two things: first, that they were in either one of the Magdalen laundries or the other two institutions; and, second, the length of time spent in these institutions. The sisters involved are co-operating fully in providing all of the necessary records in an effort to establish and verify timeframes. This is being done in respect of over 250 applicants. The information is available for the processing of some of these applications. There will be a difficulty with a small number of women in cases where records are imperfect. There may well be some disagreement about the length of time involved, but I am advised by my officials that this has not yet emerged as a significant difficulty. We deal with matters in a sensitive and as careful a way as possible, bearing in mind the difficulties all of the women experienced during their lives.</p>

            <p eId="para_670">I appreciate that the Minister is present to deal with this very important matter. Last night we witnessed a harrowing programme which chronicled the bleak tale of the disappeared, the silent witnesses to some of the grimmest and most cynical crimes in that troubled time. Sons, brothers, husbands, fathers and mothers were ruthlessly taken from their families in the dark of night on the orders of self-appointed local warlords. Some were barely old enough to shave before they disappeared into the depths of an IRA conspiracy. The gaping hole the abrupt, shock absence of these men and women left in their families' lives is a legacy with which they still struggle today. RTE and BBC did a valuable public service in producing this documentary which dealt in great detail with these awful murders and devastated families.</p>
            <p eId="para_671"> Jean McConville, a mother of ten, trying to make ends meet in desperate circumstances in west Belfast, was executed and disappeared on the orders of the Belfast IRA commander. The family unit was shattered and siblings were separated from one another. We have yet to hear the IRA leadership of that time deal in any appropriate way with a response, if there is such a thing when one is dealing with murder. It has very serious questions to deal with arising from this callous murder.</p>
            <p eId="para_672"> The family of Kevin McKee still linger with a sad regret over a final telephone call from their brother before he went silent forever. The searing testimony of Charlie Armstrong's widow, whose loss is still so raw and so painful to watch even after all the years, is a sharp reminder of the devastating impact these crimes have had on the families of the men and women who were murdered and submerged in a web of IRA lies and propaganda. Mrs. Armstrong's quiet dignity and strength as she visited the grave of her husband last night stood in stark contrast to the weasel words of Deputy Gerry Adams and others, as they even now try to muddy the waters. These victims' disappearance was compounded by the vicious malevolent rumour mill that attempted to cast aspersions on their characters and or to give false hope to bereft families. The IRA still refuses to accept responsibility for the murders and legitimate questions are not answered.</p>
            <p eId="para_673"> Since its establishment in 1999 in the aftermath of the Good Friday Agreement and enactment following referendums in the North and the South, the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains has been working on the lonely task of securing a just outcome for the disappeared. The remains of Joe Lynskey, Kevin McKee, Columba McVeigh, Seamus Wright, Captain Robert Nairac, Brendan Megraw and Seamus Ruddy are all lying unmarked in the ground somewhere in the Irish countryside. There are people who know where they are buried. Some of them are now in prominent public positions in Irish life. There is a heavy moral obligation on those who know to act on that knowledge. The families deserve to be made whole even at this late stage. The prevarication of the IRA and its fellow travellers in identifying the victims for whom they were responsible is a damning indictment of the moral judgment shown by that organisation. The weight of history is a heavy burden in this country. Shallow graves in desolate bogs, on lonely beaches and down distant country lanes are a testament to that burden. The victims' families are left with that dark legacy. Contrary to what Deputy Gerry Adams and others would now like to claim, everyone in the North does not share responsibility for what happened there. While the IRA organisation, from top to bottom, was intent on destruction, families in Nationalist communities across the North were resisting its campaign of terror, bringing up families and trying to earn a living in peace.</p>
            <p eId="para_674"> I trust that the Government will continue to give full assistance and every necessary support to the independent commission as it continues its work. I hope all Members of this House will rise to their moral responsibility to help the families, even at this very late stage.</p>

            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T17:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_675">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. I am very aware of his long-standing interest in it. There is nothing in his contribution with which I disagree. Individuals in Northern Ireland were the victims of terrible atrocities, for which there can be no excuse of any description or any political justification. Over the course of the conflict in Northern Ireland a number of people were murdered and buried secretly by paramilitary organisations, mainly the Provisional IRA. They have become known as the disappeared, as have others on other continents and in other countries who were treated similarly. This was a brutal practice, not alone the commission of kidnap and murder but also the further, profound injustice inflicted on the families of the people who were killed. Those responsible for the murder of the innocents and concealing their remains simply have no moral compass and there can be no moral justification for their conduct. The families, whose raw grief was once again highlighted in last night's television documentary which I watched, have had a peculiarly cruel tragedy visited on them; they not only lost their loved ones to murder but also for many decades did not even know of their fate and had no graveside at which to grieve.</p>
            <p eId="para_676"> I have met the victims' families and pay tribute to their dignity and fortitude in the face of their suffering. Too many have had false hopes when it was thought that remains might be found, only to discover that the information furnished had proved to be inaccurate. Once again, I extend my deepest sympathy to them on their loss and assure them of my continuing support for their efforts to recover their loved ones. The Taoiseach also met the families in July and assured them of the Government's continued support for them and its commitment to this humanitarian process. Those who were involved in these callous acts of disappearance should be keenly conscious of the abhorrent nature of what they have done. They should also feel the strongest moral obligation to do all they can to try to right the wrong done to the victims and their families.</p>
            <p eId="para_677"> The Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains was established in 1999 by the Irish and British Governments and will continue to be supported by the two Governments. It was one of a key set of actions aimed at addressing the suffering of the victims of violence as a necessary element of reconciliation. In its work the commission is not involved in making moral judgments on those who ordered or participated in such appallingly brutal acts. It is responsible for facilitating the location of the remains of the disappeared and its sole objective is to return the remains of the victims to their families in order that they can receive a decent burial and the families will have a grave at which to grieve and remember. In this way, the families may, in some measure at least, achieve resolution or closure in regard to the deaths of their loved ones.</p>
            <p eId="para_678"> The Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains has received co-operation from many sources, including from many in the organisations responsible, over the course of its work in locating the victims' remains.</p>
            <p eId="para_679">However, as there are still seven victims on the commission's list whose remains have not yet been found, we have to constantly see if more can be done. The commission needs further information to be able to progress its investigations and this is the only resource that is missing. I appeal, therefore, to anybody anywhere who has information that might assist the commission to provide that information, in confidence, so that it can be acted upon. The Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains operates a confidential telephone line and post office box and details can be found on its website.<i>
							</i>Nobody has anything to fear by providing information, and information provided to the commission is guaranteed the strictest confidence and can only be used for the purpose of locating and recovering the victims' remains. The families have endured for long enough. Although some of them have had the remains of their loved ones returned to them, there are others who still wait and who still suffer to this very day. That suffering was clearly apparent in last night's programme. There can be absolutely no excuse for those who have information to withhold it and for the sake of common human decency they should provide that information without delay. Both RTE and the BBC should be congratulated on the programme broadcast last night for yet again detailing the plight of the families, the suffering being endured and the need to ensure missing information can be furnished.</p>

            <p eId="para_680">I welcome the Minister's very clear statement and he summed up very well the significant grief and anguish felt by so many families. As he noted, the request of these families is very small, and with courage and dignity they have outlined very clearly that they want a final resting place for loved ones where they can lay flowers and say a prayer. We should all recognise that these are simple requests, and people with knowledge of the location of these victims, who were murdered in horrific circumstances, must come forward and give every possible assistance to the commission. Time is definitely on nobody's side.</p>
            <p eId="para_681"> For what is probably the first time in my 21 years in this House, I am wearing an emblem or badge. It is the badge supporting the families of the disappeared. I was a very close friend and colleague of the first commissioner, Mr. John Wilson, who was a former Tánaiste, and as the Minister, Deputy Shatter, has noted, I am familiar with the work of the commission from its early days. I was appraised in general rather than specific terms and I knew from the word go of the terrible anguish felt by the families and the simple requests made by them when a loved one had been lost in horrific circumstances. They requested the return of the body so they could have some type of closure. That is a bad phrase but they just want a place to lay flowers, say a prayer and have a final resting place for loved ones.</p>
            <p eId="para_682"> Perhaps we in the House should have a debate to keep this issue in the public mind, and maybe some of the people with relevant knowledge will come forward and assist the commission in its very difficult work. I do not underestimate the difficulty involved but, as I reiterate, time is on nobody's side.</p>

            <p eId="para_683">I will briefly join Deputy Smith in making a few comments. Anybody - either outside or inside the House - with any information or influence over those with information should use that information or influence. We and all right-thinking people are at one in our view that ending the suffering of the families who await the remains of loved ones must be a priority. The commission has had the support of the Irish and British Governments since its establishment and will continue to have that support. The officials in my Department who provide the secretariat function maintain almost daily contact with the commission and their counterparts in the Northern Ireland office. The commission's most recent operation was in search of the remains of Columba McVeigh at Bragan Bog in County Monaghan, and it concluded in September 2012, unfortunately without success. However, the commission remains ready to act on any credible new information or evidence it receives with regard to this or any other outstanding cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_684"> In concluding the debate on this issue, let me emphasise once again the fundamentally humanitarian intent of the two Governments in establishing and supporting the commission. We are all conscious of the social and religious importance attached to the rituals of proper burial of the dead. The families of the disappeared have been denied those rituals and our shared objective must be to address the humanitarian imperative of returning the remains of the victims to their families. No matter what his or her background, anybody who can assist in achieving that aim must do so. We will continue to do whatever we can to provide the commission with every support in its work.</p>

          <speech by="#PatrickODonovan" eId="spk_465">
            <from>Deputy Patrick O'Donovan<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T18:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_685">Before speaking on my issue, I wish to compliment the two previous speakers. I concur with the sentiments they expressed. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting the issue I raise today, the implementation of the new driver licence service. I support the concept of the introduction of a credit-card-type licence, which is long overdue, particularly when we consider Irish drivers going abroad and international recognition of the licence. None the less, I am disappointed with some of the feedback I have received. I acknowledge the presence of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p>
            <p eId="para_686"> In my area we are in a process of amalgamation of two local authorities, Limerick City Council and Limerick County Council, which between them had three motor tax offices, two of which could issue driving licences. One of those is gone. With regard to geography, some of the areas I represent are more than 60 km from the new centre in Limerick city. In the last week I have received evidence from the rural part of the constituency in particular that there were delays of up to four and a half hours at the Limerick centre. The Department and the Road Safety Authority might argue there are teething issues with the introduction of the new system, as there always are.</p>
            <p eId="para_687"> One can consider the midlands, where there are centres in Longford, Carrick-on-Shannon, Mullingar, Roscommon and Tullamore. Mullingar is 41 km from Tullamore and Longford is 30 km from Roscommon, 45 km from Mullingar and 36 km from Carrick-on-Shannon. Drumcolliher in my constituency is 69 km from Tralee and 50 km from Limerick, and Limerick is 102 km from Tralee. That distance traverses open spaces containing rural dwellers who find it difficult to access centres as currently proposed in both Limerick and Tralee. The other option is Cork city, which is even further away.</p>
            <p eId="para_688"> The centres are in urban areas with heavy footfall, but for people in rural constituencies and those who are not used to driving into cities such as Limerick, with the Parkway shopping centre, it is proving difficult to get to them. We know that suggestions were made to people in advance of the transition to the credit-card-type licence to hold off from applying for the licence. Others applied but did not have a licence issued under the last system. Those two categories of person are now in limbo, and it appears that large groups of people are potentially unlicensed.</p>
            <p eId="para_689"> There should be a number of actions. The resources available in existing centres should be examined in conjunction with the work of outreach or temporary centres such as those in Mayo and Galway. We must also consider the geographical area being covered. In Tipperary, although the two local authorities were amalgamated, the new national driving licence centre was not put in Thurles - in the middle of the county - but instead two centres are operating in Nenagh and Clonmel. What differentiates Limerick and the Kerry area in this respect? A person living in Cahirciveen or Sneem is expected to go to either Tralee or Skibbereen and travel over significant distances. I ask that the Road Safety Authority consider the amount of available space currently unoccupied within local authorities and other State agencies to see if outreach offices could be provided, particularly in larger counties.</p>

            <from>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport (Deputy Leo Varadkar)<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T18:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_690">I thank Deputy O'Donovan for raising this important matter. The new national driver licensing service is a matter of widespread public interest and I am happy to have a chance to discuss it here. We must be clear about what has changed in issuing driver licences in the past year. Before January 2013, driver licences were issued by the motor taxation offices of local authorities, involving 30 different offices, all dedicating staff and resources to the processing of driver licence applications and the issuing of licences.</p>
            <p eId="para_691">The EU requirement to introduce a plastic card driving licence from January 2013, as opposed to a paper licence, meant that there would be significant changes in the way licences were produced, and this provided an opportunity to review the entire system for driver licensing. Following from a study which examined the alternative ways driver licensing might be organised, the Government decided in May 2011 to move to a centralised national driver licensing service, NDLS. At the same time, the Government decided that the Road Safety Authority would be given charge of this service.</p>
            <p eId="para_692"> Centralising the services offers a number of benefits over the old system. It ensures greater consistency of practice and service across the country and will be more efficient and cost effective. In particular, there is a saving on staff numbers. The creation of a single national driver licensing service also provides for greater security and, under the RSA, offers a one-stop-shop to the public, from theory test to driving test to licence issue. The new system, designed by the RSA, involves three outsourced elements, overseen by a 'specialist unit' based in the RSA headquarters in Ballina. The three outsourced elements are - a card production facility; a front office for engaging with customers; and, a back office to process applications. Contracts were awarded by the RSA for all three services following competitive procurement processes.</p>
            <p eId="para_693"> Between 19 January and 25 October of this year, local authorities continued to provide customer services relating to driver licences on behalf of the RSA. On 29 October last, the RSA assumed full responsibility for the service. Under the front office contract, provided by SGS Ireland Limited on behalf of the NDLS, customer services are offered at 34 full-time centres and two part-time centres around the country. They are open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday, and from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturdays. They also remain open through lunchtimes. These opening hours are more flexible than previously available and more suited to modern lifestyles. Furthermore, people will be able to use any of the offices to apply for or renew their licence rather than just to the centre in their own local authority, as was the case in the past. The new network provides service to 95% of the population within a 50 km radius.</p>
            <p eId="para_694"> There were some teething problems with the launch of the new service on Tuesday, 29 October, which the RSA advises have now been substantially resolved. The main difficulties were delays for customers in some NDLS centres; the customer helpline being out of service for part of the first day; and an IT problem at 12 of the 34 centres on the morning of the first day. These problems were in part exacerbated by a high level of demand due to the mid-term break and pent-up demand in the preceding weeks. The RSA has advised that a number of solutions have been put in place to address the earlier difficulties. These include the assignment of additional staff, the provision of a further information campaign and the deployment of a manual booking system of which applicants can avail.</p>
            <p eId="para_695"> Furthermore, the RSA informs me that it is working with the front office contractor to develop an online booking system to be deployed within a month. I understand that in light of the volume of demand at various front office locations, it has been proposed that the booking system will be deployed across all the offices. I have been assured that provision will be made for emergency situations by reserving some capacity for customers who need a licence at short notice. In the course of the past few days, the NDLS has operated a manual booking system to manage queues on the ground and that has helped to reduce queues significantly across the network. Additional staff have been assigned on the ground to ensure that customers do not have unduly long waits.</p>
            <p eId="para_696"> It is important to also state that the requirement to attend in person only occurs once, when the person receives a first credit card style driver's licence under this new system. On that occasion, the person's image is captured through the SAFE 2 system and identity is verified in person. That is an important measure to prevent fraud. After attending once in person, people can renew their licence through the post and are not required to attend the centres in person again when their licence needs to be renewed or updated. The move to a centralised driver licensing service is the right one in the long term, and will provide a better service to the public as well as greater security and better value for money. While there have been teething troubles with the new system, which we all very much regret, I am satisfied that these are being dealt with quickly and effectively by the RSA and should be resolved in the coming days and weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_697">The Minister indicated that 95% of the population can avail of the service within 50 km but that leaves approximately 250,000 people who are outside of that range who predominantly live in rural areas. There has been a reduction in the number of centres from 55 to 34. The vast majority of the centres that have been closed are in rural communities, which is the reason people were waiting for up to four and a half hours last week in the Parkway shopping centre in Limerick.</p>
            <p eId="para_698"> When he discusses the issue with the RSA I urge the Minister to bear in mind the number of people who are driving without a current licence due to tractors and cars being taken off the road. Currently, a significant number of motor taxation issues arise over and above the issue of driver licences. Perhaps the timing of the introduction of the new system is inopportune. The reason I raised the substantive issue is the need for outreach services in rural areas in particular due to the coverage of offices. I did not say people had to go to the local authority in which they live but I made the point that the distance between Limerick and Tralee is more than 110 km and the people living in that corridor alone are at a significant disadvantage compared to somebody living in Leopardstown. I urge the Government to examine the issue, in particular in light of the number of unoccupied local authority offices around the country. That will especially be a factor given the local government Bill to provide for the abolition of town councils when a raft of offices around the country will not have a purpose. I encourage the RSA to examine the use of such offices rather than engaging in an expensive lease agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_699"> I welcome the fact that the offices will be open on Saturdays and at lunch time. It begs the question of why other public services do not operate to the same level of efficiency. If the service provided by the RSA currently is up to scratch why does it have a manual booking system and is it considering the possibility of introducing an online booking system? Surely be to God that underlines the fact that the offices as currently constituted are under-resourced and under-staffed to deal with the volume of applications received. I urge that my concerns would be relayed to the RSA.</p>

            <p eId="para_700">I met the CEO of the RSA about the matter yesterday and I will meet him again in the next few weeks. I will certainly pass on Deputy O’Donovan’s concerns. It is the case that the number of staff provided did not match the demand. The demand was more than anticipated and as a result in the first week there were not enough staff. The issue is now being resolved.</p>
            <p eId="para_701"> Previously, local authority offices did more than provide licences, they dealt with motor taxation as well and off-the-road declarations among other issues. They tended not to be open at lunch time and they were not open on Saturdays. The same is true of post offices. In many ways that is the reason the contract went elsewhere because a better service could be provided at a much lower cost.</p>
            <p eId="para_702"> Unless a person’s appearance changes dramatically, a person will have to attend a driver licensing service centre only once in their lives to get their SAFE 2 photograph. It is fair to say that the vast majority of people I know, who either live in rural Limerick, Cork or elsewhere in the country, do drive to the city or go to the main town probably a few times a year and certainly more often than once in their lives. The booking system will allow them to tie in a visit for that purpose onto a shopping trip or other reason for being in the nearest town or city.</p>
            <p eId="para_703"> That said, I accept Deputy O’Donovan’s basic point that 5% of the population is 250,000 people and they do not have an office proximate to them but there might be potential solutions. One solution could be to provide more part-time centres such as the Deputy mentioned. An alternative solution which could be examined, although I am not sure whether it is possible, would be a mobile centre that could travel to various parts of the country and in particular to isolated areas. People would have advance notice of when the service would be in a particular area a few times a year. It must be borne in mind that in future, people will need such photographs for other forms of ID. I am not sure whether such a system is possible under the current contract but contracts can be amended. I would like to see the new system bed down for a couple of weeks and then we will examine the situation again and see if further changes need to be made.</p>

            <p eId="para_704">As the Minister is no doubt aware, earlier this week Aer Lingus management announced its intention to close the cabin crew base at Shannon Airport from the end of March 2014. That follows the company’s unilateral announcement in September that it would outsource cabin crew services on a new transatlantic service from January 2014. The announcement was directly contrary to an agreement which Aer Lingus had reached with the pilots in negotiations on the outsourcing the 757 service in the first place.</p>
            <p eId="para_705"> In response to that unilateral action IMPACT members in Aer Lingus across the country were balloted and they determined that they would go on strike.</p>
            <p eId="para_706">I am relieved at today's events whereby the LRC has invited both parties to talks. I hope Aer Lingus will formally announce it will be accepting that invitation, if it has not already done so.</p>
            <p eId="para_707"> The limitations on what the Government can do with regard to Aer Lingus have been very well rehearsed in this House. As we all know, it not a State-owned company any more; there is merely a minority shareholding. When Aer Lingus pulled the flights from Shannon Airport to Heathrow Airport, with disastrous consequences, these arguments were debated at great length. At the time Members were told the Government could not use its shareholding to force Aer Lingus to take a particular action. However, the Government's advice from the Attorney General on the issue, as with the advice from the Attorney General on many other issues, was not published. During the last general election campaign I campaigned for the Attorney General's advice to be published. I do not really understand why the Attorney General's advice on a wide range of issues cannot be published. I understand there are issues of commercial sensitivity, but when it comes to issues of constitutional change, it is another matter. Today there was an announcement or a decision made by the Cabinet. In this regard, I just do not know why Attorney General's advice cannot be published. I do not wish to digress on this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_708"> The Government, as a significant shareholder in Aer Lingus, has an interest in maintaining the value of the company. This is determined by and very reliant on loyalty, including customer loyalty. Unlike companies with which Aer Lingus competes, in respect of short-haul flights to Europe and even transatlantic flights, the airline is very reliant on customer loyalty. It is very difficult to see how that customer loyalty can be maintained, while at the same time abusing the loyalty of long-term staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_709"> There is a notion among the new management that Aer Lingus having been a company for which people worked for their entire working lives does not fit with some of the practices of its competitors. People work for a year or two as cabin crew with the latter and then burn out and move on to other jobs. In Aer Lingus this has not been the practice. Its customers value this and it is part of the reason the company was able to survive. It survived because of the loyalty of its staff and customer base.</p>
            <p eId="para_710"> We have been told by the Irish Aviation Authority that it is safe to have four-person crews on transatlantic flights. However, there is the difference between what is safe and what is comfortable or what provides a reasonable level of customer service. Aer Lingus prides itself on and markets itself on the basis of providing that customer service. It has competitors which until very recently marketed themselves on not providing customer service, but that model does not seem to be working and the competitors are changing. It seems bizarre at this time that Aer Lingus is seeking to reduce the level of its customer service. I look forward to the Minister's reply.</p>

            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T18:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_711">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_712"> Aer Lingus is a publicly quoted company and decisions regarding its employees and bases are commercial matters for the board and management. As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have no role in such decisions. For that reason what I can say is somewhat limited. While the State retains a 25% shareholding in Aer Lingus, this does not allow it to become involved in the day-to-day commercial operations of the company. However, the Government is committed to the new independent Shannon Airport company being a success and sustaining employment opportunities in the mid-west. The closure of Aer Lingus's Shannon Airport cabin crew base would be very regrettable and the Government urges the relevant parties to make every effort to reach agreement in order that the base can remain open.</p>
            <p eId="para_713"> Last July Aer Lingus announced a significant expansion of its transatlantic routes and capacity for 2014. This included very positive developments for Shannon Airport, since one element is that Aer Lingus's Shannon-Boston and Shannon-New York services will resume during the winter months in 2014. The company had ceased operating these services for part of the winter season in recent years as they had proved loss-making for it when operated with large A330 aircraft, as opposed to the narrow-body aircraft that it will now use. The resumption of year-round services will, according to Shannon Airport, result in a 25% increase, or 50,000 additional passengers, on Aer Lingus transatlantic flights in 2014. With other new Aer Lingus European routes out of Shannon Airport, this was welcomed as an indication of the airline's continued commitment to the airport.</p>
            <p eId="para_714"> In addition to increased services at Shannon Airport, Aer Lingus announced new year-round direct services to San Francisco and Toronto from Dublin Airport in April 2014. These new services were welcomed by all concerned when first announced last summer, in particular by the inbound tourism industry and the many IT employers in the country with close links with the Silicon Valley area. Providing a year-round direct service to Shannon Airport for tourists inbound from the USA will provide a major boost for the local tourism industry and the wider western and mid-western regions. These new services have been made possible because Aer Lingus is leasing three smaller Boeing 757 aircraft from another Irish airline, Air Contractors. It was originally announced that Air Contractors would supply the aircraft and that the crew would be Aer Lingus employees. The company began the recruitment process for additional cabin crew for this purpose. </p>
            <p eId="para_715"> Agreement for these new arrangements had been reached with the company's pilots and cabin crew represented by SIPTU. However, on 24 October it was announced that the company had failed to reach agreement with IMPACT cabin crew. As I understand it, the dispute focuses, in particular, on cabin crew numbers on the smaller Boeing 757 aircraft. Aer Lingus is proposing to crew the aircraft with four cabin crew and has received regulatory and safety approval for doing so. Other issues such as the cabin manager grade and rostering have also been raised by IMPACT. It is reported that Aer Lingus believes IMPACT's objections to the new arrangements would make the Shannon Airport cabin crew base commercially unsustainable for the company and that it would have little choice but to close the Shannon Airport base and request Air Contractors to provide cabin crew for the Shannon-US services. In response to this, on 4 November it was announced that the IMPACT cabin crew had balloted overwhelmingly in favour of industrial action in the order of 91%. The ballot was of all IMPACT cabin crew in the State. The company has not yet been served with notice of industrial action.</p>
            <p eId="para_716"> The LRC has had contacts with both sides and it was announced earlier today that they had been invited to meet it this Friday in an attempt to find agreement in the dispute. The Government strongly urges both sides to use the available industrial relations machinery of the State to reach agreement on the matter as soon as possible in the interests of the travelling public, staff and the company. Industrial action in the company could be very disruptive for passengers in the run-up to Christmas and very damaging for the company. It would be very regrettable if the boost the Shannon region would get from the increased Aer Lingus services at the airport were to be marred by a reduction in the numbers employed at the airport owing to an industrial relations dispute.</p>

            <p eId="para_717">I accepted at the very outset the commercial nature of the Government's interest in Aer Lingus, but my question was on whether the commercial developments in Aer Lingus were in the commercial best interests of the company, particularly in an increasingly competitive market. I am thankful there is a more competitive market, including at Shannon Airport, at which there is increased competition on both short-haul and transatlantic routes. The company was a flag carrier and still markets itself very much as the flag carrier. We still remember the slogan, "Look up, it's Aer Lingus!" There are differences in the marketing strategies of European airline companies, from former flag carriers to newer, more dynamic companies that may engage in sharper practices in regard to their workforces. However, the companies with which Aer Lingus competes, including the former flag carrier British Airways, certainly have a higher number of staff on their long-haul flights than some of their competitors. People pay for this. Generally, Aer Lingus flights are more expensive than those of some of its competitors, but people pay more in the hope they will receive a better service. Thanks to Aer Lingus's loyal workers at its bases at Shannon, Cork and Dublin airports, customers receive the desired level of service. However, it is hard for a company to expect to be able to provide that level of service while at the same time treating workers in the way Shannon Airport based cabin crew have been treated. The Minister mentioned the 30 cabin crew trainees who were taken on only three weeks ago to be trained for the transatlantic flights. They have since been summarily fired. That is not the way to treat workers one had hoped would manage the new service and build a loyal customer base.</p>
            <p eId="para_718"> I am glad of the Government's support and hope it will not be called into question when fixing the huge pension deficit. The staffing dispute is against the backdrop of the pensions deficit. The deficit at the Dublin Airport Authority affects Shannon Airport employees and all former Aer Lingus employees. I hope this issue can also be sorted out. I realise it is an entirely separate dispute, but it forms a backdrop to it nevertheless.</p>

            <p eId="para_719">It is really good news for the Shannon region and Ireland that it has been possible to restore services, including winter transatlantic services, to San Francisco.</p>
            <p eId="para_720">Part of the reason they failed before is that they were not commercial - the aircraft were too big and the costs were too high. If we want those services to work, they must be commercial and Aer Lingus must make decisions on the appropriate staffing costs. The Deputy should bear in mind that the difference between five staff members and four is 25% in costs, while six staff over four represents 50% in costs. Staff numbers make a significant difference. </p>
            <p eId="para_721"> It is my preference that the base would remain open and that the staff should be normal Aer Lingus employees and that the additional jobs would go to normal Aer Lingus employees. That preference will be communicated to the Government-appointed members of the Aer Lingus board. The only way to achieve that, however, is for Impact and Aer Lingus to come to an agreement at the LRC and I hope they will be able to do that.</p>

          <p eId="para_725">I move the following motions:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_726"> That Dáil Éireann recommends Mr. Peter Tyndall for appointment by the President to be the Ombudsman.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_727">and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_728"> That Dáil Éireann recommends Mr. Peter Tyndall for appointment by the President to be the Information Commissioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">I will not require the 15 minutes allowed but will be happy to respond to any questions Deputies may have at the conclusion of our discussions.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> I have much pleasure in recommending to the House that Mr. Peter Tyndall be appointed by the President to be the Ombudsman and Information Commissioner. The need for these appointments arises following the resignation of Ms Emily O'Reilly from both offices from 29 September 2013 on foot of her election by the European Parliament as European Ombudsman. Ms O'Reilly had served in both offices from June 2003, having been reappointed in 2009. The separate legislation which governs each of these offices specifies that the appointment is made by the President, but only after this House and the Seanad have passed resolutions recommending that a particular person be appointed. I can advise the House that the resolutions were passed in the Seanad earlier today. The appointments are for six years and can be renewed, but only by going through the same resolution and appointment procedure.</p>
          <p eId="para_731"> I would like to take the opportunity again to congratulate Ms Emily O'Reilly on her election as European Ombudsman and commend her on the work she did in this jurisdiction. The exemplary work she did stood her in good stead in securing the very difficult task of winning the votes of the majority of the European Parliament to be the European Ombudsman against stiff opposition, including from members of the Parliament itself. All Members of this House will wish Ms O'Reilly God speed in the new role she is undertaking.</p>
          <p eId="para_732"> The proposition before the House is to appoint Mr. Peter Tyndall. Mr. Tyndall is originally from Ireland and the Acting Chairman, Deputy Mathews will be pleased to note he is a Dub. He has retained close links with this country in his years abroad. He comes to this post with a wealth of relevant experience. He has been Ombudsman for Wales since 2008. His office deals with complaints concerning public organisations responsible for delivering services devolved to the Welsh Government from Whitehall, including health, social care housing and local government. He has devoted considerable effort to modernising the systems in his office with a view to providing prompt effective resolution of complex cases and to ensuring that his office acted as a catalyst for improvement in public services. In his tenure as Ombudsman for Wales, Mr. Tyndall was able to draw on decades of experience in various fields of public service in Wales. Before he became Welsh Ombudsman, he was Chief Executive of the Welsh Arts Council and prior to his work with the Arts Council, he was Head of Education and Culture for the Welsh Local Government Association. He enjoys very substantial respect among his ombudsman peers and recently served a two-year term as Chairman of the British and Irish Ombudsman Association and is a member of the World and European boards of the International Ombudsman Institute.</p>

          <p eId="para_736">In Mr. Tyndall I am fully satisfied that we have a well qualified, experienced and suitable nominee for appointment as our next Ombudsman and Information Commissioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> The practice in the past was for the relevant Minister to ask the Government to note the name of the proposed nominee prior to consultation with the leaders of the opposition parties and the resolution process. It was my view that the most satisfactory approach to this nomination process was to depart from that established practice and to invite expressions of interest for the appointment by public advertisement. This new procedure is the first of its kind in relation to this appointment and facilitated a wider consideration of potential appointees than would have been possible otherwise. Basically, we asked anybody who was interested to make an application in confidence. A total of 35 expressions of interest were received from individuals with a wide range of experience spanning both the public and private sectors and included journalists, public relations practitioners, serving Ombudsmen, public representatives, serving and retired public servants as well as legal and business professionals. This represented a very strong pool from which to select a nominee for appointment.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> Having considered the personal and professional qualities set out in the invitation for expressions of interest, I submitted the name of Mr. Peter Tyndall as the nominee for appointment to the Government and the Government approve his nomination.</p>
          <p eId="para_739"> As the House is aware, Mr. Tyndall's name was then referred to the Public Services Oversight and Petitions Committee under the new provision within the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012. He met the committee on 23 October last and indicated that he would bring an objectivity and clarity to the role. He also indicated that, as Information Commissioner, he would relish the opportunity to bring about the changes in the impending freedom of information legislation which will widen the number of bodies included and will improve access to information more generally. He is also committed to improving the performance of the offices.</p>
          <p eId="para_740"> I am fully confident that Mr. Tyndall will bring a great deal of prior experience and knowledge to these positions and I am happy to put forward these resolutions, namely that the House recommend Mr. Peter Tyndall for appointment by the President to be the Ombudsman and Commissioner for Information.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanFleming" eId="spk_481">
          <from>Deputy Sean Fleming<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T18:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_741">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motions concerning the appointment of a new Ombudsman and Information Commissioner. I support the nomination of Mr. Tyndall for these posts. I hope there will not be a division in the House on this matter but if one is called, I will support the appointment of Mr. Tyndall.</p>
          <p eId="para_742"> I have listened carefully to the Minister and acknowledge that there have been some improvements in the appointment process. Regarding Mr. Tyndall himself, I acknowledge that he was the Ombudsman in Wales for a number of years. He is originally from Dublin, which is no harm. He was appointed as public service Ombudsman in Wales in 2008 after a selection procedure that was conducted by the Welsh Assembly itself. Ultimately, I would like to see such a procedure adopted by this House in the context of the next appointment of Ombudsman and Commissioner for Information, whereby people could apply for the posts to the House, perhaps through the Oireachtas Commission, a relevant Oireachtas committee or the line Department or some other mechanism of the House's choosing.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">I would recommend that process for the appointment of the new Secretary General of the Oireachtas rather than a diktat coming from the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_744"> It was good the Ombudsman-designate, Mr. Peter Tyndall, attended an Oireachtas joint committee last month. However, his appointment had already been decided by the Government, so he was in to be introduced rather than to be interviewed. It would be a much better practice if prospective candidates could be interviewed by relevant Oireachtas Members and public users of the offices in question. Despite the traditional shortcomings in the appointment process, I believe we have always got the right answer. I wish Ms Emily O’Reilly every success in her new role as European Ombudsman. It is a significant challenge and highlights the calibre of our people who can stand with the best anyone in the EU can offer. I recall meeting her predecessor, Mr. Kevin Murphy, here in the Oireachtas. The first Ombudsman, Mr. Michael Mills, was a county man of my own from Mountmellick. We have been well served by previous officeholders. I hope the same will happen with Mr. Peter Tyndall and, when he comes to retire, it will be acknowledged in the Chamber that he did a good job.</p>
          <p eId="para_745"> His role in Ireland will be larger than the one he had in Wales. He will also have to fulfil the role of the Information Commissioner, a separate, distinct and important function. I note there has been a slight reduction, 1%, in the office’s expenditure for next year. I hope Mr. Tyndall will be able to make ends meet with the limited resources available to him. We will have to take the cut on the chin and get on with it. The Ombudsman will be a member of the Commission for Public Service Appointments. While I suspect that role has been quiet in recent times, when the public sector recruitment embargo is lifted, it will become a busier part of the Ombudsman’s work.</p>
          <p eId="para_746"> The Ombudsman is also involved with the Constituency Commission. That is an important and different function. The commission needs to be removed from the cut and thrust of politics in the Chamber. While it examines population figures for constituency make-up on a factual, cold and hard basis, it should take into account the consideration of local geographic and social factors.</p>
          <p eId="para_747"> The key role for an Ombudsman is membership of the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO. Its role has increased enormously in recent times. It deals not just with donations to political parties but has greater levels of scrutiny in election expenditure. There has also been a reduction in the amounts that can be contributed to political parties. The commission deals with the auditing of the party leaders’ allowances. There will be legislation to ensure the Independent leaders’ allowance will be amended. This will apply to Independents in the Seanad too. For some curious reason, this had escaped public attention but the genie is now out of the bottle. I am happy the Minister will be introducing this legislation shortly.</p>

          <p eId="para_749">The commission has been diligent in pursuing electoral candidates who have not reported their expenditure during elections and registering third parties involved in promoting a point of view during a campaign. We have a much regulated financial system for donations to and the expenditure of political parties and candidates.</p>
          <p eId="para_750"> It was intended that the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner would merge with the Information Commissioner. However, this was deferred some time ago due to external factors. Will the Minister inform us if it is still off the agenda? The role of the Data Protection Commissioner is increasing. Only today, I heard him again on the radio on his role with the many multinationals headquartered here in Ireland such as Google. I believe the two offices have separate and distinct roles.</p>
          <p eId="para_751"> In the past, it was proposed that the back office facilities of the Information Commissioner would be merged with those of the Ombudsman for Children. Has this been done already? I would be concerned with such an amalgamation as both offices have totally different tasks. Will the Minister inform us either at the end of the debate or through correspondence as to where this proposal stands? Where stands the legislation on foot of the passing of the children’s referendum last year?</p>
          <p eId="para_752"> Approximately 3,500 complaints are made to the Ombudsman each year, the largest number concern the Department of Social Protection, local authorities and the Health Service Executive. The Ombudsman legislation was amended last year to extend its remit to an additional 180 bodies which means it now covers over 300 bodies. One regret the outgoing Ombudsman, Ms Emily O’Reilly, had concerned her detailed investigation into the mobility allowance and motorised transport grant which highlighted it was in breach of legislation while it was operated in an inequitable and illegal manner. She felt the Government’s right response to a report such as that would be to deal with whatever was illegal and put the scheme on a proper footing. However, the Government took the worst-case option and abolished the scheme in its entirety. Anyone following this matter did not expect such a course of action and it needs to be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">The Office of the Ombudsman issues very few reports and becomes frustrated at the lack of response from Departments. I ask, as a matter of policy, that all Ministers ensure their Departments accept and fully implement any decision of an Ombudsman regarding a matter in their remit. If they have an issue, they should give it extra time and tease it out. The Office of the Ombudsman might make an incorrect legal interpretation but rather than having a stand-off, a report printed, a committee debate and a Department refusing to implement a decision, I would like to see those matters fully thrashed out and Departments agreeing to implement whatever recommendations come forth.</p>
          <p eId="para_754"> We spoke about extending the Ombudsman's role, and this is a key issue. I have just referred to the new legislation that extended the role, but, surprisingly, the postal services provided by An Post were removed from the Office of the Ombudsman's remit from 2 August 2011. Other An Post services including savings schemes and the issuing of television licences were removed from its remit from 1 November 2012. People who had complaints about these An Post services were able to go to the Ombudsman before but they are now dealt with by ComReg. Will the Minister outline the legal mechanism by which that was done? Was there a statutory instrument to remove an organisation from the Ombudsman's remit?</p>
          <p eId="para_755"> What other public bodies have been removed from the Ombudsman's remit recently of which the public might not be aware? What other cases are in the pipeline? We have a plethora of regulators. If ComReg has roles in these areas and the Ombudsman will not now have a role, we must examine whether we are satisfied that ComReg will be as independent as an Ombudsman would be in dealing with cases in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_756"> The role of Information Commissioner is also a key function of Mr. Tyndall. I look forward to him having a good, robust and open approach to that. In her final report on 2012 earlier this summer Ms O'Reilly noted that there had been a 38% increase in the number of FOI reviews and applications by her office in 2012. It is good to see an increase and people using the office. We will have a detailed discussion on the FOI Bill on Committee Stage next week and I spent the past hour dealing with a number of amendments, all of which I hope will be taken on board by the Minister next week.</p>

          <p eId="para_758">However, I will have to table a new amendment on a subject that I only researched today. In her report on 2012, Ms O'Reilly expressed disappointment at the decision of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to stop collating the statistics on FOI returns due to the unsustainable administrative workload. The Information Commissioner was consequently unable to publish information and provide a commentary in her annual report on FOI requests made to that public body in 2012. It is not good enough that a Department would say it does not have the time or resources for this. Maybe the Minister could take that particular point on board and address it in legislation, not to allow a Department to shove FOI to one side or into the waste paper bin if it so chooses.</p>
          <p eId="para_759"> We will have the FOI Bill coming next week. Mr. Tyndall will observe closely. I hope we will have abolished fees by the time he takes up his office. I hope Irish Water, a public body, will be under his remit. I hope the secrecy provisions embedded in several other items of legislation, and on which Ms O'Reilly disagreed with various Departments, will be changed on Committee Stage and that Mr. Tyndall will have a successful career in his office as Ombudsman and Information Commissioner on behalf of the public he serves.</p>

          <p eId="para_761">Before dealing with the motion before us I acknowledge the tremendous work of Ms Emily O'Reilly. Her forthright and fearless approach to the role of Ombudsman ensured citizens were well served by her office. Our loss is Europe's gain and I have no doubt that Ms O'Reilly will play a critical role in making the Union more relevant to member state citizens in her new role as European Ombudsman. To echo the sentiment of my colleague, Deputy Mac Lochlainn, I thank Ms O'Reilly for her dedication and professionalism that was underpinned by her fundamental motivation that public services are delivered in a manner in which the rights of each and every citizen are vindicated.</p>
          <p eId="para_762"> On publication of her tenth and final annual report as Ombudsman Ms O'Reilly reflected that the financial constraint of the State is not an excuse for poor service, inequitable treatment or a denial of rights. She said that public bodies must work harder to eliminate the common causes of complaint to the Office of the Ombudsman. She also called on the Oireachtas to hold the Administration to account and insist that bodies take responsibility for their actions, to right wrongs where they are found, and change their services to avoid reoccurrence.</p>
          <p eId="para_763"> Similar sentiments were raised during the annual national seminar of the European network of Ombudsmen held recently in Dublin. The theme of this year's seminar was "good administration and the rights of citizens in a time of austerity", a very timely theme. Ms Ann Abraham, former Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman for England, told those gathered that she believed citizens have the right to expect good administration from their governments at all times, and even more so in a time of austerity. She observed that delivering good administration has been and remains an uphill struggle for governments whatever their persuasions, political stripes or economic contexts. She also noted that despite what governments say, good administration does not come easily or naturally.</p>
          <p eId="para_764"> The Minister and his Government partners would do well to take note of Ms O'Reilly and Ms Abraham's comments, and all those who advocate for citizens' rights. This Government needs to lift its gaze from the bottom line. Time and again I have raised this point with the Minister, and time and again the Minister's response has been limited and sometimes dismissive. That is not good enough. Citizens expect more, and they are correct in their expectation.</p>
          <p eId="para_765"> I have welcomed the Minister's legislative reforms in lobbying, Freedom of Information, which was cynically gutted by the previous administration, and legislation to protect whistleblowers. Plans to engage with the Open Government Partnership are positive and hold enormous potential for public administration in this State. Extending the remit of the Office of the Ombudsman is extremely welcome and long overdue. However, as I have stated before, these reforms, while welcome and timely, are not enough and do not indicate the type of ambitious reform and robust oversight our public bodies are capable of and our citizens need.</p>
          <p eId="para_766"> In the previous Government, Fianna Fáil failed the citizens of this State. They held us back from the type of reform many of us envisage. They introduced and held on tightly to the culture of a nod and a wink, and looking after one's own man. Fianna Fáil leader Deputy Martin sometimes likes to pretend he is the champion of a Fianna Fáil nua but this is not the case. Deputy Martin is as responsible for Fianna Fáil's failure to bring public sector reform and oversight into the 21st century as his former bosses Bertie Ahern and Brian Cowen.</p>
          <p eId="para_767"> For now, the Minister needs to hear what Ms O'Reilly has said, and look to put in place the necessary long-term solutions to tackle ongoing shortfalls within the public sector. As already noted, the largest number of complaints to the Office of the Ombudsman relate to the Department of Social Protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">For any of us doing constituency work on the front line, this does not come as a great surprise. The local authorities come in just behind social welfare. These two bodies, along with the HSE, receive the lion's share of complaints. We must ask why this is the case and what the Government and the Minister's long term strategy is to deal with this.</p>
          <p eId="para_769"> On behalf of Sinn Féin I commend the appointment of Mr. Peter Tyndall - a "dacent Dub", as noted by the Minister. He has an impressive CV by any standards and I welcome him to the post of Ombudsman and Information Commissioner. He has had a long career in public service and is well versed on the critical role of the Ombudsman, having held such a position for the past five years in Wales. I wish him every success and commend the Government on his selection, whatever the shortfalls in the selection process. I look forward to any and all engagements with Mr. Tyndall in his new role.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T19:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_770">Like others, I wish the outgoing Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, the best of luck in her new role in Europe. She has been an exemplary ombudsman, a fearless champion of people's rights who was genuinely and passionately concerned with vindicating the rights of ordinary citizens, even when dealing with controversial and difficult issues and up against the obstacle of the State and bureaucracy which were not always amenable to criticism and questioning. She pursued issues in a commendable and impressive way.</p>
          <p eId="para_771"> The work she did on the issue of the motorised transport grant and the mobility allowance was extraordinarily important in itself, but also in terms of its wider implications in highlighting a challenge for this or any Government. She highlighted the fact the State was breaking its own laws on equality, particularly for the infirm, the elderly and the disabled, because it believed it could not afford to vindicate those rights. That issue is still not resolved and when the Minister for Health came before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Service, Oversight and Petitions, he put up his hands and said the Department could not afford to give people their rights. This is extraordinary, particularly when we are talking about some of the most vulnerable people in society. </p>
          <p eId="para_772"> It is to Emily O'Reilly's great credit that she brought this issue to the fore. She had to do so against a HSE that did not want to know and that ignored her. The Government also ignored her, but she persisted and eventually forced the issue into the public domain. It remains a challenge for the Government to resolve the issue in a fair way. We were all shocked when the response to this anomaly was to abolish the scheme. The Government has said that the beneficiaries of the scheme will not suffer, but it has made it clear that it cannot afford to provide for the other people whom they fear may become beneficiaries. I agree with Emily O'Reilly, who was forthright on this, that rights are rights. If they are rights, the State must vindicate them and must find the resources to do so. Ms O'Reilly raised an important specific issue, but she also raised a serious challenge for this and any Government. We cannot talk about rights and then not provide the resources to vindicate those rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_773"> Emily O'Reilly was also forthright when talking about issues on which we need to direct a spotlight and areas that have been excluded from the remit of the Ombudsman, such as prisons and the asylum process. The situation with regard to the asylum process and the direct provision system is shocking. It is urgent that any Government that claims to be interested in the rights of citizens, equality and fair treatment for people resident in the State should deal with the unacceptable situation that pertains in the direct provision system. People, including families and children, are effectively non-people in this system. They have no rights and no proper recourse to justice. They are certainly not on an equal footing with residents of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_774"> Children live in appalling hostel conditions year after year. They spend their childhoods in these places - reminiscent of a 21st century version of the Magdalen laundries and the residential institutions where terrible things were done to less well off women and young people. I believe we are allowing a system to persist in which we will discover the same sort of abuses and injustices are taking place. There is considerable evidence that this is the case. Emily O'Reilly was forthright in saying these areas should be subject to full scrutiny and should not be excluded from the remit of the Ombudsman. </p>
          <p eId="para_775"> The Minister has commended the work of the former Ombudsman, but is the Government going to take seriously her appeal that direct provision and the asylum process be examined and that there be full transparency and openness in this regard? I believe the direct provision system should be abolished, but those in the asylum process should have rights and justice afforded to them as it is afforded to any other human being. Human rights are rights that are without borders and it is important that the Government vindicate these rights. I hope Mr. Tyndall will follow up on those areas highlighted by Emily O'Reilly.</p>
          <p eId="para_776"> I wish Mr. Tyndall the best of luck. I am a member of the committee he attended, but I could not make the meeting. I am also a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and, unfortunately, sometimes our meetings clash. His attendance was positive. However, the Minister is aware that questions have been raised about the process. Mr. Tyndall is on record as saying that for appointments such as these, selection, interview and appointment, as happens in Wales where he was Ombudsman, should be dealt with by the Parliament and not simply by the Executive.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">It appears the Minister has made a very good choice, and anything I say which is critical or questioning is not in any sense to question the obviously very impressive credentials of Mr. Tyndall or, in this case, probably the Minister's choice, as being a good one. It is still nonetheless important to question the processes because whether things work out well or favourable from the point of view of the public and the public interest cannot be left to the whim of individuals. We need a process which is transparent and open with the widest public oversight of important appointments and decisions. There is a problem in terms of how these appointments happen and it should not be just left to the Minister to present us with his nomination. I do not know who are the other people who expressed interest when the Minister advertised the post, but I am sure there were other good, qualified people. There are serious and fair questions to ask about the nomination and appointment process and these are points Mr. Tyndall himself has raised publicly in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_778"> Mr. Tyndall's credentials seem very impressive. He is obviously somebody who is respected by his peers. His range of experience seems very impressive in a diversity of areas in public service, from the arts to the position of Ombudsman itself and also in areas such as social care and housing, which is tremendously important given what other speakers have stated, that the biggest areas of complaints are in social protection and local authorities, and we might say many of the complaints, probably the majority, emanating from local authorities are in the area of housing, which is a real problem which I and others have raised many times. There are real problems about the provision of housing and the right to housing, and also issues to do with tenants' rights, which I raised with Emily O'Reilly and which I hope Mr. Tyndall will examine.</p>
          <p eId="para_779"> An area I would like to mention, if Mr. Tyndall is listening, is how we deal with antisocial behaviour and the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act. Antisocial behaviour is a very serious problem, and we must have a system to deal with it which protects the rights of all residents in local authority housing. An antisocial behaviour officer in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown admitted to me, with regard to a particular case in which I was helping to represent somebody, that he had been given what he described as draconian powers. Many people have examined these powers and lawyers believe they breach the European Convention on Human Rights because antisocial behaviour officers can simply designate, without proper due process, somebody as being antisocial where there is very little recourse for them. Often this may be absolutely fair, reasonable, just and in the best interests of estate management and other tenants, but in other cases there is real potential for an abuse and infringement of people's rights to due process and natural justice and to the right to housing itself. The area must be seriously examined so we vindicate the rights of tenants and human beings generally in the face of State bodies and local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_780"> Ms Emily O'Reilly was positive, as we all were at the committee when it was discussed, about the extension of the remit of the Ombudsman to up to 300 areas, and this is certainly a very positive development. In the area of freedom of information, which is connected, it is a real problem that there are certain exclusions, particularly with regard to semi-State bodies under the general heading of commercial sensitivities. Semi-State bodies are very important: people interact with them at many levels economically and they are big employers. They have many types of impacts on our society and it is deeply problematic that something which is fully publicly owned is at one remove from proper oversight and from where the public can get proper information from bodies such as harbour boards, Coillte and Irish Water in future. To my mind this is a problem and I do not accept the rather catch-all and vague term "commercial sensitivity" should insulate these very important public bodies from proper scrutiny and oversight and being subject to freedom of information legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_781"> I wish Mr. Tyndall well in what is a very important role. Emily O'Reilly stated the office had managed to maintain with difficulty its service despite the cuts in its budget. I hope the Ombudsman's office will get the support it needs to discharge its role and support citizens dealing with problems in navigating the difficulties they may have with State agencies and public bodies.</p>

          <p eId="para_782">I thank all Deputies who contributed. It is important not only that the House would endorse the nomination but that it would be an all-party nomination because it strengthens the hand of the incoming Ombudsman if this is the case. I am taken by the point made by Deputies Fleming and Boyd Barrett about the process. I wanted the process to be different. I am absolutely open to a different process and I invite the committee to examine it, perhaps based on the Welsh model. My problem is that many of the 35 people who applied are in significant public roles in the country and they might not be too keen on putting their names in the public domain. I am sure there must be a way around this. The committee might consider it. During the debate on the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act I stated I would prefer the Ombudsman to be an officer of the Parliament rather than of the Executive. This is why we wanted a committee to which the Ombudsman would report directly and not through a Department of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_783"> I will leave the appointment of the Secretary General here to another debate. I will introduce legislation on it as I promised. We have some work to do. Next week we will have an opportunity to debate freedom of information. I have a different view to Deputy Boyd Barrett on commercial semi-State bodies. Like me he supports the commercial semi-State bodies and I do not want them to be disadvantaged. We need to have a system which does not disadvantage them with regard to non-semi-State companies in their operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_784"> Deputy McDonald will be completely shocked because I very strongly agree with almost everything she stated. I attended the Open Government Partnership forum in London for two days last week. It was an exciting place to be. We might have a delegation at the next plenary session. There are now 61 countries involved and we are examining everything with regard to how open data works. I issued a statement that I want Ireland to be a leader on the default position being that all data should be in the public domain and not that one must run after it. Freedom of information legislation should be moot over time because data should be automatically available. Technical issues arise but this is where we should be going. Very experienced people spoke about the practicalities of whistleblowing and freedom of information.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">It would be helpful if we all collectively engaged in that process.</p>
          <p eId="para_786"> With regard to Deputy Boyd Barrett's point on the expansion of the role, we have, as the Deputy rightly acknowledged, expanded the role of the Ombudsman. We have tripled the umbrella, if one likes, and I will need to talk to the new Ombudsman about how that is to be encompassed. There will be other roles, as has been pointed out - for example, the legislation that will be introduced to deal with the auditing of the party leader's allowance, although it will not be called that any longer; rather, it will be called the parliamentary support allowance. There will be additional work. It is similar to the position with the NTMA, which seems to get a whole lot of additional work bolted onto it, in that the poor Ombudsman seems to be getting a whole lot of work bolted onto the role as well. We need to structure that work.</p>
          <p eId="para_787"> In conclusion, there is a job of work to be done by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions. Perhaps we need to sit down with the Ombudsman, once the President receives our nomination and, presumably, acts upon it, to work out how we can construct a robust office of the Ombudsman and of the Information Commissioner in light of the Ombudsman's Welsh experience and the view he has of Ireland. I want to be as supportive of that as I can be.</p>

          <p eId="para_789">I ran the clock down on the last occasion also. In my last contribution, I complimented the work done by all the former staff of the Meath town councils at Kells, Navan and Trim. They did great work and our towns and county are certainly a lot better for their existence. They had a great influence on development in our towns and county. However, no one can argue that the present system of town councils is fair or proportionate. Why does Kells have a town council while its neighbour Oldcastle, a town which is a little smaller but is an industrial centre, does not? The population of Ashbourne has increased through the housing and commuter boom to one that rivals that of Navan. Rapid growth and poor planning have brought challenges that must be tackled, so why does Ashbourne have no town council? Other south Meath towns such as Dunboyne, Ratoath and Dunshaughlin have also experienced rapid population growth over the past 15 to 20 years, to the point at which they rival Kells or even Trim in size, yet they have no town councils. The same can also be said for the necklace of communities on the short coastline of east Meath, whose geography is nearer Drogheda and whose presence in the Louth Dáil constituency presents their citizens with complicated representational and administrative issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_790"> The many examples I have listed prove a point. To give all of these communities new town councils would totally distort our political system. It would make a nonsense of the county council and its related bodies, such as the education and training boards. It would lead to hundreds of town councillors in a county such as Meath alone, coupled with a county council and six Deputies in two Dáil constituencies, as well as the Louth Deputies from that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_791"> During this debate, and in other debates, many have cited the French system and referred to the powerful mayors in each town, village or rural district in France in support of our own town councils and, indeed, in support of an even greater network of town councils. However, in France, as in many other mainland European countries, it is just a mayor who is elected for a set term and who can be kicked out if he or she does a bad job. There are not nine town councillors electing a chairperson each May or June, backed up by a town clerk and other administration staff. The system is completely different in that there is a spokesperson for a town, not a whole costly system of administration that gets complicated and duplicates a lot of the work done by the area council. Town councils are nice to have but they do not always lead to value for money or speedy decisions. While I acknowledge the great work that has been done by town councils, given that I served as an area councillor, there are complications and delays in decision making which do not benefit the overall areas or towns.</p>
          <p eId="para_792"> As I have already stated, no one could argue that the present system of town councils is fair or proportionate unless that person already lives in a town council area. If there is a town council, naturally, people want to keep it. I welcome the consolidation of city and county councils in Limerick, Waterford and Tipperary. This will allow for a stronger regional voice in these proud and historic cities and counties, while also saving money and avoiding duplication. Nationally, we will move from having 1,400 local public representatives to having just over 900 following the local elections next year. We are fulfilling a key part of Fine Gael's five-point plan and of the Fine Gael-Labour Party programme for Government. The mantra of broken promises holds no water here, yet again.</p>
          <p eId="para_793"> The breaking down of county council work into municipal authorities will also be a new departure for some counties which discharge most of their business at plenary meetings of the county council. In larger counties and cities, most of the real nitty-gritty local work was done through an area committee structure. To me, there are great similarities between the area committee and the municipal authority. While I realise the municipal authorities are intended to be seen as an extension of the town councils formerly contained within them, in practice, most councillors will choose to see them, as I do, as enhanced area committees corresponding with their new local electoral area boundaries.</p>
          <p eId="para_794"> With this in mind, I want to express a very clear view that the main civic and ceremonial role in each county should remain with the chairman or cathaoirleach of the county council. There can only be one first citizen. Municipal authorities will obviously have to elect a chair to order and discharge their business, but they should not have a civic function. There may be a case to be made in this regard by the more historic cities and boroughs, with their own charters which predate the Local Government Act 1898, and I am open to hearing that. However, as a rule, in each county there should only be one boss who is the elected public face of that county. To have multiple chain-holders running around the by-roads of Meath or the streets of Navan, Kells, Trim and many other towns would confuse the public, as well as visitors and potential investors, and would ultimately make the property taxpayer and ratepayer cynical about these worthwhile reforms.</p>
          <p eId="para_795"> I commend the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government on his and his Department's work on this reforming Local Government Bill. It is not easy or nice to abolish town councils, given their history and so on, but it is practical and common sense. I served as a county councillor and, therefore, for five years I was an area councillor, where I saw great work done. That is the way municipal authorities will work. The area council system works very well and that is the way to do it. I look forward to seeing it in operation. I know not everyone will like it but, in time, it will be proved that it was the right thing to do.</p>

          <p eId="para_798">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_799">That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to introduce legislation to regulate the cultivation, sale and possession of cannabis and cannabis products in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">This motion relates to the legalisation of cannabis and I wish to take this opportunity to thank a few people who helped me in respect of it. I refer to Dr. Cathal Ó Súiliobháin and Mr. Stuart Clark, who are both members of the board of NORML Ireland, Dr. Garrett McGovern, Mr. Patrick Fitzpatrick and all the other people who provided assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_801"> When I raised this issue a couple of weeks ago, one of the first things media organisations said was that it is not really that important. I decided to carry out a search of the website of one of the media organisations in questions to discover the number of times it had used the word "cannabis". When I carried out the search, the figure 3,200 appeared on my computer screen. One would imagine that if the issue were not important, then the organisation to which I refer would not mention it that often. In that context, it mentioned the word "troika" on 2,200 occasions. If it is not that important, I would love to know why the organisation's employees are obsessed with writing about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_802"> I am advocating the control, standardisation, legitimisation and taxation of cannabis. I recognise the fact that it is freely available. Those are not my words but rather those of Deputy Emmet Stagg from the Labour Party. I agree with the Deputy 100%. It is no longer radical to state that cannabis should be legalised. One of the major pointers in this regard is a Gallup poll conducted in the United States of America in the past week which shows that 58% of correspondents stated that they are of the view that cannabis should be legalised. Last year, the figure was 48%. A turning point has been reached in respect of this issue across the globe. A poll conducted by <i>thejournal.ie</i> in the past week shows that more than 80% of those who participated agree that cannabis should be legalised. The percentage in favour of legalisation is not the only remarkable aspect. The other remarkable thing is the number of people - more than 40,000 - who participated in the poll. I found it ironic that some of those who oppose the legalisation of cannabis rubbished this poll on the basis that those who smoke or otherwise use cannabis were more motivated to participate in it. That is interesting because the same individuals claim that those who use cannabis suffer from motivation problems. This is strange because if those to whom I refer are actually correct, then the figure would be higher than 80%.</p>
          <p eId="para_803"> When one scans the websites of <i>The Irish Times</i>, the <i>Irish Independent</i> and <i>thejournal.ie</i> for articles on this subject, one will discover that the people of Ireland are actually ready for legalisation. I would not be that confident that the Members of Dáil Éireann are ready for it but then again it would not be the first time we might be somewhat slow to realise what the public wants. The websites of the three publications to which I refer contain more than 1,000 comments on this matter and - from my reading of it - fewer than 50 of those who posted are opposed to legalisation. We are faced with a situation where an issue is still being described as being radical by many people in Dáil Éireann at a time when the majority of the public appears to be on board with what is being suggested.</p>
          <p eId="para_804"> The matter does not end there. All one needs do is visit Deputy Carey's Facebook page in order to discover that this is the case. Great credit is due to the Deputy because he asked people what they thought of the Bill I have drafted. He could have left the matter alone or avoided asking the question but he did not do so. I congratulate him on that. I wonder if the Deputy was surprised by the reaction he received. As has been the case for the past two weeks, I was surprised. I was expecting to be politically beaten up at home as a result of what I am doing because I was of the view that it would not be that popular. My view, however, was so be it. I am increasing the number of likes on Deputy Carey's Facebook page as the seconds go by. If Members visit the page, they will discover that 230 comments have been made. The majority of these show that those who made them are in favour of legalising cannabis. Deputy Carey has informed his Facebook followers that he will listen. I hope he will do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_805"> NORML Ireland, which was launched this week in Buswells Hotel, is further proof that this debate is going mainstream. Two of the members of the board of NORML Ireland are practising GPs who have many years experience in the field of addiction treatment. Another member of the board is journalist Stuart Clark, who does not use cannabis and who has no interest in it. Even further proof that the debate is going mainstream is that Tom Lloyd, the former head of Cambridgeshire police force, has travelled to Ireland twice in the past week in order to support what is being done. However, I was a little surprised when he described me on my local radio station as being a little conservative for his liking. This man spent his entire life trying to prevent people from obtaining cannabis and other illegal substances. At this stage, the penny has dropped. The current system does not work. Mr. Lloyd, who operates in this area and who was employed by Scotland Yard for several years, accepts that it does not work.</p>
          <p eId="para_806"> If ever anyone wanted proof that talk of legalisation is not radical, they should listen to what I am about to say. The Labour Party discussed whether to decriminalise or legalise cannabis at its annual convention in November 2007 but referred the matter to its national executive for further discussion. Putting cannabis on the party agenda was the handiwork of the party Whip, Deputy Stagg, who has long been a proponent of legalisation. The article on this matter to which I am referring states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_807">Ireland has some of the highest cannabis use rates in Europe, Stagg noted. He does not wish to encourage cannabis use, he said; only to regularize a drug that is readily available across the country. Leaving the weed illegal creates criminality and drives young people into the hands of drug dealers, he said.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">I could not agree with Deputy Stagg more. He also stated, "I'm advocating its control, standardization, legitimization and taxation." It gets better. The article goes on to state:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_809">But after contentious debate, the party voted to defer a decision [kicking the can down the road again, something it is good at] on adopting legalization or decriminalization as part of the platform. By a narrow margin, and following the lead of former party leader Pat Rabbitte [I am looking forward to hearing what he has to say about this matter], delegates voted to refer the matter to the National Executive for further discussion. While [Deputy] Rabbitte urged caution at the conference, he did say that policymakers need to be thinking outside the box when it comes to cannabis.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">Deputy Rabbitte will be pleased, no doubt, that I have brought forward this motion and perhaps he will participate in the debate on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_811"> If more proof were needed that it is not radical to suggest that cannabis be legalised, it can be found in the USA. The latter is a country the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny loves - he thinks it is wonderful and posteriors are regularly kissed when he visits the place - so obviously he would agree with some of its policies. In the past year, cannabis has been legalised in the states of Colorado and Washington. Imagine that, Washington in the US of A. We will be expecting the Taoiseach to follow suit any time, particularly as he always thinks the Americans are right. The amazing aspect of the legalisation of cannabis in Colorado and Washington relates to the fact that it was not followed up by any sanctions from the federal Government. I had expected such sanctions to be forthcoming, as had people in Colorado and Washington. However, they did not materialise. This is because the penny has also dropped with Barack Obama. I find it bizarre that it took so long for Mr. Obama to reach this realisation, particularly as he has been quite open about the fact that he regularly used cannabis when he was younger. Things have changed and several other states are set to follow the example of Colorado and Washington. In fact, a plebiscite is being held in Portland, Oregon, in respect of the legalisation of cannabis in that city. God forbid the Government here would have confidence in members of the general public to make decisions of that nature for themselves. It is a pity that is the case because I am of the view that they already have made the decision in respect of this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">Uruguay has legalised cannabis and many south and central American countries, including Mexico, are examining the possibility of doing likewise. Uruguay would not have taken this course of action were it not for the previous decision of the United States. We must remember that the US is the nation with the biggest guns, drones and whatever else one uses to hit others. When the United States of America, which wields the biggest stick, decided it was all right to decriminalise cannabis Uruguay believed it was okay to follow suit. Uruguay would have taken the decision sooner if the United States had gone down the road of decriminalisation earlier. </p>
          <p eId="para_813"> As regards Europe, Deputies will be aware that cannabis has been decriminalised in the Netherlands. In the past week, however, comments made by senior Dutch politicians point towards outright legalisation. The position that obtains in the Netherlands is not clear to many people in this country because the Irish media, which are made up of a wonderful group of people, reported about a year ago that the country was about to ban foreigners from its coffee shops and require people to join clubs if they wished to have access to cannabis. Despite widely reporting that proposal, the media did not report widely on the decision by the Dutch not to implement it. To this day, people ask me how we could legalise cannabis when the Dutch are backtracking on the issue. People should check the facts because the Netherlands is doing anything but backtracking. </p>
          <p eId="para_814"> Does Australia impose the same type of penal sanctions for cannabis use as we do? Cannabis in small amounts has been decriminalised for personal use in the Australian Capital Territory, South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. </p>
          <p eId="para_815"> In Belgium, the possession and cultivation of small quantities of cannabis, namely, 3g or one female plant, are tolerated, although they remain illegal. A similar position pertains in the Czech Republic, although the amounts involved are higher - possession of 15g of cannabis or the cultivation of up to five plants are now considered only misdemeanours.</p>
          <p eId="para_816"> The Germans are the most hard-working people in Europe, or so they keep telling us. The amount of cannabis one can possess for personal use varies in Germany, depending on the state, with Berlin being the most accommodating, at 15g. The German economy is doing well and the country's citizens have not become apathetic or demotivated - quite the opposite.</p>
          <p eId="para_817"> In Barcelona, one can join a cannabis social club whose members may legally purchase cannabis on a not-for-profit basis. </p>
          <p eId="para_818"> In light of these facts, it is not radical to suggest we should legalise cannabis. That 58% of people in the United States want to legalise the substance suggests legalisation is a slightly conservative proposal, one which would go down well with members of the Fine Gael Party.</p>
          <p eId="para_819"> What should we do? The Government needs to regulate and the purpose of the motion is to ask it to do so. If it refuses to regulate, I will introduce First Stage of the cannabis regulation Bill on Thursday and we will start all over again. The purpose of the Bill would be to provide for the regulation of cannabis for recreational and medicinal use and the establishment by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, of a cannabis regulation authority. Bad as the Minister is, it definitely would be better to have him administering the system than John Gilligan. The role of the authority would be to regulate the cultivation, sale, labelling, advertising and marketing of cannabis. It would also provide for a licensing system for commercial, home and cannabis social club cultivation under its control.</p>
          <p eId="para_820"> The Minister would establish a cannabis research institute to conduct or commission research in respect of cannabis and educate members of the public on the effects of cannabis. The Bill would allow for the provision of a licence for home cultivation, with the maximum allowable number of plants set at six female plants. Personal possession of up to one ounce or 28.35g would be allowed in the case of an individual who does not possess a grower's licence. Given the dominance of the European Union, the Government would probably shoot down that proposal on the basis that I have used imperial measurements. I would be happy, however, if it opted for the metric measurement. </p>
          <p eId="para_821"> The Bill would introduce the cannabis social club model under which clubs would supply their members with cannabis on a not-for-profit basis in a community setting. In other words, a grower would be able to produce cannabis for up to 50 people and grow up to 300 plants. Some people may ask why people would not grow their own cannabis plants. Alcohol is not difficult to brew but people still do not want to brew it because they like convenience. Under the Bill, licences granted for the sale of cannabis would include wholesale, retail store, medicinal retail, coffee shop and social club licences.</p>
          <p eId="para_822"> Children would not be allowed on premises associated with cannabis and it would remain an offence for children to possess the substance. This raises an important issue. I am no longer discussing whether cannabis should be legalised because this debate has moved on to how we would legalise it. In that context, many people have asked me whether it is a good idea to criminalise children. This question needs to be examined. </p>
          <p eId="para_823"> Under my Bill, advertising rules would be stricter than those which currently apply to alcohol advertising and would be strictly prohibited in the area of sport. This is consistent with my view on the advertising of any mind altering substances, including alcohol and caffeine, in the area of sport.</p>
          <p eId="para_824"> The legislation would require the Minister for Justice and Equality to assess the agricultural benefits of the use of hemp. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine could do likewise. The suit I am wearing is made from hemp, a substance we could grow and around which we could develop an industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_825"> Under the Bill, the cannabis regulation authority would be accountable to Dáil select committees. Let us compare that proposal with the current position. To whom are John Gilligan or the "Love/Hate" character, Nidge, responsible? They are certainly not accountable to select committees. </p>
          <p eId="para_826"> Over the next two days of debate, I look forward to hearing the views of other Deputies, especially those who have admitted to using cannabis. It will be interesting to learn if they believe they should have a criminal record given the dire consequences acquiring a criminal record has for individuals. More than 100,000 people convicted of possession of cannabis are denied the right to a decent job because their application will be rejected if they fill it out truthfully. This means they cannot become teachers, doctors or child care workers. </p>
          <p eId="para_827"> I have a warning for those who believe it is all right to impose a criminal record for using cannabis, while not having one imposed on themselves. After this debate, I will contact the Garda Síochána to inform it of the past actions of particular Deputies. I ask them to think carefully before criminalising others. </p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T19:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_828">I commend Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan on tabling the motion and the tremendous work he has done in drafting the Bill he is likely to present to the House in the coming days. The Deputy deserves the commendation of the House for having the political courage and determination to take up an issue that even those who privately and, in some cases, publicly agree with him would not choose to bring before the House or fight out publicly as he is doing. He is showing considerable political courage and principle.</p>
          <p eId="para_829"> I hope the Government will take the issue seriously and engage properly in the debate. The onus is on it to make a case for rejecting the proposals made by Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan and others who argue that we should either decriminalise or legalise cannabis. </p>
          <p eId="para_830">I do not see the argument for maintaining the criminalisation of cannabis use. I do not see what case can be put forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_831"> I will be interested to hear what the opponents of the motion say. I presume it has something to do with health. Let us put a simple fact on the record: there has never been a death in Ireland attributable to cannabis use, not one. "Drugs" is a broad, catch all and almost meaningless term. In what is put under the banner of the label "drugs", virtually every other item leads to deaths, many of which are attributable to the use of those things. We know about deaths due to the smoking of cigarettes, deaths due to the excessive use of alcohol, not to mention family violence, relationship break-up, violence in the community and deaths on the road. We know prescription drugs can potentially be very dangerous. There are serious question marks over the long-term use of antidepressants even though they are prescribed to thousands of people. Painkillers can be bought over the counter but can potentially have serious adverse effects on people's health. Cannabis, of all the substances under the general heading, has not been responsible for a single death. That is not to say cannabis is always good although it is clear there are medicinal uses. Of all the things loosely called drugs, the least harmful is cannabis. If the Government is going to be consistent in how it deals with the drugs issue, unless the Government bans alcohol, cigarettes and antidepressants, one cannot sustain the position of keeping cannabis use criminal.</p>
          <p eId="para_832"> The biggest adverse impact of cannabis use relates to the fact that it is criminalised. This pushes cannabis users and producers into the criminal world in which they would otherwise not be. In so far as there are damaging, worrying, social impacts of cannabis use, they are almost exclusively related to the fact it is illegal. We know how the prohibition of alcohol in the 1930s spawned the growth of the mafia, with damage to American society for decades afterwards. It seems obvious that the same applies here. I would like to hear what the Government has to say but it seems that, at the very least, it should accept the motion and allow the Bill to pass to the next stage to begin a serious, adult discussion about this important social issue.</p>

          <from>Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T19:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_833">Ceapaim go bhfuil sé riachtanach agus tábhachtach an díospóireacht a tosnú anois. I acknowledge the work and passion of Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan on this topic. I see it as part of a much wider debate and tonight should be the start of it. We should look at drugs, alcohol, addiction, treatment, prevention, education, health, crime, harm reduction and decriminalising. The legalising aspect is a more complex area. Starting the debate is vital. In 2009, the Latin American commission on drugs and democracy called for the international community to break the taboo. It was echoed in the 2011 global commission on drugs policy calling for an open debate. In 2016, a special session at the United Nations General Assembly will be held on drugs and drug policy. Ireland should be ready for that and part of it involves a systematic, independent objective evaluation of our drugs strategy and the views of people in the country on drugs. I hope tonight is the start of that debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_834"> The debate must be honest and based on evidence from quality research. When I looked at Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan's Bill, my reaction was that it was innocuous and mild, with a set of guidelines that are stricter than the guidelines for alcohol. It takes the control of the cannabis market out of the hands of criminals and is not leading to a free for all. E-mails tell us 150,000 people use cannabis and we seem to have received e-mails from practically all of them at this point.</p>
          <p eId="para_835"> The point borne out by research and the drug prevalence survey carried out by the national advisory committee on drugs in 2010 and 2011 is that these people are adult, educated and generally middle class. They are an informed group of people who can make choices and decisions rationally. I can see why there is support for it and, if it was followed in that way, I too could support it. However, I come from a constituency that has suffered from drugs more than any other in Ireland. I cannot divorce what is happening in this Bill from what I see in the constituency. The drug takers in my constituency are a particular cohort - young, male, and early school leavers with poor employment records. Many come from dysfunctional families and are not in a position to make rational and informed decisions about their drugs of choice. My views come from that background and from the fact that I chaired the north inner city drugs task force and the group for the young people's facilities and services fund, which looks at targeted responses to communities most at risk of drug addiction and misuse. My views also come from active involvement in projects working on the ground with those in addiction and their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_836"> In the inner city, we are seeing a different type of cannabis to the type described by Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan. It is cannabis used by a cohort of those under 18 years. It has a different strength and is being grown in skunk factories. The chemical make-up is completely different from what Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan describes. Projects in the inner-city are seeing the negative impacts of it on the mental health of young people and on their behaviour. I acknowledge that some is being taken in conjunction with alcohol and tablets but the pressure on some of these projects, particularly those working with people under 18 years of age, is to find cannabis detox due to the strength of this drug. Due to its strength, it is a gateway drug to other drugs, tablets and cocaine and heroin. The Bill applies to those over 18 and one of the unintended consequences is that those under 18 years become a further target and we will see increased targeting of them. The citywide drug campaign had a recent conference and posed the question of whether we can take anymore. The answer was "No". There is an active campaign to make the drugs crisis a political and public priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_837"> The community and voluntary sector are most active with people in addiction and it is seeing considerable costs. I would like to see us examine the decriminalising aspect and to stop using prison as a means to tackle the drug issue. Most drug users do not commit crimes except the crime of possession. That is not to deny the link between crime and cocaine, crystal meth and heroin. The decriminalising debate must follow this debate. In Portugal, it led to a reduction in drug-related deaths with no increase in drug prevalence. Portugal also put more resources into rehab and treatment. Alcohol has devastating effects and its misuse is far more costly than any other drug. The debate on drugs must take that into account. We also need safer injecting rooms and we must take into account the methadone protocol.</p>
          <p eId="para_838"> Drug abuse began in the inner city. Nobody acknowledged it, addressed it, or addressed the social conditions from which it came. I cannot look at this debate separate from the wider debate having followed in the footsteps of the late Tony Gregory and the work he did. It is the beginning of a debate and I hope it continues in an open way.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T19:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_839">I commend Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan on tabling a Private Members' motion. This is one of the many reasons he got involved in politics. He believes passionately in the need to legalise cannabis to improve the availability of choice for people who wish to use cannabis but also for safety reasons and to have a structured and targeted response to tackling and preventing the addiction problems associated with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">It is an important debate and one that we need to have. I welcome the fact that we are having it tonight and I hope it continues.</p>
          <p eId="para_841"> We should decriminalise cannabis as a minimum step and as a first step along the road in this debate. As has been mentioned already, according to the evidence on the decriminalisation of drugs for personal use in Portugal, it has had an impact in reducing addiction levels and the number of drug-related deaths. That is something we should debate, and we should move towards decriminalisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_842"> The debate on the regulation of cannabis is something for which the public is ready. It is something we should discuss. It would be worthwhile if what came out of this motion was that we could devise a system that would effectively control the strength and distribution of cannabis and provide for education on addiction and misuse, because that is something that we need to address. We need to ensure that if we regulate cannabis, it is regulated in a way that we can control.</p>
          <p eId="para_843"> If we were having this debate about alcohol and we were looking at regulating alcohol today, we certainly would not regulate it in the way in which its use has evolved in society over the past couple of thousand years. We would have a debate that was different and we would be looking at alcohol in a different way. When we look at the addiction that alcohol causes and the toll of alcohol addiction across society, we can see that we have to be very careful about unintended consequences and the possibility, if we regulate cannabis use, that of opening up a similar addiction problem. There is no doubt that alcohol addiction is causing significant problems across society. I and every family in Ireland have personal experience of alcohol addiction and alcohol abuse and know the havoc that it can wreak. I do not believe that cannabis addiction would be as severe if cannabis was regulated properly from the start, but it is interesting that the 2013 bulletin of the National Advisory Committee on Drugs and Alcohol stated that 9% of recent cannabis users were classified as being dependent on cannabis. That is based on 3% of the population who are regular users, which is quite a low figure, but that could be because of the difficulty in accessing cannabis for use. If we can devise a system that will allow cannabis to be controlled effectively and provide education on the use and misuse of cannabis, the legislation referred to in the motion could be worthwhile. This is something that we need to look at.</p>
          <p eId="para_844"> As has been outlined already, we also must consider the fact that prohibition has not worked. It never will work. While there is prohibition of cannabis, we have no control over the strength of cannabis that is available on the streets to young people, and that is a serious problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_845"> I note that recently in Holland there was talk of controlling the strength of cannabis available in the coffee shops so that it would not contain more than 15% tetrahydrocannabinol, THC. If we regulated it here in this country, we could definitely provide for lower concentrations. That is something that would be worth considering as well. We probably have to tackle this issue. We must at least decriminalise cannabis. We should be looking seriously at regulation and control, but in a way that ensures we can get it right.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T20:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_846">I too welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion calling for legislation. It is important that we debate such issues as legalising the use of currently banned substances such as cannabis. It is time that we had a mature debate. I compliment Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan on his introduction of the proposal at this time. In spite of the fact that I told him privately some weeks ago that I am opposed to it, I commend him on bringing it forward for debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_847"> The proportion of adults who reported using cannabis at some point in their lives increased from 17% in 2002-2003 to 22% in 2006-2007. The proportion of young adults who reported using cannabis in their lifetime also increased, from 24% in 2002-2003 to 29% in 2006-2007. That is a steady increase and we have to sit up and take note of those figures. There is nothing to suggest that the trend has decreased and it is important, as I stated at the outset, that we have a national conversation on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_848"> There is also an extensive international debate about the merits or otherwise of introducing legislation to decriminalise the use of cannabis and we must be mindful of what happens in the European Union and the wider world. With modern technology and modern methods of transportation, we are never too far away from issues. We cannot bury our heads in the sand and, like the ostrich, hope something will go away. It will not. It is a new world in which we live and it is ever more penetrating.</p>
          <p eId="para_849"> After reviewing some of the research in this area - not extensively, but as a parent - and having spoken to the medical profession, especially those involved in the mental health area, I am unconvinced that legislating for the use of cannabis is right at this point in time. There are significant problems in the mental health area as it is and the system cannot cope. It is a pity the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has just left, because she is responsible for that area. The other junior Minister who is here is not covering that area. None the less, there are gaping holes in the mental health services, especially for those in rural areas. I refer to my own area of south Tipperary and the closure of St. Michael's in Clonmel.</p>
          <p eId="para_850"> From the perspectives of both policing and mental health, on balance, the argument is against making cannabis more readily available at this point in time. Only a few weeks ago, in reference to what my colleague Deputy Boyd Barrett stated earlier, the Dublin Coroner's Court was told by a consultant stroke physician, Professor Joseph Harbison, that doctors at St. James's Hospital had seen five or six cases of young people having strokes following the use of herbal cannabis in the past three years. Professor Harbison stated that the heavy use of high-potency cannabis is putting young people at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_851"> The National Drug Advisory and Treatment Centre tells us that although many consider cannabis to be a relatively safe drug, new research shows that long-term users can find it hard to control their use of the drug and may become addicted. Indeed, we have seen that with alcohol.</p>
          <p eId="para_852"> Smoking cannabis increases the risk of heart disease and cancers such as lung cancer and may also affect fertility. Cannabis use may trigger schizophrenia in vulnerable persons. I referred to the lack of availability of mental health treatment. There is loneliness out there and issues associated with mental health. It is not the right time. There are too many pressures. In a time of already restricted spending on mental health services, I can find no way to justify the legalisation of a substance that already causes grave mental health issues. It is a pity the Government and its predecessor, which I supported, failed to tackle the supermarkets and off-licences for the way they are propagating the sale of alcohol. Obviously, the supermarket lobby has won out over the vintners' lobby. I salute the vast majority of publicans who run their businesses properly, pay their wages, rates and taxes and run good institutions. Recovering alcoholics and young people can go into any supermarket to buy a sliced pan and there is alcohol in front of them. It is not being regulated. The Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, agrees with me. I put forward proposals in five budgets that there should be a tax - capping is what it is called now - on cheaply available alcohol. It is everywhere in front of consumers. If something similar were to happen with cannabis, there would be no telling what might happen.</p>

          <p eId="para_853">At the outset, I thank Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan and the Technical Group for allowing me some of their speaking time. I compliment those such as Mr. Patrick Fitzpatrick, who works with Deputy Flanagan, on their excellent work in bringing this motion seeking legislation before the House. Whichever side of the argument one is on, I believe it is good that we are having the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_854"> If the Bill that is proposed only referred to the use of cannabis by persons who are ill and under doctors' advice, and it was to be strictly regulated, I would have no problem whatsoever with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">I would have a problem with and concerns about personal use and people growing it at home. However, I take grave exception to the fact that last week a Fine Gael Deputy accused the Technical Group of cynically facilitating Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan in bringing this motion before the House. That is a ridiculous statement for any person to make. I refer to the broad-minded attitude of Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan. Even though, like me, she may not support it, she agrees with and welcomes the holding of this debate. We will all be the better for the work Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan and his people have done in bringing the motion before the House. While it may not be accepted, I predict that good will come from having such a debate in the first instance. It is wrong for anyone to say it is wrong to facilitate debate. That is what democracy and politics are about. I welcome the debate. I know of the work and sincere effort and research which have been undertaken by Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan. People from abroad have come here to support him and they have given us the benefit of their expertise and life experiences. That is to be welcomed because we are all on a learning curve. It is very important that we be open-minded and broad-minded about all subjects like this.</p>

          <p eId="para_865">I propose to share time with Deputies Michael McNamara, Joe O'Reilly and Joe Carey.</p>
          <p eId="para_866"> Drug misuse continues to be one of the most significant challenges facing the country. It is highly destructive and has devastating effects on individuals, relationships, families, communities and society in general. Cannabis is the most widely consumed illicit drug in Europe and Ireland. There is a substantial body of clinical evidence documenting the health and social risks associated with its use. The Government is strongly of the view that we should maintain the current system of strict controls and regulation of cannabis in Ireland. For that reason, we will not support Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan's motion. I agree with Deputies opposite who spoke about the necessity and importance of debating these questions. I have no objection whatsoever to people in the media and, most of all, in the Oireachtas debating these issues, largely for the reasons outlined by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan.</p>
          <p eId="para_867"> The rationale for the Government's position is set out in the national drugs strategy which aims to tackle problem drug use across the five pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research. One of the principal objectives of the strategy is to reduce significantly access to all drugs, particularly those drugs that cause most harm to young people and especially in those areas where misuse is most prevalent. The drugs prevalence survey 2010-11 carried out by the national advisory committee on drugs found that cannabis was the most commonly used illicit drug in Ireland. The survey found that trends in recent and current use had remained stable in comparison to a similar survey carried out in 2006-07. However, it reported that lifetime prevalence of cannabis had risen to 25% by 2010-11, up 3.4% since 2006-07.</p>
          <p eId="para_868"> Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan's motion calls for legislation to regulate the cultivation, sale and possession of cannabis and cannabis products in Ireland. He has not tabled a Bill, at least not at this stage, but rather has asked the House to call on the Government to introduce legislation. It is not true for Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett to say the motion has any bearing on a Bill because there is no Bill before the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_870">As is well known, these issues are already covered under the Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977 and 1984. Under these Acts and the regulations made thereunder, the cultivation, production, preparation, sale, supply, distribution and possession of cannabis is prohibited, except for the purposes of research and the growing of hemp. The Government has no plans to alter or repeal the current strict legal controls on cannabis and cannabis products in Ireland. However, it recognises the claims made in respect of the potential health benefits of cannabis-based medicinal products such as Sativex for patients suffering from certain conditions such as multiple sclerosis. Accordingly, while it is not Government policy to legalise cannabis or its use, provision is being made for the availability of cannabis-based medicinal products by way of an amendment to the misuse of drugs regulations being finalised in my Department. This follows on from the receipt and assessment by the Irish Medicines Board of a request for authorisation for such a product to be available on the Irish market.</p>
          <p eId="para_871"> As Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, I maintain close contact with all of the statutory agencies, Departments and the community and voluntary organisations involved in addressing the problem of drug and alcohol misuse in Ireland. Our work spans across the five pillars. Each of these aspects is of critical importance. In this regard, while law enforcement through the criminal justice system is an essential element of our policy approach, as is the case internationally, we must also pay close attention to the health and education dimensions of addressing drug misuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_872"> I am well aware of the international debate on this question. Earlier this year in Ecuador, representing the Irish EU Presidency, I co-chaired a conference held with the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean on dealing with the global drugs problem. Differing perspectives were expressed on many aspects of this extremely challenging issue, including on the subjects of legalisation and decriminalisation, in particular of cannabis. It is important for any government to be aware of international debates and experiences and we are no different from any other country in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_873"> Cannabis, cannabis extracts and cannabinoid substances such as THC which are contained in cannabis are subject to international controls in the 1961 United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs and the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances. Ireland is a party to these international conventions and consequently has agreed to create and maintain offences for the supply and possession of controlled substances, including cannabis.</p>
          <p eId="para_874"> The case is sometimes made that criminalisation of drug use does not work, or even that it is counter-productive. As policy-makers, we should always be prepared to listen to reasoned argument. However, there is a significant body of clinical evidence which demonstrates that cannabis misuse is detrimental to health. Physical and mental health risks are particularly associated with long-term or heavy use of cannabis by young people. In 2004 the national advisory committee on drugs published a study entitled, Overview of Scientific and other Information on Cannabis, containing evidence that cannabis use was detrimental to health. This view has been supported in other international research. The risks include increased chances of developing lung and throat cancer, mental health illnesses such as schizophrenia, increased frequency of seizures in epilepsy, and depression. It can also lead to other health problems such as cardiovascular effects in susceptible individuals. The smoke from herbal cannabis preparations contains all the same constituents, apart from nicotine, as tobacco smoke, including carbon monoxide, bronchial irritants and cancer stimulating agents. There are strong indications that regular users of cannabis, but not tobacco, develop more symptoms of chronic bronchitis than do non-smokers.</p>
          <p eId="para_875"> Of particular concern to me and referred to by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan are the findings of a 2011 NACD study of the increased potency of THC in cannabis product in recent years. There is evidence that cannabis produced in Ireland which can be grown quickly has a higher potency than imported varieties. The question of higher potency is also an issue for our UK neighbours who saw it as a compelling factor leading to the reclassifying of cannabis in 2009, thereby increasing penalties associated with possession and supply.</p>
          <p eId="para_876"> A central aim of the national drugs strategy is to promote throughout society greater clarity, awareness and understanding of the dangers of drug misuse. The promotion of healthier lifestyle choices among young people is at the heart of substance misuse prevention. I cannot overstate the importance of the work we do to try to prevent young people from becoming involved in drug use in the first place before it becomes an entrenched habit and a dysfunctional way of life. Making this drug available, even where subject to severe restrictions, could potentially lead to increased levels of experimentation with drugs by young people. This, in turn, could lead to increased long-term and sustained use, with the real risk of significant and adverse effect to the health of users.</p>
          <p eId="para_877"> We need to learn from our experience of new psychoactive substances. We are all aware of the proliferation of head shops in Ireland in the late 2000s. The increase in recreational use of new psychoactive substances posed significant potential risks to users. The fact that these substances were legal, hence the name "legal high", gave comfort to thos using them that they were not in breach of the law. The Government acted swiftly and decisively through controlling approximately 260 substances, as well as through the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Act 2010 which made it an offence to sell, import, export or advertise psychoactive substances. These measures led to a sharp decrease in the number of head shops. Law enforcement work continues in order to control the availability of these substances through the Internet and other means, but there is no doubt that reducing access plays a vital role in reducing usage.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">The NACD overview of new psychoactive substances refers to survey findings indicating a pattern of reduced use of new psychoactive substances among a subgroup who may be described as "recreational" users. It is likely that this pattern of usage reflects the impact of the May 2010 Government ban on a range of substances. Accordingly, if we were to legislate to allow for the cultivation, sale and possession of cannabis, we would be acting contrary to our core policy objective of reducing availability and access to harmful drugs. It does not follow that legalisation of the kind being advocated would reduce the level of criminality associated with the illicit drugs market. Were cannabis to be legalised, it presumably would be very strongly regulated, possibly heavily priced, and with a much lower potency level. The illicit market would, no doubt, continue, and provide a cheaper and stronger product. Consequently, any benefits such as those suggested by Deputy Flanagan must be set against the likely continued existence of an illicit and indeed criminal market.</p>
          <p eId="para_879"> As I have already stated, Ireland is a party to International conventions on the control of illicit drugs. In this respect, the EU Justice and Home Affairs Council of Ministers adopted a resolution in 2004 requesting member states to take measures to discourage personal use of cannabis, so Ireland's position cannot be considered purely in our own national context. We cannot act in isolation and we must be conscious of the position of other EU states.</p>
          <p eId="para_880"> It is worth noting that we now have a comprehensive Government framework setting out a vision for a healthy Ireland, and the actions we need to take in order to attain this vision. Our objective is to improve the health and well-being of the whole population, increasing the proportion of people who are healthy at all stages of life and protecting them from threats to health and well-being. We need to minimise all risk factors if individuals are to be supported and motivated to make healthier choices.</p>
          <p eId="para_881"> To briefly respond to the contributions of colleagues opposite, I repeat what I have already said about the absolute propriety of our having a debate in this House on these issues. I would like for us in the Oireachtas to be able to engage in debate across all the various threats, issues and challenges that we face in the drugs and alcohol area. I was delighted recently to see the Government approving a set of proposals brought forward by me in the alcohol area, and for the first time we will have a public health (alcohol) Bill. It will be the first time in this country that we will address the alcohol issue in public health legislation, including some of the matters raised by Deputy Mattie McGrath some moments ago in respect of access in supermarkets and so on. There is absolutely no objection to debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_882"> With respect to Deputy Flanagan, there is no reality in suggesting that legalisation of cannabis is not a radical proposal. Whether one agrees or disagrees with his proposal, it is nonetheless radical, and it is not credible to ignore completely the health evidence, as Deputy Flanagan has done. He made no reference to it in the course of his speech.</p>

          <p eId="para_886">I have listened very carefully to Deputies Flanagan, Maureen O'Sullivan and others and we must listen to one another. We must have regard to what is happening internationally but we cannot exclude from the debate completely the very genuine and serious risks that exist to health, as set out in recent days, for example, by a number of psychiatrists and other professionals working in the field in the context of this debate. We should not exclude any party from the discussion or any reasoned argument. If we are to respect one another's perspective, we must listen to all arguments made on every side.</p>
          <p eId="para_887"> There is no reality in the suggestion that there is no down side or potential negative consequences arising from legalisation of cannabis, and it is not credible for Deputy Flanagan or anybody else to suggest it. I know he must put forward his argument with all the force he can muster but he must have regard to the case against him and the legalisation of cannabis. We should have the debate by all means, having regard to all the evidence and arguments. We should not imagine that taking the step Deputy Flanagan is advocating in his motion - I repeat there is no Bill - would not have a negative consequence, as it would do so.</p>

          <p eId="para_888">I commend Deputy Flanagan and the Technical Group on raising the issue and giving the House the opportunity to debate what I believe is an increasingly important issue. I also thank the Technical Group for offering me speaking time this evening as opposed to tomorrow evening, when I am due to travel to a meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_889"> In 1996 a book called <i>Rethinking the War on Drugs in Ireland</i> was published by Cork University Press, which is hardly a revolutionary outfit. It was written by a former law lecturer of mine so perhaps I am slightly biased. I found it a rather convincing read and a serious argument was raised by it. In the years since 1996, what serious rethinking of the war on drugs in Ireland has taken place? With the greatest respect to the Government counter-motion tonight, it would appear there has been none.</p>
          <p eId="para_890"> The war on drugs was declared by none other than Richard Nixon in 1971, when he stated the war would result in a drugs-free world. Now, more than 40 years on, there is a growing movement to declare that war unwinnable, not least because there are now more drug users in every country in the world, and I dare say in every constituency in Ireland. There are 250 million drug users worldwide, according to a UN estimate. Illicit drugs are now the third most valuable industry in the world, behind food and oil, and that industry is estimated to be worth $450 billion dollars per year. All of it is controlled by criminals, whether the activity is in this city, this country, Colombia, the United States, Scariff, Ennistymon, Clarecastle or even Cootehill.</p>
          <p eId="para_891"> We know drugs are dangerous and the argument must be taken seriously, just as we know alcohol is very dangerous and nicotine is a serious matter. I commend the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Reilly, on the initiatives proposed and, importantly, which are being put into action to combat the misuse of alcohol and nicotine in Ireland. Some 7,000 people in Ireland die from smoking-related diseases every year, and these deaths occur despite the fact they are preventable.</p>
          <p eId="para_892"> The Minister of State has argued that even if drugs are legalised, criminality will not be eradicated. That is true. Even tonight a poitín still was broken up in Deputy Joe O'Reilly's constituency and I have no doubt people are selling illegal cigarettes across the city as we speak. Nevertheless, we are able to control nicotine, including the amount sold and to whom it is sold, by and large. We can get a clear picture of the problem and there is no such clear picture of drug use. We know drug use is increasing, and the chief executive of Merchants Quay Ireland has revealed that the scale of the country's drug problem is increasing. He has stated that the spread of drug use outside Dublin is an ongoing trend, with continued demand for services at regional level.</p>
          <p eId="para_893"> Some 17 years after the publication of <i>Rethinking the War on Drugs in Ireland</i>, drug use continues to increase in the country. In 2006, the adult caution scheme was introduced, whereby gardaí could grant an adult caution for a list of offences if they believed it to be beneficial. It was proposed that the possession of cannabis - not possession with intent to supply - would be included on the list but it fell off the bottom. Additional offences have been added since in which an adult caution can be issued but possession of cannabis remains excluded. I asked the Minister for Justice and Equality in how many cases the Probation Act was applied to cases of cannabis possession in Ireland, and there appears to be approximately 1,500 cases on average every year. With these people, a file is prepared and a garda shows up in court before the Probation Act is applied. Is that useful for Garda resources in the constituencies around the country? It is not, and I urge the Minister to seriously consider adding possession of cannabis to the adult caution scheme. That should not mean a caution would be always applied but if a Garda believes it to be the best course of action, there should be an option to do so. That was what was originally proposed by the Minister responsible for justice matters as far back as 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_894"> A serious body of work has been done by the Government with regard to alcohol abuse and smoking but, regrettably, the counter-motion does not reflect a serious consideration of the drug problem in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">A commission should be established of senior policing experts, Revenue officials, doctors and people from the medical world to examine the situation. I agree with the Minister of State, Deputy White, that it is a radical proposal to legalise drugs, especially as we have built ourselves in a "war on drugs" mentality. I urge the Minister to set up a commission of senior gardaí, Revenue officials and senior policing experts worldwide, including the UN ODC and other organisations that work on the issue to examine the effect of such a change. We are now out of kilter with the majority of states in western Europe in terms of how we treat possession of cannabis. It is the case that cannabis is becoming more dangerous because as the Minister of State indicated, the variants which can be profitably grown by criminals in this country are more dangerous than those which used to be imported by other criminals. Criminals do what is most profitable without any concern for what is beneficial. I urge the Minister of State to move beyond the "war" mentality because I fear it is a war which cannot be won towards devising a workable solution to the drugs problem across the State.</p>

          <p eId="para_898">I join in commending and applauding Deputy Flanagan on bringing about this worthwhile debate. It is critical that we would have such a debate in the House of Parliament. I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan that the debate should be broadened and that on this and future occasions we must examine the issues around the use of drugs and giving young people the necessary self esteem to deal with the problem. A broader debate is required on all of the safeguards.</p>
          <p eId="para_899"> Before we legalise a narcotic, we would have to examine the health and other implications. With respect to the proposer of the motion - it is a worthy debate - the balance of the greater good for society lies in the <i>status quo</i>. Careful consideration is required but the evidence tends to support that view. I will cite studies in due course but cannabis use can contribute to cognitive deficiencies, dependency and, if smoked, to smoking-related health problems such as throat and lung cancer and respiratory problems. The evidence supports the view that an array of health issues is unavoidable. Cannabis use is believed to contribute to mental health problems such as depression, anxiety and in some cases, psychosis. The effect of cannabis on the mind of the user, especially if the user is an adolescent, is most disconcerting. Studies from Bristol University have shown that there are high levels of cannabis use among adolescents who show signs of schizophrenia. The primary psychoactive ingredient of cannabis, is known as THC. THC is known to have a significantly disruptive impact on the areas of the brain vital for memory and decision-making. It has been empirically established that people who smoke the drug between five and 20 times a month have a 10% greater incidence of such memory problems than non-users. Those who smoke cannabis more than 20 times a month have been found to be 20% more deficient. Cannabis use also heightens anxiety. Adolescents who use the drug are at a highly vulnerable age. The point was made that perhaps the THC levels are greater because the drug is illegal and cultivated underground. With respect to the proposer and his supporters I submit that it would not be possible to police the situation adequately and that even if cannabis were legalised one could not monitor THC levels and the problem would remain. For young people, their brains are still very much at the developmental stage, particularly from a cognitive and social behaviour point of view. The<i> British Medical Journal</i> found that the use of cannabis in adolescence increases the likelihood of experiencing symptoms of schizophrenia in adulthood and early cannabis use by age 15 confers greater risk for schizophrenia outcomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_900"> I am aware of the argument about pain relief. I am happy the Department has conducted a study on the use of cannabis for those suffering from multiple sclerosis. Dr. Henry McQuay, from Oxford University has sounded a note of caution in terms of the side effects on the nervous system. The jury is out to some extent on the issue but in so far as it is beneficial from a health point of view any civilised person would want the use of cannabis to be considered in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_901"> With your indulgence, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle I wish to briefly mention a couple of issues. Reference has been made to the benefits of cannabis versus nicotine and alcohol. Were nicotine to be introduced now with the knowledge we have today it would not be made legal. Our attitude to alcohol has changed and is radically different. I commend the fact that the Minister will deal with the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_902"> I am concerned about the potential of cannabis as a gateway drug. While it might sound a little old-fashioned and traditional I am genuinely concerned about the gateway factor. I say that as a teacher and the parent of three young boys. I point to the way head shops were used until the matter was addressed. A degree of experimentation was involved. A plethora of head shops quickly developed which was an indication of use, experimentation and the fact that they offered excitement. I fear that the legalisation of cannabis would lead to a gateway culture and a progression to more serious drugs. Support from a Yale University study in the <i>Journal of Adolescent Health </i>suggests the use of prescription drugs by people who initially use cannabis.</p>
          <p eId="para_903"> The Netherlands is cited as nirvana by proponents of the legislation but there are compelling and difficult statistics from that country which we cannot avoid. A total of 13,109 clients entered treatment for cannabis use in the Netherlands in 2011. A total of 48.3% of all those treated reported cannabis as their primary drug. The Netherlands National Drug Monitor annual report for 2011 stated that in the period between 2007 and 2009 nearly 30,000 adults aged between 18 and 64 were diagnosed with cannabis dependence.</p>

          <p eId="para_908">In recent days, I asked for contributions from constituents on the issue of legalising cannabis. It is an issue that attracts a strong reaction with those in favour of legalisation tending to shout louder than those who are against it. As drugs go, both legal or otherwise, it is fair to say that cannabis is not of the more serious variety. There does not tend to be the same widespread social disruption as a result of persons regularly using cannabis, as opposed to persons who may be alcoholic, for example, or are intravenous drug users. That, in itself, though, is not a strong enough argument for legalisation. The link between prolonged cannabis use and mental health-related illnesses, has been proven in some instances and should not be dismissed lightly. We must listen to those working at the front line in our addiction services, who have seen persons present who find it very difficult to end cannabis use.</p>
          <p eId="para_909"> In the UK, we know that from January 2004 to January 2009, the law relating to cannabis was relaxed. In effect, cannabis went from being a class B drug to a class C drug. A Newcastle University study showed that during the same period, smoking of the drug increased in the UK by 25% and smoking in general increased by 8%. Despite the smoking ban in Ireland, our <i>per capita</i> smoking levels are quite high in comparison to the UK or the US. That is something we would need to think very carefully about if we were to legalise any new product such as cannabis, that can be smoked with or without tobacco. The last thing Ireland needs is more smokers with society as a whole paying for the added burden on our health system.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">Notwithstanding my reluctance to embrace legalising cannabis, I acknowledge that there may be ways we can examine changing the current system to better effect. In the past week, many young people have contacted me about how their experimentation with cannabis when younger has caused them problems, specifically in regard to work and visa applications. Some of them were caught in possession of relatively small amounts of the drug.</p>
          <p eId="para_911"> Perhaps we need to examine the model adopted in Portugal and elsewhere where decriminalisation has been introduced. I have listened to people like Tony Geoghegan from the Merchant's Quay project, who referenced this model in recent days, and I believe we should examine it. In Portugal, the authorities have decriminalised possession of specified amounts for personal use. If one is caught in possession, one must face a panel, which could comprise a doctor, social worker or a judge who would decide on the best course of action, be it a fine, penalty or, as is often the case, a course of drug treatment and counselling. If one is caught in possession of amounts larger than amounts associated with personal use, one must face the judicial system. Since the introduction of decriminalisation in Portugal, drug use has declined significantly, and the way the citizens view addiction has also changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_912"> With regard to the issue of cannabis for medicinal use, many of those who contacted me in recent days outlined in great detail how using cannabis helps them with illnesses such as motor neurone disease and MS. I note that the Irish Medicines Board has recently approved the cannaboid spray Sativex, which is also available under strict conditions in the United Kingdom. The medical aspect needs to be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_913"> This is a debate well worth having, and I congratulate Deputy Flanagan on tabling the motion. We do need to consider every possible way of tackling imaginatively and progressively societal problems arsing from illegal drug use. From a medical point of view, I believe the use of cannabis by persons suffering from MS and motor neurone disease should be permitted. I am not convinced that legalisation is the answer but believe we should begin to consider decriminalisation as a way of prioritising drug rehabilitation over jail so society as a whole will benefit.</p>

          <from>Deputy Niall Collins<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T20:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_914">Fianna Fáil is opposed to this motion. The legalisation of cannabis in Ireland will do little to curb criminality while simultaneously jeopardising the health of generations of Irish people. The appeal of taking a libertarian approach to this problem is a failure of our responsibility to protect society from the harmful effects of drug abuse and the inevitable violent criminality it brings with it. Deputy Flanagan's misguided enthusiasm - I say that respectfully - for this project down through the years belies the all-too-real dangers of cannabis. I acknowledge, however, that Deputy Flanagan is a lifelong, consistent campaigner on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_915"> As legislators, we have a duty to pursue the common good. The damage that legislating cannabis would inflict upon innumerable people across the county is a breach of that duty. This attempt to liberalise drug use demonstrates a deeply flawed view of the common good.</p>
          <p eId="para_916"> It is particularly ironic that, in a time when we are ramping up efforts to cut down on smoking, we are now discussing the addition of a further dangerous substance to people's lives. Efforts to introduce plain packaging and copperfasten the smoking ban introduced by Deputy Martin are the new front line in snuffing out tobacco use in Ireland. The work and progress made in tackling tobacco usage and its detrimental impact on health will pale in comparison to the challenges presented by widescale cannabis use. It begs the question as to why we would escalate a public health crisis by adding a new toxic substance into the mixture, which question underpins the whole debate on this subject. Why would we risk undoing the good work achieved to date? Proponents of legalisation have not put forward a reasonable answer to that question.</p>
          <p eId="para_917"> I would like to confront a number of other claims made by advocates in favour of legalisation. Many of the arguments put forward by advocates of the Bill point out the grave problems that alcohol abuse has inflicted upon Irish life. Undoubtedly, our collective national drink problem costs the Irish taxpayer hundreds of millions of euro per annum in health and security costs. By contrast, proponents of legalisation claim that cannabis has no such drawbacks. However, this is ultimately an argument in favour of prohibiting alcohol and not legalising cannabis. Unconsciously advocating for the Volstead Act does not mean endorsing the legalisation of cannabis. This is not a prohibition-era discussion. Our efforts to tackle the ongoing problems of endemic alcohol abuse in Ireland should not be diverted with a tangential attempt to legalise cannabis.</p>
          <p eId="para_918"> It is extremely difficult to remove organised criminal groups from a business if they are already involved. Any move to regulate the cannabis trade or licence it would inevitably result in the creation of a shadow economy to undercut the legitimate trade. Evidence of this can be seen all too clearly in the case of other substances, such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol. The €300 million industry estimate ignores the continual criminal role in the area. These products are sold and licensed in Ireland but there is an equally vibrant black market trade in the substances. Evidence has shown that consumers are not concerned with quality so much as price.</p>
          <p eId="para_919"> The legitimate trade in cigarettes and tobacco in parts of Dublin has virtually collapsed because of the black market trade. Regulating the trade and use of cannabis would likely cause the illegal trade to flourish as it would create a benign environment for drug use to take place and would probably strengthen the hand of organised crime gangs that would benefit from it.</p>
          <p eId="para_920"> It is worth noting the problems the Dutch are facing with regard to the position they adopted in 1976 when they decriminalised possession of less than 5g in 1976. Amsterdam is now a centre of operations for most major organised crime outfits and a hub of hard drug distribution. The areas where coffee shops sell cannabis all suffer from late-night disturbances, traffic jams and hard drug-dealing because of cross-border visits from Belgium and Germany, where cannabis cannot be bought openly. The Dutch have attempted to repeal the laws but have backed down because they are too afraid that the country's drug-using population will cause further problems if they cannot source drugs from existing coffee shops.</p>
          <p eId="para_921"> It is worth noting that people licensed to produce cannabis for their own use would inevitably sell to friends and associates. Rather than prevent people from getting a criminal record, allowing people to produce a drug would inevitably encourage them to engage in petty dealing, therefore causing more problems for the justice system. The motion, as proposed, is effectively unenforceable and would be impossible to police.</p>
          <p eId="para_922"> Much of the discussion on the health impact of cannabis strikes me as dangerously naive. It ignores the variety of cannabis available and the dangerous impact it has on users. The cannabis on sale in Ireland at the moment is primarily skunk grass, which is grown in secret grow-houses under lights. By contrast, during the 1980s about 70% of cannabis consumed in Ireland and Britain was cannabis resin, or hashish, imported from north Africa. It was produced from the wild-growing cannabis sativa in Morocco. This skunk is usually twice as potent as cannabis resin although both are synonymous with triggering schizophrenia and mental health issues in certain types of people. Skunk is produced by crossing cannabis sativa and indica to produce a hardy plant that can be cultivated indoors. Skunk is genetically modified to such an extent that it bears no resemblance to the cannabis that would have been smoked in the 1960s.</p>
          <p eId="para_923"> The motion makes no reference to what sort of cannabis plant would be permitted in Ireland. If it were to become legal, criminals would simply undercut any legitimate trade to control the market by producing more potent plants. Criminals who grow the drug in Ireland are already focused on increasing the strength of the high from the crop they produce. One way they do this is by selecting plants that are naturally more potent; another is to use lights to mimic the effect of autumn on the female plant. This causes it to produce more resin in a last-ditch attempt to pollinate itself before winter, and the resin is what makes it stronger. The varying potency of the drug would inevitably create different markets, with criminal enterprises moving into one area over another.</p>
          <p eId="para_924"> In short, cannabis is harmful. Ireland's psychiatric hospitals are literally overwhelmed with young men who have developed psychiatric problems by using cannabis or newer varieties of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">If one considers that all pharmaceutical drugs and foods undergo rigorous testing to see if they cause side effects, one can see the difficulties with permitting cannabis to be sold.</p>
          <p eId="para_926"> In straitened economic times the idea of a viable commercial industry providing employment and making a contribution to the Exchequer might seem appealing. However, the reality of attempting to commercialise cannabis production and sales throws up insurmountable problems. Any legitimate business which would enter into cannabis manufacture would, of course, have to secure insurance to operate. Given that tobacco and cigarette companies are being sued for selling products which cause cancer, it is hard to imagine how any limited company could comply with any human resources, employment and health legislation, given the activities in which it would be involved. In terms of regulation, would persons with criminal convictions be permitted to produce cannabis? The reality is that established dealers with expertise in the area are involved in overtly criminal enterprises. The vista of a cannabis regulation authority would do nothing to curb criminal engagement.</p>
          <p eId="para_927"> In 2010 the then Fianna Fáil Government took a strong stance in addressing the problem of psychoactive substances being sold in so-called head shops. Criticism of the measure focused on the claims that banning head shops would do nothing to actually reduce the use of these dangerous substances, that it would, in effect, drive them underground. In fact, the end result of the decisive measures taken against these substances was to significantly curb their usage, in particular among vulnerable adolescents. There is a lesson to be drawn from that experience in this debate. Eliminating head shops and banning dangerous substances that treaded the boundary of legality was a positive measure to protect young people. Legalising cannabis would be a perverse application of the lessons learned in that experience. If the sale of cannabis was to be permitted, it would create a benign environment for illicit drug use to flourish.</p>
          <p eId="para_928"> This debate provides an opportunity to reappraise how we resource the Garda in tackling drug fuelled criminality and whether resources would be better directed towards high-level suppliers rather than low-end users. Garda discretion is key in empowering the force to realistically tackle drug abuse. There must be a debate on the use of adult caution and the impact the current system has on the administration of justice. It also behoves us to ask why drug abuse flourishes in our society and what we can do to address it. This is an immense task of dealing with both supply and demand and any drugs strategy must address both aspects. However, the principle that cannabis should be legalised is simply indefensible because the health and social risks are far too great for us to countenance. This is a deeply flawed measure reflecting faulty assumptions. We need to stand up to the allure of populist measures and do what is right for the greater good of the country.</p>

          <from>Deputy Sandra McLellan<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T20:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_929">Sinn Féin welcomes this debate on the question of cannabis legalisation on the basis that such a debate is needed and should prove informative. We commend Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan for bringing forward this motion. While we will not be voting in favour of it, we believe there is merit in a thorough and critical examination of all aspects of how problem drug use is addressed in our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_930"> The question of cannabis legalisation is one which divides opinion sharply but one which definitely needs to be teased out and debated in a calm, considered fashion. We must move beyond a facile, adversarial approach. Hysteria is not what we need. We must approach the issue in an evidence-based way and draw our conclusions from the evidence. We must look at problem drug use, including cannabis and alcohol, in a holistic manner, taking into account the implications for individual health, the effects on wider society and the role of the justice system. </p>
          <p eId="para_931"> One of two main arguments made in favour of cannabis legalisation is that the drug is less harmful than others. That may be so, but that is only in relative terms and we do not believe this is a valid argument for legalisation. The drug can have serious detrimental effects on people's health. There is considerable concern in the medical community about the effect of cannabis on the levels of schizophrenia and psychosis. It is widely believed cannabis use can increase the likelihood of the onset of psychosis. From a health point of view, there is a legitimate concern that legalisation would lead to even wider problem use of the drug. There is surely validity in the argument that legalisation would run contrary to the efforts we are making to combat tobacco smoking and the problem use of other drugs, including alcohol. It is important that we note the enormous damage alcohol abuse causes in Ireland in terms of health and public safety, as well as its implications for the health care system. We must work very hard to ensure we tackle the misuse of alcohol, as well as illegal substances. </p>
          <p eId="para_932"> The second main argument used in favour of cannabis legalisation is that it would take what is admittedly a very widely used drug out of the hands of organised criminals and free up resources for combating the trade in more damaging drugs. In 2009 Sinn Féin published its proposed priorities for a national drugs strategy for the period 2009 to 2016. In that document we state the spectrum of drug-related crime must be understood if justice and public policy is to be effective in reducing such crime. The drug policy action group categorised drug crime as systemic, economic-compulsive and psycho-pharmacological. System crimes include drug trafficking, dealing, possession and associated gangland crime, including murder, intimidation and money laundering. Economic-compulsive crime describes robbery to feed a drug habit, while psycho-pharmacological crime includes violence against people or property caused by the mental or behavioural effects of drug taking. We argue in our submission that law enforcement efforts and resources must be matched with the priorities arising from an objective understanding of the three main types of drug-related crime. The rates of prosecution relating to heroin and cocaine compared to those for cannabis do not match the far greater relative harm caused by the former drugs. The focus of policing efforts should be systematically matched with the relative harm caused by the various drugs, with the understanding of harm to include that done to individuals, communities and wider society. This requires a critical examination of how the policing and justice system addresses problem drug use and we should not shy away from that examination. </p>
          <p eId="para_933"> Sinn Féin has never supported the legalisation of cannabis, though strong arguments have been made on both sides. This position has been reaffirmed at successive party ard fheiseanna. The health implications associated with cannabis, like tobacco, are very serious and have the potential to have a significant negative effect on public health. On the separate but related issue of the medicinal benefits of cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds, there is significant scientific evidence to support the case for the introduction of such products here. We would, of course, await the expert advice of the relevant Irish regulatory authorities, including the National Immunisation Advisory Committee, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics and the Irish Medicines Board. Again, we must allow expertise to be the basis for our decisions, but if there is evidence to support the introduction of such products, we should consider it.</p>
