I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors' Gallery that all mobile phones should be switched off.  This meeting is being broadcast by UPC on Channel 207 and mobile telephones that are switched on will interfere with the broadcast and seriously disrupt it so that those watching cannot follow or hear questions and responses.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">  I advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Mr. Dukes to make his opening statement.</p>

          <p eId="para_23">In addition to our CEO, Mr. Aynsley, I am accompanied by Mr. Jim Bradley, our chief financial officer, and Mr. Richard Woodhouse, who is in charge of special projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">  We are very grateful to the committee for its invitation to come and discuss a series of issues with it.  The last time we were before the committee was on 15 September last year and at that stage we went through in some depth what the bank had been doing since nationalisation.  Today, I would like to update the committee further on the progress the bank has made since September 2011 and on some of the challenges we face.  Following my presentation, my colleagues and I will be happy to deal with any issues members of the committee want to raise.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">  As committee members know, the bank's mission is to deal with the assets of the former Anglo Irish Bank and those of Irish Nationwide Building Society since the merger of these two entities in July 2011.  We now do this under the name, the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, and have been doing so for just over a year in a concerted and directed effort to minimise the overall cost and maximise the returns in the interest of the taxpayer.  We operate on the basis of an approved restructuring plan which was submitted to the European Commission in January 2011 and which it is intended will bring about an orderly wind-down of the entity over a period of ten years up to approximately 2020.  An additional objective since the merger of the two entities is to prepare the former INBS mortgage book for sale within a period of five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">  The IBRC is a regulated entity that is closely supervised by the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank of Ireland.  In addition, it is supervised by a monitoring trustee which has been put in place to report to the European Commission on the bank's adherence to the terms of the commitment letter which accompanied the Commission's approval of the restructuring plan.  The bank is subject to all of the relevant provisions of company law and also to a series of codes of practice relevant to State-owned entities and companies as well as to the provisions under which the original new entity was set up by an Act of the Oireachtas post-nationalisation.  It operates in the context of overall banking policy as laid down by the Minister for Finance on behalf of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">  I reported last year that the board and management of the bank had effected considerable and dramatic change in creating a fit for purpose wind-down vehicle to deliver on its mandate and resolution objectives.  The most significant of these since then has been the sale of the bank's US loan book, which was effected in October 2011 and saw a once-off balance sheet reduction of close to $10 billion in one of the largest ever single sale transactions seen in the US real estate market.  This operation was successfully carried out without any negative effect on the bank's regulatory capital base.  Following the completion of the operation, there remained a balance of approximately $1 billion of unsold assets, which fell out of the sale for a number of technical reasons.  We have made substantial progress on the disposal of these assets since completion of the original sale, and all offices of the bank in the United States have been closed.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">  Further progress in planned and controlled downsizing of the bank has been made since.  We have prepared a series of notes for the committee which show there has been a further reduction in our balance sheet, bringing the total reduction, excluding the promissory notes and bonds, to 78% since nationalisation.  Deleveraging will continue, principally on a loan-by-loan basis, but with consideration being given, based on informed analysis, to portfolio or book sales in both of the banks' remaining jurisdictions, the UK and Ireland, where it makes economic sense.  Deleveraging to date has been substantially ahead of the targets set in the restructuring plan and we hope to maintain that accelerated performance.  I should add that our success in this endeavour will depend crucially on developments in property markets and the condition and liquidity of markets in both Ireland and the UK.  Dealing with the most distressed parts of the bank's loan portfolio will be especially challenging.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">  We place a close focus on cost containment and reduction within the merged entity.  Staffing is one of the main cost components.  We have now reduced the number of employees in the bank by over 50%, from the peak staffing levels of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society combined in 2008, which was approximately 2,250.  By the end of this year, core staffing levels in IBRC, excluding the NAMA unit, will be below 800.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">I take this opportunity to express, once again, my appreciation of the way in which bank staff have responded to the demands inherent in the restructuring process since nationalisation. It has been a very demanding process of constant change accompanied by a great deal of negative comment about their workplace. Staff have participated in a radical process of change and retraining. Without their active participation, the progress we have made in the face of considerable difficulties simply would not have been possible. While we are obliged to review staff numbers, we must also ensure the quality and skill levels of our staff match up to the extremely exacting demands of the market situation and the wind-down role of the bank. As I said, the staff response to those demands has been exemplary.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> We have streamlined the operation of the merged entity with office closures and sales of premises. A process to evaluate the outsourcing of some support functions was initiated, and several functions have been outsourced. We have, <i>inter alia,</i> completed a significant exercise in the area of legal expenses attributable to ongoing litigation matters and in the area of the appointment of receivers. These are two necessary ongoing expenditures and we have taken steps to ensure, to the maximum extent possible, that we obtain value for money out of that expenditure. These and other measures reflect the bank's continuing commitment to ensuring its infrastructure and business processes are efficient and appropriate for the changing size of the organisation as we progress through the phases of the wind-down.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> We have continued to strengthen the board of the bank. It consists of ten members, including the chief executive officer. One member was appointed in November 2008, one in February 2009, the CEO in September 2009, three directors in May 2010, two in 2011 and two this year. Fees for non-executive directors were initially reduced by 20% at the end of 2008 and by a further 15% with effect from 1 July this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> The total balance sheet of IBRC has reduced from €101 billion at the time of nationalisation to approximately €53 billion today. This includes the €29.3 billion in support from the Government to the former Anglo Irish Bank and the €5.4 billion put into the former Irish Nationwide Building Society. IBRC is totally reliant on funding from the Central Bank and monetary authorities and from the Government. Funding from the Central Bank and monetary authorities stands at approximately €42 billion. If we exclude the Government's promissory notes, total assets are approximately €25 billion. Impaired loans on our books amount to almost €18 billion, with cumulative impairment provisions of almost €11 billion. Impaired loans now account for approximately 66% of our total loan balances.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">We remain reasonably hopeful that the final cost of the operation will be closer to €25 billion rather than the €29 million to €34 billion estimated in September 2010. This is, of course, highly contingent on what happens to property markets here and in the United Kingdom. The outcome will depend on what happens in the general economy and may also be impacted by any restructuring of the promissory note. In addition, the banking situation is very vulnerable to what happens in the eurozone in general. Notwithstanding these qualifications, which are substantial, we are confident that we have reduced the expected final cost of the operation to the taxpayer by an appreciable amount.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> The bank has made significant progress since nationalisation in spite of considerable and complex challenges. The task ahead is possibly equally challenging and the problems are different in many respects. Following the merger with the Irish Nationwide Building Society, we are managing a relatively small portfolio of residential and investment mortgages. We recognise that the situation for mortgage holders is very difficult in the current economic environment and that this is unlikely to change for the better in the short term. We noted with interest the recent comments on this matter by Ms Fiona Muldoon of the Central Bank. We agree that banks must be decisive and creative in dealing with the system-wide issue and with the stress being experienced by many ordinary borrowers. We acquired what I can only describe as a very challenging mortgage book in July 2011, as can be seen in the notes we have prepared for the committee. A significant amount of work has been undertaken in regard to this book as part of our mortgage arrears resolution strategy. The strategy is designed to deliver a range of forbearance solutions to support borrowers in financial distress or those likely to fall into arrears in the near future. We are tackling these issues and making progress. It is a complex matter and it takes times to construct solutions that work. We will roll out those solutions in accordance with the timelines agreed with the Financial Regulator. The real test is not simply in the launching of new products but in ensuring thereafter that the solutions work and have the intended effects. IBRC is considering the possibility of doing even more, where practical and possible, with some of the more difficult cases in our mortgage book.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> Another notable challenge for the bank is staffing, to which I have referred. Ongoing restructuring as the bank is wound down brings constant uncertainty for all staff. No long-term future career can be offered to those we seek to attract or those who wish to stay. This creates difficulties in terms of retention and motivation of staff. We are losing skilled and experienced personnel to other institutions at an unacceptable rate. Those individuals must be replaced with high quality candidates who can do the job we require them to do. Some 25% of IBRC employees are on short, fixed-term contract, the number is increasing. A drain in corporate knowledge is a serious side-effect of this dynamic. Of the original 2,250 Anglo Irish Bank and INBS staff at the time of the bank guarantee, fewer than 575 remain working in the merged entity. This underlines further the dramatic change that has taken place in the workplace culture. The numerous comments to the effect that the bank does not need the number of staff currently employed simply are ill-informed. The challenge for management is to ensure we have the right number of qualified staff to complete our task, no more and no less.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> I assure the committee that the objectives of the board and management team are to run the bank in the public interest in a manner which minimises costs, maximises the return to the Irish State and treats customers and creditors fairly in the context of policy as laid down by the Government. The work being undertaken at IBRC is critical to the economy. The work of an asset recovery bank is complex and not easily understood by the public. In particular, the nature of the management and staffing expertise required for the task is often insufficiently understood.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> There is clearly a high degree of interest in what we do and say. Since our discussion with the committee last year, there have been, at the last count, 7,362 print articles on the bank's activities and a huge number of media queries. We feel very privileged to be the subject of so many parliamentary questions in the Dáil. We deal with those queries and questions in house. I acknowledge the need for the bank to engage in an open, honest and transparent manner with all of its stakeholder groups and to communicate clearly what it is doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">In addition to fulfilling our statutory reporting obligations, we regularly communicate progress achieved and major milestones along the way to ensure what we are doing is understood by stakeholders, including the media and the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> I also should add in parentheses that if the joint committee has some additional time available at the end of the session, I might go into detail on the number of statutory reporting requirements we must meet. It regularly keeps me awake late at night, shortly before our board meetings, to check that we have made all the statutory returns we must make. I sometimes am tempted to wonder, in the small hours of the morning, who reads the goddamned things when they get to the other side, but that is another day's work.</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> I wish to make three points of clarification in this connection before I conclude. The first relates to the bank's dealings with high profile borrowers, in which there frequently is a substantial amount of outside interest. We have strict legal and ethical obligations not to disclose the bank's dealings or relationships with individual borrowers in the public domain. We simply cannot discuss the specifics of any individual case with any third party. Following a call in the media from a member of this joint committee for these dealings to be investigated, the chief executive officer, Mr. Aynsley, has given the Chair a commitment to the effect that the bank is more than willing to discuss in detail its approach to managing both performing and non-performing borrowers and the multifaceted governance that applies to all decisions in this regard without exception. I repeat and fully endorse that commitment. I can state categorically that any debt restructuring decisions the bank has made have been in accordance with that governance process and in the best interests of the taxpayer at all times.</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> The second point of clarification concerns the bank's appointment of and the mandate given to advisers. The bank is in wind-down mode and the process will be pursued by selling, as I indicated, entire loan books, portfolios of loans or individual loans. It is, therefore, a matter of when and not if we so do, as we achieve full resolution under the Government and European Union mandates. Details regarding the individual appointments of advisers relating to any commercially sensitive areas of activity, such as the ongoing analysis or the sale or recovery of individual loans or loan portfolios, must be treated as commercially sensitive information, given the real risk that public disclosure might have a detrimental effect on the bank's efforts to maximise loan recoveries. Therefore we will disclose any specific information in this regard. In response to continuing interest in the matter on the part of particular members of the joint committee, I can assure them that the bank adheres to a structured procurement process for the appointment of all of its advisers. That process is open, objective and transparent and is subject to the bank's governance processes, including both the provisions of the relationship framework with the Minister for Finance and oversight, through a regular reporting process, through the board of the bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> The third point of clarification relates to the bank's recovery of debts owed by the Quinn family. I am sure members will appreciate these actions are the subject of litigation and are a matter for the courts that will be before the courts again as early as tomorrow. We will not be able to respond to questions today on any matters related to that activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_44"> I can again assure the joint committee that all of the actions and decisions undertaken by the bank are, without exception, focused on maximising returns in the best interests of the taxpayer and we now are quite ready to deal with any issues the committee may wish to raise.</p>

        <speech by="#CiaranLynch" eId="spk_4">
          <from> Chairman<recordedTime time="2012-10-31T11:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_45">I thank Mr. Dukes.  I have a few items to deal with before we get things under way.  Is it agreed that the opening statements made this morning will be published?  Agreed.  As this part of the meeting will conclude at 1 p.m., I must ensure that I will accommodate all speakers who present themselves.  I propose that the first round of speakers from both the Government and Opposition sides be limited to 15 minutes and, depending on how time is being managed after that, I will readjust times, if necessary, to accommodate everyone.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">  Before calling on the first speakers, I wish to put in context what we intend to do this morning.  The two other banks the joint committee will meet today and tomorrow, namely, AIB and Bank of Ireland.  They will make presentations on how they intend to trade their way out of their current difficulties and get themselves operating independently from the State.  The mission of Mr. Dukes's organisation is quite different, as it is about winding down this bank over the next ten years in a sustainable and orderly fashion and in such a manner that the minimum cost is accrued to the taxpayer.  That is a summary of the presentation Mr. Dukes has given.  In so doing, I seek a point of clarification in respect of Mr. Dukes's position in the bank.  Is it as a public interest director or is there a public interest director on the board of Anglo Irish Bank, as there is on the boards of Bank of Ireland and AIB?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_5">
          <from> Mr. Alan Dukes<recordedTime time="2012-10-31T11:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_47">Before answering that question, may I add one brief remark, which was implicit in what I stated in the opening statement?  The context of the bank's activity, as the Chairman observed, is to wind down the operation by 2020, including the preparation of the ex-Irish Nationwide Building Society loan book for sale, if possible, in five years.  While that was implicit in what I stated, I should make it explicit.  Moreover, one of our concerns is to maintain the capital base of the bank.  It is part of the complex of decision making that we maintain the capital base in the interests of the shareholder.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">  On the matter of public interest directors, it is true that I was first appointed to the board of the bank in November 2008 as one of two public interest directors under the action that was taken by the Government at that time.  The bank was nationalised subsequently and is now the property of the State, the Minister for Finance being the shareholder.  I am unsure of the ceremonials of the issue but I would consider each director of the bank to be a public interest director at present.  Our mandate is clearly to act in the interests of the shareholder, who I take to be a proxy for the public interest.  The Government is obliged to act in the public interest and, consequently, I take the view that all our actions in the bank are to be seen in the context of pursuing the public interest, as it is defined for us by the regulations and policy framework laid down by the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_49">In that context, the witnesses might provide the joint committee with a broader explanation or understanding as to how the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, operates at present.  It also has a property portfolio, to which Mr. Dukes referred, in its capital base.  How extensive is that property portfolio?  Unlike the other banks that will appear before the joint committee and which are dealing with loans, borrowings and so forth, I understand the IBRC has a fairly extensive property portfolio.  How many of these properties are located within the Irish State?</p>

          <p eId="para_71">I have to make the point, Chairman, that we cannot discuss the details of specific cases.</p>

          <p eId="para_72">I will be specific in a general way, if that is the case.  A company that has been losing €20 million a year in Ireland, which employs several hundred people across the country - and in regions close to me employs 50 or 60 people - has an unsustainable rent agreement.  Two independent rent reviews have said that the rent would be half of what it is at present if market rent were applied.  In fact, the situation is so ludicrous that it would be cheaper for the company to close down, pay the IBRC rent and lay off 50 employees.  However, the IBRC, and Mr. Aynsley in particular, have been in contact with that company asking for the parent company, which is based outside the Republic of Ireland, to keep paying that rent.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">  This committee may need to make a recommendation to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.  He was very explicit, in regard to NAMA property portfolios, in stating that it was to deal with upward-only rent reviews and take a proactive approach to them.  Can I put the accusation that, because the Minister has not made that direct recommendation to Mr. Dukes, the IBRC is not as proactive in this area as NAMA might be, given that the IBRC has quite an extensive property portfolio?</p>

          <p eId="para_74">I am not in a position to make comparisons.  I can only say two things that I have already said.  First, our concern is to maximise the return on behalf of the taxpayer; second, it is to deal with our counterparties in a consensual way where that is possible.  I cannot go further than that in dealing with any specific issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_75">I will conclude on this because I am going to bring some other speakers in.  What makes the IBRC different from NAMA?  Although the IBRC is a State-run bank, NAMA is probably even less of a State structure in many ways.  If the committee needs to raise this issue with the Minister for Finance it will do so.  However, given the Minister's instruction to NAMA last year with regard to upward-only rent reviews, why does the IBRC not seem to be proactively dealing with this?  The information I have to hand is that the IBRC is chasing landlords based outside the State with whom it has agreements, while the companies concerned are losing money hand over fist.  If the IBRC pursues this course in terms of its wider public interest it will close those companies down, which will also have a net effect for the taxpayer.</p>

          <p eId="para_83">I welcome Mr. Dukes, Mr. Aynsley and their colleagues from the IBRC.  I thank Mr. Dukes for his opening statement and the schedule of information we received in advance.  I will start on a broader level in terms of the overall cost and the final bill, which Mr. Dukes addressed in his opening.  He said it would be close to €25 billion as opposed to the €29 billion to €34 billion that he estimated in September 2010.  Can he clarify whether the estimate of €25 billion relates to the former Anglo Irish Bank - as opposed to the Irish Nationwide Building Society, INBS, element of the IBRC - or is he referring to the IBRC in its totality?</p>

          <p eId="para_85">I am trying to get clarity on the overall figures.  The estimated liability in INBS when it was recapitalised through the promissory note was of the order of €5.4 billion.  As regards that element of the IBRC, is it anticipated that that cost will be broadly correct?</p>

          <p eId="para_86">Yes, somewhere in that region.  This is not intended to be an inflammatory remark of any kind, but the committee should be aware that the carrying out of that calculation in September 2011 was inevitably a very speculative kind of exercise.  I hope we will come nearer to €25 billion for the old Anglo Irish Bank than the €29 billion to €34 billion figure that was put out then.  All of that is highly contingent on the condition of markets, the condition of the overall economy and, to a large extent, what happens in the eurozone generally between now and the final wind-up.</p>

          <p eId="para_87">That is entirely accepted.  There are a whole load of moving parts here - I fully appreciate that - but we do have to probe what Mr. Dukes's best estimate is, based on certain assumptions at this point in time.  His hope is that the final bill for the Anglo Irish Bank element of the IBRC will come in at around €25 billion.  The INBS will still cost, as originally expected, in the region of €5.4 billion.  That will be a total of €30.4 billion, if the figures are correct.  The total amount that will go in by way of capital is €34.7 billion, so some money will be due back to the State in the event that what Mr. Dukes anticipates actually materialises - of the order of €4 billion to €5 billion.</p>

          <p eId="para_88">That is a reasonable deduction from the figures we have produced.  As I mentioned in a supplementary comment just a few minutes ago, we are concerned to maintain that capital base for two reasons.  First, it seems prudent that we should maintain a capital cushion as we go through a very uncertain market situation; and, second, we want to ensure there is some return at the end of the process out of what has been pumped in so far.</p>

          <p eId="para_92">If property markets do not deteriorate any further from the levels they have currently reached in the UK and Ireland, I would be quite confident that we could meet those targets.  If liquidity in both of those markets improves over that period, we might be more sure of realising those targets.  If liquidity became available and property markets firmed up we could do better.  There is a whole pile of conditions and speculations in there.  On the other hand, if property markets deteriorate further there will be a serious downside risk.  As I said in my introductory comments, as we go through it the deleveraging process will become more difficult because, of necessity, we will be getting down to the more distressed levels of the loan book, some of which may be difficult to dispose of.</p>

          <p eId="para_93">Can I ask about the impact of the promissory note?  I understand the IBRC is a passive participant, as such, and the negotiations are between the Government and the European Central Bank.  Mr. Dukes said the final bill for the Anglo Irish Bank element of IBRC may be affected by any restructuring of the promissory note.  What did he mean by that?  Is he involved in the discussions that have been under way for some time on redesigning the promissory note arrangement?</p>

          <p eId="para_94">We are not involved in the discussions on arrangements that might be made in the future.  We have been able to participate in some of the background work in modelling solutions and approaches because we have the expertise in the bank to do it.  As the committee knows, broadly speaking the promissory note as it is currently structured produces a level of income for the bank.  If the maturity of or the rate of interest on the note were to be changed, it would have an effect on the amount of income accruing to the bank over the period.  What those changes might be, I cannot say.  I do not know what kind of outcome we can expect from the discussions.  If there is a change in any of the major characteristics of the note, they will obviously have an impact on the bank.</p>

          <p eId="para_95">In his opening statement, Mr. Dukes stated the IBRC owes €42 billion to the Central Bank and other monetary authorities.  The promissory note money the bank receives every year goes to pay down its emergency liquidity assistance, ELA, to the Central Bank.  Is there a schedule agreed with the Central Bank on the repayment of that ELA?  Obviously, the IBRC would be able to settle all its other liabilities from existing resources, apart from the ELA, which it depends on the promissory note to fund.</p>

          <p eId="para_96">Broadly speaking, the promissory note sits on the balance sheet and is lodged with the Central Bank along with several other assets that we also can put into the ECB to generate funding to support the organisation.  As we wind down the balance sheet of the bank, all of the funds we collect are used to pay down the ELA facility, without exception.  What would be left out is a balance of borrowings which are secured by the promissory note.  Success for us is the removal from the balance sheet of all the commercial and residential loans from Anglo Irish Bank and INBS, to the point where we are left with just a government instrument - in whatever form that ends up being restructured to - on the balance sheet.</p>

          <p eId="para_97">In his opening statement, Mr. Dukes spoke of how high-profile borrowers are dealt with, and he referred to me.  I intend to raise the issue of the evidence that emerged in the High Court case in London involving Mr. Paddy McKillen and the Barclay brothers about text messages sent by Mr. Aynsley to Mr. McKillen conveying a board decision.  Perhaps this was put into the public domain to embarrass Mr. Aynsley.  However, it does raise certain questions as to whether it is common practice for the IBRC to liaise with its largest debtors.  Was this an isolated case or is it common practice, as opposed to issuing an electronic memorandum?  I am asking this question because we want to be reassured that what is left of the former Anglo Irish Bank and INBS has moved away entirely from the culture that prevailed in the past in which there were close relationships between those running the banks and their largest borrowers.  Mr. Aynsley is involved in making commercial decisions involving hundreds of millions of euro.  One can go through all of the governance process to which Mr. Dukes referred, but ultimately it does come down to judgment calls.  It is not my job to say whether these are correct.  It is my job, however, to seek assurance that it is been done in the right way, with nothing else influencing decisions.</p>

          <from> Mr. Mike Aynsley<recordedTime time="2012-10-31T11:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_98">There was nothing untoward in any way about the approach to Mr. Paddy McKillen to advise him of the board’s decision.  We were going through a process, of which Mr. McKillen and the Barclay brothers’ representatives were aware, which culminated in a submission to the board and its approval of the maintenance of a process of consensual restructuring of Mr. McKillen’s loans rather than the sale of a portion of these to the Barclay brothers.  When we came out of those meetings, my colleague Mr. Richard Woodhouse was given the authority to contact the Barclay brothers to inform them of the decision.  I attempted to call Mr. McKillen but, of course, could not get hold of him.  He does not do e-mail so I sent him a text.  It was as simple as that.  The reminder to him, following it up, was simply that this was a board decision and that it was a bank-client relationship that should not be divulged, as we were aware at the time that he was in litigation with the Barclay brothers.  It was inappropriate, we felt, that he went to the press with that.  Of course, it ultimately came out during the discovery process in that litigation.  That is all there was to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_99">  It is very important that the Deputy is confident that this bank is operating in a different way from the old management of the bank before nationalisation.  The key point is that there is no one individual in the organisation who has the capacity to influence or make decisions on any of these loans.  We have a very well-structured governance process.  It starts off with an account management team that is responsible for analysis, monitoring and oversight of the relationship every day to ensure the organisation has all the information that is required.  That in turn is overseen by a client relationship manager for each one of these accounts.  In the case of Mr. McKillen, Mr. Woodhouse is operating as his client relationship manager.  We have a series of asset quality forums that examine these accounts on an ongoing basis, assessing the appropriateness of the various impairment levels or the performing loan portfolio, although it is a small one given what has happened to the bank.  Decisions are processed up through a group credit committee that has representatives from the business, independent and risk management oversight units of the bank.  There are two main operating committees in the bank - the transaction review committee and the investment product committee - which deal with the sale or holding of loans, equity participation or investment or divestment decisions, wealth management business and the protection of investor interests.  These committees have various delegations that come down through the board.  There are multiple people within the organisation that scrutinise every aspect of the loan decisions.  For loans above certain levels, as in the case in question, there is a requirement to take these facilities in detail to the board to seek main board approval.</p>

          <p eId="para_100">One departure from the practices of the past in the institutions Mr. Aynsley inherited is how hospitality is dealt with.

          <p eId="para_103">I have a number of questions on five or six issues.  I will put them first before taking an answer.</p>
          <p eId="para_104">  I thank the IBRC representatives for coming in today.  Mr. Dukes mentioned in his written submission that the remit is to wind down over a period of ten years.  Can this be brought forward?  Would it be in the interests of the taxpayer and IBRC if this period could be brought forward?  What is the minimum amount of time needed to bring the bank to closure?  He also mentioned that IBRC is preparing the ex-INBS mortgage book for sale within a period of five years.  Can this task be achieved?</p>
          <p eId="para_105">  One of the issues where there may be difficulty in going through IBRC's properties is in tracking down the title deeds.  Would Mr. Dukes elaborate on that?  Is this process completed?  As opposed to other financial institutions, I understand that the former INBS and the former Anglo Irish Bank may have had several solicitors around the country certifying the deeds and they all might not have been sent into a central location.  Where stands IBRC's work on this?  Who is tasked with it?  Is it done in-house or is it outsourced?</p>
          <p eId="para_106">  It was mentioned in the submission that IBRC conducted an audit of legal costs.  How does IBRC operate?  Does it generally stick with the big practices or does it farm the matter out to smaller legal entities?</p>

          <p eId="para_108">On that point, is IBRC's legal department adequately staffed?  It was mentioned that there was a 50% reduction in staff since the peak.  Obviously, IBRC has lost a certain amount of expertise.  Is there any area where it is really exposed?  Have any section heads left in the past six or nine months?</p>
        </speech>

          <from> Mr. Alan Dukes<recordedTime time="2012-10-31T12:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_109">On Deputy Timmins's first question as to whether we can accelerate the process, we would hope so.  As I stated in my opening statement, de-leveraging so far has exceeded the targets that were set in the 2011 restructuring programme.  If it turns out to be possible to do so in a shorter period of time than originally provided for, we will be happy to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">  Having said that, we must pay attention, first, to the need to minimise the cost to the taxpayer and, second, to the capital maintenance issue.  To put it crudely, we could sell the whole lot tomorrow if we did not have to worry about the price.  If we were to do that - this is an unscientific way of saying it - and if we stated that we are not worried about the price and total return and we are prepared to burn all the capital, we could probably sell the whole lot tomorrow, and that would not be a good outcome for the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_111">  Deputy McGrath mentioned judgment calls.  We must make judgment calls at the end of the day.  The sale of the United States loan book last year was a very successful enterprise.  It would not be possible in the market circumstances today to get anything like as good a result for that loan book.  It may happen that next year market conditions in the United States might be such that somebody could come along and say to us that if we had held off our 2011 sale of the American loan book until 2013 or 2014 we would have done much better out of it - they might well be right - but we must make a judgment call at a point in time.  In answer to the question as to whether we would accelerate it if possible, the answer is "Yes", if we could do it happy in the knowledge that we were maximising returns and that we were not burning capital.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">  The same applies to Deputy Timmins' question about the INBS mortgage book.  I am not criticising any person when I say this, that the condition of that mortgage book when we took it over was rather bad.  It is a difficult mortgage book.</p>

          <from> Mr. Alan Dukes<recordedTime time="2012-10-31T12:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_114">I am glad the Chairman appreciates my difficulty.  It is a work in progress whether it will be possible to get it into shape where we can sell it or a big portion of it within five years respecting our overall objective or maximising returns but it is something we would like to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_115">  Deputy Timmins' next question related to some of the issues that are outstanding.  On tracking title and ensuring the solidity of title, in both the former Anglo Irish Bank loan book, which we took over on nationalisation, and the INBS loan book, we have had to do a very considerable amount of work to ensure that we can be confident that we have good title and a good base on which to deal with them.  There is ongoing work on that and the committee will be aware that a considerable amount of work had to be done in that regard in the transfer of chunks of the loan books to NAMA also.  I am not sure we will ever be at the point where we can state with full confidence that every "i" is dotted and every "t" crossed, but we have put a considerable amount of effort into ensuring that the condition of the book is as good as we can make it so that we can make progress on the sales.  It is probably fair to say that in none of the asset disposals in which we have been engaged so far have we met any substantial problem in that regard because the books have been properly prepared for the sales.  The great majority of that work is done in-house.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">  On legal fees we said that there is a big volume of legal work that will need to be done on behalf of the bank and we invited a wide diversity of firms from across the country to make offers to us for the terms on which they would carry out this work.  Our objective was to get the work done as cheaply as possible but ensuring that we got the quality of work that we required.  We have broadened the field out considerably past the large firms in the business.  Personally, I take the view that there are probably a good many legal practitioners all around the country who, if given the right opportunity, could be as big and as successful as any of the big four or five, and if they can do it in doing good value work for us, I would be happy with that as long as we get a good bang for our buck out of it.  We have paid particular attention to legal practitioners and receivers in seeking to get value for money on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">  Our legal department is competently staffed.  We could do with more staff.  We are currently in the process of considering the best means of replacing our chief legal officer who, to my great regret, resigned amicably a short time ago.  She wanted to get a life back again and we are looking to replace her.</p>

          <p eId="para_120">I thank Mr. Dukes for his response.  That brings me on to two issues.  First, he mentioned that he lies awake at night thinking of the statutory returns.  Sometimes we put too much emphasis on something that was not policed and then we over police.  Are there some measures the Government might take, or perhaps not take, that might include IBRC in its commercial remit?  Perhaps there are some shackles on IBRC that it could do without and it would be of more benefit ultimately to the organisation and the taxpayer if there was a little less regulation, if I may use that term.  What statutory returns could be dropped?</p>
          <p eId="para_121"> With regard to deleveraging, who is actually buying the properties? What is the profile of the companies involved? I understand many American companies and pension funds are buying properties here. Who are they and what kinds of properties are they seeking? Is it fair to say that as we go along it will be more difficult to sell because the prime properties are the ones that will be sold first? If IBRC manages to wind down within ten years - perhaps in eight or nine years - what will happen to the residual properties and loan books? How will they be integrated? What will happen to individual mortgage holders with a 20 or 30-year-old mortgage when the bank ultimately winds down?</p>

          <p eId="para_130">I do not believe there are shackles that I would wish were taken from the bank.  We have a number of restrictions, the most notable being in terms of the European Commission's commitments letter.  We are allowed to lend a very limited amount of money to borrowers if that is a substantial part of rescuing the loan, so to speak, and making it viable.  There is a percentage limit per facility that is extended and an overall maximum quantum for the bank.  In every case so far we have been well within the limits for the given loan and we are well within the overall limit set for the bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_131">  I would very much like to have an opportunity of sitting down at some leisure with a regulator.  I know my colleagues are a bit nervous of me saying this.  It is a waste of time, energy and money for the bank to have to state, for example, on a monthly basis that the Minister for Finance has not required us to do A, B or C, and there is a good bit of that in regulatory reporting.  I am not sure that it is really designed to put the focus on where the real problems are.  That is a hobbyhorse of mine.  I would like to see much more succinctly expressed and much more brutally applied regulation.  I have been dealing with regulation one way or another for most of my working career and I find that the more elaborate the rules are, the more opportunity people have to get around them.  The simpler the rules and the more brutally they are applied, the more we can be sure of getting the desired result.</p>

          <p eId="para_136">There are occasions when issues between the bank and borrowers leak out.  There have been a couple of occasions when that has happened and it is not very convenient.  When people approach me about those issues I usually ask what is the possible source of the leak and what is the motive.  One rarely meets a happy under-bidder.  Quite often information that comes out comes from a person who has been disappointed and is looking for another way around the process in which he did not successfully engage in the first place.  It is a case of <i>caveat emptor</i> when it comes to taking up leaks.</p>

          <p eId="para_137">In terms of who is buying, it is a combination of US, continental Europe and UK parties - private equity houses, funds and private family offices looking for an up-tick in yield.  We have been satisfied with considerable interest in the UK where - without giving any specific details - we are probably disposing of approximately €100 million worth of property per month.  When one looks at the underlying parties there, one of the reasons for liquidity is cited as a hedge on the euro's collapse.  People are looking at UK and sterling-denominated assets as part of their reinvestment portfolio.  In the US, funds are being raised on a pan-European basis and an allocation of that European-wide fund is allocated to Ireland.  It is a small part of the overall - perhaps 10% or 15% - but nevertheless for some of the properties we have in our portfolio the quantum that is available within those sub-divisions of the fund makes some of our assets of interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">  As the Deputy rightly acknowledges the difficulties of the portfolio shrinking and being left with a more difficult portfolio will be a challenge.  Perhaps a little more reflective of where we are in the residential mortgage portfolio area, he asked what is to be done for people with 20 years paid down and five years to go at the point the bank is wound up.  Almost certainly, with the residual rump of Irish property it will be sold in one shape or form on a block basis at that point in time, possibly to another bank here and possibly to funds that have raised a larger sum with greater confidence in the improvement in the Irish economy at that point.</p>

Along with other members of this committee, I ask many parliamentary questions, which are sometimes unrelenting as the witnesses mentioned in the earlier address.  It is important that we, as legislators, do that.  When we consider where NAMA has found itself in recent weeks, sometimes when we think the ship is sailing steadily it is actually on the rocks.  It is important there is scrutiny from Oireachtas Members and the media in general and none of us should fear it.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">  Deputy Michael McGrath spoke about the ELA.  Mr. Dukes mentioned that there would be a rebate to the State of approximately €4 billion based on his figures.  If there was no restructuring of the promissory note and if the promissory note runs its course, in 2020 IBRC will have sold its loan books and would have had enough capital - €25 billion - and basically the rest of the promissory note would be written off.  It would not be a case that we would continue paying the promissory note after that point because we would be paying to a bank that is just holding capital.  Would that not be the case?</p>

          <p eId="para_141">The structure of pro-note is such that it generates income and as we sell down the assets there are changes in the timing of the cash flows of the pro-note versus when the disposals happen.  So in fact we are forecasting some capital generation in the latter years because we have sold down the loan portfolio quicker than we had modelled a year or a year and a half ago.  So it is timing based.  Any disposals we do from a loan asset are used to pay down ELA.</p>

If things run as normal, when the last €3.1 billion is transferred on 31 March 2020, the IBRC will have paid off all of the ELA liability and met all other liabilities through the sale of its loan books in the meantime.</p>

It was done through the arrangement of constructing a promissory note that could be lodged with the Central Bank ELA facility.  It provides cash flow for the bank and has a coupon.

However, there has been a drastic reduction in staff numbers over a number of years.  Are staff receiving pay increases or performance bonuses?  Why are staff costs not coming down in proportion with the reduction in staff numbers?</p>

          <p eId="para_175">There have been no performance bonuses since nationalisation and no generalised pay increases for staff.  There have been some increases in pay for a limited number of individuals who have taken on extra responsibilities.  As I said, there have been cases in which we have had to replace staff who left with staff on short-term contracts.  They are not always less expensive in pay terms than those who leave permanent positions.</p>

          <p eId="para_186">We need to be sure we have people capable of doing the type of job that needs to be done to maximise the return for the bank, and we must pay the market rate for the people we hire. We have done this with regard to the CEO, who was recruited in 2009. A number of discussions, to put it mildly, have taken place since then on levels of pay in various parts of the bank. It has been a problem for us as we retrain our staff in order that they can do the type of functions appropriate to a bank in wind down because we find that when people get to the point where they will be promoted to a new grade, they are head hunted by other banks which pay them more money than we can. We have a difficulty with pay levels from the point of view of staff retention and promotion. As far as I know, and this is an issue being constantly reviewed in the bank, we do not pay people more than we need to retain them. We probably pay people a bit less than would be needed to be sure we can retain the type of skill sets we need in the bank.</p>

          <p eId="para_189">As Mr. Dukes stated, we do not have retention bonuses or any other type of bonus at this point.  Having said this, the attrition rate at the bank over the past 12 months has been unacceptable.  In an organisation such as ours, much of this comes about from the fact we do not provide a career future for people, but also because we are involved in a very specific type of work.  We are contracting our organisation to a single focus, which is work out of loans and achieving the highest possible result for the taxpayer in every circumstance, either through refinancing performing portfolios or recoveries and collections on the poorer parts of the portfolio.  We are not the only organisation in the country which has this type of portfolio.  As we go through the process of building teams, they are at risk.  They get poached, and not only by other State-owned organisations but also by foreign organisations which have difficult and distressed portfolios which they need to work out.  The Department of Finance has realised this and it has in train a review of remuneration throughout all State entities.  We are involved in this and as we go through the process, we hope it will contain measures designed to assist us retain people through to completion.</p>

          <p eId="para_197">As I stated, we are pushing ahead with the implementation of the mortgage arrears resolution strategy, MARS, and the range of forbearance products included in it.  I would like to go further.  It is something we have just begun to discuss in the bank.  If we look at the most distressed part of the mortgage book, there will be cases where it will be impossible to envisage the mortgage being fully paid off in the contracted term.  We will examine introducing another arrangement in addition to what is provided in MARS to bring some relief to people in this position.  We have only just begun this reflection.  Our first concern is to get MARS into action.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">  It is clear in a general way, as Ms Muldoon and others have stated, that if there is to be any type of domestic market recovery in the short term, measures must be taken to relieve some of the burden of debt on consumer expenditure.

          <p eId="para_209">The IBRC and the two pillar banks carry out a number of operations for the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  We run a unit that is an outsourced part of the NAMA operation under a service level agreement.  I am happy to say that it works well.  NAMA has gradually devolved more and more of the decision making on this part of the portfolio to the IBRC.  It has been suggested to me that NAMA believes that outsourcing some of its operation is effective for it.  Policy on this issue will not be made by the IBRC, but by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">  Our <i>modus operandi</i> includes and will include for some time to come an occasional reflection on whether it would be better to outsource some parts of our operation.  Some of them have already been outsourced.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">  In the final analysis, we will have shrunk the bank to the point where it would be conceivable to sell the entire thing in one or two chunks if we could find a buyer.

Recently, we appointed two new directors, each of whom has a specific background in banking and brings valuable expertise to the board.  Three board members will come to the end of their term of appointment in May 2013 and the board has started considering what we need to do to make it the right size for the bank's condition.  This will include a consideration of what skillsets we will need.  We will give our opinion on this matter to the shareholder, but the shareholder is the final decision maker.  We review the board's competences and functions.  We are not obliged to have more than five members, as we are a non-major financial institution.  Given the type of work we do, though, we need a particular selection of capacities.

          <p eId="para_215">I apologise for stepping outside briefly.  If I am repeating someone else's question, please tell me that it was answered and I will move on.  I do not want to waste anyone's time.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">  I will ask a general question first.  We are four or five years down the road from the crash, but I have put a question to everyone, including the troika, to which I have not received an answer.  Perhaps Mr. Dukes, a public interest director, will be the first.  Anglo Irish Bank was a nest of speculation to an acute degree.  Fortunes were made by private individuals while the going was good.  When it crashed, it was landed on the shoulders of the working class - the poor, the pensioners and the workers.  What is the moral justification for crucifying our taxpayers with destructive austerity to bail out speculators?</p>
          <p eId="para_217">  Let me protest in passing.  When many people are suffering so much, that any bank, be it private or public, is paying hundreds of thousands of euro, much less €500,000 or millions, to top executives is obscene.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">  Ordinary people, including me, can be bamboozled by discussions on promissory notes and the merry-go-round of bonds, notes, etc.  If €3.1 billion must be paid each March, and setting aside the various manoeuvrings in that regard, what are the mechanics of it and how will it be paid?  In a few sentences, will Mr. Dukes reprise the story of the €31 billion that constitutes the promissory notes?  Where did it come from and where has it gone in recent years?  If the State asserted that the amount was a burden too far on the people and that it would stop further payments, what would the consequences be apart from apoplexy in the EU establishment and among the sharks in the financial markets?</p>

          <p eId="para_219">I am not being smart, but the Deputy has asked questions about the promissory note and the payment of €3.1 billion in March.  I will take the Deputy at his word, as this issue has already been addressed.  If the Chairman will permit it, I will ask Mr. Bradley to discuss it again in one moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">  The Deputy will not be surprised to find that I will disappoint him again.  To put it at its simplest, my job and that of the bank's board and management is to pick up as many of the pieces left after Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide went bust as we can.  I take no responsibility for the bailout or for decisions on the guarantee.  I would be happy to engage in a philosophical discussion with the Deputy about other issues, but I must deal with the situation on the basis of current Government policy with all of the influences that come to bear on it.  The IBRC has met the repayment of bonds falling due in accordance with current policy and legislation.  Had we been told or legislatively obligated to do something different, we would have done so.  We are like the legionnaire - do this and he does it.  We are subject to other peoples' orders.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">  We do not pay IBRC's executives millions of euro.  I am not being smart with the Deputy, but we dealt with the issue of the chief executive's salary a few moments ago.  We will happily rehearse it if the Chairman will allow us.</p>

          <p eId="para_232">I am mainly concerned with owner occupiers, people who purchased a home in good faith when they were being blackmailed by rampant speculation in the property market but needed a home for a family.  The submission states that the bank repossessed 23 properties in the six months to June 2012.  What is the story in those cases?  Did the owner occupiers fight the bank and did they want to maintain their homes?  If they did, why did the bank not settle an agreement with them rather than taking the roof from over people's heads?</p>

          <p eId="para_233">Generally, repossession of any personal dwelling home is an absolute last resort.  By policy, we do not want to go there.  Normally, it is a situation where the borrowers will not co-operate with the bank in any shape or form.  These are long-term delinquency situations with no hope of recovery.  We try to work with clients and try to put them in a position where they can get back on their feet.  We have a number of products coming online, with the mortgage arrears resolution strategy, to assist us through forbearance.  The chairman alluded to IBRC being in a process of forming a strategy for the most distressed parts of our loan book for the most distressed clients.  For want of a better name, we could call it a residential intensive care unit, designed to focus on the most needy.  It is an initiative that will come online within the next few months.</p>

          <p eId="para_235">I refer to individual mortgages, not portfolios.  People were caught in an impossible situation at the height of the boom, with what are now unsustainable monthly payments because jobs have been lost.  Why could IBRC, as a State-owned bank, not come up with a revolutionary approach?  The solution is simple and involves reducing the value of the home to the current market value and reducing the monthly payment to the equivalent of that.  It would make the loan sustainable for the vast majority of people who are now in difficulty.  IBRC would then be leading the way for what would happen generally.  Instead of the massive amount of money going to the banks, through huge suffering from people in these difficulties, money would be released into the real economy, which may help to overcome the disaster of austerity.  Would the IBRC consider something like that?</p>

          <p eId="para_236">There is no release of money into the real economy from that.  If we follow the process suggested by Deputy Joe Higgins, a lower level of mortgage repayment would still be paid.  As Mr. Aynsley has said, we have only just begun the intensive care system for homeowners.  Useful as it is, the mortgage arrears resolution system cannot be the final answer to the mortgage problem.  It is pretty clear that the final shape of the personal insolvency legislation will have an impact on action in this area.  I do not know what the impact will be but it will emerge over a period of time.  The kind of proposal made by Deputy Higgins would have an effect on the capital position of the bank and would have to be assessed on that basis.  I understand why Deputy Joe Higgins is making the suggestion.  One of our concerns, and one of the requirements, is not to erode further in the capital position of the bank.  It is a conundrum.</p>

          <p eId="para_244">I run the specialised asset management group.  For want of a better description, it is the cash flowing businesses as distinct from commercial real estate loans.  In that area, we have approximately 100 regulatory groups or companies equating to approximately €5 billion on the bank's balance sheet.  It is a fairly small number.  It represents a significant discreet portfolio of high net worth, in the sense of company exposures.  I operate the cash flow elements and another individual, Mr. Mark Layther, runs the unit dealing with smaller individual loans.  He has approximately 2,000 connections in the commercial real estate space and there are thousands of individuals who borrowed less than €10 million for a number of projects embarked upon in 2005 and 2006.  Many of them are now in need of care and attention.  If one is looking for large groups, there are 100 companies in the €5 billion group, €7 billion comprises 2,000 representatives and the balance is a much wider spread.  In the UK, it is a few hundred connections making up almost £8 billion of loans.</p>

          <p eId="para_249">The IBRC has been fairly flexible and proactive in how it has been achieving objectives over the past number of years.  Does IBRC have connection with asset management companies such as Certus, which is involved in getting out of the Irish market as quickly as possible on behalf of some of the major UK banks?</p>
          <p eId="para_250">There is a NAMA unit within IBRC. NAMA is much bigger than IBRC in the overall context of asset management in this economy and in other economies and even the other banks, like Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland, which are in a similar position to IBRC. Do the banks pool information? Do they discuss how they will move forward in the context of the big boys and the MARS programme? For this to be sorted out, something must be done. This has been mentioned by others as well. Buy to let is a big problem. The SMEs are finding it difficult to move on because, to some degree, they are burdened with a property debt. People are genuinely suffering because of the residential property market, and that is very much a moral consequence of where we are. Does IBRC discuss this with the other banks to see if they can move this forward?</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> When other banks have appeared before the committee, we have often found that some of them have a very negative attitude towards doing something about debt write-down. I do not get that impression from IBRC. It seems to be a bit more proactive. Is it pushing the MARS programme? Is there some connection with other banks when trying to push for a resolution to this? I speak about this from our point of view as legislators because the insolvency legislation has been criticised by some of the banks which feel we are helping people to get off the hook. If the banks are not proactive, we may well have to become proactive in the context of the legislation. As IBRC knows, it is much better for the banks to look at things case by case basis rather than having prescriptive legislation which may not deal with the problem in an appropriate way. What is IBRC doing to move this forward?</p>

          <p eId="para_252">There is no concerted view among all the banks on how they deal with their particular loan books.  I imagine any attempt to do that would be frowned on by the authorities.  We regard ourselves as policy takers.  We operate within the framework of policy as it is.  The Government said it wanted the MARS policy, the Central Bank laid down guidelines and we put that in place.  The shareholder told us to wind down the bank in ten years without burning the capital reserve and that is what we set out to do.  Within that framework, we deal with each particular connection we have in the way that seems to us to get the best return out of the situations we find.  It is not always easy to figure out how to do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">  In regard to personal insolvency legislation, I do not know, and nobody can know, at this stage how it will work out.  We have to see the final shape and how things move through it.  I believe it will have some effect on how the MARS programme works when we see how the dynamics of the process work out.  We will have to review our financing models when we see the results of the programme.  There is clearly going to be some margin of choice in individual cases as to how they work out, but we will have to make the same kind of commercial judgment on how we treat the loan as we do now with some new factors coming into play.  I do not know if there is any appetite on the part of policymakers to impose a single set of approaches to any part of this.  I have not seen any evidence of it.</p>

According to page 9 of the document, which sets out the profile of residential mortgages, the bank increased its specific provisions for impairment on the owner-occupied section of its loan book from €206 million on 31 December 2011 to €235 million on 30 June 2012. Is that correct?</p>

I appreciate that the bank did not take on the Irish Nationwide loan book until 2011.  I am sure it is still responsible for what happened earlier.  Perhaps the person who was dealing with Irish Nationwide will respond on this point.  To what extent has the provision for impairment had to be increased over the past three years?</p>

          <p eId="para_277">The condition of the market, rather than the bank, is the key driver behind this.  As the market falls, one needs to assess the value of the underlying collateral and the likelihood of repayment by the borrower.

          <p eId="para_278">I suppose I am looking for an answer to a specific question.  Having examined the balance sheet, my impression is that the bank's failure to deal with impaired domestic owner-occupied debt is costing the taxpayer.  The bank has had to make higher provisions for impairment over this period.  I was somewhat concerned to hear one of the witnesses say, in response to a question that was asked by my colleague, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, that the bank is formulating a strategy as we speak.  It does not appear to be formulating a strategy for its high profile debtors.  Why is it taking so long to formulate a strategy for owner-occupied domestic mortgage debt?</p>

          <p eId="para_279">We are doing several things.  We are not losing taxpayers' money by sitting by and watching loans gradually get more impaired.  That is not an active act on our part.  If the market keeps deteriorating, we will have to make a bigger provision because more loans will get into trouble.  If we move quickly, it will not necessarily make a difference to the level of impairment.  If we move quickly and we find a borrower or mortgagor cannot pay, the impairment is going to happen anyway.  We are not generating impairments by doing anything or failing to do anything.</p>

          <p eId="para_285">I have not said that at all.  The impairment provision we have to make in our accounts is a source of considerable worry and concern for the bank and for the taxpayer.  The more impaired the loans, the less likely it is the taxpayer is going to get a return.  We are not just sitting there and allowing impairments to drown us out.  We have to do something about it.  One of the drivers of impairment is the condition of the market, which is not something we decide.  The Senator asked why it is taking us so long.  First, we took over the mortgage book for residential mortgages and investment properties in the middle of last year.  As I have said, it was a pretty bad book.  We had a lot of work to do before we could figure out what condition the book was in.  It was not like a normal takeover in which one would carry out a due diligence operation before taking on the book.  It was simply transferred to us as it was and we had to deal with it.  We had to arrange and organise ourselves to begin to implement the MARS process, which we have done.</p>

          <p eId="para_317">The MARS process in which we are involved is the same process in which the other banks are involved.  The first product roll-outs will take place in December.  As Mr. Dukes said, products such as the split mortgage product will give relief.  In response to what was said about the provision numbers going up, I would like to refer to what will happen if we accelerate the process without a process of debt forgiveness.  I know much of this will come back to views on debt forgiveness.  At the moment, the bank does not have any debt forgiveness capacity.  The Senator asked whether we write down loans for customers.  We have a policy of not writing down loans for customers.  We will take write-offs when we sell a loan to another party.  A number of loans have been auctioned through a process.  Their value is driven by that public process.  It depends on what people are prepared to pay for the asset or loan at that particular time.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">  We do not write that off when selling a loan facility.  We do not go through that process with the residential part of the portfolio.  It is very much a measured process of working out a consensual solution with the borrower, where we can, as long as the borrower co-operates.  As we bring this series of products on line through the MARS process, we hope to address many of the difficulties people are having.  Products like the spilt mortgage product, which will give people the capacity to resize the amount of money they spend on a mortgage and park the other part of the resized mortgage, will help people to manage their cashflows as they go through the recovery.  Unfortunately, we do not have any mortgage forgiveness or debt forgiveness products that we can offer.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">  As we said earlier, we are going to look at the very distressed end of our book.  We hope to be able to develop a different series of products around that intensive care unit.  We have to go through that process.  It is difficult because we have inherited what is probably the worst residential book, with the worst system constraints, in the Irish marketplace.  We have had to reconstruct much of what one would normally hope to find when one takes over one of these books.  We are going through a long and lengthy process.</p>

The bank had no influence on that.  At the end of the day, "a little" was the chief executive's answer earlier on to the pay grades within the company here.  These businesses are mainly cashflow-based and the best assets drive home at night.  If people are to continue to create value in the business in which they operate, it is the same for a bank as it is for an oil company, a trade or anything else, the board of that company would determine pay levels and their appropriateness.  We had no involvement at all.</p>

          <p eId="para_326">The driving home at night is the bit that concerns me because unlike a commercial real estate loan, where there is a building that will stay in the same spot in perpetuity and its value will go up and down, for a cash-flow business, the staff will either create value or destroy it.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">  Deputy Twomey's asked how we look at the restructuring of these companies.  We are different from the other banks for several reasons but our strategy remains the same.  We are different because the bank tended to lend all of the money; if it liked a transaction it would do 100%.  When looking at Bank of Ireland or AIB's portfolio, there are more syndicated loans and other players.  Often we would also provide mezzanine finance.  The bank's concentration in each investment is much higher.  The fact the assets drive home at night gives rise to enormous risk in realising the best long-term economic value for the shareholder.  As a consequence, the preferred platform is a consensual restructuring wherever we can get that done.  Going through the courts and other recovery mechanisms is extremely costly and a consensual outcome is by far the best, and dealing sensitively with the employees and the management of the company is how we stimulate the best possible bid from a third party buyer.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">  Coming back to Deputy Higgins's earlier question, albeit phrased differently for residential mortgages, many of these companies on our books were financed and constructed at the height of the boom and the level of debt in those companies is unsustainably high.  Part of the creativity we want to bring to bear is the "right-sizing" of that debt, not writing it off, to make the company of capable of sustaining a portion of the debt and packaging the company in a manner that will allow a buyer to realise precisely what he is buying, having certainty about staff and debt levels and an appreciation of the forward look of the company.  We utilise experts, often accountancy firms which help us with an independent business review on a particular product, and the solutions are, therefore, both bespoke and discreet.  The collusion that was asked about earlier does not arise.  We must be nimble and sympathetic to each case and operate within those parameters to achieve the best price on sale.</p>

          <p eId="para_339">  Going back to the NAMA situation, it is important that people understand the model used.  About 250 staff are directly or indirectly associated with the supporting of NAMA.  NAMA has around 200 staff but that number does not include the staff sitting in those participating banks who provide services to NAMA.  NAMA has effectively outsourced those services.  If we transfer loans to NAMA on day one, this represented a transfer from one set of accounts on our computer system to another set of accounts that were sectioned off.  We still undertake all of the loan management operational work associated with the management and maintenance of those loans.  We have teams of people who are operating under a service level agreement with NAMA to support those loans and the needs of NAMA.  To look at the total number of individuals and the costs associated with that, we must take not only the NAMA staff but the staff in each of the banks that support the agency.  We have just less than 800 in the core of the institution by year end to support the wind-down activities of IBRC.</p>

          <from>Deputy Peter Mathews<recordedTime time="2012-10-31T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_341">I hope it will be a conversation, with a mixture of speech and questions.  I thank the witnesses for coming in.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">  The story of how Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society merged to become the IBRC is amazing.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">In 2006, in Davos, the world's richest, most powerful and so-called most intelligent people lauded Anglo Irish Bank as the best banking model in the world, with a balance sheet of approximately €100 billion, as shown in these excellent bar graphs which I find very helpful for seeing at a glance what has happened on the balance sheet from then to now. The bank had €100 billion of assets and was lauded as the best bank in the world. Now, under Mr. Dukes's chairmanship and executive management, this has been shrunk to just over €50 billion, which includes a large chunk of the remaining €28 billion of promissory notes, the asset that was created to allow the emergency liquidity assistance, ELA, to be advanced to redeem the losses of the investors or bondholders. As Deputy Higgins pointed out, he was one of the first on the European stage to put the case to Mr. Barroso that it was wrong for Irish citizens to be saddled with investor losses.</p>
          <p eId="para_344"> The €31 billion of promissory notes, now reduced to €28 billion, has a headline rate of interest that is the income for IBRC. According to Karl Whelan, over the period of the promissory notes, that will amount to approximately €18 billion. Therefore, that €18 billion in projected income is offset against the estimate of losses to the end of IBRC's life. If we take even half of that €18 billion and add it to the €25 billion - the estimate of losses that will be found buried in the Anglo experience - that will amount to €34 billion as the losses that originated out of Anglo. That brings us to the stage now where the funding has changed and the citizens of Ireland are administering a drip to inject money to redeem the losses of the replacing creditor, the euro system and the Central Bank of Ireland, who gave the investors the get-out-of-jail-free card. This is not pleasant.</p>
          <p eId="para_345"> This brings me back to a question for the IBRC. Is it not logical, financially and arithmetically, that it should be possible to negotiate on this? It should be possible to make the case to Europe that we plugged the hole in the framework, stopped it falling to the ground and, therefore, deserve some reduction in the bill that is being laid totally on the backs of the Irish people. We deserve that on the basis that the arithmetic can do it. This is not a financially complex process that will take 40 or 30 years. It simply requires the creditor - the Central Bank - to agree to buy in and not seek-----</p>

          <p eId="para_367">I welcome Mr. Dukes and the team from IBRC.  It was good to hear their report.  We are aware of the high profile litigation in England, but perhaps IBRC is only a witness in that.  We understand that decision is to be appealed.  In how many other cases is IBRC involved, if any?  If there are other cases, how significant are they or how much of the remaining loan book is exposed?</p>
          <p eId="para_368">  With regard to the question raised by Deputy Stanley, I understand IBRC must function on an agency basis for NAMA, but how many of its staff are engaged full-time in managing loans on behalf of NAMA and how does NAMA recompense IBRC for them?  Dealing with NAMA must be a huge part of the business of the IBRC and I assume large numbers are working in the IBRC on its behalf.  Is NAMA involved and does it take the advice of the more senior people acting in that capacity on how to proceed with the number of receivers who have been appointed?  I have in mind a case I believe is pretty hopeless.  It seems as though NAMA is playing along - perhaps there are big salaries going to some of these people - but I see no prospect of a return at all.  Obviously, every case is different and each must be taken on its own merits.</p>

As far as our NAMA operation is concerned, there are approximately 170 people directly employed and probably another 70 or so equivalents, indirectly, in support of those.  We reckon there are effectively 230 full-time people in the bank working on the NAMA portfolio.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">As we have gone through the process, NAMA has gradually delegated more and more of the decision making regarding that bloc of loans to our dedicated NAMA unit. We are remunerated up to a maximum of ten basis points on the total gross quantum of loans.</p>

          <p eId="para_387">As I said, we will probably do it sooner than 2020.  The reason I am circumspect about saying how much sooner is that as we go through the process, we are getting to the increasingly difficult parts of the loan book.  If we are doing well, we will be in a situation where it is conceivable to take the remaining rump loan book and package it in a way that will allow us to sell it to three or four buyers without damaging the capital and still ending up with €6 billion to €8 billion to hand back to the shareholder.  That is what we see happening.</p>

The latter is an important factor because we are talking here about a fixed-rate instrument and interest rates will having a bearing in terms of how much capital will be generated.

          <p eId="para_392">The promissory note was based on flows back - that is, a discounted value of funds that flowed over a period of time back to a current market value.  This has huge significance in terms of the cost of the banking recapitalisation to the State.  Was the residual value built into the estimated cost at the time of €34.7 billion?

          <p eId="para_410">Thank you, Chairman.  Citizens and taxpayers are concerned above all that there be fairness in this process.  Last week representatives of NAMA indicated to the committee that two thirds of the agency's clients are co-operating with it.  Will the delegates indicate the percentage or portion of IBRC clients who are not co-operating?  The NAMA delegates also indicated that 90% of rental income is now directly mandated straight into the agency.  Will the delegates comment on that in the context of IBRC's engagement with its clients?</p>
          <p eId="para_411">  Finally, there is a general view that many people with substantial assets transferred some of them to children, siblings and spouses in the lead-up to the crash.  Have the delegates consulted the relevant registration authorities with a view to ascertaining the level of that type of activity?  Have they drilled down into the loan books that were historically produced on a quarterly basis?  As a former employee of Anglo Irish Bank, I am aware of the level of detail that would have been recorded.</p>

          <p eId="para_414">In terms of co-operation, I do not have a figure to hand but I will revert to the committee with that information.  It is fair to say that we have a very good record generally in our dealings with clients who work consensually with us.  That consensual approach is core to the way we operate and has consistently proven more effective at producing higher returns than would be achieved by way of an adversarial approach to customers.  It also helps to avoid litigation.  As I said earlier, we will do everything we can to avoid litigation because of the sheer cost.  A consensual approach is conducive to achieving the highest possible return to the taxpayer, which must always be our focus.</p>

          <p eId="para_416">We pin down rental incomes as part of the consensual operating process.  There are processes and protocols in place to ensure we capture them.

          <p eId="para_418">It depends on the situation.  It is much more important to have direct control over them in circumstances where one does not have a consensual restructuring or working out of a situation with a client.  In many cases, clients have operating businesses and will require control over cash flows in order to operate those businesses successfully on a day-to-day basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_432">I will take up the point made by Senator Hayden.  Huge stress is building up in respect of the buy-to-let mortgages and a problem will arise regarding the non-allowability of a certain portion of the interest on funding for portfolios that are in buy-to-lets.  I ask the witnesses to make representations to the Minister for Finance and his departmental officials that this be reconsidered.  A great many of these valid portfolio holders of residential property and so on, who have been in this business for a long time, are the tipping point of going bust.  The interest on their loan funds is not allowed fully as an expense against the rental income.  Rental income has shrunk, interest non-allowability against a shrunken rental income is causing deep problems and the taxation implication is that their liabilities are still there.</p>

          <p eId="para_436">I also wish to come in and ask, following on from the Keane report, about one of the many actions that were outlined as part of the mortgage arrears resolution process.  One of the more radical approaches contained therein was the buy-to-rent scheme.  Has IBRC given consideration to this proposal with regard to its mortgage book?  If so, how many proposals are currently under consideration and is there a likelihood that any of them have been converted from mortgage to rent?</p>

While I am aware that IBRC's loan book is more biased in favour of the domestic standard home mortgage, to carry on with this point, it has come to my attention a number of times that the behaviour of receivers, where a property has been possessed, towards tenants has not been to treat them as though it is a landlord-tenant relationship but simply to receive the rent.  Does IBRC have a policy in this regard?  Second, does IBRC have-----</p>

          <p eId="para_449">The answer to the second question probably is shortest.  Yes, we are required to maintain a minimum capital level of 8%.  We are capitalised for some degree of stress, given the state of the markets and given our mandate to sell down the portfolio.  Our strategy is to stay within that regulatory capital threshold as we wind down.  On the question as to whether we can close this earlier, yes we can.  The way we look at it, this is a very black and white situation.  Yes, we can but there is a capital consequence.  We are into what we refer to as the "hard yards" part of the portfolio, that is, individual line-by-line work-out.  That is in the absence of markets opening up and offering us an opportunity such as we saw in the United States.  That was a strategy we began in October 2010 and which was concluded in October 2011.  An enormous amount of work was completed to get the book in shape in order that we knew exactly what we had and we could take individual loans or parts of that portfolio to market.  As the market opened up and the commercial mortgage-backed securities, CMBS, markets reopened, we had the opportunity to market the entire portfolio and of course all of it went, bar roughly €1 billion, which now has been worked down to approximately €400 million.  If markets offer opportunity, our strategy is, in the meantime, to continue through this process of preparation and maintenance of data tapes, etc., in order that as markets operate and open up, we can put portfolios or more individual loans into the marketplace and close it earlier.</p>

          <p eId="para_451">To give the Deputy an idea, it always is difficult.  We do not like to forecast because there are so many moving parts.  However, our net loan book is roughly €15 billion at present.  By the end of 2014, we probably can get that down to between €6 billion and €7 billion.</p>

If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given, and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible they should not criticise, or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name of in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. </p>

          <p eId="para_467">Before making my opening comments, it is important for us to recognise the support of Irish taxpayers, the Government and our other stakeholders, including the Central Bank.  It has been said before that AIB does recognise the historical role it has played in where we have come to today, and the issues we face.  We want to remind everybody that we are fully aware of, and do apologise on behalf of AIB for, our contribution to this situation.  Notwithstanding that, the team here today is brand new.  I will speak more about that shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">  The efforts which we have to make to change AIB are very broad.  The team here today is a brand new one.  Our entire leadership team is new to the bank and brings a wide variety of skills to the table.  The team is passionate about restoring AIB to a position where we can support the economy, return some value to the shareholder, and at the same time address what is a very important population - those who are in significant distress, whether they are customers in homes or SMEs.   </p>
          <p eId="para_469">  The scale of what we have to do in the bank is fairly dramatic.  For the purposes of history, the peak of our head count was 27,000 in 2007.  Following the severance programme for the bank today we will be at 12,000.  That is still subject to further potential reduction. </p>
          <p eId="para_470">  Our balance sheet over the period has been reduced by 26%.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">There is a material change in the overall structure of the bank. We have changed the leadership team, reduced the workforce, cut pay for the majority of the workforce and reorganised the structure of the bank to be more simplified and focused on customers. We are trying to rebuild the business at the same time as restructuring while addressing customers in financial distress, which requires the build-out of a new bank capability. On top of that we have the overall regulatory regime, which has escalated significantly as it catches up on areas that needed to be enhanced over time. This all has to be done at the same time as motivating staff who have had a difficult time over the past four years, the majority of whom have not had an influence in the difficult decisions that have been made and their consequences. They do pay a price and it is difficult for them to remain motivated. It is also difficult for us to get them motivated to deliver some of the solutions required. These changes, given their scale and complexity, will take time. Everyone would like to solve everything immediately but it does take time.</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> When I joined the bank ten months ago, there were several concerns about the bank’s culture and the lack of trust between the bank and its key stakeholders, including the Department of Finance and the Central Bank. Our risk processes were very deficient and the customer model was broken. Our ability to help people in financial distress was fairly non-existent. We have introduced several cost-cutting measures. A voluntary severance scheme is under way with 1,700 staff expected to depart by the end of December 2012 and a minimum target of 2,500 by 2014. It is interesting to note that more than 2,500 applied for the scheme. That speaks of the stress and the environment in which many of our staff work. Annual savings in excess of €200 million are expected from this scheme. Pay and benefits have been tackled, with a 15% pay cut at executive levels while there is a pay freeze at more junior levels. All employees who are members of a defined benefit pension scheme will be moved to a defined contribution pension scheme, which is expected to generate €30 million in savings. Several branch closures have taken place, which is a difficult decision. We know it affects customers. However, with our arrangements with An Post we are hoping to mitigate the loss of service in some locations. We have to tackle fees. In our variable expenditure, we estimate that we will have reduced the ongoing burden of professional fees by 60% this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_473"> We are also looking at how we run the bank. We have a revised strategy based on servicing customers and increasing our effectiveness in lending in the economy - both mortgage lending and lending to small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs. AIB recognised that the leadership team needed to change, which was part of the culture change in the bank. The entire board and leadership team has been replaced. In the past 12 months AIB has appointed a new chief executive officer, chief risk officer, chief operating officer, head of audit, head of human resources, general counsel and head of corporate affairs. Five new board members have also been appointed. Of the 11 board members, two are public interest directors and the other nine were appointed in 2010 and 2011. Of the 50 significant officers who were in place during the crisis, only two remain and only as non-executives. We have created a financial solutions group, a dedicated unit of more than 2,000 people, to address debt and debt restructuring.</p>
          <p eId="para_474"> What is the bank doing about lending? We are focusing on mortgages, SMEs and customers in difficulty while at the same time maintaining the bank’s capital and remaining stable for the long-term health of the economy. We have had to revise our processes to make it easier to access credit. AIB is 28% ahead of its September year-to-date lending target of the Government’s target of €3.5 billion. We continue to approve 90% of formal applications for credit. We have tackled the overall big drive for the small business area and shown how we are open for business. We are assisting SMEs and providing education, training and consultancy in moving them from collateral-based lending to cashflow lending. Some SMEs are fearful about the economy and unwilling to take risks. We are helping them understand how they can access credit. In many cases, we have discovered that firms do not want more debt and would prefer equity. There is a combination of issues in the dynamics of the economy which we are trying to address. We have landed several funds to promote debt and equity.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> AIB will comfortably exceed its internal target of €1 billion in mortgage approvals for 2012. There has been an improvement in the trend of mortgage lending. However, as the Central Statistics Office pointed out recently, 46% of house purchases have been cash-only. The number of total approvals has increased by 72%, and 47% of all mortgages sanctioned are by AIB. This is quite a material share of the economy. At the same time, however, we have also opened up EBS as a mortgage channel which was not in the market until two months ago. We expect the EBS brand, a historically strong lender, and the AIB brand to be operating in the mortgage market fully in the next month.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> AIB is participating in the NAMA 80:20 deferred consideration pilot initiative. We have introduced new initiatives such as the negative equity trade-up mortgage and expanded our distribution arrangements with An Post. Credit approvals have a quick turnaround and there will be a choice of brands with AIB and EBS.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">Our endeavours show that we are approving much more than we used to and a much higher volume.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> We have had to try to address the overall deposit costs for the bank. As we have explained at other meetings, the cost of funds to AIB is significant and leads to many of our products being loss-making. Many of the mortgages we write, even at current rates, when one takes into account the cost of funding and administering the bank, still remain loss-making. We have seen a big increase in deposits in the first half of the year. We have even seen some unguaranteed corporate deposits come back to the bank, which is a positive trend and a signal of more stability and confidence in the banking system.</p>
          <p eId="para_479"> The stabilisation and support of customers in difficulty are probably the most complex and significant matters in the endeavours we must undertake. We provided a complex analysis of this in the packs we sent to the committee. In the past year we have had to build the skills set which was not really available in the bank previously and that skills set is for 2,000 staff. We have had to identify existing and new outside resources. We have had to create a separate division of financial solutions group. We have had to train all of these individuals and work with them to help them on issues of how to manage, understand and be empathetic in the restructuring of debt with an individual. We have developed all of the Keane report and MARS arrears products and have had these submitted to and approved by the regulators. We have received full board approval for the entire strategy for addressing absolute debt levels in the marketplace and the use of each of these products. The strategy has been documented and confirmed and communicated to the regulators.</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> At the same time, we have not been sitting there waiting for that approval. We have been engaged with our customers and in many cases there has been initial forbearance. If we look at principal homes, the private homes category, we have been addressing 33,000 customers in difficulties. Although 85% to 90% of our customers are paying their mortgages, for those in distress for whom there is interest-only forbearance, 70% have been able to return to a normal payment schedule. The balance we must address within more complex scenarios and in that regard, we come across in a significant number of cases somebody who has a home but also an SME, is in a partnership for buy-to-let properties and may have other family relations who, together, have invested in commercial real estate or other properties. We are trying to address the disentangling of all of these components of debt by prioritising the issues of people staying in their homes and the stability of jobs and growth in SMEs. Some 41% of the population of SMEs at which we have been looking are in advanced stages of restructuring. Some 14% have debt restructuring. If one looks at all of the SMEs on which we are working and which are in distress, our objective is to have 100% of them addressed by the second quarter of next year. The speed at which we can move is significantly enhanced by having a trained and capable group of 2,000 staff. We now have the resources and would like to receive all of the committee's questions on this topic, among others, that will allow us, together with the tools we have developed, to address the issue of sustainable debt in all categories of the economy. </p>
          <p eId="para_481"> I want to bring my comments to a close because we have provided so much information that the guidance I am receiving is that we would like to move to questions as quickly as possible. Let me reiterate the fact that we appreciate the support we have received, for which we are very thankful. We recognise that AIB would not exist today were it not for that support. At the same time, we must deliver a sustainable and profitable bank if we are to be able to lend and return shareholder value at the end of this process and support with capital those in distress. We must be able on a long-term basis to support the growth of the economy. As the economy will eventually return to strong growth, we need to have the ability in skill sets and the capability in terms of capital to support that growth. We now have the right solutions and the right team in place that will allow us to deliver on our promise. At the same time, we appreciate the fact that delivery of many of these initiatives may not be as fast as people would like, but we must be effective in what we do; we must be consistent and fair in how we treat people; and, above all, the solution must work. We have achieved a great deal. We have taken many steps within the bank to change the culture and costs. At the same time, we have taken many steps to rebuild our lending and restructuring capability. Notwithstanding the fact that we have taken all of these steps, we recognise that we have more to do than we have already achieved.</p>

          <p eId="para_482">I thank Mr. Duffy.  With the committee's permission, I will publish his opening statement.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">  I will defer my questioning until the end of the first round, but let me put this question to Mr. Duffy before I invite other members to contribute.  Does he have a response to Ms Fiona Muldoon's recent comments which were very much directed at his bank and Bank of Ireland, that they were in denial in respect of the mortgage difficulties, that their response to date had been very much one of wait and see, that the issue of forbearance about which Mr. Duffy spoke was one of merely keeping something going on an infinite basis which, in some cases, was making people's situation worse, and that, with the Personal Insolvency Bill coming down the tracks, we should have seen more innovative approaches from both banks?</p>

          <p eId="para_484">On this point, I respect everything Ms Muldoon and the regulators have had to say.  They have a difficult challenge to address in this complex transition in the banking environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">  On the specific concern that AIB was waiting for some solution in the economy, I can tell the committee that that is absolutely not so.  The bulk of the senior team and others who are not here have hardly had a weekend day free.  We are working around the clock to develop, if one thinks about it, one of the biggest financial services firms in the country to service this debt restructuring.  Second, we had to seek approval from the regulators and others for the very products that would be effective in providing the solutions.  Third, we have a complex debt restructuring to take care of and balance it with moral hazard, which is not an excuse.  When one has 85% to 90% of one's mortgage holders paying their mortgages, rushing out and putting a temporary or quick and expedient solution in place for those in distress would be complex and, ultimately, damaging to the economy and those individuals.  At the same time as developing that capability which has been an enormous task, as I stated, we have addressed 33,000 private dwelling house, PDH, customers in stress, 70% of whom have been in a position to make their payments.  There is always an element of truth in these statements, but we are working around the clock to develop advanced capabilities.  At the same time, we have not ignored the reality and tried to address all of these customers.  We are very advanced in the SME sector, too.  We have an objective of within six months having complete coverage of all SMEs in distress and solutions on which we will work with them.  </p>
          <p eId="para_486">  On the question of whether we are or have been waiting for something, the answer is, "No, we have not."  At the same time, we respect the fact that the regulators would like us to proceed and be more aggressive in our execution and that there are stresses for people who are living on the edge.  We are trying to address them.  There are no expedient solutions, but we hope to demonstrate in the next 12 months our absolute commitment by what we do, not by what we say.</p>

          <p eId="para_487">I welcome Mr. Duffy and his colleagues from AIB and thank him for all of the information he sent which we have had the opportunity to go through in preparation for the meeting.  As I am limited in time, I will move as quickly as I can through the key issues I want to raise.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">  As Mr. Duffy will be aware, the State has injected €20.7 billion into AIB and the EBS in the past few years.  When can we expect to get some of this money back?  The Government is involved in negotiations which potentially may involve using the European Stability Mechanism to take equity stakes in the banks that the State has already recapitalised.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">As CEO of the bank, does he have any view on that issue? Does he believe it is the right strategic direction for AIB or does he have alternative proposals such as getting the bank to profitability and, ultimately, selling an equity stake by another means?</p>

          <from> Mr. David Duffy<recordedTime time="2012-10-31T15:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_490">I will deal with both issues together.  It is relatively clear from our perspective.  Our priority has been to get the bank back to sustainable profitability for the very purpose, as I have said, of lending in the economy, returning value to the shareholder - the issue raised by the Deputy - and also helping people in distress.  The issue of how to do this involves all of the things I mentioned in our preamble and significant changes are required to get there.  We have stated our objective is to get to that position by 2014; therefore, that is when we would have profitability.  The purpose behind this is to allow us time to begin - we have begun already and are in numerous discussions - talking about foreign or other investors in the bank.  Our strategy on the first level is to pursue the bank model we can deliver that we would have confidence would attract investors and to begin conversations with these potential investors where the first conversation is about building trust.  Then over two years we would expect to be able to convince them that everything we were doing and delivering would suggest one could trust a management team to execute a model that would deliver sufficient return on investment.  That is the path we are pursuing, regardless of anything else that happens.  These conversations have been positive and people have been pleased to see us back in the marketplace in discussions around these topics.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">  With regard to the ESM facility, I really do not have a perspective on whether it will succeed or come to life, or when it will come to life.  Certainly, if there is a positive - if it did come to life - the bank would become a bank that had a foreign investor, that was no longer linked with a sovereign risk and that could be attractive to investors.  There are a number of possible advantages to cheaper funding.  However, the view of the team is that we cannot build a bank strategy around anything we do not control.  We need to build a successful bank model based on the environment we can control and deliver a bank that will be profitable in 2014 and have positive discussions with investors along that curve until 2013.  If somebody subsequently offered the ESM to us and that was a solution we could apply to the bank, of course, we would be happy to consider it in a positive light.</p>

          <p eId="para_492">I wish to clarify what I interpret Mr. Duffy as saying.  Apart from the possibility of the ESM taking a direct stake in AIB sometime in the future, even at this point the bank is engaging with potential investors explaining its strategy for getting back to profitability with a view to them potentially investing in the equity of the bank in a couple of years time or beyond.  Is that essentially what he is saying?</p>

          <p eId="para_493">That is correct.  Our objective is to pursue that timeline and conversations now with investors because they will not take a view in the first instance.  An investor needs to look at the management team in place, establish in his or her mind whether the people concerned have the capabilities and credibility by their track record to deliver a bank that will give a return that an investor would find attractive.  In our minds we see the two year timetable mentioned by the Deputy mentioned as sufficient time to demonstrate a track record of two years or more and be able to offer at least the sight of, if not the actual reality, sufficient returns for investors to make an investment.</p>

          <p eId="para_494">At this remove is AIB neutral on whether that investment could come from the European Stability Mechanism or whether it could come from stand-alone foreign investors taking stakes in the bank?  How would Mr. Duffy feel about AIB being owned and run by the ESM?</p>

          <p eId="para_495">I do not have a strong view on that issue.  I do not know enough about it because it is not something that is clear.  What would be the governance structure?  What would be the ownership structure and for how long?  What conditions would be attached?  Until we know all of these elements, it would be hard to have a positive or negative view of it.  The most practical measure we have adopted, in recognition of the uncertainty in many areas, is focusing on delivering success within an environment we can control.  Then, if there are further benefits to the ESM or some other model, we will, of course, address them at the time, but we do not have a strong view on it at this stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_496">Before I move on to the issue of mortgages, I wish to ask about pensions.  Mr. Duffy referred to - it is also outlined in the details AIB sent us - the difficulties the bank is experiencing in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme.  It is moving to a defined contribution scheme.  Last weekend the <i>Sunday Independent</i> reported on the pensions being paid to former politicians, which are always, rightly, subject to scrutiny.  Mention was also made of some of Mr. Duffy's predecessors as head of AIB.  According to the newspaper, the former CEO, Mr. Eugene Sheehy, is paid a pension of €529,000 per annum, which would have an overall value of approximately €18.5 million over a lifetime.  The former AIB managing director, Mr. Colm Doherty, on reaching his 65th birthday will, apparently, receive a pension of €300,000 per annum.  These figures seem obscene, particularly in the context of what has happened to the bank and the amount of money ordinary taxpayers have had to put into it.  Has Mr. Duffy, as CEO, explored every possibility of addressing the legacy pension bill AIB is facing for his predecessors, even down to the level of asking people to volunteer to surrender pensions on foot of what has happened in the bank?</p>

          <from> Mr. David Duffy<recordedTime time="2012-10-31T15:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_497">The issue has two parts, the first of which is the absolute overall pension liability for the bank.  We believed on assessment that the absolute pension cost to the bank was unsustainable.  With the model we were operating, the benefits employees today are receiving are significantly in excess of what they should be in a market that we would see as sustainable.  That is why we addressed pensions overall as per the document the Deputy has before him.  We have addressed the issue to materially reduce the cost to the bank and, ultimately, the taxpayer.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">  The Deputy asked about specifically addressing the pensions of previous individuals.  The question was raised with the chairman at our annual general meeting this year and the chairman has committed to evaluating the ability to request a voluntary contribution back from a range of individuals in the history of the bank.  He has committed to doing this by the end of the year.</p>

          <p eId="para_505">Essentially, money that is owed to the bank by its debtors, instead of being repaid to the bank, is being paid into a pension scheme which will now fund the payment of enormous pensions to Mr. Sheehy, Mr. Doherty and many others.  Is that the case?</p>

          <p eId="para_506">It is the case and unless there is a contractual change in the environment, as CEO, I cannot make any change to these arrangements.  However, notwithstanding these arrangements and any arrangement reached in the future, for the broader population of AIB, past and present, many of whom have nothing to do with some of the decisions made in the past, we had to address the issue of pension restructuring.  The deficits would have meant pensions would have been wound up and in that case all pensions, including those for long retired pensioners who were in the bank before any of these issues relating to current employees arose, would have been reduced by up to 50% or 60%, which we considered would have been inequitable.  Our purpose was not to fund any particular pension but to address the critical mass of the population.</p>

          <p eId="para_507">I wish to move on to the issue of mortgages.  In the questionnaire submitted AIB has indicated that even at a 4% standard variable rate for mortgages, variable mortgages are still loss making.  In the presentation Mr. Duffy has pointed out that the cost of funding now is 2.79%.  I presume he is taking into account ELG costs, bad debt provision, etc. in saying that even at 4%, the bank is still losing money on variable rate mortgages.  What would it need to charge in order for them not to lose money?</p>

          <p eId="para_509">The average cost of funding in AIB and the EBS is approximately 3%.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">Until recently, the standard variable rate in AIB was 3%. We have a €41 billion portfolio so there is much processing and organisation around it and it is clearly loss-making. As our CEO stated, we are attempting to bring the bank to viability, sustainability and profitability. In that regard, we must sell products in AIB at a profit going forward, just as any viable bank would. Our mortgage book is loss-making. The cost of running the book is about 60 basis points per annum in terms of the operating cost for the people and processes. The cost of credit going forward will probably be about 50 basis points. If one takes an average funding rate of 3% and adds on that 1.1%, one still sees a book that is break-even or loss-making.</p>

          <p eId="para_511">The essential issue is that the tracker mortgages are haemorrhaging in terms of losses.  The variable-rate mortgages might be marginally loss-making but if one is charging 1.75% on tracker mortgages, the losses there are absolutely enormous.  I know the bank denies the claim that variable-rate customers are subsidising tracker mortgages but essentially they are.  One would not need to charge as much if the trackers were not so low.</p>

          <p eId="para_512">I do not agree with that.  The tracker and SVR books are not subsidising each other.  They sit alongside each other in the balance sheet and are both loss-making.  Our SVR, at 4%, is still by far the lowest in the Irish marketplace; that is an important point to make.  The tracker book is terminally loss-making.  It was a very bad product brought out by Irish and UK banks at a point in time when the world was a very different place.  Clearly, AIB and EBS are honouring their commitments, as they must and should, in respect of tracker mortgages.  However, we do not look at one book subsidising another.</p>

Am I correct in saying that the bank has actually executed some of these solutions for individual distressed borrowers?  They have been piloted.  Have all of these types of advanced option been rolled out on a pilot basis?</p>

          <p eId="para_514">I will make one comment and ask my colleague to comment on some of the cases.  Just to be clear, the complicated multiple debts that are linked must be resolved so we are employing all products.  We have three approaches.  The first is to immediately stabilise and reduce the absolute flow of debt the person must service.  The second is to calculate with him or her what is sustainable.  The third is to determine the debt that is not sustainable that we would have to restructure.  The case in the example we showed the committee is representative of a significant number of our volume.  In a number of cases, one finds a husband and wife with a PDH, a SME and three buy-to-lets and a brother- or sister-in-law with further SME debt and other property debt complications.  We would bring interest rate forbearance, split equity, debt write-off and all of the elements into those.  That is the model we are using so everyone understands how we are approaching it.  The great majority of cases are in that mode of complexity.  It takes time to resolve them and come to a conclusion but we will end up in all of these situations reaching a level of debt in a calculation at which that debt is not serviceable and we have to write some of that debt off.</p>

          <p eId="para_521">Like Deputy McGrath, I welcome Mr. Duffy and his colleagues to the meeting.  The bank has two clear objectives.  The first, as it is one of our pillar banks, is to get back to a point at which we have a functioning banking system.  The second is to ensure that some moneys can be recouped by the Exchequer.  I will pick up on some questions posed by Deputy McGrath.  This morning, we heard from executives from the IBRC who told us that their ambition is for the net cost to the Exchequer of the promissory notes to be in the region of €25 billion as opposed to the predicted figure of €34 billion.  AIB has cost the Irish taxpayer in the region of €20 billion.  I know the bank is restricted with regard to profit warnings but it has said it hopes to be back in profit in 2014.  Could Mr. Duffy give us a target that could be achieved for the Exchequer from a potential sale of AIB or a portion of it and give us some indication of where he sees the bank at this point?</p>

          <p eId="para_522">We are not able to put a financial target on it.  There are so many variables.  We must deliver on restructuring, capital and Basel III.  We must get our costs down and develop a provable model.  We must see what the economy and the European market does, how our revenue profile can build or not build and how quickly we can produce a profitable bank that has an attractive yield.  In speaking to investors, not one of them would give us any indication of what likely output there would be in terms of a pricing model in the future.  The view is that it is too early in Ireland's case - because we are so linked to the sovereign, which is our shareholder - for them to calculate how they would see us in terms of the value of an investment.  We would seek to produce a return for the bank in the 8% to 12% range that we believe is attractive to investors and in discussion they have confirmed that, but beyond that we have not been in a position to create any calculations around the exact value potential.</p>

          <p eId="para_523">In respect of the language that Mr. Duffy used about variables and the market changing, perhaps one of the most refreshing parts of this morning was that the IBRC also acknowledged, as we all do, that there is a broad range of variables.  However, the IBRC still set a target at which to arrive.  It may be worthwhile to look at the model set out by the IBRC in the documents its delegates laid before us as to where it sees itself going.  As a State-owned bank, AIB should have that objective rather than a more vague ambition.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">  My next question concerns SMEs.  Mr. Duffy said that 90% of formal applications for credit are being approved.  Could he briefly define "formal application"?  Certainly, there is anecdotal evidence that many businesses are being refused before they arrive at a formal application.  Does Mr. Duffy have a figure for the number of people who are being refused before they get to the formal application stage?</p>

          <p eId="para_525">I will comment on that question and then ask Mr. Byrne to comment on SMEs.  To be open and frank, the informal side of it has been a concern.  There was risk aversion in the restructuring of AIB.  Certainly in the early period, people were afraid to bring some credits to the table and were risk-averse in that respect.  Throughout the past six months, whenever I have met many of the Deputies here and others in Government, I have asked those present to bring to us by name any individual company which has not been able to access credit so we can tackle it.  I have given those present my number and e-mail address to this end.  On a positive note, I received notification of a significant number of cases over that time and we were able to resolve many of them satisfactorily.  We have been trying to specifically address the informal world and have spoken with Deputies and the ISME representative group.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">We have met with the ISME executive and every other institution in the financial services world. As simple and as unsophisticated as it is, we gave them our card and stated they can bring anybody to us, from the Taoiseach all the way down through any other institution. Some of those in this room have brought us people who were not able to access credit and we have been able to resolve the matter. We recognise a challenge exists at the informal level and this is one of the initiatives we have been rolling out. As I mentioned earlier, there are also all of the other educational initiatives and travelling throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_527"> The executive, which numbers an additional four or five people, does not meet at the head office in Bank Centre; it meets only in branches. For our monthly executive meetings we travel to a branch. The two most recent meetings have taken place in Kilkenny and Cork. We meet the staff during the day and spend four or five hours afterwards with small and medium enterprises and individual customers. At the most recent meeting in Cork we met 50 customers over four hours. We do not present; instead, we ask the customers what we can do better. To give a level of comfort, the executive will be on the road for the bulk of the time in direct contact with retail and small and medium enterprise customers throughout the country. We think this is the best way to learn. This is an indication of the attempts we are making to deal with the informal world. I will ask Mr. Byrne to comment specifically on the definition of a formal application.</p>

          <p eId="para_528">A formal application is an application in writing using our application form.  The benefits of applying in writing are that we are provided with all of the information, and if somebody does not like the decision made he or she is capable of appealing it internally to AIB or to the Credit Review Office.  If somebody does not make a formal application there is no process by which he or she can make an appeal.  We strongly encourage everyone to make a formal application.  To the end of September 25,000 formal applications were made to AIB of which 92% were approved, which is approximately 23,000 applications.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">  With regard to informal applications, we ran a trial for a period of time.  It was a spreadsheet-based approach on a branch by branch basis to try to track how many applications did not proceed from informal to formal inquiry.  It was very much a manual process to try to get a sense of the issue referred to by the chief executive.  Our sense is that the number could be an extra 10% to 20% so it could mean our approval rate is below 90%.  It is an informal process and, as has been indicated, our objective is to try to get to a point where all applications are made formally.  We clearly suggest that if everyone with an interest in applying for credit formally applied the application approval rate may fall.  We believe this would be all right because it would mean a formal process was in place through which everyone would know what was happening.  In every forum where we have the opportunity to do so, we consistently encourage people to make a formal application because it is the only way they can appeal our decision if they believe it is incorrect.</p>

          <p eId="para_530">What is the degree to which the bank has restored power to local branch managers?  A largely anecdotal view is that during the so-called boom huge pressure was put on individual managers to lend and sell various products which many people now find difficult to repay.  There is also a sense that individual managers must kick an issue up the line.  To what extent is the bank working on allowing managers, who know their customers best, to be part of deciding on solutions?</p>

          <p eId="para_531">Deputy Murphy raised several issues which are quite particular with regard to how we are changing the culture of the bank.  In the past people were paid for volume of sales and this is one of the easiest ways to damage a bank's health if it is without regard to the creditworthiness or ability to repay of the customer and is a case of piling them high and selling them by volume.  This is the wrong motivation for banking.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">  Banking is very basic.  One should know one's customer, and our ability to have people in the branch network who know their customers was severely weakened during the time it was felt people had to move to head office to progress their careers.  To answer the Deputy's specific question, we are taking this skill-set back from head office and putting it into the branches.  We are returning the SME experience which was severely weakened to the branch network and bolstering it with expertise we must source from outside the bank because much of it had left.  We are taking these two steps to return to the basic banking model, which is that people in the field know their customers and make judgments.  We are adding to this a level of approval which has been difficult to discuss because in a regulatory environment such as ours which is changing, requests are made to remove individual authorities from the branch network.  We have been working on standardisation, simplification and a delegated level of authority which we can review monthly in head office but a stand-alone decision can be made locally with a customer in a branch.  It is early days but we imagine in the next six to 12 months there will be a material improvement in terms of knowing the customer, accessing local credit decisions and having the authority to make such a decision without referral to head office.</p>

          <p eId="para_533">AIB has merged with EBS, and the mortgage figures in some of the graphs refer to AIB while in other graphs the figures are pooled.  Why do different variable rates exist?  In one table AIB is referred to as having the lowest standard variable rate, which it does, but the same table does not refer to EBS, which has a higher rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">  It was stated that 43% of people who have distressed mortgages come from the SME or partnership sectors and perhaps have rental properties, and that the bank is examining packaging all of their debt to come up with a solution for them.  To what extent is the bank examining loans with other banks which their mortgage customers have?  Is the bank taking a multi-institutional approach to difficulties?  If people have loans with several banks the burden still exists although I am sure AIB would not wish to have the liability.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">  In continental Europe, particularly in Germany, people have 50 or 60 year mortgages.  Would AIB be interested in such a product?  It would allow multi-generational ownership of property.  Is this a potential solution to the difficulties people have?</p>

          <p eId="para_536">Where other banks are involved we take a multi-institutional review.  To give a practical example, a person may have unsecured debt with another bank and a mortgage with us.  The banks initially came together on this through the Irish Banking Federation but now deal directly with each other on each transaction.  In some cases we deal with unsecured debt as a loss and in other cases another bank will, but we will work together to try to solve the cases.  We must work on a multi-bank basis to solve the problems.</p>

          <p eId="para_537">With regard to the main lending rate for mortgages, the EBS rate is 4.33% against the AIB rate of 4%.  The market average is approximately 4.35% so EBS is still slightly below the average.  EBS is a separate legal entity with separate funding vehicles, securitisation vehicles and wholesale funding.  As a smaller organisation historically it paid a little more for its funding than AIB because it was lower rated and smaller.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">Since the cost of funding the EBS balance sheet - it is a separate legal entity with a separate balance sheet, board and governance - is a little bit more expensive, it would be appropriate that its pricing would be at par or slightly higher. To build a sustainable model, the EBS moved its pricing to a sustainable level prior to AIB during the crisis.</p>

          <p eId="para_545">I thank the witnesses for their presentation, which was full of facts and figures.  I appreciate how comprehensive it was.  As I am restricted by time constraints I will begin my questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">  A number of people have mentioned the super pensions being paid by the bank.  As these are contractual pensions, the bank's ability is limited.  The Parliament has seen this issue previously, when bonuses were being paid to people who believed they were entitled to them despite the fact that their banks were being propped up by taxpayers' money.  A super levy was introduced.  The bonuses could be paid, but the taxpayer would recoup nearly all of it through a universal social charge levy on persons in institutions being supported by the State.  When we discuss the super pensions, we are not referring to employees' ordinary pensions.  What would be the impact on AIB if legislation was introduced to impose a similar levy on pensions in excess of a certain limit?</p>

          <from> Mr. David Duffy<recordedTime time="2012-10-31T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_547">I cannot figure out what the impact would be.  If legislation entitles the State to reclaim money, it would become a matter between the super pension individuals, as the Deputy defined them, and the litigation.  It would probably become a legal issue, but I am unsure as to how it would interplay with the bank.  Former employees would be in litigation or in a super levy situation.</p>

          <p eId="para_548">Would the bank have any concern about such legislation deterring other individuals from being recruited?  I assume that members of the bank are no longer entitled to these types of super pension.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_421">
          <from> Mr. David Duffy<recordedTime time="2012-10-31T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_549">That is correct.  Apart from no longer being defined benefit pensions, but defined contribution pensions, the current pension structure requires a much lower level of contribution.  The Deputy's point is valid.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">  As to the deterrent, it would be another contributing factor to the negative environment in which the banks operate.  The greatest background challenge is the operational risk of having a large group of employees in a shrinking bank that is publicly vilified, be it politically or in the press.  Their pay and pensions have been cut and their benefits, for example, cars, are gone.  Name it and it is gone.  If one is in that environment and suddenly something else is done, it will serve to vilify a population, the great majority of which had nothing to do with what happened.  It may have a negative impact on that population.</p>

          <p eId="para_551">I know many of the bank's employees.  They would welcome the imposition of such a levy on super pensions, as it would be viewed as equitable, particularly by those who are losing their jobs as a result of the downsizing.  People who worked in the bank right up to the middle of the crash and who were a part of the excessive lending have walked away with golden parachutes.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">  Regarding lending to small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, the presentation mentioned that the bank had surpassed the 2011 and 2012 targets.  Given the figures released by the Central Bank, this seems to be a question of the interpretation of what we call new lending.  I presume that the bank does not view restructuring as new lending.</p>

          <p eId="para_553">Correct.  Of the target surpassed to date, €600 million is specifically new lending.  People measure differently.  We do not call giving someone a new facility new lending.  Besides the €600 million, much of the amount is restructuring.  Restructuring is vital to the retention of employment and the stability of SMEs.</p>

          <p eId="para_558">I have AIB's 2010-11 SME lending plan.  The target was €3 billion.  The first paragraph reads: "In recognition of this, AIB is already providing considerable lending support to SMEs in both new lending and in the re-scheduling and restructuring of their existing borrowings".  It does not state that rescheduling and restructuring form part of new lending.  Indeed, they are not a part of new lending.  As written, they are separate.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">  The Central Bank has provided data on new lending for SMEs.  The Central Bank states: "Gross new lending is defined in such a way as to exclude renegotiations or restructuring of existing loans".  Are we playing with figures?  The target of new lending was the additional money being given to SMEs, supposedly some €3 billion last year.  All of the banks in the State just about surpassed that figure.  AIB's target this year is €3.5 billion.  The bank is playing with figures to make it look like its targets are being achieved when that is not the case.  If someone's overdraft is restructured into a loan, the business person has not received new money or lending.  He or she might be in a better position with a loan, but new money is not being delivered into the economy.</p>

The targets of €3.5 billion and €3 billion for this and last year, respectively, were set as part of the recapitalisation of AIB and the Bank of Ireland.  The targets could never have been envisaged as new money into the economy, as a total target of €7 billion this year or €8 billion next year would be in excess of anything the economy could even contemplate having.  From a macrostatistic point of view, we could not provide a further €6 billion, €7 billion or €8 billion.  Those amounts would never have been sustainable, given the size of the economy.</p>

          <p eId="para_562">We will be hit by time.  The 2010-11 lending plan reads, "AIB is already providing considerable lending support to SMEs", but the key phrase is "in both new lending and in the re-scheduling and restructuring".

The presentation, while good, puts forward the idea that the target has been surpassed and that €3 billion has flooded into SMEs.  However, that is not the case.  The majority of the €3 billion is the same money that the SMEs had, merely restructured.  I will move on, as we will not agree on this point.  We have been playing with figures.</p>

          <p eId="para_571">With regard to an investment return of 8% to 12%, most of the money that went from the State to the bank, approximately €15 billion, went via the NTMA and the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  The National Pensions Reserve Fund has been successful in the past but average returns are approximately 6%.  Why would the National Pensions Reserve Fund not hold onto its shares in AIB if the bank could rate guarantee a return of up to 12%?</p>

          <p eId="para_577">  I take the witnesses back to November 2011, when there was a public spat between the Government and the bank.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance called the position of the bank pathetic and the Minister for Finance said the position was serious.  It concerned the ECB reduction of 25 basis points in interest rates, which was not passed on by AIB.  The meeting between the Government and bank resulted in the bank facing down the Government but two weeks later it reduced the interest rate by 25 basis points.  The bank knew the mortgage book was loss making at that time.  The Government faced down the bank and AIB reduced the rate by 25 basis points.  Since then, the ECB has reduced the interest rate on two occasions, amounting to 50 basis points, but AIB has not passed on reductions.  Instead, it has increased its interest rate by 50 basis points.  Is another showdown required between the Minister for Finance, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance and AIB?  Why did the bank reduce the rate in November 2011 when it was not of the opinion that it should reduce it and when it knew the mortgage books were loss making?</p>

          <p eId="para_579">The original decision was taken before my time.  I am not even sure if all the parties are here.  The question of why we are not doing it now and what will happen in the future is the most pertinent issue.  It involves sitting down as a senior group of people and working through, with the Department and with the troika, what is needed to bring a bank back to stability.  There are three things – one must be able to price products so that they are not at a loss, lower the cost of funding and significantly reduce the cost to the bank.  If we put that together in a strategy to bring us to profitability in 2014 and include our assumptions on our margins, it means we will not be reacting to variables of ECB rates.  In that sense, the reason for not making a decision in reaction to the ECB rate cut is that our arms-length commercial strategy to return to profitability, to attract investors and to return money to shareholders has been agreed between all parties.</p>

          <p eId="para_593">If the Deputy could refer us to someone following the pitch, that would be advantageous.  To give the committee the concise and explicit version of what we have just done in Asia, where we met investors at the IMF, and two weeks previously at the Merrill Lynch conference, the world of banking is structurally changing.  UBS, with 10,000 people, changed as a result of the regulatory consequences of old banking models.  Pay scales, business models are changing with Basle III and everything else is changing.  Analysts and those who examine these investments, from Canadian long-only to other short-term venture capital firms, are looking at a yield.  The highest value is a simple and transparent bank.  The comment has been made to us many times.  We will create a model of a bank that is a low-cost provider of a utility type service of payments and cash management, with strong SME capability.  It will primarily be a domestic bank, offering the most advanced technology to facilitate consumers banking when they want, how they want and what they want rather than having to come to the bank and queue up.  We have the technology.  The cost, ease-of-use and ubiquity of the technology for all products should be comparable to the disintermediation threat of PayPal and others coming across the Internet to compete in that space.  The cost-income ratio must be in the low 40s whereas banks today are in the high 40s and early to mid 50s.  It must be an incredibly efficient, low-cost model.  It must offer a simplified range of products.  We have a large number of mortgages, whereas it should be a handful of mortgages.  What will investors think of a bank with a stable market share, with a transparent and simple to understand balance sheet and products that are simple, a bank that is low-cost, high tech and is competitive in terms of ease of use of facilities with anything that is disintermediated, with a strong capital tier 1 ratio and a stable annuity yield of between 8% and 12%?</p>
          <p eId="para_594">If we can present that to investors, what will they think? Investors will think that is very attractive.</p>

          <p eId="para_602">It depends on the mortgage, including the duration.  As the Deputy will know, the loan to value ratio can vary and the amount of the mortgage can vary, depending on the person.  The cost to income ratio is the best way to look at it.  If one can create a low cost with sufficient margin that the cost to income ratio is in the low 40s, that allows one to generate that yield and that is what makes it attractive to investors.</p>

          <p eId="para_603">Therein lies my concern.  As we know, the mortgage crisis is escalating.  I refer to the bank talking to potential investors who will purchase into a forecasted cashflow that shows profit being made on what I call "negligent lending" - lending over 30 to 40 years, at 100% to 110% LTVs and multiples of earnings that were inappropriate.  What I am trying to work out is whether the bank is putting into the cashflows a margin which is shown on these loans, especially the ones given between 2002 and 2008, which will give a return on investment of potentially of 8% and 12% to investors.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">  I welcome the news the bank is considering investors coming into it but it must solve the problem of cost of funds and of negative equity and what I would consider a solution - a potential moratorium on profit-making on negligent lending.  I raised this subject with the Minister for Finance last week and have done so on a number of occasions in regard to the sale of the bank.  We have all known for more than over a year that it is going to do this but it is only a topic of debate now.  What will the bank do to tell the people that they were lent money in the most negligent format, that it got it wrong and that it will strip it back in any future profits it will make and in any sale which will ensue?</p>

          <p eId="para_605">In regard to what we are going to say to the customer, we understand and have a lot of sympathy with much of the difficulty people are incurring in their personal lives and the debts they have.  That goes from a small single home owner family to more complex people with businesses and buy-to-lets.  We have an obligation to understand what debt is sustainable.  That is at the heart of the issue - what is an affordable level of debt for those people and not what was the debt.  How do we address that with individuals?  In our restructuring plan, about which we talked, our intention is to address that with all of those people.  SMEs will be 100% tackled by the second quarter of 2013.  We are involved with 33,000 homes and are trying to cover that entire spectrum of distress in the same period.  Can we get answers for those people in distress and return them to a lifestyle that has affordability as a theme rather than distress?  That is the simple message.</p>

          <p eId="para_606">The very fact the bank is engaging with investors at a time when the number of people with distressed mortgages is rising would suggest to me that it cannot give an investor a true picture unless it is talking about the margins it will implement on mortgages.  Will there be some forgiveness in regard to the mortgages of people who were loaned money in the most negligent format?</p>

          <p eId="para_607">Are we putting a margin around those current lending products?  We are putting average assumptions around a portfolio, so we are not modelling current distress into margins for an investor.  That is absolutely not the case.  We are assuming we can solve our distress issues and rebuild a stable and normal bank and we are offering that as a proposition to investors.  It is a very different issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">  In regard to the distress in mortgages today, we are looking at all debt, and not just mortgages on their own, and at the sustainability of that debt.  We are being explicit about the difference.  There will not be debt forgiveness.  Maybe this is semantics for some people but it is a hugely important issue.  There will be debt restructuring where there is compromise on both sides at the end of a process of discussion.  As I said, there are three parts to this.  We will immediate try to stabilise.  The reality is we are all human beings and people are lying awake at night in distress.  We will stabilise the situation to prevent that from becoming another problem.  We will identify what is a sustainable amount of debt.  Both parties, following discussion, will decide the amount of debt that is affordable.  We will deal with and address the rest of that debt and, in most cases, do some structural write off.  Those are the challenges we face and the actions we will take.</p>

          <p eId="para_609">In essence, that means rather than a debt write down, there will be a margin moratorium for people.  That is one way to look at it.  I would like to ask Mr. Murphy about cost of funds.  He expressed an interest in trying to sell the bank with a view to potentially different elements of funding for the bank coming about - wholesale deposits, etc.  What could happen if we sell the bank and how low should interest and cost of funds go?</p>

          <p eId="para_610">We do not know who that investor might be at this stage, so much would depend on the investor, the investor's individual ratings, etc.  In regard to what Mr. Duffy said earlier, we are looking to build a bank that can stand up in its own right based on what we can control right now.  Whatever comes around the corner in terms of ESM, investors or whatever is just that.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">  At the moment, the funding costs to the bank are about 3%.  They are unsustainably high given that there is an ECB rate of 0.75%.  We have brought deposit rates down by about 1% during the course of this year, so we are on a glide path to bring those deposit levels, which will be the lifeblood of the new core bank, down to levels where they should be.  As the Deputy knows, they have been artificially high.  </p>
          <p eId="para_612">  With all the stakeholders, we will also look at removing the eligible liabilities guarantee at a point in time that is appropriate for the system.  There is a significant cost to the bank on an annual basis for the eligible liabilities guarantee.  It is about 43 basis points off the net interest margin of the bank on an annual basis.  If we want to bring a viable and sustainable bank to an investor going forward, we will have to have a net interest margin of 1.5 plus.  Taking 43 basis points off that before one starts is a difficult thing to do.  Our net interest margin at the moment is in the mid 80s after the ELG cost.  We are planning to bring deposit pricing down and to look at removing the ELG at the right time.  Then one starts to get the liability side of one's balance sheet in shape.</p>

          <p eId="para_622">AIB might be what people consider to be the bank of the moment but to me it should be PIB - popped up Irish bank.  The level of damage that has been done to the brand in rural areas, where it has closed branches, is incredible.  It has not told people why it has had to do this.  As someone with some banking experience, if one looks at some of those bank branches as stand-alone entities, they would be profitable.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">None of them provided moneys for apartment blocks in Ballsbridge, contracts for difference or anything else like that. They were involved in agricultural loans, simple things like car finance and some mortgages. Can the witnesses explain to the people of Ireland why AIB closed those banks? Will they do anything to redress the imbalance that exists in rural Ireland now? The bank was the fulcrum of society. Shops, petrol stations and small retailers will feel the effects of this move. I would like to hear the witnesses' socioeconomic analysis of what this is all about.</p>

It reflected the demographic changes that have taken place at many of these locations over a long period of time.

          <p eId="para_627">Almost 90% of all transactions take place away from the branch.  Clearly, that was not the case when those branches were set up.  Notwithstanding any anecdotal evidence one might hear, the volume of activity that goes through those branches is tiny by comparison with what it was when they were originally set up.  The specific locations we chose had the lowest levels of activity and served areas that could be served in other ways.  The committee may be aware that we have four mobile banks which are serving most of the locations that have been disenfranchised as a result of this measure.  We also have an arrangement in place with An Post to ensure anyone can carry out lodgments, which was a key issue for people with cheque lodgments.  At each location where we have closed a branch, An Post has been enabled to accept cheque lodgments in post offices.  It was already able to take cash lodgments and provide cash services.  The new facilitation, which involves cheque lodgments, was launched at the exact same point in time.  In many locations that have lost a branch, two or three locations in the surrounding region have been enabled from a post office point of view.  Clearly, there has been a change in how the service is being offered.  We know that is difficult.  It was simply not possible for us to continue to provide this social service in the context of the imperative to become viable.  We had to do something to address the cost base.  We believe we have enabled people to continue to avail of banking services through our on-line and remote offerings, through what is happening in An Post and through the mobile banks I have mentioned.  That is a quick attempt at an answer at this point.</p>

          <p eId="para_629">I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  I am still trying to work my way through this substantial amount of information.  Our view is that we need write-downs because forbearance, restructuring and the various models the bank is developing or has put in place are not enough to deal with the issue of mortgage arrears.  The witnesses have made it clear that write-downs are not on the agenda.  Can they justify that position?  The figures we have been given, which show that the bank is getting an additional 1,400 requests for forbearance each month, indicate that the mortgage crisis is getting worse.  More and more people are encountering trouble and asking for help.  Although many people are already in trouble and the crisis is getting worse, we are continuing to approach this problem on a piecemeal basis rather than looking for a radical solution that could take this albatross from around people's necks, get them out of trouble and boost the economy.  We all know that the level of mortgage distress is operating as a huge macroeconomic dampener on the economy.  Can the witnesses tell me why it is better to take a piecemeal individual approach, involving restructuring and forbearance, than to adopt our approach of writing down to current market value the unsustainable debt that was incurred during the period of the property boom caused by developers and banks?  If our approach was pursued, how much would it cost?  On the basis of the bank's figures - we have been told that the volume of negative equity is approximately €6.8 billion and that €1.9 billion of that is currently impaired - I estimate that the additional cost of writing down the negative equity would be approximately €5 billion.  Is it not the case that the bank has been recapitalised to do that?  The Irish banks are probably among the most recapitalised institutions in Europe.  Why can this not just be done?  It would help distressed mortgage holders and the economy at the same time.  If we string it out, it will act as a continuous burden on people in an unsustainable situation and damage the prospects for economic recovery.</p>

          <p eId="para_630">The Deputy has asked a number of questions.  I will make an initial comment before I ask my colleague, Mr. Murphy, to do likewise.  I should mention, in order to be balanced, that we are looking at the totality of unsustainable debt, including mortgages, SMEs, buy-to-lets, commercial real estate and unsecured debt.  All of those elements, taken together, comprise the debt burden that society has.  It is not just one asset class.  In the context of our addressing of the totality of the debt, we are figuring out how to reduce the burden, what is sustainable in the eyes of our customers and feasible in terms of repayment over a continuum, and what is unsustainable in the manner suggested by the Deputy.  We will then consider whether that can be addressed by writing some of the debt off.  It has been suggested that we are not looking at any write-downs, but in fact we are.  We are doing so in the context of all the asset classes of debt, rather than just one.  I ask Mr. Murphy to comment on the specific issue of the cost of the alternative approach the Deputy is advocating.</p>

          <p eId="para_631">The most important thing we are trying to do is move away from the concept of negative equity and towards the concept of affordability.  Much of what we are doing is being done with the intention of driving it in that way.  The Deputy correctly mentioned that the negative equity on AIB's mortgage book is €6.8 billion.  Under the prudential capital assessment review, we have provisions of €2.8 billion in place for that book.  We have also made provision for other asset classes and books, etc.  It would be irresponsible of AIB, as a Government-owned bank that has been recapitalised by the taxpayer, to approach the mortgage arrears and default problem that is being experienced by the bank and the country by writing off all negative equity overnight.  It is not a solution for the country.  As Mr. Duffy and I have already said, we need to get people into restructured loans that they can afford, if at all possible.  Between 69% and 70% of our 33,700 customers who are in forbearance are affording the new restructured loans we have put them into.  This approach is working, in the main.  It is obvious that there are problems with between 25% and 30% of the customers in question.  That is why the banks have been initiating advanced forbearance under the supervision of the Central Bank over the past year.  We are trying to restructure these customers' loans in a deeper way to see whether we can get them onto a sustainable path again.  That is the approach.  It relates to affordability rather than to negative equity.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2012-10-31T16:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_632">I reject the argument that by coming to an arrangement with people that enables them to just about manage, AIB is somehow offering a solution to the damage to the economy that is being caused by the fact that so many people are in mortgage distress.  I understand the logic of AIB's point of view, but I do not understand its rationale from the point of view of the economy as a whole.  Even if an arrangement is reached that allows people to just about manage, as long as they are continuing to pay off the inflated mortgages that resulted from the property madness, they will be limping along for many years to come and therefore will not be able to contribute substantially to the restoration of economic demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">I do not accept that is the case. Furthermore, I put it to AIB that given it is getting more requests for forbearance - 1,400 extra requests - the situation continues to worsen and deteriorate. It is obvious we need more radical solutions. AIB asserted in its response that this is not the answer for the economy. I cannot see what evidence it as for that assertion, given there is no evidence the current approach being pursued is getting us out of the crisis with anything like the urgency we need, both for the householders involved and the wider economy, where demand continues to be strangled by this debt burden.</p>

          <p eId="para_634">Unemployment has stabilised, house prices have stabilised and the monthly increase in defaults in the banks has been reducing month on month for nine months.  We are beginning to see an inflection point in the economy, where, hopefully, the worst has passed and the economy continues to stabilise.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">  We will contact 1,500 customers per month in the coming months to restructure their mortgages in a deep restructuring called advanced forbearance, using products like split mortgages, where we try to put the customer into a sustainable cash flow pattern on mortgage part A and warehouse, at zero interest to the customer, the second part of the loan, for the foreseeable future.  In this process we will link in with the customers on a regular basis to see how they are getting on.  Where people are unemployed currently, hopefully they will be employed in the future so that where one person of a couple was working, there will be two.  People will receive salary increases or promotion and the economy will grow.  This is a medium term solution we need to work through as there is no short term solution that will make the problem disappear overnight.</p>

          <p eId="para_636">We will agree to disagree.  Obviously, this is also a Government policy matter, but it is also Government policy to allow AIB the freedom to make these decisions.  I believe AIB is making the wrong decisions, because unless we get radical debt write-down, we will continue to bump along the bottom.  I believe AIB is failing to grasp the significant influence it has on whether we will have the recovery AIB hopes will arrive magically.  AIB is part of the solution or the problem in the context of producing the recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">  To what extent is AIB policy in this regard connected to the fact that its objective is to resell the bank and make it attractive to private investors?  I see this as part of the problem and see these two issues as connected.  In so far as AIB has responded - not sufficiently in my opinion - to some public pressure in terms of how it operates and its willingness to pass on ECB interest reductions, that has to do with the fact AIB is now in public ownership and more subject to public pressure.  However, in the opinion of many, AIB is not responding fast enough or significantly enough to that public pressure and this has to do with the fact AIB is trying to make itself attractive to private investors.  Is that a reasonable assumption?</p>

          <p eId="para_641">My final question concerns the land and development and investment property loans of AIB, which are a significant part of its loan portfolio and impaired loans.  In fact, they comprise a larger portion of the impaired loans than residential property loans.  What is going on with regard to these loans?  Tell us more about them and what is happening with them.

I would not characterise needing to create private investors in the bank to return taxpayers' money as a sole purpose.  We are in a position where we must have capital at a minimum level for regulatory purposes.  On top of that, we must have capital for restructuring when we do write-offs, because what happens is capital is destroyed then.  We must also have capital for growth.</p>

There is €7 billion in that portfolio and some €5.7 billion of that is in impaired loans, which is indicative of the quality and locations of those properties.  Some 71% of those impaired loans are provided against.  A large part of that portfolio comprised elements that were to go to NAMA, but a threshold level of €20 million was introduced so they remained on the bank's balance sheet.

It is interesting to listen to the discourse here and to hear the different terms used.

Whether products or options, one of the issues at both business and individual level is that many people invested in property and now find themselves ruined as a result.</p>

We look at the total debt of the customer and try to take a holistic view of all of the debt.  The property often comprises an owner occupier primary domestic dwelling, an SME, buy-to-let properties, tax loans, car loans etc.  We look at bundling all of that together and prioritising how we manage it, with a view to bringing the customer again into a repayment plan that works for the customer.  Therefore, we break their loans into three, an A a B and a C part.  The C part is a stretched target that may not be doable for the customer.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">Through time, depending on the performance of the other loans, we look at the possibility of compromising on that. Therefore, we are trying to segregate our book in the way suggested.</p>

          <p eId="para_664">Moving on to specific operational matters, I submitted a parliamentary question recently relating to the rent-to-buy programme and the response was interesting.  It stated that more than 60 cases were currently being processed under the mortgage to rent scheme, that one case had been fully concluded and a further eight were expected to conclude shortly.  Anecdotal information I have got is that it is the sub-prime lenders who are engaging better with this scheme rather than the pillar banks.  From what I know, the only one of these cases that has gone over the line and converted from mortgage to rent has been with a sub-prime lender.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">  This brings me to Ms Muldoon's comments earlier this evening accusing the banks of being in denial.  If this is the case, it means the sub-prime lenders are not in denial, but are dealing with the reality of the market, but that the pillar banks are resisting and still have difficulty with regard to the real value of residential property.  How many cases involving moving from mortgage to rent is AIB considering currently and how many of these does it expect to conclude over the coming period?</p>

          <p eId="para_695">In Mr. Byrne's estimation there are 40,000 or 50,000 of these debit points.  Up to recently, these were rented on a monthly or weekly basis.  Therefore, if a business decided not to use them any more, they walked away from them.  However, from what I understand, AIB market banking has now engaged with a German company, First Data Global Leasing, and all of these machines are now on a two to three year lease to AIB customers.  Is that correct?  The accusation in the retail sector is that a scam is being played on them and that is the issue I would like to deal with this afternoon.  There is a strong accusation being made that by sleight of hand many retailers who had machines last week and who signed the paper for them, thinking they were just conducting the normal transaction, found they were no longer in a rental agreement that could be cancelled easily but had moved into a two or three year lease agreement.  In the event of their business closing, they find they are locked into a three year lease agreement on the machine.  The business could go to the wall, but the company owner would still have to pay for the use of the machine.  Can we have some more information on that?</p>

          <p eId="para_699">I would like to emphasise for AIB that businesses are struggling on a week-to-week basis and in terms of cash flow are counting the lodgment they make to this on a week to week basis.  If they had to close in the morning, they would have an exposure of several thousand euro for these machines for another two or three years, even though no longer trading.  This indicates a poor level of practice on the part of AIB.  Many of these businesses did not realise that when they converted to First Data Global Leasing, they were entering a contract of a long-term leasing arrangement.  Up to then, they were engaged in a month-to-month rental with AIB merchant banking.</p>

          <from>Deputy Liam Twomey<recordedTime time="2012-10-31T16:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_704">It has been interesting listening to the contributions made today and to hear that the AIB team is holding board meetings at branches throughout the country and actively seeking face-to-face meetings with customers.  This is all very positive and it is good to hear staff in both loan and asset management are being retrained.  These initiatives and others mentioned here this afternoon give the impression AIB is actually rebuilding the bank, almost from the ground up.  Clearly, some huge problems were discovered when this team took over at AIB.  If it is the situation that significant internal restructuring is being undertaken and that the team must go right to the ground level to do that, is it not a bit premature to talk about getting investors, particularly if there are structural problems and problems with loan management to be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">  One of the issues discussed here, tracker mortgages, which amount to approximately €20 billion, make up a sizeable proportion of the existing loans.  These will be loss makers for a number of years, not to mention the buy to let loans, which are significant loss makers.  Also, there is €5.7 billion of impaired speculative loans, mainly land.  Almost €5 billion of that amount could be written off as there has been discounting of up to 90% on that type of loan.  That is another €5 billion loss, before we even start drilling down into the issue of arrears.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">The bank is facing huge problems, yet the delegates are talking about seeking to attract investors, almost like they are preparing for a sale. I wonder whether that is a little premature.</p>
          <p eId="para_707"> The delegates spoke about building sustainable profits and balancing competing interests. On the one hand there is the shareholder interest, which is our interest because the taxpayer is heavily involved. On the other hand, however, is the debt restructuring issue and the need for some type of solution for small and medium-sized businesses and householders in serious arrears. The delegates spoke a great deal about restructuring, but the question that arises in this regard is why there is such resistance to debt forgiveness. Is it because the bank is of the view that there is no capacity within the system at this time to engage in a process of examining customers' debts, assets and income with a view possibly to writing off at least a portion of their debt? Or is it simply the case that there is a general policy of opposition to debt forgiveness in any form across all the banks? Going from what we heard from the IBRC delegates this morning and on previous occasions from representatives of other banks, one might conclude that the latter is the case and that there is a collective strong resistance to any write-off of debt. It is one of the issues that is constantly raised with public representatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_708"> The other major issue we are hearing about is the difficulty of obtaining loans. In fact, what we are hearing outside these Houses does not correspond to what the delegates are saying in this meeting today. Every time I speak to people at events, particularly business events, I hear very detailed stories about how they were refused a loan. There is a need to clarify what is happening in this regard. </p>
          <p eId="para_709"> I conclude by voicing my appreciation to Mr. Duffy for making himself and his team so accessible to us. That is a very positive development and it allows us to redirect queries to them with ease. </p>

          <p eId="para_711">Deputy Twomey's first question was whether, given the scale of what we have to achieve, it is premature to talk about attracting investors.  To be explicit on this point, there will be no investors really soon.  What we are saying is that investors look at the evolution of a bank, and some might wish to come in earlier in that evolution where they see the price of entry being cheaper and the potential for profiting as things improve.  Other investors might choose to become involved at a later stage.  We are not targeting investors for a price but rather for trust and confidence.  Our view is that it is never too early to start building trust and credibility with all classes of investors.  We do not have to accept anybody's offer at any time.  It is not a matter of rushing to sell; it is about the Government making the decision on price and us preparing the ground as well and as thoroughly as we can in anticipation of investors of all types possibly engaging in a debate.  It is a question of balance.  We are seeking to build the credibility necessary to create that option and it is then at our discretion, collectively with the Government, as to when the choice is taken to exercise that option.  That is the nature of what we are trying to do.  We recognise fully the many challenges we are facing in this regard.  However, many investors are not put off by the severity of the challenges facing the world of banking.  In fact, many are of the view that Ireland as an economy and the bank as a link to the sovereign are among the first to emerge out of the chaos of recent years.  That possibly makes us an attractive investment prospect and we will do whatever we can do to encourage people to think about us in that way.  Timing and price, however, are a Government issue and we will not seek to influence that.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">  On the question of whether there is a reluctance to consider debt forgiveness, it is important, first, to ensure that we are all talking about the same thing when we have this discussion.  In particular, it is important to recognise the difference between debt forgiveness and debt restructuring, which includes write-offs.  The phrase "debt forgiveness" suggests to us the notion that debt can somehow be magically waived.  However, the moral hazard and the absolute inequity of those types of decisions places one on very dangerous territory given the reality that lots of people are paying their debts.  The question would immediately arise as to why one person's obligations should be waived simply because he or she made a bad decision which another person, who is not receiving any benefit, did not.  When we say that debt forgiveness is not a policy we are supportive of, that is the reason.  Blanket forgiveness without regard to the moral hazard and inequity of unbalanced dealings with different people in different situations is not a solution that works.  What we are saying is that we are working on the principle of affordability, as Mr. Murphy mentioned.  We seek to address, on an individual basis, what is sustainable debt and what people can afford within the mix.  In such circumstances, the bank does look at write-offs of debt.  That is the approach we are taking rather than simply blanket forgiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">  The third issue the Deputy raised related to the difficulty in securing loans.  There is an evolution going on here and our primary obligation in this is education.  We have to get out in the marketplace, which is why we are doing what we are doing.  For example, we are saying to members of the committee that if a person approaches them with a problem, they should pass the details on and we will try to assist.  We have engaged with local radio, arranged meetings in town halls and so on in an effort to get our message out.  It is a matter of putting feet on the ground throughout the country in order to identify where problems are arising.  In recent months I have seen thousands of SME owners, including 30 CEOs in one go.  I have seen SME owners in large groupings and I have seen individual customers.  On each occasion I put some very simple questions to those sitting in front of me.  When I asked, for instance, who in the room wanted more debt, no hands were raised.  On the other hand, when I asked who was seeking restructuring or equity, a lot of hands went up.  The reality is that there are pockets of the economy that are doing very well, including the agri sector and others, where there is a requirement for more debt.  We must, however, be very careful and responsible about pushing more debt onto those who are already too heavily indebted and who should instead be offered other solutions.  We are seeing a low-demand domestic economy.  In our view, there is a need for equity, as well as restructuring, in that low-demand economy to balance out the absolute burden of debt.</p>

We have seen the monthly increase in arrears on our mortgage book slowing down month on month for nine months.  We took on board the fact that consumer demand for next year is slightly better than this year.  Retail sales, consumer confidence indicators and so on are other factors we have considered.

          <p eId="para_718">Deputy Twomey referred to the issue of fundamentally reshaping and restructuring the bank.  Twelve months ago we would have said that we had three priorities, namely, deposits, mortgages and SMEs, and we have spent a lot of time reforming and reshaping those processes.  We have been very successful on the deposit side.  As Mr. Murphy outlined, we have been very successful in reforming and reshaping the mortgage process so that people feel confident that they can submit an application and get a response.  We are doing a lot of work at this time on the SME issue.  It is a much trickier matter which requires a whole ecosystem in which people have the confidence that they can approach the bank and have a reasonable chance of getting the right answer from it.  We are doing our piece in this regard through initiatives such as SME seminars.  In conjunction with ActionCOACH, we have initiated a scheme whereby SME owners who attend out seminars can be allocated a third-party coach who will go into their business for one day to assist them.  We are providing the funding for that for 3,000 businesses.  It is all about seeking to instil confidence that it is okay to make an application for a business loan.</p>

          <p eId="para_721">I will have to do a little bit of thinking and revert to Deputy Higgins with the exact numbers.  In my own case, as a top executive I came in on the cap.  I took a decision with the senior executives to make a proposal to the board to reduce our pay by 15%, which we did, and that has been implemented.  All of those executives have lost all benefits associated with it and pensions have also been cut and discounted severely.  As we mentioned earlier, the defined benefit plan closed and instead, there are lower levels of contribution on a defined contributions plan.  We have been implementing cuts not only at our level but throughout all levels of the organisation.  There have been cuts of 10% at lower levels and, as we got to the lowest levels of the organisation, we felt it was inappropriate to impose cuts and instigated pay freezes.  Within the context of the overall expense of the organisation, which is the broader issue with which we concern ourselves, we have looked at tackling the absolute cost of people.  We have been able to reduce the number of people in receipt of more than €100,000 by 40%, and where there were a certain number receiving more than €200,000, we have taken that down by 60%.  While we still have plenty of work to do, we think it is appropriate to rebalance the cost equation in the bank and consequently, we started with the executive.  Even though I came in on the salary cap and others came in on less than the cap, we all accepted, on foot of our own proposal, a 15% cut in our compensation.  We then thought the entire bank needed to take some pain, which we did, after which we thought that the absolute number of people on higher salary levels needed to be reduced materially, and it has been.  I am not saying our work is complete but we recognise that level of adjustment is the first phase of adjustment that is required in the bank.</p>

Moreover, my first reaction, when considering the severity of the situation, was to volunteer to cut the salaries of myself and the other senior executives by 15% for starters.  That is what we did, and on top of that we addressed benefits and other issues of potential pensions etc.  From the perspective of what people get in the organisation and in the community and what skills one gets for that, I was willing to take it at that level and was willing to take those cuts and show leadership in that respect.</p>

          <p eId="para_728">With regard to lending to small and medium enterprises, I wish to approach this from a different angle.  I gather, from reading the international financial press in recent months - that is, the <i>Financial Times</i>, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> and so on - that essentially, as far as investment is concerned, capitalism in the eurozone is in a state of paralysis.  The figures that were given indicated the percentage of investment to gross domestic product is at a 60-year low within the eurozone, with a figure of €2 trillion in uninvested profits by big business sitting in banks and financial institutions.  I have seen a figure for Ireland, which I cannot source precisely, of perhaps €32 billion of uninvested profits within a short period.  Does AIB find substantial corporate funds resting in its accounts that are not going into productive use - that is, towards investment, job creation and so on - considering that the number of unemployed within the European Union is 25 million?  Can the witnesses see this phenomenon here at a local level?</p>

          <p eId="para_729">I will make a comment before handing over to Mr. Fergus Murphy, who deals with our deposit book.  I am not seeing a trend of a large build-up of cash deposits.  I am seeing, within the Irish dimension, a very active and aggressively growing foreign direct investment universe.  Consequently, when people talk about investment levels, we are seeing a very strong investment in Ireland in technology and other sectors, which we support.  However, with regard to actual deposits on the books that are being used, I am unsure whether Mr. Murphy has seen anything.</p>

          <p eId="para_730">No, not in AIB.  We are rehabilitating our deposit book and are beginning to get deposits back.  In the year to date, we are doing well in respect of our deposit gathering.  As for large corporate deposits, we prefer retail deposits, but we have some large Irish corporate deposits.  Globally, however, I note that corporates are doing very well.  The balance sheets of large corporates around the world are very strong and globally, they have a lot of cash.  They have had strong strategies, good mergers and acquisitions activities and good markets for many years.  It is ironic that while banks globally are struggling hugely, many large corporates, which may be what are being referred to in the <i>Financial Times</i> and <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, are in very strong positions with their balance sheets.</p>

          <p eId="para_731">They must be going elsewhere, then, to deposit the uninvested cash.  As for foreign direct investment, it is fine and obviously is an important part of the economy, but it is the domestic economy here that is getting hammered.  This is the reason lending to small and medium-sized enterprises is so important.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">  To move on quickly, a return to profitability by 2014 has been raised with Mr. Duffy.  Why the obsession with the re-privatisation of Allied Irish Banks?  If AIB returns to a position in which it is carrying out its business in a socially responsible way and then makes a profit as well, why not keep the bank in public ownership?  Why hand it back to the types of entity that wrecked it in the first place?</p>

          <p eId="para_733">I was not planning to hand it back to anyone to wreck and it is not my decision to hand it back to anybody.  My objective and strategy, as agreed with the Government and the troika, is to return it to stability for the purpose of lending in the economy, generating enough capital to support restructuring and, ultimately, being a high-performance bank or, at a minimum, a well-performing bank that would therefore be attractive to investors.  This decision therefore is for others to make.  Our primary purpose is to build a bank that returns shareholder value based on investments and to make it attractive enough for that and to lend into the economy, as well as to provide capital for restructuring.  If we simply continue with our current model of selling products at prices that are loss-making, that will be another huge burden for the taxpayer when we actually do not survive.</p>

          <p eId="para_734">It is a Government policy anyway.  For my last question, I will return to the matter of mortgages for owner-occupiers, not buy-to-let investors or speculators or all the rest of it.  Mr. Duffy has set his face quite categorically against what he calls debt forgiveness.  What will be his approach to the provisions of the Personal Insolvency Bill when it is enacted?</p>
          <p eId="para_735">  Second, in his earlier response, Mr. Duffy stated he would not magically wave away negative equity.  I put it to Mr. Duffy and to Mr. Murphy that this is a moral issue, in that there was a young generation of Irish workers who, during the bubble, were blackmailed due to the grip financial speculators and developers had on the housing market.  If such people wanted a home for a family or whatever, they had no option but to go for the extortionate prices, the 40-year mortgages and all the rest of it.  That generation is now stranded, and I put it to the witnesses that there is a moral issue in this regard.  While it pertains to society and not simply to the bank, as an important player therein, does the bank not have a moral responsibility to try to unwind this injustice that was done?  I put it to the witnesses that there would be huge merit in having an across-the-board scheme of reducing the crazy prices for which homes were bought down to the current value and calibrating the monthly payments downwards accordingly.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">That would relieve enormous stress and it would also perhaps release some billions of euro into the domestic economy to try to revive it. So why does Mr. Duffy not entertain that idea more seriously by discussing it and putting it on the agenda? </p>

          <p eId="para_739">As citizens we can all empathise and sympathise with what happened to a generation of people buying homes during the Celtic tiger period.  I am sorry to repeat myself, but the most important thing is affordability rather than negative equity.  We will have a range of supports and products that will help people who want to trade up or down.  We are rolling out those products and services.  However, as regards the earlier answer, we cannot enable an overnight solution to this problem.  Mortgages are a long-term product and there will be a medium-term work-out through this crisis.</p>

          <p eId="para_740">I will make one final comment on that.  We have to be very careful in all of our solutions that we look to the entire population in this country.  Solutions which are designed to forgive debt and erase problems for just one section represent very inequitable treatment of the rest of the population.  In our case, 85% to 90% of our people are repaying mortgages.  It is the residual population that we are trying to address and even of those, 70% on interest rate repayments are paying their mortgages back.  I am sure some of us have been in negative equity, which does not mean mortgage distress.  At the end of the day, as a bank we are not capitalised to try to solve negative equity on a macro basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_749">The sum of €20 billion is just slightly less than the Department of Social Protection's budget, and is about two thirds of our annual tax take.  The money was given to AIB on the proviso that it would bring about lending in the real economy.  I have spent the greater part of my adult life working with SMEs, but AIB is not lending to SMEs.  I have as many of them coming to me now as I had in practice.  The reason AIB is not lending to SMEs is that while there is new lending, a lot of restructuring is converting overdrafts to term loans.  The SMEs are not able to function in business because effectively they do not have an adequate supply of working capital.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">  My view was that AIB had a part to play.  The bank has to restructure but I thought that we were all in this together and that it was not a case of AIB seeking to repair its balance sheet.  The mortgage sector and restructuring have been referred to but I am talking specifically about the real economy.  I am talking about SMEs that may employ two or three people.  They are unable to expand, as they have been explaining to me.  AIB was a very aggressive bank over the years and that was shown up particularly in the DIRT inquiry.  The bank has ridden very much to the forefront.  I would like to see AIB riding to the forefront in SME lending.  Mr. Duffy has made points but the figures do not reflect what we are getting from punters on the ground.  The Acting Chairman referred to the fact that we are dealing with local businesses. </p>
          <p eId="para_751">  If someone's overdraft is restructured into a term loan with no overdraft facility, it is like to asking them to drive with the handbrake on.  The car cannot function.  The SME sector is vital to this economy.  AIB has €20 billion of taxpayers' money on loan, so there should be some reciprocity.  AIB appears to be very risk adverse, which I understand given the necessity to repair the bank's balance sheet.  However, can Mr. Duffy explain why only a quarter of the €3.5 billion annually is going to new lending?</p>

          <p eId="para_754">We are very happy to have a robust debate; it is entirely fair to do so.  Every week I am somewhere in this country and there is a robust debate - perhaps not even a debate but a lecture.  That is part of  learning how to do this better and we accept that.  There is a range of initiatives in our documents about trying to do it better.  We are now moving into local radio and local TV.</p>
          <p eId="para_755"><b>Deputy Kieran O'Donnell:</b> I know all that but my time is so limited.  Will Mr. Duffy deal with the €600 million as a proportion of €3.5 billion and explain why that is so low?</p>

          <p eId="para_756">Let us do that.  The first comment I will make - and then Mr. Byrne will follow - is that there is a demand equation.  It is constantly said to us that we are not lending, but if we do not lend the bank will be bankrupted again.  Let us be explicit.  SMEs are a core part of our business, so unless we are lending there is no point in us being here.  We will not be here.  I do not understand this equation half the time because we are constantly asking the question ourselves in the field and are told that those concerned do not want more debt, they want restructuring.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">  As regards the Deputy's specific question, that is one of the concerns I have.  Is everybody saying they want something but not applying, or are we not encouraging them enough?  We all need to get better at that to make it work.  I am making the offer absolutely and have done for six months now.  One meets a person, whatever their name is, and all I need is a telephone number and we will get in touch.</p>

In Cork there are only seven branches closing, or 18% of the network, while in Dublin the figure is 11% and in Galway, 13%. Why is the figure in Limerick so high at 44%?

          <from>Deputy Peter Mathews<recordedTime time="2012-10-31T17:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_778">I thank the delegation for its presentation.  We have heard much about pockets of the forest, but I want to look at the overview of it.  The balance sheet of any business tells us an awful lot if we ask the right questions.  In December 2007 Bank Zachodni-WBK, BZ-WBK, was consolidated into the balance sheet but not EBS.  After the then Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan, announced the NAMA model, I examined the balance sheets of the six banks.  I noted that staff levels at AIB were 25,000, but 10,000 of them were in BZ-WBK.  The average salary in the AIB Group was €10,000 less than that in the Bank of Ireland Group.  This can be explained by the fact that average salaries in the Polish bank are low compared to those of home and English-based employees.  The capital injection was €20.7 billion and the aim is to get the bank to sustainable profitability and develop a model to attract investors to rehabilitate the bank.  AIB offers one of the lowest standard variable rates, SVR, at 4%, in the market.  The sensible level would be 5% to 6% when one factors in the costs of operating a long-term mortgage book and risks.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">  There are bits missing from the balance sheet provided by AIB.  Shareholders’ funds are listed at €13 billion, while customer deposits come to €64 billion.  That gives a subtotal of €77 billion.  The balance sheet states the bank’s total assets come to €130 billion.  What do the European Central Bank, ECB, and other interbank advances come to?  The balance sheet lists other assets at €50 billion.  What are these assets?  It must be remembered that loans for buy-to-let properties or land speculation may be worse than we think.  Perhaps mortgages will suffer another tsunami.  This means the €80 billion net needs further provision.  Perhaps we should start doing surgery rather than with provision.  It is time to recalibrate loans through debt restructuring rather than debt forgiveness.  Independent News and Media, for example, has had to restructure its debt and it did not leave creditors hanging.  We need creditor buy-in in the banking system, which must be done by the Central Bank and the ECB.  We do not necessarily have to wait for the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, to be set up, with its banking supervision function.  We need a creditor to step into the shoes of the bond investors in AIB in the same way that was done with Anglo Irish Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">  There is still much confusion about the €25 billion estimate for the loans embedded in Anglo Irish Bank.  Irish Bank Resolution Corporation’s loan losses are reduced by the drip feed of income from the promissory note which comes to €18 billion in interest.  That is a liquid asset being injected into the bank’s balance sheet at intervals to pay off the emergency liquidity assistance, ELA, provided.  The ELA was the originating cause because it was needed to redeem the bond investors in full to save the euro.  If one adds the income of €18 billion plus the embedded losses of €25 billion, it comes to a loss of €43 billion.  Depending on how much interest comes into the IBRC by way of the promissory note, it adds to the estimated losses of €25 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_781"> I am concerned about investors in the buy-to-let market not those who came in on the last wave but those who genuinely built up investment property portfolios and managed them in a professional way, letting them to answer a demand for accommodation in city markets. The interest on their carrying loans in their portfolios is now being restricted by the Department of Finance in terms of its allowability as an expense to be deducted from rental income for income tax assessment purposes. That is another timebomb because that interest restriction is actually growing. It should be reversed if we want to save that category of investor. It is not a question of a free lunch but one of survival. I urge the bank to raise the matter in its pre-budget submission to the Government. I asked representatives from the IBRC to do the same this morning. </p>

          <p eId="para_794">I will make one final point on restructuring and loan rehabilitation on the books of AIB, the IBRC and NAMA.  AIB is doing a lot of work for NAMA and I am wondering if there are conflicts or competition issues.  Are staff leaving AIB to join the staff of potential buyers and investors of AIB's or NAMA's portfolio of loans?  AIB staff know what the provisions on the different loan cases are, which is important competitive information that could be useful to some of the investment funds coming into Ireland.  All of these issues are important.</p>

          <p eId="para_795">I thank the Chairman and Deputy Peter Mathews who has made very valid observations, some of which we discussed.  On the issue of NAMA conflicts, we take great care in that area, but the degree to which we can control it is limited.  We cannot dictate where someone goes to work, but we have not come across a problem to date.  It would be fair to say most people leaving banking want to take a break from it.  However, we will keep that point in mind and make sure there is a minimum ethical standard, which is critical to the future functioning of the bank.  We cannot tolerate any unethical behaviour or anything that might lead to the perception of such.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">  Regarding the Deputy's central theme on processing versus execution, we have built the capacity and have the technology and the provisions to do precisely that, namely, to restructure the absolute debt level in the organisation.  The rest of the issues on the balance sheet and the observations, with the exception of those made regarding the IBRC, on which I cannot comment, are noted and will be taken into consideration.  The same applies to the Deputy's point on the buy-to-let market.</p>

          <p eId="para_809">I welcome Mr. Duffy and his colleagues and thank them for their honest and open approach in trying to rebuild the business which has been tarnished as well as damaged.  I wish to corroborate what was said in that it is open to any of us to get in touch with AIB.  I did so and I am grateful because a case in south Kerry was solved to my satisfaction.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">  I accept what was said about staff.  I have dealt with AIB for a long time and know many of its staff.  I appreciate its difficulties in motivating them because morale is low.  However, I salute what Mr. Duffy and his team are trying to achieve.  Approximately 2,500 staff will leave, 1,700 of whom will have gone by the end of the year.  However, the bank is also taking on people, particularly new graduates.  </p>
          <p eId="para_811">  Mr. Duffy has said the bank is ahead in lending, but that seems to be in conflict with what we heard from Deputy Kieran O'Donnell.  I ask Mr. Duffy to clarify the point.  What does he mean by saying AIB is ahead in lending?  If I understood what was said correctly, 41% of SME loans have been or are being restructured.  Does this mean that 59% have yet to be restructured?  </p>
          <p eId="para_812">  If the bank is hiring new staff, one assumes they will need training.  I gather some of the new staff might be graduates and perhaps the bank might allow them to deal with the restructuring because the most important area on which the bank should focus is new lending.  I appreciate that we do not want to have more bad debts and that many people are reluctant to take on more debt, but there are genuine cases in which credit is needed.  It is very important that the right staff deal with such cases.  Coupled with this, I welcome what was said about the meetings in branches in Kilkenny and Cork.  There seems to be a slight drift of control of lending away from head office towards branches.  Is there a new authorisation or credit limit in operation or due to be put into operation for branch managers who know what the situation is locally?  That would be welcomed if it was so.  </p>
          <p eId="para_813">  I ask Mr. Duffy to answer my questions on lending and the hiring of staff.  Staff are employed on an agency basis for NAMA.  How many AIB staff are working full-time for NAMA, dealing with receivers and so forth?  What level of remuneration is the bank receiving from NAMA for such work?  </p>
          <p eId="para_814">  I loved what Mr. Duffy said about being back in profit by 2014.  We all hope that will be the case.  </p>
          <p eId="para_815">  Mr. Duffy dealt with the issue of a sale to foreign investors and I totally accept his answer.  He also spoke about the economy.  I ask him to give us his prediction as to when he expects us to return to growth.  We are all very interested in his answer.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">  I wish Mr. Duffy and AIB the very best.  We have a vested interest in AIB becoming profitable as soon as possible for the sake of the taxpayer, but we hope it will happen without people being screwed, if I may put it like that.</p>

          <p eId="para_817">I thank the Senator for his comments.  He raised a range of issues, the first of which concerned lending.  The main point is that bank branches need to have more autonomy and a greater ability to approve credit decisions.  They also need enhanced skill sets and capacity to be able to service their customers.  In response to the Senator's question, that is our objective.</p>

Some 41% of our SMEs are in the impaired category while 39% are in the satisfactory category and we do not expect them to impair.  Then the category in the middle is the watching vulnerable category.  While 41% have been worked through, we are carefully monitoring and minding this category because these businesses are weak at the moment.</p>

          <p eId="para_827">In many cases of restructuring a company might have a three year or five year term loan that expires.  We give that company a new term loan, that is, a new loan in terms of restructuring or a re-facilitation of that loan.  The restructuring activity is a separate financial solutions group activity and during the coming 12 or 24 months we expect to see significant progress made in terms of the restructuring of the SMEs in difficulty.</p>

          <p eId="para_828">I wish to be clear in support of Mr. Byrne's comments.  We will have fully engaged with and decided on a future strategy within six months in the case of all SMEs in difficulty.  At issue is the complexity of taking two years to achieve an end result.  We have engaged initially to stabilise but then we must develop a strategy together relating to buy-to-let, SMEs, the house, the in-laws and whatever other variations of transactions with which there is a good deal of connected debt.  Sometimes working this out, agreeing it and executing it takes several years.   To deal with them in a simple way in our minds we prioritise people staying within their homes and the associated multi-debt connection and we prioritise growth and stability in SMEs.  These are the two informed principles behind what we are trying to achieve.  We are trying to increase our lending but we must do debt restructuring sensibly to allow those companies to grow again.</p>

          <p eId="para_829">There have been several conversations back and forth today on the new lending versus the overall lending targets.  At no point in recent years has AIB changed the definition of what it considers to be the lending target agreed with the Government as part of the recapitalisation.  That was agreed and has been agreed and continues to be agreed with the Credit Review Office and the Department of Finance.  We do not see this as something new.  We have always included new lending, re-financing and restructuring in the figures reported as part of our lending targets.</p>

          <p eId="para_830">We serviced the assets we transferred to NAMA.  There are approximately 300 people in the organisation in our financial solutions group dedicated to the servicing of the NAMA assets.  Those are the exact numbers and there is between ten and 12 basis points as a fee.  That is the structure and the answer to that question.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">  A prediction was sought on the economy.  Mr. Fergus Murphy has done an outstanding job on that so far.  We see more pain to come in the domestic economy for a period.  This is the natural by-product of people de-leveraging their consumer spending and this follows through to the domestic SMEs.  This is why we are so focused on supporting those SMEs and restructuring those debts.  We are seeing positive signs in the agri-economy, where there is strong growth.  There is strong growth in the foreign direct investment universe including the employment aspect.  The average unemployment rates are beginning to stabilise and we are seeing pockets of positivity in the domestic real estate market.  Some of this is related to particular types of housing which have limited supply but some of it is linked to people believing that we are at or close to a bottom in terms of the housing market as well.  These are our observations at this stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_833">I tried to follow proceedings on the monitor when I was not here because I was involved in a different matter today.  I apologise if my questions have been asked already and if they have been the delegation can close me down.  Will AIB comment on the mis-selling of payment protection policies and the associated Central Bank investigation?  How many AIB customers were involved and what is the total cost to the bank?</p>
          <p eId="para_834">  The Chairman raised the issue of payment processing services.  It seems that as we are entering a cashless society many small businesses will be put severely at risk because the costs of having the machines is prohibitive in the first place.  Generally my barber or the dry cleaners cannot take a Laser card.  Unless a business is a high volume cash shop such as a newsagent or grocery it will not be able to take them.  The local farm shop will not take them.  Swipe cards are being introduced with a value of under €15.  Businesses that depend on such transactions will be at a severe disadvantage because they do not have the machines.  It would be a help to small businesses if the costs were reduced.   I realise this is not only a matter for AIB.  There are various companies involved in this area and I understand AIB is involved in a joint venture, but it seems to be a major issue and it will get worse for these businesses as the take-up of these swipe cards becomes more widespread.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">  The standard financial statement for mortgages comes from the Central Bank requirement.   It seems to be the most extensive means test conducted by anyone in this country.  It is more extensive that the medical card or social welfare means test.  A social welfare means test does not take account of expenditure, only one's income.  The medical card uses three or four items of expenditure as a way of reducing one's income for the purposes of getting a medical card but the standard financial statement goes into remarkable detail in respect of expenditure going out.  It seems to be a burden on the banks and it give the banks a bad name because people have no wish to be dealing with the banks, especially when someone has a bad experience and it gets out.  The process could be dramatically simplified.  We could have standard levels of income or percentages of income to correspond to a mortgage.  A mortgage could be no more than 30% or 35% of one's gross or net income, whatever way it works out.  Does AIB foresee any difficulty with that or does it wish to see this changed?  Is this a burden on the bank?  It is humiliating for people to have to list their expenditure to banks in ways not required by the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">  The advanced forbearance options referred to include split mortgages, trading down, voluntary losses and mortgage-to-rent.  However, I do not see shared equity solutions, although a split mortgage may be a type of arrangement.</p>

Mr. Fergus Murphy will speak on payment protection and the mortgage standard financial statement and Mr. Byrne will comment on the machines.  Senator Byrne asked about the judgment of Ms Justice Dunne.  We have been trying to analyse it in terms of its impact on subsequent case law.  It represents a limitation on how we can proceed in some cases.  We have raised it with the Department of Finance as one of the challenges at our normal shareholder meetings.  It is a limitation in terms of some of the actions we might be forced to take but cannot execute properly.  I imagine that will follow its natural course within the Departments.</p>

          <p eId="para_842">It was not a matter of agreement or disagreement.  What the case law states and the impacts of it was a matter of record.  It was more a question of whether they understand the impact.  We did not discuss whether they would discuss a particular thing to fix it.  Mr. Murphy will discuss payment protection insurance, mortgage and the standard financial statement.</p>

          <from> Mr. Fergus Murphy<recordedTime time="2012-10-31T18:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_843">The Central Bank conducted a review of payment protection insurance last year and has asked all institutions to conduct their own review in this regard.  EBS and AIB sell payment protection insurance in three main areas, namely, alongside mortgages, personal credit and credit cards.  Since the inception of the consumer protection code in August 2007, some 160,000 customers have bought a PPI product from us.  PPI has acquired a bad name in the United Kingdom in the past five or six years, where penetration rates were as high as 95% in some products.  In other words, if one took out a mortgage, there was a 95% chance one would also purchase payment protection from the same provider.  In Ireland, on the other hand, penetration rates have never been more than approximately 25%.  Therefore, we believe this issue is on a different scale in this country compared with what happened in the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">  Our review of PPI is ongoing and will continue until the end of 2013.  There is no need for customers to do anything in this regard - all of them will be contacted by 7 December this year.  One in five of our customers has made a PPI claim against his or her contract in the past five years, and four out of five of those claims have been upheld and paid out.  In other words, it is a product that has been of real value to customers.  As I said, we believe the situation here is quite different from that in the United Kingdom.  We are doing all we can to assist customers in this regard and will have contacted all of them by 7 December.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">  In regard to the standard financial statement, I agree with the Senator that it is very comprehensive.  We follow the format prescribed by the Central Bank, which includes a huge amount of detail in regard to expenditure.  In fairness to the customer and to the bank, it is very important that we understand where the former is at in regard to affordability.  We must ensure he or she has sufficient income to have a reasonable standard of living thereafter.  The SFS, burdensome as it can be, does clarify the situation very strongly.  Although it might be possible to have a slimmed down version, it is important that we can clearly see the nature of the expenditure for a particular individual or family.</p>

          <p eId="para_846">When a person becomes unemployed, he or she applies to the Department of Social Protection for jobseeker's allowance or jobseeker's benefit, to the Health Service Executive for a medical card and, if he or she has a mortgage, to the bank to discuss repayment options.  It is notable that such persons are obliged to provide much more information to the bank than to the Department or the HSE.  I accept that this information retrieval is mandated by the Central Bank, but it seems to me to be superfluous.  Would it not be better from the bank's point of view, in terms of administration, time and staff resources, simply to assume a certain level of expenditure?  What I am suggesting here is that housing costs should not exceed a fixed portion of income.  Would the banks prefer not to have to deal with the level of detail required in the standard financial statement?  Would it be possible to operate a fair system with a more broad-based approach?  If certain criteria were in place whereby housing costs could only account for a designated portion of income, much of the detail that is currently required could be bypassed and the whole process would work much more quickly.  In addition, it would be less humiliating for the person in difficulty and would be in line with the type of information that is required by the Department of Social Protection and the HSE.</p>

In time, as we proceed with administering 1,500 cases per month in the next six months, we will get better at processing the SFS and customers will get better at filling it out.  We have hundreds of staff throughout our network who are trained to evaluate and challenge SFSs and ensure they are properly completed.  We are getting better at helping customers to complete the statement.</p>

          <p eId="para_854">To clarify, Senator Thomas Byrne is, as I understand it, proposing that a social welfare assessment is the type of assessment the bank should be using.  Social welfare benefit is determined within a specific monetary limit.  In other words, where one qualifies for a full supplementary welfare allowance or disability allowance, there is a cap on the benefit received.

          <p eId="para_861">I am seeking the officials' views on the level of detail required in the SFS and whether it goes down to such matters as television subscriptions.  All types of discretionary spending, including school costs, are included in the process.  My point is that this level of information is not required as part of the means tests conducted by the Department of Social Protection or the HSE.  It is utterly humiliating to have to provide that level of detail.  I am suggesting - it is for the Central Bank to introduce such a change, but it would be implemented by the banks - that a standard proportion of income be designated for housing costs such that where a customer goes beyond that, it can be concluded that the mortgage is unaffordable and there is no need for the bank to delve into any of the other information.  People should be able to spend the remainder of their money as they wish.  Given the difficulty in which these customers find themselves, the reality is that it will be spent on what is necessary rather than what is discretionary, however the bank chooses to define the latter or is mandated by the Central Bank to define as such.</p>

          <p eId="para_863">I thank the delegates for the time and attention they have given to this meeting and the candid nature of their answers.  Is AIB outsourcing any of its debt collection function to agencies in respect of leasing loans, credit card debt or anything else, or is it retaining all debt collection activities in house?  My second question relates to the lower interest rate the bank is charging new business customers as compared with existing customers.  I appreciate that this is an industry practice rather than being specific to AIB, but in the current climate it is very difficult for business owners to shop around.  If they have a good relationship with their bank, most business owners will stick with it.  Yet they are seeing new business customers being given a lower interest rate.  Will the delegates comment on that?</p>
          <p eId="para_864">  What is the delegates' view on the concept of 50-year mortgages, similar to products available on the Continent, and how they might work in an Irish context, particularly for people who have very large debt or substantial negative equity?

          <p eId="para_871">We will run through them quickly.  We are not outsourcing the collection of debt, but we are bringing in outsource companies to provide us with expertise and advice which we need.  As we do not have enough trained personnel, we have brought in resources to the organisation which have experience of this.  Those to whom I refer have experience and help to train our personnel and work with us.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">  I will ask Mr. Murphy to comment on the issue of 50-year mortgages and Mr. Byrne to speak about lower interest rates for SMEs.  I will then come back in on the issue of DIRT.</p>

          <p eId="para_873">We have looked at 50-year mortgages in the context of the position in Japan and other countries.  We would prefer each generation to be in a position to pay back its debt, rather than burdening the next generation with that debt.  Most of the structures we are seeking to put in place are trying to talk to this, namely, trying to make that debt affordable for the customer within his or her generation.  However, 35 and 40-year mortgages are now available.  The tenure of mortgages has increased during the past decade.  We are already moving towards long-term mortgages, given that 35 and 40-year mortgages are available.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">  In terms of DIRT being increased, the liability-deposit side of Irish banks has stabilised and, thankfully, deposits are beginning to come back onshore.  Previously, they were offshore.  We are also winning against onshore rivals.  AIB is up approximately €3 billion to date in deposit gathering.  However, we are at an early stage of stabilising that marketplace.  Again, the ELG discussion is going to take place soon, we hope and expect, with a view to termination of that issue.  It is not for us to decide on tax matters, but, in general, there will be enough happening in that space in the coming period.  We wish for that market to remain stabilised rather than potentially being destabilised by something new being introduced which would act as a disincentive for people to deposit money within Irish banks.</p>

          <p eId="para_875">On a point of clarification, the outsourcing resources for us are internal, but we have used recovery firms.  It has been pointed out to me that it is to this to which the Deputy's question may possibly relate.  We have used recovery firms occasionally to collect debts.  Therefore, the answer is "Yes".

          <p eId="para_876">On the rate, this is one of the classic questions where, regardless of the answer we give, there will be a problem.  We do have a discounted rate for new business which we see as appropriate, given the challenges new businesses face.  We have a package for new businesses which includes free banking for a period and a start-up rate of 4.4%.  That rate is also available to a series of other interests and applies to the agri-sector and the job creation fund.  The overdraft rate on standard loans is higher - it is closer to 7.8% - and depending on the negotiations that would take place in respect of a standard business, it could be somewhere between 4% and 6%, depending on the type of business involved.</p>

          <p eId="para_878">I wish to raise three matters.  In order that there will be no misunderstanding, when I refer to restructuring of AIB's client loans - mortgage loans, buy-to-let loans and SME loans - I mean including a write-down in order that the loans will be recalibrated to reflect what the current, reasonable and maintainable profits of the borrower can bear.  Otherwise, our guests will only be fooling themselves and playing at "shadow banking".  That is not on.  If standard variable rates increase from 4% to 6%, that is a 50% increase.  If people are under stress and strain at a figure of 4%, their levels will rise again by 50% if there is an increase to 6%.  This only adds to the argument of ensuring the recalibration or restructuring, including a write-down, is done sooner rather than later.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">  I echo what other members have stated, namely, that people are under enormous stress.  It is not just in the context of doing the arithmetic and dealing with the numbers.  Those to whom I refer are literally crying, shivering, nervous wrecks when we meet them at our offices.  It is very distressing to have to deal with this matter.  I ask our guests to please meet their clients.  I am glad they have indicated they are going out across the country to do just this.  They should keep up what they are doing in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">  My final point is that I had experience of loan portfolio work-outs for a five or six year period in the 1980s.  I have, therefore, been on the battlefield, which is why I am of the view that it is important to clean up the position and not leave loans to fester or park 50% of them in no man's land.  If the latter is done, we will have a sword of Damocles hanging over us in four, five or six years time, which is wrong.  It is, therefore, very important to clean up as one goes.  I thank our guests and appreciate them giving of their time.</p>

          <p eId="para_881">I refer again to the type of lending taking place.  Much of the anecdotal information indicates that car finance packages are being advanced.  I am concerned about the domestic rather than the international economy.  In the context of recovery we should focus on a number of particularly vital areas, namely, exports, tourism, energy, agribusiness and microenterprise.  AIB's submission to the committee states the fund for agribusiness is €250 million, that 625 applications have been sanctioned to date and that only €47 million in funding has been disbursed.  Mr. Duffy has suggested the agri-sector offers a great deal of potential and is going to grow.  I would like the lending that is going to take place to focus on indigenous businesses and those which are focused on exports and which can assist us, rather than on other areas.  I have no intention of criticising the car sector - I am aware that many are employed in it - but with every car we buy, we are helping the Japanese and the Germans far more than we are helping ourselves.  Is AIB's thinking on this matter along the lines to which I refer?  What emphasis is it placing on driving the economy towards recovery?</p>

          <p eId="para_883">The Deputy will find that much of the car finance on offer is actually supplied by the original equipment manufacturer, OEM.  In other words, Volkswagen and BMW will offer their own deals which are aimed at shifting their merchandise.  Less of that finance is probably directly on offer from the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">  As the agri-sector has actually grown, we have more credit outstanding to that sector than was the case at the beginning of the year.  There are not many sectors in which that is the position.  Our exposure to the sector is €1.9 billion at this stage.  The fund to which the Deputy refers is a new one.  We have a series of funds.  We find that if one has a fund and one has something in the shop window, it is easier for people to say "I'll get a bit of that" and "I understand what the agri-fund is".  We have many specialists in the regions who are supporting the six advisers who do nothing other than concentrate on the agri-sector.  We are very positive in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">  In respect of the new sectors to which the Deputy referred - clean tech, energy and medical - we have put a start-up team in place.  This comprises ten people whose sole focus is to concentrate on these emerging sectors.  We know we need to know more about these industries, particularly as they are different from those industries to which the banks have traditionally lent.  We are moving up the curve in terms of the knowledge-base.  Much of this is simple.  Providing the first item of advice and credit for a small start-up is very different from dealing with traditional manufacturing business.  We accept the point and are pursuing a series of initiatives to try to help them move forward.</p>

          <p eId="para_894">I am surprised to hear that, particularly in the context of new mortgages.  In 2009 the Central Bank gave a very clear opinion that it was very much opposed to mortgages with terms of more than 25 years.  In the long term advancing such mortgages would give rise to another property bubble because by scheduling over a 35-year period, all one would be doing was facilitating an additional value being placed on properties.  </p>
          <p eId="para_895">  I return to a matter I raised with the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation this morning.  In the context of the residential sector, property values are now approaching normalisation.  The properties to which I refer are not undervalued; they have reached their real value.  If, therefore, one applies lending criteria to a couple, namely, three and a half to four times the principal earner's income plus the secondary earner's income, surely it should be possible for people to repay mortgages over 20 or 25 years.</p>

If people take out mortgages in their early 20s, they should have them repaid by the time they are in their 50s, at which time they have another big bill coming down the road, namely, the cost of third level education for their children.  If one is in a 35-year mortgage, one is not even halfway through it at the stage when bills for third-level education arise.  There is a life cycle to the type of financing people have in adulthood.</p>

          <p eId="para_907">I wish to provide clarification to you, Chairman, on the portfolio we have and what is beyond the 20-year to 25-year range.  You will find that it is <i>de minimis</i>.  It is a facility we have to go to the age of 65 and in the great majority of cases it applies to distressed mortgages.</p>

          <p eId="para_911">It is a legal obligation in this country that when one takes out a mortgage one must have life assurance.  That is built into our processes.</p>

          <p eId="para_913">The percentage is probably less than 10%.</p>

          <p eId="para_914">Okay.  It is mandatory to protect mortgage repayments in the Canadian and Dutch models of mortgage lending practice.  As a result, neither Canada nor the Netherlands suffered a property bubble.  Products were designed by companies such as Genworth to protect 30% of the equity.  Because the governments of those countries introduced such a mandatory ruling, they had positive outcomes.  From our perspective, it would have meant that one was protected for the first two years of repayments following default.  Does Mr. Murphy have a view on the benefit of examining protection of the mortgage itself, not in the event of the person's dying but in the event of his or her losing a job or becoming disabled for a temporary period?</p>

          <from> Mr. Fergus Murphy<recordedTime time="2012-10-31T18:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_916">Yes; it is a PPI-like product.  We have had that as a staple product in AIB and EBS for 15 years.  It is a responsible product and there has been a good pay-out following claims by customers against it for illness and other reasons.  The product is available with all mortgages.</p>

          <from> Chairman<recordedTime time="2012-10-31T18:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_917">If PPI were mandatory, as is the case in Canada and the Netherlands - albeit under two different models - would it bring down the cost of the mortgage because of the reduction in the risk factor due to the insurance loading that is placed on top of the mortgage?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_721">
          <from> Mr. Fergus Murphy<recordedTime time="2012-10-31T18:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_918">EBS has been taking out mortgage indemnity insurance for the past ten or 15 years, but it no longer does it on its own book.  It is often difficult for the bank to claim in cases of mortgage indemnity.  In general, taking out insurance would be of marginal benefit to the customer.  The main factor in the Canadian market which assisted it through the crisis was the limiting of loan-to-value ratios.</p>

          <p eId="para_919">The insurance companies ensured there would be a limit on loan-to-value ratios because they insure the amount of borrowing provided by the bank, which results in a triangulation in terms of monitoring.</p>

          <p eId="para_921">On mortgage protection, if a premium fails to be paid by the borrower, is it an obligation for the bank or financial institution to pay it to keep the policy alive?</p>

          <p eId="para_923">Normally a mortgage protection policy is assigned to the bank, or it is in the joint names of the borrower and the bank, so that if the borrower fails to pay the premium the policy will lapse.  Therefore, the insurance company notifies the bank that the premium has not been paid and normally the bank should step in to do so.  Is it legally obliged to step in to keep premiums going?</p>

          <p eId="para_928">It is coming up to 5.25 p.m., and we are due to finish at 5.30 p.m.  I would be grateful if we could finish five minutes early.  I have been sitting here since 10 o'clock this morning and my legs are getting a little stiff.  I thank Mr. Duffy and his team for attending this afternoon.  I believe it is his first time before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  I am new to the committee so I was not sure about that detail.  I am grateful for the positive engagement with the committee this afternoon.  I wish Mr. Duffy and his team well in their objective of getting AIB back to a sustainable position, independent of the Government, in the future.  This is one of a series of meetings we will have in the coming years.  I very much appreciate the frankness with which the witnesses dealt with questions and the detailed information they furnished in response to the questionnaire we sent.  There is much reading in it for members.  On behalf of all committee members I thank Mr. Duffy and his team for their engagement this afternoon and wish them well in their endeavours to return the bank to a sustainable position eventually.</p>
