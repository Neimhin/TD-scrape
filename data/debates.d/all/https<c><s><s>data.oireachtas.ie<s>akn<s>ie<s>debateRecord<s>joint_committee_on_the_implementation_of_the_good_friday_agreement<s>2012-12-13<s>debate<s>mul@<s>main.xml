          <from> Chairman<recordedTime time="2012-12-13T13:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_16">Our first item for discussion is the work of Youth Work Ireland and Youth Action Northern Ireland, YANI, in supporting young people.  I am delighted they are present in a joint capacity.  Youth work is an area in which I am interested as a former youth worker and community development worker.  Our guests are speaking to the converted.  Given the community and civic work done by the committee's members, they undoubtedly have an interest in this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">  I am pleased to welcome from Youth Work Ireland Mr. Patrick Burke, CEO, Mr. John Gilmore, president, and Mr. Michael McLoughlin, head of advocacy and communications.  From YANI, I welcome Ms Caroline Redpath and Mr. Martin McMullan, assistant directors.  I have a great preamble ready about what the organisations do, but I will discard it as the delegates will give a presentation on the good work in which they are involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">  I advise delegates that when I invite them to make their presentations, they will be protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease making remarks on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their remarks.  They are directed that only comments and evidence related to the subject matter of this meeting are to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">  Before I call on Mr. Gilmore to start proceedings, I will give the delegates an idea of the committee's approach.  We sit once a month, but we also do a bit of outreach work and try to visit Northern Ireland.  Recently, we visited Unionist, loyalist and Nationalist communities in east, north and south Belfast.  We still need to conduct an evaluation, which we will do in private session after today's presentations.  Our visits were interesting.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">  We are concerned about the issues on the ground.  While driving home to Donegal last Thursday, I came across 16, 17 and 18 year olds in Omagh.  Matters are not pigeon-holed into Belfast.  We are quite concerned about the entire dynamic and questions will be asked at this meeting in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">  I invite Mr. Gilmore to make his presentation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_5">
          <from> Mr. John Gilmore<recordedTime time="2012-12-13T13:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_22">I thank the committee for inviting us to attend.  It is a pleasure for Youth Work Ireland to be present alongside our Northern partners, YANI.  I will provide an introduction to our organisation.  I am the president and a volunteer.  I was young when I took up my post, but now that I am hitting on 25 years of age, I am moving on a little bit.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">  We are a national organisation and the largest youth work organisation in Ireland, comprising a federation of 22 regional youth services.  What makes us unique is that our focus is very much on the local.  We pride ourselves on being local services led by local people that come together as Youth Work Ireland on a national footing to work collectively, to ensure young people have a voice nationally and to ensure the best service provision for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">  It is difficult to make estimates, but we work with approximately 100,000 young people through a number of programmes and projects.  We have approximately 450 clubs and projects, but our services also work with young people one on one and through other fora.  We try to promote an integrated service and ensure any young person who approaches us has the service he or she needs, be it focused or universal.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> Our unique community focus and our structure have led to us being a good fit with YANI. That group has a community focus, working with over 200 communities with a large volunteer base and approximately 17,000 young people. A number of years ago we came together and decided to work on the same footing. Things have improved greatly for cross-Border initiatives and young people in the 32 counties of Ireland but we cannot become complacent and there are still significant issues. Through the auspices of youth work we are trying to help and promote peace, ensuring that young people are supported. Youth work plays a vital role in that respect for young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> I will hand over to Mr. Michael McLoughlin, our head of advocacy and communications, who will provide some indication of the kind of work we do in our partnership.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_6">
          <from> Mr. Michael McLoughlin<recordedTime time="2012-12-13T13:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_27">The partnership between the two organisations is based on a strategic plan and agreement.  It is very substantial in terms of meeting and progressing work.  We have a very strong focus on front-line work with young people in communities, and although teams and managers meet to speak about the type and quality of work, we also run direct programmes.  For example, I have provided the Chairman with information about the Irish Youth Music Awards, which has over 10,000 people from young bands in local communities participating North and South of the Border.  Ms Redpath can speak a bit more about an apprenticeship programme for youth workers, run directly for young people who wish to pursue a career in youth work on both sides of the Border.  A while ago Mr. McMullan and I were strongly associated with exchange work involving young people North and South of the Border and people in the south-west Balkans in Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia.  That took in the lessons of conflict and its impact on young people.  There is a significant level of direct work ongoing, which we hope is one of the strong outcomes of the partnership.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">  In considering the committee's agenda, it may wish to examine the common challenges faced by young people in youth unemployment.  There are large numbers of young people who are not in education North and South of the Border, and we have had much discussion about that.  We are trying to raise political engagement in young people, and there is an active voices of youth group, with young people engaging directly with policy makers.  That is consistent with the national children's strategy and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  In the North there is a Let's Talk initiative, which is similar, and we are trying to bring those together as much as possible.  There is much going on of great relevance, and even in the area of health and well-being we have always tried to highlight issues about young people's mental and physical health.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">  There is a North-South dimension to that as well, and we often hear North-South trade cited as a reason not to take action on issues such as alcohol and tobacco pricing.  The World Health Organisation advocates a public health view and I know there have been meetings between the Ministers North and South about those  issues.  We encourage the committee to take an active interest in that so that the Border is not used as an excuse not to take effective public health measures on behalf of young people, for example.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">  It is 15 years since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  In working together and as institutions mature and relationships improve, we should look for more dedicated space for young people in those institutions and in civic society engagement.  Even if we want to put forward joint initiatives and measures, it is very hard to find a space to do so.  There is no North-South body in this area, and the only opportunity for co-operation is in the education field, and even that tends to be very limited in what can be done.  We are working together on a North-South basis and coming across many issues but we are scratching the surface.  It is very hard to find institutional space and, related to this, it is very hard to find the funding base to do that work.  We are robbing Peter to pay Paul even in doing the most basic or rudimentary work.  The committee should think about whether there is a way of supporting such work on a North-South basis.  There are one or two small programmes but we are merely scratching the surface and doing some very basic things.  We are dipping in and out but there should be a greater space for young people and youth organisations in the institutional framework, with some type of improved funding base for working together for the future of young people.  That would be a valuable outcome from this work.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_7">
          <from> Mr. Martin McMullan<recordedTime time="2012-12-13T13:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_31">I thank the committee for having us here today.  I will provide a brief insight into Youth Action Northern Ireland and some of its key work.  Ms Redpath will take us through aspects of employability in young people and some key issues for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">  Youth Action Northern Ireland, a charitable regional voluntary youth non-governmental organisation in the North, has been around for between 65 and 70 years.  Like Youth Work Ireland, our strategic partner, we are a membership-based organisation.  We have regional bases across the North in Derry, Enniskillen, Armagh, Ballygawley, Kilkeel, Newry and the hub in Belfast.  We are based in these locations but we also prioritise work throughout the region, including Border counties both North and South, with a range of programmes operating across them.  </p>
          <p eId="para_33">  The organisation is based primarily on research and needs assessment, working in partnership with local communities.  Our practice develops through evidence-based need, and we are a practice-based organisation that builds the capacity of the youth sector in the North.  We are also strategic in working across Departments, taking in health, education, employment and learning.  We contribute to policy discussions and involve young people in engagement with politicians and as my colleague mentioned, we are looking at Let's Talk programmes, where young people can come together on a range of issues to debate with politicians.  Our work is very much about education and a community-based approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">  I will speak about peace and reconciliation before handing over to my colleague.  Reconciliation issues are a priority this year for the committee.  We are working with young people on the ground on the issue of peace education and the legacy of the conflict, and a sentiment that arises is that it is always in the back of people's minds.  There is not the same level of shootings and bombs but in the back of young people's heads, it is there consistently.  This may relate to safety of movement in school or leisure services, for example.  There is now an issue with flags in the North, which is contentious, and we must engage with young people on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">  We live in a segregated society, with segregated housing, education and leisure services.  Even still there is segregated employment.  The challenge is to work with young people to try to help them develop critical minds and meet young people different from themselves.  They should learn to appreciate the diversity in Ireland beyond the traditional Protestant-Catholic population, and we have many minority ethnic communities.  We must take in how to approach broader diversity in a range of issues.  According to researchers in Queen's University in Belfast in 2009, 75% of young people expressed a fear of travelling to another community, whether for education, employment or social friendships.  That means three quarters of young people still feel very frightened with regard to mobility.  One of our executive members, who works for the Northern Ireland Tourist Board spoke recently about young people from the South, particularly Dublin, who are still frightened to come to the North and Belfast because of the legacy of the conflict and fear for safety.  That is how young people feel.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">  The Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister and BBC worked on a legacy pack a number of years ago, and we were able to hear and read the stories of mostly adult civilians and those involved in the armed conflict.  What was missing from that pack was the voice of young people.  We have been trying to capture the voice of young people through publications, with an example being Peace and Quiet, Noise and Riot.  It sums up the very volatile position in the North, where we can be living with peace and quiet and believe everything is okay, with something erupting because of volatility, leading us to feel we are going backwards rather than forwards.  We must try to capture the voice of young people so others can listen to what is going on.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">  Some 82% of young people in a Community Relations Council 2009 report cited that they believed community relations between the two primary communities would be better if there were projects to address community relations.  However, in speaking to young people about community relations, there is often a disconnect and they can feel it is not particularly relevant; it may appear that they are apathetic and it has no impact on them but that is not true.  We must keep the work real and relevant, helping young people to provoke curiosity and break down attitudes and barriers.  We should help young people to come together through contact, paradoxical curiosity and inquiry.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_5">Let us take the flags issue in the North which led to young people and adults demonstrating on the streets in Omagh and elsewhere. At the same time we must appreciate and savour how far we have come and recognise that young people are actively involved in their communities and act as volunteers. As Youth Work Ireland has cited, young people are keen to become involved in politics, but they do not know how. They have an interest in political issues but perhaps not in party politics in the North. They present their visions of peace through symbols like those in the booklet I have in front of me. They want to remain connected and contribute, but sometimes they do not know how. From my perspective and that of Youth Action and Youth Work Ireland, we aim to develop a flourishing community, including young people. It is our responsibility to inspire a more optimistic and happy society and young people.</summary>

          <from> Ms Caroline Redpath<recordedTime time="2012-12-13T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_38">As Mr. McMullan said, Youth Action is a practice-based organisation and employs people to work directly with young people in communities.  He has also talked about some of the programmes we deliver.  We have key priority areas of work and I shall highlight a couple of programmes that we deliver on a cross-Border basis with Youth Work Ireland.  Like the South, we have a high unemployment rate in the North, with one in five young people out of work.  The committee showed a particular interest in this issue during its recent visit to the North.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">  Mr. McMullan talked about the cross-Border apprenticeship programme which employed 43 young people from across Derry-Londonderry, Donegal, Monaghan, Fermanagh and Belfast for 18 months.  They completed a level 3 youth work apprenticeship programme which was recognised by the Department of Employment and Learning in Northern Ireland.  Obviously, they accessed a training grant, but we secured external funding from the International Fund for Ireland and The Atlantic Philanthropies.  Both organisations have been very supportive.  A key aspect of the programme is to increase the employability of young people.  Obviously, they learn about turning up for work on time, how to fill in time sheets and about youth work.  The programme delivers good and effective youth work opportunities to young people.  As Mr. McMullan said, it is about young people learning about life, helps them to be hopeful, optimistic and interested in their surroundings and encourages them to participate in their community and community events.  The good thing about the programme is that young people can avail of a community placement and thus become involved in youth work.  Obviously, they must do so to gain their qualification.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">  Another key aspect is that we introduce all of the themes of peace building.  The publication at the back of our legacy pack has been a great resource for us.  As members will be aware and understand, we need people to tell each other their story, understand it, know how they feel and their attitude to various matters.  Mr. McMullan highlighted the flags issue.  Our document has been a brilliant resource for us, as it helps young people to tell their stories but also to listen to others.  At the back of the publication there is a list of shorter programmes for young people that last for 16 weeks.  They focus on the large numer of young people who are not in employment, education or training, which is a major issue for us in the North.  We go through a process with these young people and try to engage them.  We try to get them interested in undertaking a lot of confidence-building work, in addition to completing short qualification courses and learning essential skills.  This is all done to give them confidence in learning and prove to them that they have an ability to learn. A lot of these young people would have issues such as to do with drugs and alcohol and we use specialised services to provide support for them.  We also provide mentors on the programmes who work with them to help to plan and take responsibility for their learning.</p>
          <p eId="para_41">  A lot of our work is focused on the employability of young people.  As Mr. McMullan and Mr. McLoughlin have highlighted, we provide a lot of support and try to get young people to engage in the political process.  In the North 56% of young people in the 17 to 25 year age group are not registered to vote.  It is very important, following the Good Friday Agreement and with a devolved Administration, that young people become engaged in politics and understand how it works.  We also want them to become interested in local issues.  Even though the statistics show that 75% of young people are not interested in politics, once my organisation engages with them they do become involved in local campaigns.  For example, road safety is an issue in County Fermanagh of which Ms Gildernew will be aware.  We have also got young people involved in larger campaigns in respect of public transport.  The young people concerned worked with Translink which resulted in a discount card being provided for young people up to the age of 23 years.  We can see how motivated young people are on such issues separate from a party political system.  As Mr. McMullan said, part of our work involves giving hope to young people about their future, increasing their employability and confidence in what they can do and how they engage with others, thus building a better and more peaceful society.</p>

          <p eId="para_43">The delegates are welcome and it is good to see them here.  I especially welcome Ms Redpath because I have worked with her previously.  I thank the delegates for their presentations in which they covered a lot of bases.  I know the difficulties surrounding young people who are not in employment and training.  It is hard to reach young people, especially those leaving care and in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.  There are many issues facing young people but one of the greatest is access to transport.  At the end of Ms Redpath's presentation she talked about the Translink discount.  A lot of young people do not have access to public transport because they live in a rural community.  The greatest obstacle is to get to their nearest town to catch a bus.  I have worked on the issue of rural transport and tried to ensure young people can access it.  Young people with disabilities find it a particular problem, while young people are excluded from many activities because they do not have access to transport.  For example, young people in Garristown cannot access services in Enniskillen because it is too far away.  Our challenge is to make services more accessible and that campaign must continue.  Many young people feel disenfranchised in more ways than one because of access issues.  I appreciate that there is co-operation in this regard, but it could be enhanced and thus benefit young people across Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_44">  It is my party's policy to reduce the voting age to 16 years.  We also believe it is important to have young people engaging at 14 and 15 years of age and talking about who they want to vote for.  By the time they reach 18 years they may be a little jaded and cynical about politics.  It is also important that young people have their electoral mandate recognised.  Changing the voting age would be a huge step and a vote of confidence in our young people who get a bad press most of the time.  Things are tough and I am not only referring to drugs and alcohol but the cost of insurance.  </p>
          <p eId="para_45">  I am particularly concerned about young people who discover that they are gay.  Statistics show that a young male will keep his homosexuality a secret for five years, or between the ages of 12 and 17 years.  That must be a lonely place for such individuals to be in.  I ask the organisations present to keep up the good work, but I also ask them to examine the issues of isolation and living in a rural community, especially for hard to reach and vulnerable young people.</p>

          <p eId="para_46">I apologise for being late, but I had to attend another meeting.  However, I have a fair idea of what is included in the presentations.  I also welcome the delegates.</p>
          <p eId="para_47">  I wish to raise a number of issues, health and well-being being a huge one.  Obesity is exerting huge pressure on people and the health service.  What do the organisations think politicians should do?  Do they suggest we should conduct campaigns and engage in more collaboration?  </p>
          <p eId="para_48">  I am concerned about the level of access to third level education in Northern Ireland, as there seems to be a great imbalance in one community, although I appreciate that there are many apprenticeships available.  It is a huge imbalance.  Are the delegates involved in trying to get more people into third level education?  The figures are startling.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">  I am interested in the south-west Balkans project.  Will the delegates elaborate on it?  I have been to Sarajevo.  Has the project been of benefit?</p>

          <from> Mr. Patrick Burke<recordedTime time="2012-12-13T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_50">I will field some of the questions to the most relevant person.  </p>
          <p eId="para_51">  Rural isolation is a huge issue for young people around the country and, obviously, transport is a critical part of it.  Youth Work Ireland has almost 5,000 clubs mainly located in rural parts of the country; for example, Kildare Youth Services has between 20 and 30, while in County Donegal there are up to 50.  These clubs are critical to the life experiences of young people.  It is possibly their only opportunity on a Friday night to meet their peers, relax and engage in some positive learning also.  Often in social policy the emphasis is on investing in programmes that work with young people who have difficulties or that see young people as a problem that must be solved.  Instead, both of our organisations make it clear that we work using what we call an asset base approach, which simply means we see young people as a huge resource, hugely resilient and more than capable of organising their own lives and communities.  They really want to be part of the community and clubs are a very important part of that dynamic.  I come from a rural village and 30 years ago was involved in my local club.  We had the GAA and the local youth club.  We were all involved in both, but those who did not like sport got involved in the youth club.  It was a hugely important part of our community and I have no doubt it shaped who I am today in terms of the work I do and the values I hold.  Organisations such as ours which support the training and development of volunteers to facilitate these clubs are critical.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">  With regard to youth political engagement, we would certainly welcome a debate on the age at which young people can vote.  In the recent referendum we lobbied for it to be held on a Saturday and welcomed the fact that it was.  Despite the fact that the number who voted was not as high as we would have liked, we continue to be of the view that it is critical for youth participation that Saturday voting continue.  It means young people can get home from college and become engaged in the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">  My colleague, Mr. Gilmore, will talk about the LGBT issue, while Mr. McLoughlin might deal with some of the health issues.  My colleagues from Northern Ireland might speak about third level education and the Balkans project.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_13">
          <from> Mr. John Gilmore<recordedTime time="2012-12-13T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_54">Mr. Burke spoke about the local youth club being important in rural areas.  We lobbied for youth club support not to be touched in the budget and welcomed that it was not.  However, a minimal amount of money is given to rural youth clubs which are led by volunteers like me in local communities who give up their time for young people.  It is a hugely important area which needs investment and support in order that it can continue to flourish.  </p>
          <p eId="para_55">  With regard to the projects in which we have engaged to access local people, one project was very innovative.  Kerry Diocesan Youth Service has a mobile youth café which it built from scratch.  It travels around some of the rural areas that do not have a youth project or youth café to provide services.  Again, it was a youth-led initiative whereby young people were able to interact and design the idea.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">  It is welcome that the LGBT youth work issue was raised.  Youth Work Ireland has a network of 12 LGBT youth projects.  My engagement with Youth Work Ireland at a primary level was in setting up, as a volunteer, an LGBT youth project with Youth Work Ireland in Galway.  It was when I worked in the equality area in the university.  It is a huge sector.  There are numerous pieces of research on young gay men, gay women and transgender people and the issues of coming out, gender identity, the difficulties in that regard and the importance of trying to provide social support.  Our organisation is the primary provider of LGBT youth services through our strategic partners BeLonGTo where funding is channelled, but there is still no mainstream funding for regional LGBT youth work services.  Our approach, like that to all our projects, is to engage LGBT young people as part of an integrated service within these specialised projects.  They engage in the service as a whole.  A big concern for us is that because the money has dried up, in essence, for many of our projects, particularly some in Donegal, Galway and Waterford, there is no funding available.  They are trying to fund-raise, scrimp and save and take money from other projects to support these highly vulnerable and at risk young people who have a huge amount to give.  It is just a question of adding that support.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_14">
          <from> Mr. Michael McLoughlin<recordedTime time="2012-12-13T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_57">It is hard to know where to start on the issues of health and well-being.  The idea is that the journey of 1,000 miles starts with one step.  To highlight one area in the presentation on alcohol policy, for example, we have done a great deal of work on the issue during the years.  There is a template available, for which the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, has responsibility - the last Minister of State, Deputy Róisín Shortall, did a great deal of work on it in the South - based on WHO research and years of discussion with a number of players.  The issue now is implementation and delivering things that have been well researched, proved and signposted.  We would like to see progress being made in this discrete area.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">  On a broader level, there are a number of issues such as transport and so forth.  From our point of the view, the participation of young people in decision making is crucial.  We are involved in running Dáil na nÓg and Comhairle na nÓg which are very good initiatives, but we need more and better ones.  We certainly support the widening of the franchise, but there is the issue of registering to vote, as 18 to 25 year olds have the lowest rate of registration.  They also have the lowest turnout in elections.  Our statistics office carried out a study about ten years ago.  The rate of registration and participation in the political process increases sequentially every ten years.  The highest participation rate in voting and registration is among people over 65 years, while the lowest is among 18 to 25 year olds.  We must lance that boil.  The registration process in the South is an absolute disaster.  It is like an obstacle course.  If one moves and changes address, it involves getting bits of paper, filling them in and bringing them to a Garda station.  It is crazy, given that one can do most other things online such as banking and buying airline tickets.  We must think about making the process much easier.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">  With regard to decreasing the voting age, for some bizarre reason, there was a consensus among campaigners that we should reduce the age to 16 years, but suddenly it is 17 for the constitutional convention.  I do not know why or whose idea that was.  Young people are not involved in the constitutional convention.  They are effectively excluded because the citizens involved in it will be selected from the electoral register.  We hope to do something about this to involve young people directly.  We have to walk the walk on the issue of participation.  We talk a great deal about it; there is lovely talk about getting young people involved and telling them they are great.  However, they become very frustrated at being led up the hill on something and then seeing no delivery or action on it.  The voting and constitutional convention are good examples of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">  A number of years ago we met a Minister of State to discuss the issue of alcohol and the State's response.  The meeting was held in the Department of Health on the fourth floor of Hawkins House.  We asked the officials if they had consulted or involved young people in these decisions but they had not.  Interestingly, the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs was located on the fifth floor.  The Minister had responsibility for the national children's strategy which states young people should be involved in decisions that affect them.  The strategy had not even moved down one floor in the lift, let alone out into the community and among decision makers.  There is still a huge amount of work to be done in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_61">  The final point is on education and training.  I urge people not to lose sight of the vocational space.  Third level is hugely important, but even today there was an announcement about cuts to post-leaving certificate, PLC, courses.  These courses are very important for young people who are not going on to third level but who have an average leaving certificate and want to get on in life.  Many of our members are involved in delivering Youthreach and community workshops in conjunction with FÁS or the new structure of education and training boards.  With the concept of a European youth guarantee, we want to see more young people having quality options in the education and training areas.  We must have vocational spaces, what was seen as traditional FÁS provision, and PLC courses, as well as third level places.  Today's news regarding PLCs is very disappointing in that regard.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_15">
          <from> Mr. Martin McMullan<recordedTime time="2012-12-13T13:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_62">I would like to pick up on a point made by Ms Gildernew.  I compliment previous speakers on what they have said.  I am delighted Ms Gildernew mentioned the LGBT work that is being done.  As part of the current policy in Northern Ireland with regard to education and youth work priorities, it has been suggested that youth work should be confined to those aged 21 and under.  As Ms Gildernew said, it sometimes takes young people five years to come out.  That gives us another reason to argue in favour of being allowed to continue to work with young people until the age of 25, at least.  Given that approximately 60% of LGBT young people do not have a single adult they can talk to, it is not surprising that young gay men are five times more likely to attempt suicide, or that 30% of young people in the LGBT community engage in self-harm.  We should acknowledge that.  Youth Action Northern Ireland and other organisations like the Rainbow Project are running programmes in the North to deal with these issues.  Those who work with LGBT young people help to address issues such as diversity.  An expert approach is not required.  We need to treat the person like a human being.  It is a question of having a humanitarian point of view.  We do not need experts who send them to various projects.  Those involved in education and youth work often feel they do not have the skills to work with LGBT young people.  There is nothing different about them.  They have exactly the same needs as other young people, but they feel that extra levels of pressure and suppression are imposed on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">  Deputy Feighan expressed some interest in the work we are doing in the Balkans.  Care International is our partner, and that of Youth Work Ireland, in the Balkans.  It is a well-recognised organisation that works in areas of conflict.  It tries to work at many levels.  Approximately six years ago, we embarked on conversations with Care International about the Balkans.  At a time when countries like Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia were emerging from conflict, we felt we could do something in the Irish context.  I refer to Northern Ireland in particular.  It is a question of two areas that are emerging from conflict.  We looked at gender-based work and gender-based violence because we felt we had that in common.  Much of the work we have done with Mr. McLoughlin in the South has involved looking at the role of young men in violence.  We have reflected on the invisibility of women and young women throughout the conflict, when young men were more visible on the streets as defenders of communities and protectors of identity.</p>
          <p eId="para_64">  When we became aware that a similar concept was being developed in the Balkans, we organised study visits through the British Council and the Youth in Europe programme.  We received support from Irish Aid at a later stage.  That enabled us to embark on study visits.  We went to the Balkans to have conversations and dialogues with practitioners on the ground there.  We also discussed policy.  The people in question came here subsequently.  That has developed into ongoing annual exchanges, whereby young people from Dundalk, Dublin, east Belfast and south Armagh go to the Balkans to meet other young men and compare their experiences of conflict and everyday violence.  They have travelled to places like Sarajevo, Vukovar, Belgrade and Zagreb.  That has resulted in conferences and seminars on the island of Ireland and in the Balkans.  The President of Croatia came to our Belfast offices, which was really exciting.  He launched the initiative and gave the programme his endorsement.  Our next step is to look at it from a female point of view.  We want to work with young women on issues like gender-based violence.</p>

          <from> Ms Caroline Redpath<recordedTime time="2012-12-13T13:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_65">I want to say a couple of things about third level education.  Ms Gildernew spoke about the issue of transport.  One of the recommendations made in our report related to the introduction of the iLink card.  Other recommendations focused on young people in rural areas and the need to examine how local transport systems can be better integrated with Translink services.  We recommended that no young person should live more than two miles from a bus stop.  We said that cycling would help young people to be fitter and healthier.  Young people have pointed out that safer roads are needed in that context.  We are working with the Consumer Council for Northern Ireland to implement a number of our recommendations.  We would be keen to get the support of this committee to help that process.</p>
          <p eId="para_66">  We can work on a number of aspects of the issue of mental health and young people.  I refer to the school curriculum, for example.  We need to put more pressure on the formal education sector to educate young people about positive mental health, with specific regard to the things young people can do for themselves to ensure they have positive mental health.  There should be a particular focus on the activities young people are involved in and on their relationships.  We have recently been involved in a couple of initiatives that have focused on the use by young people of social media such as text messaging.  When young people become engaged with our programmes, we get their consent to send a positive mental health message to them.  We do that on a regular basis.  The message could say something as simple as "do something for yourself today".  It could be a nice thought about something.  We are trying to help young people think about the small things they can do for themselves and about how they engage in their activities and relationships.</p>
          <p eId="para_67">  I would like to conclude by speaking about third level education.  I have already spoken about our apprenticeship programme.  The level 3 diploma in youth work that our young people complete is recognised by the University of Ulster.  It gives them access to the community youth degree programme.  Our work in this area focuses on young people who have not achieved what they might have needed from the formal education system.  We try to develop their capacity to get higher education places, which might be limited for a number of reasons.  While qualifications are important, we often have to start by developing people's confidence in their ability to access third level education.  Many of them are in the first generation of their families to go to university.  Their families would not have had a history of going to university.  That has been our particular focus in terms of third level education.  Obviously, the number of places available to young people is a key issue, particularly in light of budget reductions.  We have been campaigning on that issue with a focus on young people who leave the education system without many qualifications.  There is a large gap between young people who do well and achieve brilliant things and those who are not in employment, education or training and have a low level of qualifications.</p>

          <p eId="para_68">I admire Youth Work Ireland and Youth Action Northern Ireland.  More than 350,000 young people in the South are catered for by youth work services.  Approximately 1,400 people work in full-time equivalent positions in the youth work sector.  There are over 40,000 volunteers in this area, which is a huge amount.  I am sure the ratio is the same in the North.  Much of this work, although not all of it, is done in deprived communities and with socially disadvantaged young people.  Those who provide youth work services are sometimes the only positive role models in these young people's lives.  We need to support the two organisations that are represented at today's meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">  I was very interested to hear Mr. Gilmore mention the mobile youth cafe.  There are 70 youth cafes in this country.  Some €2 million has been provided in the budget for up to 100 more youth cafes.  Would Mr. Gilmore agree that they seem to be taking over from the youth information centres to a certain extent?  The youth cafe in my own village, which is near Dundalk, is a very positive thing.  I will come back to Dundalk, south Armagh and east Belfast, which have been mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">  The members of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement are quite interested in North-South links.  While I was interested to hear what was said about the strategic plan, I would like to hear more about how these links are developing.  I know from my own links - I have been working through schools and the horse and dog racing sector - that it is very useful to be able to help youth people in the North and the South to come together.  We would be very interested in that.</p>
          <p eId="para_71"> I saw many young people at the final of the Setanta Cup last year. I am disappointed to learn that the Setanta Cup soccer tournament is in danger of folding. This is a great North-South event. Representatives of the Football Association of Ireland and the Irish Football Association appeared before the committee previously and should be invited to come before us again to give their views on this matter. The Setanta Cup creates a great bond among young people.</p>

          <p eId="para_72">I welcome our guests.  We could spend the entire morning discussing the impact of cuts on young people.  I am impressed with the results achieved by the youth organisations which have come before us.  We have heard, for example, that 86% of youth work apprentices secure employment and that 72% of young unemployed people on the REACH training programme progress to employment.  These are positive and impressive figures.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">  I am surprised at the high proportion of young people in the North who are not on the electoral register.  Is the position similar in the South?  The political parties have tried everything to persuade young people to register for elections, from knocking on doors to canvassing in colleges.  According to the survey mentioned, young people feel disillusioned, disenfranchised and disconnected from politics, but they are also interested in politics.  This appears to be a contradiction. </p>
          <p eId="para_74">  Comhairle na nÓg is a youth organisation in the South.  Is there a similar organisation active in the North?  It is important to have young people meeting and talking to one another.  It will be the younger generation, rather than my generation, that will advance reconciliation and peace building.  I hope we will be able to build on the changes made.  While there is common agreement that this is the way forward, increasing co-operation will be a challenge.  It will be achieved by spending small but important sums of money to foster such engagement.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">  What are our guests' views on getting young people involved in politics?  How can young people be persuaded to register for elections?  It has been suggested PRSI numbers could be used to automatically register voters.  Has this proposal been discussed?  Youth groups in my area have been involved in trying to persuade young people to register.  </p>
          <p eId="para_76">  I am not surprised young people are afraid to go into other communities.  This is a generational issue and I suspect family members tell young people not to go into other communities.  Young people in parts of Tallaght in my constituency are nervous about going into other estates.  For example, young people in Jobstown will be nervous about going to Killinarden and <i>vice versa</i>.  One will hear young people who are hoping to get a house say they do not want to move to a particular area, which may be only across the road.  The reason may be that they would feel uncomfortable living in the area or do not have family links with it.  While the problem is bigger in the North, it is also present in the South.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">  One of the positive outcomes of the peace process is that young people from different communities are starting to go out with each other and breaking taboos by going back and forth between communities.  While there have been difficulties in recent weeks, we can move on.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">  I congratulate the youth organisations on the work they are doing.  If they have suggestions on what Members can do to assist them, I would like to hear them, especially with regard to structures.  The peace process has not been successful in including civic society, especially young people.  The Oireachtas has opened up to Comhairle na nÓg.  Could the Assembly take a similar step?</p>

          <from>Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin<recordedTime time="2012-12-13T14:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_79">I apologise for being a little late.  Please feel free to interrupt if I ask a question that has been answered.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">  I am stunned by the figure showing that 56% of those aged between 17 and 25 years in Northern Ireland are not registered to vote.  I spoke to a trade unionist in Australia where voting is compulsory.  While I have never advocated compulsory voting, it could be a long-term strategy because the person with whom I spoke told me it worked in Australia.  Political systems gravitate towards those who tend to vote, namely, the middle class, the wealthy and older people.  Finance is never directed towards areas and age groups which do not use their franchise to the same extent.  Is there potential to have a conversation about moving towards an understanding of how different international electoral models have worked?  The trade unionist indicated that voter turnout in the most disadvantaged areas which was traditionally poor had changed completely and that the political system was moving towards meeting the needs of this section of society now that it was much more engaged.  I ask our guests to comment on this issue. </p>
          <p eId="para_81">  On the attitudes of young people to voting, I am involved in a project with transition year students in local secondary schools.  It is related to the constitutional convention and known as the "Convention in Your Classroom".  I find it remarkable that students in only one of the schools I have visited as part of the project are in favour of lowering the voting age.  They are all <i>au fait</i> with social issues and happy to voice opinions on them.  However, they told me that young people under the age of 18 years did not understand or have an interest in political issues, although they tended to be more in tune with what was going on when they reached 18 years.   I was surprised that young people of 16 and 17 years were not eager to get involved in politics and have their voices heard.  Perhaps there is a disconnect between them and the political system.  The problem that arises when the political system tries to fill this gap is the contamination effect created by political parties becoming involved in voter registration.  There is a danger that politicisation will take on a party political dimension. </p>
          <p eId="para_82">  I am not sure if the issue of integrated schooling has been discussed.  The committee has received a number of presentations on the issue and I am aware the various churches are not keen on the idea.  We also received a presentation from loyalist community leaders, one of whom was strongly opposed to the idea of integrated schooling.  While the Republic does not have a great record on integrated schooling, we are moving towards a model of diverse school patronage.  Is the fact that children from different religions do not attend the same schools part of the problem in the North?  </p>
          <p eId="para_83">  On the most recent violence and the discovery that 13 year old children were involved, time and again we have heard that those in their mid-teens and early 20s have no idea what happened during the Troubles and have a sense that they missed out on some of the action.  I am not trying to be dismissive or insulting, but that is the feedback we received from some community leaders.  I ask the delegation to comment.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">  Literacy, knowledge and learning are surely the most fundamental building blocks for anyone to be able to engage in the labour market or improve himself or herself in education.  The statistics for literacy in the North are probably similar to those in the South, especially for young men who have a difficulty in this regard.  Perhaps the delegation might comment. </p>
          <p eId="para_85">  The sexualisation and commercialisation of young women is not a problem exclusive to Northern Ireland or the Republic.  Having taught in a primary school for girls for 11 years, it is my view that young girls' sense of themselves and their place in society has regressed.  They are very much aware of their sexual power at a much earlier age.  Commercial interests demand that childhood be shortened in order that they can make money out of children as commercial entities.  A 12 year old who should have five or six years of childhood left is now deciding which boy band member she fancies, which make-up she should wear and what colour her hair should be.  Does the delegation wish to comment on the sexualisation of young women and the fact that they are contextualising themselves in terms of their sexual power?  I find that women and young girls are in a less positive place than they were ten, 15 or 20 years ago when, for example, Mary Robinson was elevated to the Presidency.  I do not know if the organisations have tapped into that area or if they have a comment  on it.  I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to contribute.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeOReilly" eId="spk_20">
          <from>Deputy Joe O'Reilly<recordedTime time="2012-12-13T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_86">I apologise for the fact that we have been in and out this morning owing to votes in the House and the fact that we have had to meet ICBAN Limited, another cross-Border organisation.  I welcome the delegates.  It is great to have this exchange of views and to commend and salute their work.  President Higgins' recent initiative of regional assemblies of young people culminating in an assembly within Áras an Uachtaráin was hugely successful.  What was remarkable at the last session was that the young people advanced a knowledge-based excellent set of proposals.  That makes me believe, as Mr. Michael McLoughlin said, that young people should have an input into the constitutional convention.  I concur with that view and wish him well.  If the committee can help in any way it would be delighted to do so.  The question is how to organise the input.  Any of the young who spoke at the final session in Áras an Uachtaráin who represented the regions could reasonably make a presentation of great excellence and maturity to the constitutional convention.  In fact it might well put some of the adult contributions in the shade.  As I had a personal interest in it, I watched the entire proceedings, which were excellent.  Linked to that area is Comhairle na nÓg, Dáil na nÓg, about which Deputy Crowe asked if there were similar assemblies in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">  There is great potential in all of these organisations.  I have personal experience as I have a teenage son who is involved with Comhairle na nÓg which has been transformational and excellent for him.  He has benefited hugely from it.  It is very enjoyable for him and his associates.  They have a round of social activities related to it as they do active community work.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">  It is clear to me as a parent and a former teacher and from observation and through constituency work that young people need confidence, that is, inner confidence and self belief.  That is how to tackle substance abuse and many of the issues correctly identified by Deputy Ó Ríordáin about the position of young women and the attempt to exploit them commercially.  Confidence is a major issue.  All of one's activities help to contribute to building confidence which is a major issue. That leads to my last point, that the enemy of confidence is youth unemployment, the crisis with which we are confronted which is at 30% and is a huge challenge to us all.  Without wishing to be political, I commend the Minister on job activation and the fact that 10,000 new places are available for community employment, through social employment schemes and so on provided for in the budget.  I hope the delegates will tap into that area and have an input into identifying schemes in which young people can be involved and an involvement in the running of youth cafés.  For example, a young person on a community employment scheme could assist with the running of a youth café.  That has been an issue in some instances.  Senator Jim D'Arcy mentioned the huge significance of youth cafés and their attempts to deal with substance abuse, the confidence and so on.  There has been an issue in a few places in regard to continuing to run youth cafés.  There may be potential within the community employment schemes or the social employment schemes to do something in that regard.  I would be interested to hear a comment on that. </p>
          <p eId="para_89">  My last point, although basic, merits repeating on every occasion, that is, that the young need confidence.  That is the reason I was delighted with the impact of Comhairle na nÓg for my son.  If they have confidence everything else will follow.</p>

          <p eId="para_90">We are under pressure timewise.  We have hurled a ball in there which probably does not work.  I suggest one person respond from each group but if somebody else wants to come in, we will not be too strict.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_22">
          <from> Mr. Patrick Burke<recordedTime time="2012-12-13T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_91">I will keep my response as succinct as possible.  Senator Jim D'Arcy kicked off the issue.  Clearly he has a deep knowledge of the sector, the sheer number of young people who are engaged and the number of volunteers and staff.  The sector is giving value for money.  I am aware of a discussion in the Seanad last night on a report produced by the National Youth Council of Ireland which studied the value for money of youth work.  For very little money in the overall scheme of things all of these programmes are delivered locally in all communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_92">  On the issue of youth cafés, obviously we welcome the investment from the Government.  Unfortunately, it is primarily capital funding.  One of the key challenges, as Deputy O'Reilly mentioned, is how to staff these and resource our volunteers.  Organisations such as ourselves put a good deal of time and energy into making sure that volunteers are Garda vetted and that child protection measures are in place.  Obviously that is critical but it comes at a cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_93">  In regard to the strategic plan which we share, it is a great idea and we are delighted to have it but perhaps the committee might think about how it could help us resource it a little more.  Again we are talking about relatively small amounts of money but were the two organisations able to meet and plan much more strategically and in detail, the effect at grassroots level would bear fruit.  There is money available but it is around the grassroots work.  If we were able to strategise around that area with a little money at management or organisational level that would make a huge difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_94">  Mobility is a critical issue.  We must find ways of promoting mobility between both jurisdictions among young people.  Something like the Irish youth music awards is one way of doing that where we have bands coming from North and South.  It is not just the banks it includes all their crew, their background and their family.  That programme is delivered for about €30,000 and there are 10,000 young people involved in it.  Is that not value for money?  That gets people moving and it gets people speaking to each other.  It creates friendships and all kinds of co-operation.  That is one example of the huge impact of a small amount of investment.  As a sector we are operating with between 40% and 50% less funding than we had four or five years ago.  That has a huge impact on the sector.  We are awake to the realities of life.  Ireland is not the same any more.  We have huge challenges.  We are doing our best to deliver on a shoestring.  The outcomes are there to be seen, they are empirically verifiable.  I hand over to my colleague.</p>

          <p eId="para_95">Just to pick up on a few issues.  Deputy O'Reilly raised the issue of the importance of confidence building in young people.  I can tell the committee quite confidently that as a 25 year old man, I would not be able to sit in front of the committee were it not for the interventions of youth work.  I am sure Mr. Patrick Burke would have said the same thing 30 years ago in his youth club.  It provides the mechanisms and the confidence.  The youth workers with whom we work are doing fantastic work.  In regard to youth information centres, an issue raised by Senator D'Arcy, they are hugely important.  In Donegal we have seen the amalgamation of youth cafés and youth information.  In some ways many of our colleagues in the sector are not engaged in youth information as their core work.  It is the core work of Youth Work Ireland.  We are the largest provider and the largest youth work organisation and it is a core and a key element.  One of the arguments is that young people get information online.  Therefore, why does one need to support youth information work?  There is a huge amount of information online that is not very good information on what youth information co-ordinators and workers can do.  Working in youth cafés or in integrated services might not necessarily be the old hatch system we do not operate any more in Youth Work Ireland but they are able to sign post them to good information.  In regard to online work we have a strategic partnership with another national organisation, SpunOut, of which the committee may be aware.  We engage with it at national level to ensure that work goes on in this world wide web era.</p>
          <p eId="para_96"> With regard to how to get young people registered to vote, SpunOut's initiative coming up to the children's rights referendum worked well. It registered 3,000 young people through that campaign. Deputy Ó Ríordáin spoke about the fantastic work being done with the schools with regard to the constitutional convention. Our Vote@16 approach is very different. We get very different feedback from young people. A national campaign is being run currently by the National Youth Council of Ireland at Vote@16, in co-operation with European counterparts through the European Youth Forum. The message from that is very much that young people are in favour of voting at 16. There are many other issues we could discuss in detail, but I will hand over now if anybody else wants to add to what I have said.</p>
        </speech>

          <from> Mr. Michael McLoughlin<recordedTime time="2012-12-13T14:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_97">Legislators could decide to permit voting at 16 for the next European and local elections without a constitutional referendum.  Therefore, if they want to see how it works, they could try it out then.  That power exists and there is no need for constitutional change.  The Constitution only covers Dáil and presidential elections.  That is an idea and initiative that could be tested in the field.  If we go for voting rights at 16, everyone will get registered, because it will be done through school.  Therefore, young people would not have to go through the current obstacle course to get registered.  Everyone would register and vote in school and the turnout would be quite high.</p>

          <from> Ms Caroline Redpath<recordedTime time="2012-12-13T14:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_98">To pick up on what Mr. Burke said with regard to value for money,  we can do a significant amount with just a small amount of money.  In the voluntary youth sector, our organisation brings in £9.32 for every £1 we get of public funding.  We are an ambitious organisation, like Youth Work Ireland.  We are ambitious for young people and need to be in the context of the challenges facing young people currently.</p>
          <p eId="para_99">  In terms of cross-Border work, we work together with Youth Work Ireland.  Much of our work is in the context of the movement of populations of young people into other communities to develop their confidence.  Self-confidence is a big issue for young people.  We have been recruiting young people through job centres recently for one of our employability programmes.  They felt that lack of confidence was the biggest factor in stopping them from getting work.  They did not consider qualifications or education as so significant.  Confidence in themselves and what they could do was the major factor.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">  With regard to engaging young people in democracy, we are very interested in the Rock the Vote campaign that was part of the presidential elections in America.  We have got involved with that and believe it would be wonderful to bring that campaign to Ireland, North and South.  That campaign engages pop stars like Madonna and various others to make voting sexy and to engage young people.  These are things we have to do.  I was sent to the Department of Regional Development to promote cycling for young people, but that, like voting, is not seen as something cool.  Perhaps "cool" is a better word to use than "sexy".</p>
          <p eId="para_101">  On the sexualisation of young women, there are a couple of factors involved here.  There is a vacuum in the North in terms of women and leadership.  Obviously, Michelle Gildernew is the exception in terms of a positive role model for young women.  We take various approaches in working with young men and women in terms of gender stereotyping.  We try to educate them through the use of positive images.  We do this in a practical way, by having them create positive images of young men and women that depart from the gender stereotype, leaving out the make-up and other ways the media suggest they should portray themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_102">  On the issue of compulsory voting, rather than persuading people to agree to compulsory voting, we need to nurture young people earlier.  We need to engage with them in their communities through local campaigns and to inform them of what is going on and deal with local issues like transport.  On schools, I agree these should be integrated.  This is a no-brainer.  Young people are growing up segregated and are not meeting each other until they go into higher education.  That is crazy and has a major impact on relationships in our communities.</p>

          <p eId="para_103">Youth Work Ireland is under pressure to deliver targets.  There is pressure on us to get young people into employment, get them educated and get them into third level education and so on.  We talk about youth cafés, drama, music and all the things young people love to do, but we are not getting to do that because as a deliverer of youth work, our work is focused on that target-driven culture.  This places pressure on people to become something rather than just on being together and enjoying being together.  A recent BBC Radio 2 programme, "Pause for Thought", pointed out that the purpose of life is having a purpose.  Young people just enjoy being together and being happy.  That happiness, contentment and positivity breeds the sort of confidence we have mentioned and inspires them to get involved in other things, like education and employment.  As a youth sector, we need to be more inspirational.  We must get out there and have positive conferences and seminars rather than heavy doom and gloom.  We must be more positive in the sector and inspire people to move forward for a better future for this island.</p>

          <p eId="para_104">I just wish to make an observation on the sexualisation of young women.  I agree with what is being done in this regard.  I cannot speak for the North with regard to third level education of men and women, but in Ireland significant numbers of women are entering third level of education.  Increasingly we see young women speaking on political issues on television panels.  We have a coterie of highly educated women we did not have previously.  This is fascinating.  Many young women in secondary schools now want to go to Cambridge.  This is fantastic.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">  I accept there is sexualisation in the context of what people wear, but young women are ambitious.  Education is what it is about if we want to create self-esteem.  In general, I do not see sexualisation as a major concern, because there is evidence on television and radio constantly that our young women are highly educated and professional and have opinions on every issue.  There were not so many there before.  I admit there is a deficit of women in politics and there are only two women in the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party, which has 33 members altogether.  We do not have role models there.  However, I am not overly concerned as I do not see us being able to change early sexualisation.</p>

It is good to see the dynamic and to see the different dynamics between youth work in Northern Ireland and southern Ireland.  Northern Ireland was ahead of the posse in terms of professional youth work courses, and Jordanstown would have been a pioneer in that area.

          <p eId="para_112">I thank the Chairman and the committee for this opportunity.  This is an important committee on the island of Ireland because it is one of the few formal spaces where all-island thinking must be paramount.  That is important, especially at this time.  I am here to discuss my scoping study, Delivering a Prosperity Process: Opportunities in North/South Public Service Provision.  It is not said often enough that North-South interaction has delivered substantial benefits for both jurisdictions on the island.  This is something which, perhaps, we do not appreciate or look to often enough as we consider what we have to do in this new era.  Why can I say that?  Essentially, I know this because I was there, as Max Boyce says.  In the early 1990s I first became involved in North-South economic and enterprise policy development.  When I reflect on the difference between then and now, I realise it is substantial and significant.  There is peace and there are agreements, institutions and a wide range of other interactions.  Above all, there are relationships that did not exist in the early 1990s, especially at political level and among politicians.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">  This leads me to one of my themes today.  Given the important decisions that politicians are making this week in the Houses, typical of the choices that have to be made in these times of serious budget adjustments, it is important the relationships in place between North and South that can deliver the types of recommendations I am making are used beneficially and productively on behalf of all the citizens of the island.  I have always been involved in the thinking related to how to go about that.  New thinking is needed because we are in a new era.  The great recession has left us in a completely different place from where we were even five or six years ago.  Governments are engaged in adjustment programmes.  The report notes that in this jurisdiction we are 65% through the adjustment programme required by the troika.  The United Kingdom is only 12% through its programme.  In his budget speech the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, said that he pushed out the end of their project until the latter part of the decade.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">  We are discussing public services.  Public expenditure is under pressure and reforms and adjustment are required.</p>
          <p eId="para_115">New thinking will be needed if North-South co-operation is to be part of that. I put forward ten suggestions in that regard. I place them in the context of a prosperity process. In the early 1990s, everyone spoke about peace and prosperity but we ended up with a peace process. Now that economics is dominating thinking, surely it is time we moved the focus onto the prosperity side. I suggest that could be captured in a prosperity process.</p>
          <p eId="para_116"> Last October I presented the study to the enterprise, trade and investment committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly and there was very good interaction at the meeting. The prosperity focus seemed to be a comfortable space in which to discuss opportunities for co-operation and interaction. The areas of most interest in my suggestions were to do with jobs, energy, education and the EU, especially the Presidency. There is a sense of the necessity to move on. There has been much talk and now is the time to do something.</p>
          <p eId="para_117"> Senator George Mitchell addressed this committee earlier this year. I noted he said that in brokering a lasting peace the process requires endless perseverance. I can attest to that. He also said that the role of a mediator was to establish a context for reasonable discussion to occur, often simply by listening, being patient, imaginative and practical. I am here to listen to members of this committee and to answer any questions as best I can. I am happy to give further details about the study and its recommendations.</p>

          <p eId="para_118">I thank Mr. D'Arcy.  This is a scoping study containing ten areas which have been identified.  I will list the areas for the benefit of members.  They are, work and jobs from economic growth; the single energy market; off-island tourism research projects; cross-Border health service provision plan; the case for a cross-Border economic development zone - this will be of interest to Border Deputies; higher education initiatives between third level institutions; North-South co-ordination on treated water; memorandum of understanding on all 21st century infrastructure upgrades; Ireland's EU Presidency - a vehicle for the North-South collaboration will be the North-South Ministerial Council; and a practical system-wide support for public sector managers.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Conlan<recordedTime time="2012-12-13T14:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_119">I welcome Mr. D'Arcy to the meeting for this important discussion.  This is an area of great interest to people living along the Border.  They have been affected negatively by the lack of joined-up thinking between both sides with regard to the provision of health services, education, water, telecommunications, industrial development or the creation of jobs in the region.  Much of the focus has been on Belfast and the larger locations.  The development of prosperity along the peripheral Border regions needs a lot of work.  I am interested in teasing out Mr. D'Arcy's views on the importance of local transport networks in the peripheral regions and their effect on the development of business and job opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">  A particular bugbear of mine is the lack of development in the local road structure between the counties on each side of the Border, between the towns of Armagh and Monaghan.  I am sure it is the same between Donegal and Tyrone in the more rural areas compared with the Derry-Letterkenny side. This development of local roads has a part to play in the creation of growth.  There is a lack of joined-up thinking between the road service in Northern Ireland and the local authorities in the Republic when it comes to the development of those local transport links.</p>
          <p eId="para_121">  This also affects the health policy.  There have been some initiatives to develop co-operation between both health services such as cross-Border ambulance and emergency services.  Many people living along the Border on the Republic side may go to a doctor in Armagh or in Fermanagh.  When they get sick they may want to go to Craigavon hospital but the ambulance will not cross the Border so they will need to be transported by a family member.  At a practical level we need some movement in this area to ensure these people are not inconvenienced in this way.  This is a very important report which I look forward to reading in depth.  I may revert to Mr. D'Arcy to tease out some points.</p>

          <p eId="para_123">I welcome Mr. D'Arcy.  I will be brief.  There is a lot to talk about in this report.  A lot more is being done but there remains much to be done.  Like Deputy Conlan, I will focus my questions on the issue of health.  He referred to John Compton's Transforming Your Care programme.  Enniskillen has a new state-of-the-art hospital with the potential for cross-Border working in co-operation with Sligo and Cavan hospitals.  This is not an attempt to empire-build but rather we have an opportunity to provide a quality service for people living in that region.  However, there is an issue because that hospital is not recognised by the health insurance companies.  I commend Mr. D'Arcy's report and I suggest it is circulated to all Departments, North and South with a note requesting Departments to provide a response to this committee on how they propose to address the recommendations outlined in the report.  It is a very impressive piece of work.  We can do so much more to benefit all the people on the island.</p>

          <p eId="para_126">I welcome Mr. D'Arcy to the meeting.  I also welcome his presentation and the report.  Like Deputy Conlan, I intend to read the report.  We suffer overloads sometimes, as the Chairman will confirm.  We are in receipt of so many documents on a given day and, sadly, one cannot read them all.  However, in this case it is incumbent on us to read and study it because of the region we represent.  I see merit in what Deputy Conlan said about follow-up discussions with Mr. D'Arcy as we read the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">  I will focus briefly on the area of cross-Border co-operation, the economy and the prosperity agenda that everyone can buy into, to use that phrase.  Tourism holds great potential.  We have lakeland areas and heritage sites which have been under-exploited.  There is a potential to create a branding for the area to market it abroad more effectively.  We have more potential to market our Border area.  There may be a need for some flagship events.  I refer to the impact of the all-Ireland Fleadh Cheoil held in Cavan which is difficult to quantify.  Apart from its cultural and aesthetic merits which are unquantifiable, there is the purely economic impact with €40 million coming into the area as a result.  We need to look to organise flagship events in the Border region and also to create marketing brands for the lakeland areas.  We seem to have missed out down the years.  We may be the Cinderella area in terms of the national tourism product and tourism numbers.  We have been on the periphery.  Our Chairman's County Donegal would not have suffered to the same extent.  However, in the other Border counties we are on the periphery in terms of marketing for tourism purposes.  I refer to the beauty of the Cavan-Louth area and the Fermanagh-Tyrone area.  The attractions offered by those areas were not packaged very well over the years.  I look forward to Mr. D'Arcy's comments in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_128">I welcome Mr. D'Arcy and thank him for his contribution.  I regret, however, that it seems unlikely his report will be given any real, serious consideration in the course of this meeting.  I accept that we are operating under time constraints, but it seems clear to me that the committee needs to be allowed time to give the matter further consideration.  The form that consideration might take can be discussed in private session.  By allocating only today's meeting for discussion of the report, we are not giving it due attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">  What stands out from Mr. D'Arcy's statement is his indication that all participants in the study agreed that opportunities for cross-Border co-operation in the provision of public services are being under-utilised.  He referred to several areas in which there is potential for practical co-operation, including higher education.  There have been some positive developments in this area recently, such as the co-operation at ministerial level in respect of the survey on small schools in Border areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">  Mr. D'Arcy also observed that 90 years of development has resulted in an ingrained institutional separation of public services which has the potential to block the types of initiatives he discusses in his report.  We must give careful consideration to how those difficulties can be unblocked.  Would he recommend, for example, the establishment of additional North-South bodies, for which there is scope under the Good Friday Agreement?  Earlier in this meeting we discussed the opportunities for co-operation in the area of youth work.  Is that an area in which Mr. D'Arcy sees scope for enhanced co-operation under the terms of the Agreement?</p>
          <p eId="para_131">  In regard to the overall response to his report, North and South, will Mr. D'Arcy indicate whether any individual Departments in either jurisdiction have acted on any of its recommendations?  I presume, after all, that he wrote the report on the basis that there would be follow-up on those very clear recommendations.  Have Departments been in contact with Mr. D'Arcy to discuss how they can best move forward in this regard?</p>
          <p eId="para_132">  Finally, I would appreciate if Mr. D'Arcy could expand on the economic development zone issue.  I reiterate my apology that the committee is not giving the report the consideration it deserves.  I am strongly of the view that we should have another meeting to continue our discussion of the issues raised therein.</p>

          <p eId="para_137">I thank Mr. D'Arcy for the excellent document he has produced.  Of the ten areas he has highlighted, the first and fifth seem particularly relevant.  We are all in favour of measures to support economic growth and jobs creation.  I am particularly interested in the proposal regarding an all-Ireland tourism infrastructure research project.  A concern for me in this regard is that the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Fáilte Ireland are working independently of each other.  This committee has a great opportunity to push for greater co-operation between the two bodies and the development of a single marketing plan for the island as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">  More specifically, there is great potential in the hosting of the G8 summit in County Fermanagh next year.  The marketing of that event could include information on tourist activities in, for instance, County Leitrim.  There is enormous scope in this event for tourism on both sides of the Border.</p>

          <p eId="para_140">Of course.  Fermanagh is such a beautiful county and the resort at which the meeting will be held is amazing.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">  I would like to see a greater level of co-operation generally between the two tourist groups on either side of the Border with a view to enhancing the tourism potential in both jurisdictions.  This committee supported funding for the construction of the Narrow Water Bridge in Carlingford, which is due to be up and running in 2015.  There is great potential in that development for the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Fáilte Ireland to work together to devise a joint marketing plan for the Mourne Mountains and the Cooley Peninsula.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">  There are many other opportunities for North-South co-operation, but tourism is a particularly logical and beneficial one.  It is an issue about which I am very passionate.  The committee should encourage the two tourism agencies to work together to produce a joint marketing plan for the Border area.  The hosting of the G8 summit offers an exceptional opportunity in this regard and the committee should push hard on the issue.</p>

          <from> Mr. Michael D'Arcy<recordedTime time="2012-12-13T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_146">Being a sportsman, I take that as a challenge and my response had better be good.  In case I did not mention it earlier, I should say that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is the supporter of this study.  It was commissioned by the CCBS and it is important to put that on the record.  When I was preparing this presentation and the fact that it was to be made to the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, I reread the Agreement, particularly the declaration at the start of it.  I took note of the wording of what was the task of the Agreement and I give a few selected references from it.  It states: "We are committed to partnership ... between North and South" and "we will endeavour to strive in every practical way towards reconciliation and ... agreed arrangements".  In responding to the questions, I would like members to keep that sense of agreed arrangements in the back of their minds as to what this committee and politicians in general can do.  Ultimately, when one talks about public service provision, one is talking about matters which are under the discretion of politicians and of Ministers in exercising power.  If we are to have two jurisdictions co-operating with each other, we need agreed arrangements.  In terms of the "what can we do?" question, which is always the first one that should be tackled, agreed arrangements are perhaps a good starting point.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">  I was just talking to Michelle Gildernew about the question of health and health insurance and I will start by dealing with that question.  We are talking about the NHS and the HSE in any agreed arrangements.  I am often amused when those in the South talk about economies of scale.  If we think about the NHS and about the HSE, the economies of scale are the other way around.  The benefits from this jurisdiction plugging into the NHS is to plug into those economies of scale, as they are deployed within Northern Ireland.  That is the perspective to which we need to get used.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">  The question of insurance goes to the heart of the matter when we think of what we insure against and it is against the occurrence of a catastrophe.  My life is insured.  When one talk about health insurance, there are two aspects.  One is if something goes wrong and the other is the payment mechanism when one is getting something done.  If one thinks about both, co-operation, or even co-ordination, will not be enough.  These arrangements will include collaboration.  When something goes wrong, it cannot be a case of: "Would you like to look into that, please?"  People have to come and work together to figure out how this can done.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">  In a Border context, are there different arrangements for different parts of the Border? This is a point Michelle Gildernew raised.  Is there one arrangement in Enniskillen hospital, another in Altnagelvin hospital and another in Daisy Hill Hospital?  How does that make sense?  The arrangements must be co-ordinated and coherent between all the facilities.  That is the only agreed arrangement that fundamentally makes sense, namely, that some basic principles would guide the application of the insurance right along the Border.  What was mentioned in the Compton report in this respect?  It was the fact that there happen to be three acute hospitals in the Border region on the Northern side of the Border whereas they do not have a mirror in the South.  The acute hospitals are further south.  For the convenience of people in the Border regions, tapping into that economy of scale makes a good deal of sense.  The Compton report is interesting in the sense that it allowed for the possibility that around Daisy Hill, unless patients were coming from the South to it, it would not maintain its position in terms of economies of scale within the Northern system.  That is a real challenge and opportunity in the South to put the agreed arrangements in place that would make that happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">  What is the role of politics and politicians in this?  It is to sit on that in a way, to keep asking the questions whether we should have those arrangements, where they are, how we can put them in place and how they should happen.  We are not the experts, we need to be given the answers and then we can evaluate.  That is the reason this forum is so important because the members bring both sides of that equation together.  If we were in the other committee rooms with just the public health forum operating in the South, we would get only side of the equation.  Here we have the opportunity to bring the two sides together and to seek co-ordination and coherence between them in terms of all along the Border and not just in the middle, the north west or wherever.  That is an interesting question but these are tough challenges and they are complex.  If one were to ask administrators to do this, they would have a lot of work to do.  I will come back to that question in terms of the administration and what that might involve.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">  The benefits are clearly evident.  If one looks from the top down, in terms of the element of the health budget that is within the discretion of the Northern Ireland Administration, if economies are scale are dependent upon usage, then across the health system there are benefits form acute hospitals down to centres catering for specialist conditions.  If one decides to set up centres to cater for specialist conditions on this island, be it cardiac care, a very rare form of cancer and let us say there are 100 sufferers, on the law of averages, ten of those will be in the North and 90 will be in South.  There is a choice for the patient and his or her family.  If the specialist centre is set up in the South, the choice is if they wish to have treatment in London, Liverpool or Manchester whereby they would have to board a plane or boat or if they wish to get into a car and drive North and <i>vice versa</i>.  A centre of excellence is being developed in Belfast, involving Queen's University and Belfast City Hospital around cancer care.  Is there a benefit in the South in being able to plug into a UK centre of excellence by driving in a car for the two and half hours to the North instead of boarding a plane or a boat? These are the practical issues that need to be injected by politicians into the more complex challenges of the two entities, which are engaged in enormous internal reform process and have many other things on their mind.  Unless this is pushed, I fear it will not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">  Another way this can happen is through communities.  General practitioner services are driven by patients.  As I understand it, the NHS is moving towards a more GP-paid-by-patient model, more like the model we have here.  That puts the power somewhat into the patients' hands.  If communities in the Border regions can come together to drive this again from a bottom-up approach, that would be helpful as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">  In terms of the study, it is proposed that someone should put forward a plan to do this.  There should be a plan somewhere.  If one wants to implement something, one needs a plan.  Who will be responsible for that, where is the plan, how can it be done, what are the issues around it, what are the costs involved and what are the benefits?  Those are the practical suggestions made in the study.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">  I will move on to tourism and the issues raised were interesting.  All the conversations I had were informal - Chatham House rules.  There was a sense that we have structure in that Tourism Ireland sells Ireland across the world and invites people to come to Ireland and in that way it increases its share of the pie.  We also have Fáilte Ireland and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and they compete for their share of the pie.  Structurally, one might say that is not optimal.  In answer to the specific question of how do we get around that, my practical suggestion was to ask can we move beyond the agencies to the people in the field, the providers of tourism products and services.  I thought back to the late 1980s.  Unfortunately, I can go back that far.  For a long time the tourism industry had depended on coach tours from UK and there was a desire to increase tourism from the Continent.  The industry commissioned research and asked people on the Continent what they wanted, what would bring them here in the first instance, and what would have to be invest in to provide an experience that would be worthwhile for them to travel here.  It is time to go back and think about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">The scenery is beautiful but what will someone from Beijing, for example, want to do there? What would bring them to those lakes as distinct from lakes elsewhere in Europe? We should think about the G8 summit in that context because if it is on Chinese television, that is one of the few opportunities one gets to be on mainstream Chinese television. My proposal for the people in Fermanagh, Sligo and north Leitrim is that they should not just wait. The community should mobilise and consider that ahead of the event. They should identify the gap, go to the agencies and ask them to do some research to find out if this could be more broadly popular in that market.</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> That leads me to the next question on the Border development zone. The concept of a Border development zone was first proposed by Mr. Padraic White at a conference run by Andy Pollak, and it is so self-evidently worthwhile it is something one could think might happen. I got some push back in the research from a policy perspective, however, in terms of the danger of creating another special region. There is always a risk to that. The Shannon Development region is now being wound up 30 years later because it passed its purpose. There are also the Gaeltacht regions. There is always a risk in creating specialist regions. I suggested taking another step and pushing this out to the communities. What do the 1 million people - Mr. White did the mathematics - who live within 20 miles of each side of the Border share? They share two peripheralities. They share regional peripherality within both jurisdictions and they share the peripherality of being on a border between the two jurisdictions. In terms of anything that requires a decision at the centre in Belfast or Dublin that has universal effect, why not mobilise universally to get that decision made?</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> In terms of health services, why talk about a particular case in Altnagelvin hospital which is different from Enniskillen hospital or Daisy Hill Hospital? All the groups around the Border should have a common set of principles and say to both centres that this is what is needed in the Border region. I pushed it back, so to speak.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> I was talking to Mr. Pollak during the break. The centre will launch a series of scoping studies to drill down more deeply in terms of the implementation of the zone, but regardless of the number of studies done, local leaders must come together to bring it forward. Looking around this room, obviously representatives of the Border region play an important role in sending signals. Politicians can always send critical signals to their constituents and their communities. This is important. We must step outside the local and see what we share in common if this zone is to work, and these are the issues we can work on collectively around the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> Economically, there are major distinctions. The north west is one type of economy. What is Derry doing in terms of stepping up to the plate and being the economic hub of that north-west region? In the mid-Border region there is no urban centre. It is completely peripheral and therefore people have to work harder. The eastern corridor is between Dublin and Belfast. There are the two economic poles and the motorway, and all the literature tells us that motorways can act as a powerful development tool.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> If we look outside of the area, the centre commissioned a very good study from John Bradley and Mike Best that examined business in the Border region. Again, that is taking advantage of the Border in setting up logistical services to serve the island from the Border region with the new transport network. There are opportunities in that regard. On one site a cluster of specialist food companies is developing. This is where we need to go in the future in terms of enterprise development.</p>
          <p eId="para_161"> In terms of transport, I have driven to the north west - the missing link. One drives to Galway and it is transformed. I live in Terenure. I am ten minutes from the Spawell roundabout and then all of the island, except the north west, is available to me. I used to show a map of the railway infrastructure in 1920 and it covered the entire island, and if one looks at it today, it has a big gap also. A good question for people in the north west to ask themselves is which north west are we talking about. Is it just Donegal or the broader north west? That is a real challenge and is something I hope will be corrected because it is an infrastructure gap that needs to be filled.</p>
          <p eId="para_162"> In regard to local roads, that is the legacy of history. Again, it is about agreed arrangements. Can agreed arrangements be put in place in terms of the local authorities, the National Roads Authority and the Northern Ireland counterpart to fix those problems? If there are traffic jams due to more economic activity and interaction between the communities, that builds the case. Demand should drive the necessity to upgrade the roads infrastructure. If members can show a progressive demand, that will probably help but, ultimately, agreed arrangements are what will be needed. Someone must allocate the budget to spend the money and it must be obtained from the two centres. That is the real challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> Coming back to administration, I am not talking about the joint secretariat in Armagh that essentially has become the experts in North-South interaction. It is almost like a centre of excellence in that regard. In terms of a manager in the broader public administration being given a job that involves North-South engagement, it is a risk. It is outside the day job. We do not normally engage with someone from the other jurisdiction, and it is different from going to Brussels. In Brussels, one is engaging with 27 other member states. It is a big process and a big machine. One has been geared up for it. One has got training and coaching. It is a different experience to jump into a car and drive to Belfast to meet one's counterpart in a Northern Ireland department, especially if it is on an issue outside the agreements and there is not someone from the joint secretariat present.</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> Being practical about it, there is no real incentive in that regard. Does one get an extra star on one's performance measurement by either Administration in recognition of it? Is one given any extra credit for it? One of our practical recommendations is that there should be a handbook and more support given generally across the system if implementation is to work. Politics and politicians have an important role to show the systems that this is important and that it must be recognised. If they ask for the work to be done, they must recognise there is a need for the benefits to be acknowledged, both for the individual as well as for the system as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_165"> In terms of the agreements, that is a political task. I would make two suggestions. It was interesting that in all the conversations I had with people, two aspects set the tone. The first was when I suggested that this was about thinking about the choices. Decisions in politics are about choices in terms of where the money goes and where and how reform will occur that will still have a significant effect in 2022 when a child who is 11 years old today is 21, because the political horizon is always relatively short. It is about the opportunity to think into the future, particularly in a crisis. That was a useful space that people went into.</p>
          <p eId="para_166"> The second was when I spoke about the full spectrum of North-South interaction because very often we just hear the narrative, but the Chairman understands that there is a single electricity market on this island. I like the way he referred to a single energy market. That is my suggestion, but technically it is still a single electricity market which makes a difference because gas is outside it, for example. That is a very important matter if we consider the energy security of the island. Gas is being piped in from the west coast which might mean that the entire island would not be dependent on that one pipeline from Scotland for its gas. For those of us who use gas in their homes, it would make quite a difference not to have it. The sense of energy security we get there is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_167"> We have the agreements, the cross-Border bodies, InterTradeIreland and Tourism Ireland, which has a dotted line relationship to the agreements. We have NAMA, which is outside the agreements. We have the co-operation that takes place between the security forces, the co-operation on tackling diesel laundering and beyond that the money that goes to sport and cultural organisations that operate on an all-island basis. If we embrace the full spectrum of that, that is a fair degree of activity, but it is very rarely brought together and examined in its totality and as a challenge for the two jurisdictions in terms of doing things and moving them on.</p>
          <p eId="para_168"> I might pose questions rather than answer the Deputy's questions. Are we going about dealing with that and progressing that full spectrum of activity efficiently and effectively?</p>
          <p eId="para_169">Are the agreed arrangements that are in place up to that challenge? Are they up to it in an EU context, in particular? When preparing for today's meeting I rang a couple of economist friends who told me the biggest existential threat to what has been achieved is that of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union. This has been discussed seriously in London. With regard to the practical movement of people and goods on this island, we could return once again to having a border. It is unlikely that there will be halfway houses. In this regard, one should consider the consequences of a return to our position in 1989 and 1990 before the Single Market programme, bearing in mind the status of the United Kingdom and the question of the Scottish referendum.</p>
          <p eId="para_170"> Despite these considerations, the European Union is moving on with regard to energy and water. A single EU energy market is approaching. It is really important and there is work going on in this regard. There is a success story in the form of the single electricity market because it involves insured investment. It provides regulatory certainty and has led to lower prices for consumers in Northern Ireland and the Republic. This is challenged by the wider market, into which there must be integration. How do we continue to have success? While there is work taking place at technical level, is there enough awareness among the wider population and business community, who are concerned about energy prices, that holding onto that benefit is one of the important challenges faced by the two Administrations? While there is work at administrative level, are there agreed arrangements between the relevant Ministers that are ambitious and forward-looking in that regard?</p>
          <p eId="para_171"> With regard to new relationships, the most striking phenomenon in the past 20 years has been the relationships between politicians and decision makers generally. I was involved in an initiative in the noughties, the North-South round table group, which had a role in founding and facilitating that development. We were working with very few relationships at the beginning. Now, anybody present can telephone a representative in Northern Ireland, even if he does not know him. There are no barriers in this regard. We forget that this was not possible ten or 15 years ago. We must consider how this arrangement is being leveraged and how personal trust is being used to take account of the new challenges facing each generation. What is the practical evidence? Are public representatives talking to their constituents enough about this matter? What message is being given to them about the benefits of North-South co-operation?</p>
          <p eId="para_172"> Let us consider the challenge of prosperity and the need for initiatives. If one stands still in sport, one actually goes backwards. I could quote any number of examples from Arsène Wenger this morning. He stood still for a decade and now has gone back. I am a rugby person. There will be 50,000 people in the Aviva Stadium for an upcoming Leinster game but when I played for Leinster, the spectators amounted to no more than ten men and their dog. One cannot stand still and one must move forward. We must examine the extent to which the agreements and interactions are helping in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> Economists love charting trends with tables and indices. One wakes up every morning and hears the markets have moved or that the price of gilts has decreased, resulting in another crisis. Let us imagine a chart of North-South interaction on new arrangements from 1993 to date. Imagine also a steady line for arrangements on the agreement and a broken line for arrangements outside the agreement. For 1993, there would be only a broken line, rising slowly. For 1998, the unbroken line would shoot up because of the agreements and all the arrangements, resulting in the disappearance of the broken line. For the period 1998 to 2002, the line depicting new arrangements and the agreement would gradually decrease. For 2007, the broken line would shoot up suddenly, with the kicking in of the single energy market. NAMA was established shortly thereafter.</p>
          <p eId="para_174"> Let us imagine the chart in 2022. Imagining that we currently have a value of ten, we must ask whether anyone is setting a target for new arrangements such that we will be at 50 in 2022. What should the target be? The economist in me would like to leave members with this observation.</p>

          <p eId="para_175">As much as the members, including me, would like to contribute further, we must acknowledge that we are under pressure as there is another meeting.  The delegation has been more than welcome.  We must really consider how we follow up on the economic side.  Mr. D'Arcy's message is a refreshing intervention.  He has asked us to determine exactly how we take stock of what is occurring.  We certainly value his input.  I look forward to reading the report.</p>
