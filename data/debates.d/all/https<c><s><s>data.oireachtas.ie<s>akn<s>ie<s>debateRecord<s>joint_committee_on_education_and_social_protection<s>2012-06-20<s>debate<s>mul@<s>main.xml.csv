Apologies have been received from Deputies Brendan Ryan and Barry Cowen.  The first item on the agenda is the election of the Chairman.  I invite nominations for the position.

The nomination, then, is really a handshake.  It is not really a nomination.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	18	The nomination of the Chairman is exclusively a matter for the members of the committee.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	22	I have one nomination for Chairman at present, and I am seeking other nominations, if there are any.
#MarieLouiseODonnell	unknown-#MarieLouiseODonnell-party	unknown-#MarieLouiseODonnell-dob	unknown-#MarieLouiseODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I was under the impression that the Labour Party and Fine Gael Government decided who the Chairman was to be.  Am I wrong on this?
#JimDarcy	unknown-#JimDarcy-party	unknown-#JimDarcy-dob	unknown-#JimDarcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	24	The Senator is asking the question.

#JimDarcy	unknown-#JimDarcy-party	unknown-#JimDarcy-dob	unknown-#JimDarcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	26	Yes, and I am waiting for the answer.
#MaryMitchellOConnor	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-party	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-dob	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	27	Senator O'Donnell can nominate somebody now, if she wants to.
#MarieLouiseODonnell	unknown-#MarieLouiseODonnell-party	unknown-#MarieLouiseODonnell-dob	unknown-#MarieLouiseODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	28	No, I do not want to nominate anybody.  I am asking about the process.  The process is that the Government actually chooses the Chairman and we are here to validate it.
#MaryMitchellOConnor	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-party	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-dob	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	29	No.  I have just nominated Deputy Joanna Tuffy.
#MarieLouiseODonnell	unknown-#MarieLouiseODonnell-party	unknown-#MarieLouiseODonnell-dob	unknown-#MarieLouiseODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	30	That is fine.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	31	Are there any other nominations?  No.  As there are no other nominations, I declare Deputy Joanna Tuffy Chairman of the joint committee and invite her to take the Chair.Deputy Joanna Tuffy took the Chair.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	32	I thank members for electing me as Chairman.  It is a great honour to chair this committee and I look forward to working with everybody.  I thank Deputy Mitchell O'Connor for nominating me and Senator Healy Eames for seconding my nomination.  This is a new committee which will cover the Departments of Education and Skills and Social Protection, both of which are important Departments in terms of expenditure.  It will deal with the nitty gritty of our role as legislators because much of our work concerns issues of education and social welfare.  In education we must try to ensure people reach their best potential and with social welfare we must ensure everybody has a safety net in hard times and can find work through labour market activation measures.I see this committee as a team that makes up an important part of the infrastructure of the Oireachtas by influencing policy development.  In the coming months I want to work with members on the development of policy in areas in which they are interested.  I hope everybody will have an input to the development of our work programme and deliberations.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	33	Standing Orders state that as soon as may be after the election of a Chairman every committee shall elect one of its members to be Vice Chairman.  I invite nominations for the position of Vice Chairman.
#MarieMoloney	unknown-#MarieMoloney-party	unknown-#MarieMoloney-dob	unknown-#MarieMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	34	I nominate Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin as Vice Chairman.
#RayButler	unknown-#RayButler-party	unknown-#RayButler-dob	unknown-#RayButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	35	I second the nomination of Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin as Vice Chairman.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	36	Are there any other nominations?  No.  As there are no other nominations I declare Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin elected as Vice Chairman.  I congratulate the Deputy and look forward to working with him.
#AodhanORiordan	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-party	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-dob	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	37	I enjoyed my time as Vice Chairman of the previous committee and look forward to working with the Chair and other members.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	38	The next matter on the agenda is the selection of meeting times for the joint committee.  Joint committees meet on a weekly basis and select sub-committees shadowing individual Departments meet when Bills, Estimates, motions and other matters are referred to them under their terms of reference.  A select committee meeting will be held on the conclusion of this meeting to decide the membership of our select sub-committees.  I propose that the joint committee shall continue to meet on Wednesday mornings at a new start time of 10 a.m. instead of 9.30 a.m. and that the select sub-committees shall meet at 10 a.m. on Thursdays when matters are referred to them.  Are the proposed arrangements agreed?
#RayButler	unknown-#RayButler-party	unknown-#RayButler-dob	unknown-#RayButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	39	That does not suit me at all because I have other commitments.  Wednesday afternoons between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. would be more agreeable to many members.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	40	One of our difficulties is that the meeting rooms are occupied by other committees on Wednesday afternoons.  As this is a new committee, we are left with the time slots that are available.  Our previous time slot was 9.30 a.m. to 1 p.m. but I believe 10 a.m. is a preferable start time.  Certain meetings will take place at other times.  For example, we will be taking legislation next Tuesday and Thursday afternoons.  A certain amount of flexibility will be required but the only time that is open to us consistently is on Wednesday mornings.
#RayButler	unknown-#RayButler-party	unknown-#RayButler-dob	unknown-#RayButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	41	As I will be unable to make that time due to family commitments, I will have to resign from the committee.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	42	We are supposed to be here at 10.30 a.m. in any event.  As committee meetings will go on longer than that, if members are late they will still be able to attend them.
#MarieMoloney	unknown-#MarieMoloney-party	unknown-#MarieMoloney-dob	unknown-#MarieMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	43	I do not think 10 a.m. on Wednesday morning is suitable given that the Order of Business is taken in the Seanad at 10.30 a.m.  Senators are required to attend the Order of Business.  I do not see why we cannot commence at 9 a.m. or 9.30 a.m.  We are here anyway on Wednesdays.
#AodhanORiordan	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-party	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-dob	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	44	The previous committee had this conversation at length and came to the conclusion that 9.30 a.m. was a suitable time.  It would allow us to meet for an hour before business commences in the Houses.  Even though it initially proved difficult to get people in at 9.30 a.m., it eventually worked to good effect.  It is not an unreasonable time to expect members to be here and I suggest it as a starting time.
#RayButler	unknown-#RayButler-party	unknown-#RayButler-dob	unknown-#RayButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	45	Is there not a slot between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. on Wednesdays?
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	46	The meeting rooms are unavailable between those times.
#FidelmaHealyEames	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-party	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-dob	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	47	I am agreeable in principle to 9.30 a.m. and 10 a.m.  However, my difficulty is that the previous committee continued with its business when votes were taking place in the Seanad, although it suspended for Dáil votes.  The value of this committee is that it is a joint committee which comprises Senators and Deputies with considerable expertise in these areas.  I propose that the committee should suspend for votes in either House.  If meetings start at 10 a.m. members would be facilitated if they had to leave for a vote.
#AverilPower	unknown-#AverilPower-party	unknown-#AverilPower-dob	unknown-#AverilPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	48	In an ideal world I would second a proposal to meet on Wednesday afternoons.  I suggest instead that we meet before the Houses sit on Tuesdays.
#FidelmaHealyEames	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-party	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-dob	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	49	That is impossible for members travelling up from the country.
#AverilPower	unknown-#AverilPower-party	unknown-#AverilPower-dob	unknown-#AverilPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	50	Everything else in the House is organised around the need to travel up from the country.  The previous start time of 9.30 a.m. did not work for a number of members.
#JimDarcy	unknown-#JimDarcy-party	unknown-#JimDarcy-dob	unknown-#JimDarcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	51	It did not work for Dublin people.  The country people were always here on time.
#AverilPower	unknown-#AverilPower-party	unknown-#AverilPower-dob	unknown-#AverilPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	52	That is because Dublin people have other commitments before they come to the Houses.  The same applies on Tuesday and Wednesday nights when Dublin people want to work in their constituencies.  A balance needs to be struck.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	53	We will keep the matter under review.  We can only get a room on Wednesday mornings at present.  A working group of committee Chairs decides the arrangements and we will discuss the matter further.We can deal with the matter raised by Senator Healy Eames on a case-by-case basis.  I was a member of another committee which did not always suspend for votes in the Dáil.  If it is appropriate we would suspend for a Seanad vote.  If a meeting was about to conclude, members might not want to suspend it at that stage.
#FidelmaHealyEames	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-party	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-dob	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	54	All I ask is that an equal value be given to both Houses.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	55	That is a fair point.  Do members agree on the 10 a.m. time slot?
#RayButler	unknown-#RayButler-party	unknown-#RayButler-dob	unknown-#RayButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	56	No.
#AodhanORiordan	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-party	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-dob	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	57	I suggest that 9.30 a.m. is a viable option that should be considered.
#RayButler	unknown-#RayButler-party	unknown-#RayButler-dob	unknown-#RayButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	58	Meeting at 9.30 a.m. or 10 a.m. does not make a difference to me.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	59	If the majority of members are in favour of 9.30 a.m., I am agreeable to it.
#RayButler	unknown-#RayButler-party	unknown-#RayButler-dob	unknown-#RayButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	60	I cannot believe there is no slot available on Wednesday afternoon.  I look at the monitors any Wednesday afternoon and these committee rooms are empty.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	61	Actually, they are not.  There are only four committee rooms and there is great demand on Wednesday afternoon.  We have been shown the table with the available timeslots.  Wednesday afternoons are not generally available and the time available to this committee is Wednesday morning.  We can keep the matter under review.
#FidelmaHealyEames	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-party	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-dob	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	62	Bearing in mind what Deputy Butler is saying, we would all like to be facilitated at the optimum time.  Given that there is not a slot available on Wednesday afternoon, do the Chairs meet at a particular time to agree the slots and the space available?  Could we put a call on a Wednesday afternoon slot at that point?
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	63	Yes, we can certainly raise it at that stage.  We must ensure it is agreeable to everyone.  A Tuesday afternoon slot might not suit some people if they have the parliamentary party meetings at that time.  Many issues are involved and there are generally no meetings of parliamentary parties on Wednesday mornings.  These points need to be borne in mind.
#AodhanORiordan	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-party	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-dob	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	64	Some members of this committee were not members of the previous committee and I understand that people have different points of view.  In the previous committee, the meeting was at 9.30 a.m.  We got used to that time and it worked.  If we are going to work, the morning is the best time.  Attendance at committees can be a problem at every committee.  I do not say that I am better than anyone else.  If we are trying to get work done, 9.30 a.m. is one hour before the Houses sit and it worked best for the previous committee.  I do not really see the reason to move from 9.30 a.m to 10 a.m., notwithstanding the difficulties Deputy Butler is having.  A half hour at that time can make all the difference.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	65	Is it agreed that we meet at 9.30 a.m on Wednesday morning?  I can put it to a division if people want.
#JimDarcy	unknown-#JimDarcy-party	unknown-#JimDarcy-dob	unknown-#JimDarcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	66	We were trying to seek compromise on this point.  Deputy Butler cannot be here at 10 a.m.  The Chairman said he might be able to attend half an hour of the meeting.  It is not very accommodating for anyone to propose 9.30 a.m., given the difficulties that have been expressed.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	67	The original proposal was for 10 a.m.
#FidelmaHealyEames	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-party	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-dob	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	68	We should proceed on that basis.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	69	I propose that we agree with the Chairman's suggestion and, in the meantime, the Chairman can see if it is feasible to get a slot on Wednesday afternoon in view of members' concerns.  We will leave it with the Chairman to work out an arrangement.
#FidelmaHealyEames	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-party	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-dob	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	70	That is a reasonable proposal and I second it.
#MarieMoloney	unknown-#MarieMoloney-party	unknown-#MarieMoloney-dob	unknown-#MarieMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	71	There are two proposals - one is 9.30 a.m., the other is 10 a.m.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	72	We can proceed on that basis.  We will write to the working group of Chairs of committees and ask for a slot on Wednesday afternoon.  Is it agreed to meet at 10 a.m.?  Agreed.  The meeting time will be the same for the select committee on Thursday.
#MarieLouiseODonnell	unknown-#MarieLouiseODonnell-party	unknown-#MarieLouiseODonnell-dob	unknown-#MarieLouiseODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	73	I was unaware the committee membership had changed.  I thought only the committees had been divided.  I thought I was on the wrong committee because there are new members of this committee.  They are extremely welcome.  I thought the committees were splitting, with the personnel remaining the same.  That has changed, for the better.
#FidelmaHealyEames	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-party	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-dob	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	74	To clarify, this is the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection, not just the education committee.
#MarieLouiseODonnell	unknown-#MarieLouiseODonnell-party	unknown-#MarieLouiseODonnell-dob	unknown-#MarieLouiseODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	75	Many people are missing.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	76	A number of changes have been made to committees and it affects many committees.  A vote on committee personnel was taken a number of weeks ago in the Dáil and Seanad.  The changes were voted upon by Members.It is my intention to work with committee members on a work programme.  That will come up at the next available agenda.  I would like all members to have an input into it.  I hope the committee will be based on developing policy in the areas of education and social protection.  I hope we try to influence the policy of the Oireachtas and the Government through our contribution.  Our next joint meeting will be a private meeting to discuss the work programme.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.I ask Deputies to return to this room at 10.30 a.m. for a second short meeting to elect members onto the select sub-committee to deal with Bills and referrals from the Dáil.
