        <speech by="#DarraghOBrien" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Senator Darragh O’Brien</from>
          <p eId="para_15">I am glad to hear some of my colleagues are on board in my campaign to halt the monster sewage treatment plant project in north County Dublin.  Perhaps the reason is boundary reviews are due to be undertaken soon.  I raised the matter with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, in a good debate on public expenditure a number of months ago in which he committed to review the project, which will cost €2.1 billion.  I ask the Leader to use his good offices and follow up on the matter with the Minister to see if the review has started.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">I was concerned, as were a number of people who contacted me today, to read the piece in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> and listen to the interview with the chairman of the Labour Party, Deputy Keaveney, on Newstalk, in which he stated clearly that should Ireland require a second round of funding — he used the words “in the unlikely event”, but most of us would agree that we will require it — the decision on whether to accept it or the Labour Party should proceed in government would have to go before Labour Party members.  I voice a note of caution for the Labour Party.  We dealt with such a group in the previous Government when the Green Party Ministers had to go back to party members every time they wanted to agree to an order of business.  That is not the way to do it, as the Government has a mandate.  Deputy Keaveney mentioned that the Government had inherited the memorandum of understanding; it did not.  The Government renegotiated.  It made great play of the fact that it had renegotiated the most recent one — the July memorandum of understanding.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">Recently there was a vote on how the European Union should proceed on the ESM and the fiscal stability treaty during the course of which debate we spoke about the importance of stability, both within Europe and the country.  I genuinely do not believe comments such as those made by Deputy Keaveney are helpful in carrying out the job of government.  He stated effectively that at the end of 2013 they would be going back to Labour Party members to decide on whether they should remain in government.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, should be requested to come here to clarify whether the formal position of the Labour Party is as enunciated by the chairman of the Labour Party.  If that is the case, it will introduce a large degree of uncertainty between now and when we exit the programme at the end of 2013 in that every month we will be wondering what is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">I would have thought it was a most unhelpful comment.  I also thought it was not coincidental that the Tánaiste, because of Government business, was not at the Labour Party Parliamentary Party meeting when the matter was raised.  However, it needs to be clarified, as it is a concern.  I say to my Labour Party colleagues that policy cannot be driven by popularity ratings in polls.  As the Labour Party is teetering on single digits, it seems its members are a little nervous.</p>

          <p eId="para_21">As the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, will be in the House to take the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2011, I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that we allow him 30 minutes to update us on the Government's response in the ongoing dispute at Lagan Brick in Kingscourt.  The employees who number more than 20 have been on strike for nearly six months and we have heard nothing from the Government on what is being done to assist them.  As the discussion on the Competition (Amendment) Bill should not continue too long, I suggest the Leader provide 20 or 30 minutes to allow the Minister to discuss the serious issue of workers' rights and how the workers are being treated at Lagan Brick.</p>

          <p eId="para_35">I welcome the Amnesty International 70 page report, Deadly Reprisals, which it compiled by sending its brave members on the ground to dangerous and difficult places in Syria.  They did this work at the risk of death and have confirmed, as the organisation can do given its status as an international organisation, that it is state policy to overthrow those opposed to the government.  Amnesty International has established that at least 10,000 people, mainly men and boys, have been killed since March 2011.  Each time I stand in the Chamber I raise the matter of Syria.  I urge the Government to keep it to the forefront of our efforts.  It is nothing short of disgraceful what is happening in Syria.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">I support the Leader on the Seanad Public Consultation Committee hearings planned for next week on the subject of cancer.  They will deal with how we, as a society, can get a clear message across on how we can reduce the number of cancers.  The evidence is incontrovertible.  Some 30% of the most common cancers can be prevented.  There is the unwelcome news from the World Health Organization that diesel fumes give rise to a 40% greater risk.  This raises a serious question, if the risk is heightened so much by diesel fumes.  This research was published yesterday by the International Agency for Research on Cancer and while I suspect it will not form part of our discussions next week, it should at least be in our minds.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">I seek clarification of the position on Cregg House in Sligo, which matter has been raised in the House previously.  I have taken advice this morning from the HSE and seek an assurance for those using Cregg House which offers services for those with intellectual disabilities that they will continue to be provided, despite the fact that the Daughters of Wisdom have stated they will withdraw in the longer term, in order that there will be no short-term risk to those using the services, their families and staff.  I seek clarification from the Minister on the deficit of €1.3 million with which Cregg House cannot cope.  The HSE states that this deficit is not necessary.  The truth lies somewhere in between.  We need to know what is happening in order that services at Cregg House can continue to be provided and rooted in the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">I wish the Irish team the best of luck today as it prepares to play Spain.  It will, I am sure, be a difficult match, but we wish it well.  As spokesperson on agriculture, I also wish those involved in the Taste of Dublin festival well today.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_20">
          <from>Senator David Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_39">I express concern about No. 1 on the Order Paper in which it is stated there will be no Order of Business on Tuesday next.  Unless the Leader is able to give a satisfactory explanation, I shall vote against the Order of Business today.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">Would the Leader be kind enough to clarify for me a serious report I have received?  Apparently, there was a programme on Channel 10 News in Israel on which it was stated they had in their possession a communiqué to Jerusalem from the deputy Israeli ambassador, Ms Nurit Tinari Modai, in which she stated they should be working against Israeli activists supporting Palestinian human rights.  I have worked with many of these groups, including Professor Gideon Halper and the Rabbis for Human Rights.  I want the Leader to ask the Government to establish the credibility of this communiqué because if true, it is extremely serious.  Ms Modai suggests undermining, attacking and shaming these activists, publishing their names and photographs and suggesting they are working for Mossad, a move that would certainly expose them to considerable danger.  According to media reports, she states it is possible to obtain the name of Israeli activists and Israel should "try to hit [the activists'] soft underbellies, to publish their photographs". This, she wrote, might "cause embarrassment for their friends in Israel and their family" and sow suspicion among non-Israeli activists that "they may actually be working on behalf of Mossad". Significantly and worryingly she states: "The activity of those activists against the state is, in my evaluation, not necessarily ideological (!) but grounded in psychological reasons, (generally of disappointment with the parents, [or] sexual identity problems) or the need to obtain a residency visa in one of the countries in Europe."  I am well aware of the circumstances and if the deputy Israeli ambassador is sending these types of communiqués, we have real cause for concern about the activities of the Israeli embassy.  I seek clarification on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_41">I strongly support the view expressed by Senator Susan O'Keeffe on Cregg House, which I visited during a tour of the country last year.  I was immensely impressed by the work done there, the professionalism and expertise of its staff, the caring atmosphere at the facility and the happiness of the people who are using it.  I did not see any waste of money and saw nothing but devotion and professionalism.  Some of those using the resource are extremely vulnerable people whose lives have been made immeasurably better by the combination of the Daughters of Wisdom and the State.  While I did not see a single nun on my visit, I gather an elderly nun lives at the centre.  I understand, however, that the nuns have effectively had to pull out because of a decline in numbers.  One must pay tribute to them for the work they did in establishing this wonderful facility.  I pay particular tribute to the staff who continue to work there.  They are of the highest international standard.  If we allow the vulnerable to be attacked in this way, it would be a major reproach.  I compliment Senator O'Keeffe on raising this important matter from the Government benches and will support her in anything she wishes to do to help to ensure Cregg House continues to operate.  I am sure those using the service and their relatives will be reassured by the Senator's clear statement that there is no immediate prospect of disturbance to the facility's users.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulBradford" eId="spk_21">
          <from>Senator Paul Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_42">I very much appreciate that Senator Norris is genuine in his comments on human rights in the Middle East.  However, we sometimes fail to see, particular in respect of Israel, that there is another side to the story.  While the Senator's worries need to be taken seriously, I am not convinced the Israeli deputy ambassador is any way responsible for any of the types of activities described.  To respond to his comments on homophobia, it is fair to point out that the only country in the entire Middle East where a gay person can feel safe, secure, wanted and welcome is the State of Israel.</p>

Senator Averil Power from my party is raising an issue about north County Dublin.  Everyone is making way for the various eventualities.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">I second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by the leader of my party, Senator Darragh O'Brien, on the Lagan Brick dispute, which is now six months old.  Although it commenced on the same day as the Vita Cortex dispute, it has not received anything like the same publicity as the latter.  The affected workers, who are from counties Meath, Cavan and Monaghan, are suffering and have been badly treated.  The discussion of the Competition (Amendment) Bill is an opportune moment for the Minister to outline to the House the Government's response to the dispute and the hardship Lagan Brick workers are suffering.  This is important because the men in question — the group is primarily made up of men — have not received the support they require from various arms of the State.  I have raised the matter on the Adjournment and my colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, has raised it in the other House and the response in both cases has been less than satisfactory.  The House must discuss this dispute as it has gone on for too long.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">I call to mind the workers in Panda Waste in County Meath where a major fire broke out last night.  I understand people living near the facility have been affected by smoke, although it seems no one was injured.  Conscious that the company is a major employer in the area, I hope things will go well for it in the period ahead.</p>

This meeting has not yet taken place, which is not the fault of the Minister of State.  I ask the Leader to contact the Minister of State on this matter and ensure the meeting is held.  Senator Tom Sheahan raised this important issue on the Order of Business yesterday and on Tuesday.  Given that the banks are now owned by citizens, they have a duty to appear before us and make the presentation we seek.  I ask the Leader to pursue this matter on behalf of small businesses.</p>

          <p eId="para_61">I refer to the national procurement service and the control it exerts over public bodies in the seeking of tenders.  Last month, three local authorities, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, South County Dublin and Fingal county councils, were criticised for awarding a €750,000 contract for the supply of library books to a British company.  While the reasons for awarding the contract are understandable, it means an Irish company which tendered at a price only 1% or approximately €7,000 higher than the winning tender lost out and ten people will lose their jobs.  I am not certain if those figures are correct.</p>
          <p eId="para_62">I understand we do not have the freedom to award contracts to companies on the basis that they are Irish.  In conversation with people in France I learned that French public bodies are a little smarter than their Irish counterparts.  Apparently, they do not require contracts worth below a certain threshold — perhaps €25,000 — to go to public tender.  This allows them to break down a contract into a series of small tenders valued below the threshold.  While they are acting in a self-interested manner, it is also a smarter approach than that which is taken here.   I would like to draw attention to the fact that while we want best value for money, we want to maintain jobs in Ireland as well.  Whenever we have the chance, perhaps we could act in a smarter way by reducing the amount of tenders to the amount that does not necessarily apply under European rules.  It is something we should take into account.</p>

          <p eId="para_72">It was announced yesterday that resource teaching time for children with learning difficulties is being reduced by 15 minutes per week, or 5%.  This is on top of the 10% cutback from last year, which means each child with a special need will lose 45 minutes of learning support.  I have spoken to many teachers in Waterford over the last few months and years on this issue, and they are very concerned that children with special needs are not getting the attention, care and support they need.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">We can all have differences of opinion on the cuts being put in place by this Government, but surely the State should be able to shield children with special needs from cuts.  Surely they should be saved from the kind of cuts to which everybody else is being subjected.  If we cannot shield children with special needs, then I believe we are failing as a State.  To add insult to injury, this is part of the troika arrangement which capped the number of learning support and special needs teachers at 9,950.  So when the IMF comes into town and tells us that we are meeting all of its targets, it is also referring to these targets where we are putting caps on the number of learning support teachers and making sure that children with special needs are not getting the support they need.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">The savings that are to be made by this decision are quite small.  Surely the money could be found elsewhere and we should be able to protect special needs.  The Minister said that he was quite satisfied that this was a very small reduction, but he has taken that reduction in isolation, because we have to look at the reduction last year and the year before, and the cumulative effect that these reductions are having on some of the most vulnerable children in this State.  It is time to have a real debate in this House about special educational needs, the resources available and the cutbacks that are having an impact on the most vulnerable in our schools.</p>

I will be very interested to hear what the Leader has to say about this, although I appreciate that it is a topical issue that has just come before him.  Senator O'Keeffe will know that all eight Oireachtas representatives for the Sligo-North Leitrim constituency have met with the relevant Minister on this issue.  Senator O'Keeffe has not been behind the door in going to the media on each and every occasion in respect of Cregg House, so I find it a little strange that she is now asking the leader of her own Government on its position on Cregg House, when she knows it full well.  There are difficulties with the deficit and with governance in Cregg House that have to be resolved.  The Senator will also know that when we went on that delegation to the Minister, he made it quite clear that the Government was not going to take up the slack on the issue.  There is a responsibility on the Government to take some action on the deficit.  It is difficult to see the Senator wringing her hands and asking the Leader what should or should not be done, when she knows full well what should be done for Cregg House.  It is a sad situation and the nuns have had no choice whatsoever but to take the action they are taking.  Senator O'Keeffe will again be aware of that.</p>

          <p eId="para_97">I call for a debate on obstacles to employment creation.  We heard much about the so-called ESRI report, whether it was factual or otherwise, but we must be concerned by a report in this morning's newspaper that in the past five years a restaurateur has failed to attract any application for seasonal employment from an unemployed person.  Despite the fact that the restaurateur is prepared to pay well over the minimum wage, he cannot attract anyone in receipt of social welfare benefits.  That is a serious matter at a time when there are 450,000 unemployed.  We must have a forthright discussion on the issues that are causing people to remain on social welfare payments as distinct from taking up part-time employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_98">I welcome this morning's announcement by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, that 37 business development managers are being appointed to community enterprise centres throughout the country, three of them in my county.

In Ballinasloe, Tuam and Galway city we very much welcome the fact that new possibilities will be created for people through these centres that are doing such good work.  I wish to refer, in particular, to the centre in my town which has already created 180 jobs.  We hope to see this number rise to well over 200 in the coming months.</p>

          <p eId="para_99">I express concern about the third leak of a sensitive report on the Irish economy from Germany's Parliament in just over six months which the European Commission has described as "extremely regrettable, unfortunate and irresponsible".  I do not wish to draw inappropriate comparisons, but students of history will remember how Bismarck adjusted the wording of a particular telegram, the Ems telegram, in order to heighten tensions between France and Germany in the run-up to the Franco-Prussian War.  I am not trying to cast aspersions on the intent in this case, but the Germans should know their history and the German Parliament should know that this kind of thing is not conducive to good relationships between countries, particularly at a time when Germany holds the whip hand to such a degree in Europe and people are concerned about the "Germanisation" of European policy.  Smaller countries, in particular, are understandably sensitive that they find themselves in a position of vulnerability where their financial and economic affairs are now subject to scrutiny in foreign parliaments.  That is all the more reason parliamentarians should act with responsibility and decorum.  This is not only extremely regrettable but also potentially very harmful to this country's interests, the interests of the European Union as a whole and the necessary harmony between member states at a time of crisis.  Mr. Dan O'Brien, writing in <i>The Irish Times</i> today, makes the valid point that if there had been such leaks in the run-up to the Belfast Agreement, no agreement would have been possible.  Three times is three times too many.  The Government must take the lead in communicating its views, not just to the European Union and the European Commission but also to the German Government and ask it to communicate its displeasure at what has happened for a third time to the German Parliament.  I hope there will be an end to the leaks.</p>

The problem is of long standing and in Gaza, in particular, little progress has been made in finding a solution to the problem.  As I indicated previously in the House, Gaza is a strip of land stretching for 35 miles — the same distance from Cork to Youghal — and 10 miles wide, with 1.5 million people locked inside it.

Israel is the fourth biggest manufacturer of arms and munitions, yet it imported €1.4 billion worth of munitions from the United States in a four year period.  We should discuss why very little work is being done at a European or an international level to restrict the work being done by people who are making large sums of money out of conflict.  That is an issue to be considered also.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">I refer to the level of absenteeism in the health service.  It is an issue we must examine.  We have a problem with absenteeism in certain categories.  I will quote two figures.</p>

Absenteeism among the medical profession, wherein some people work 60 to 70 hours per week, is less than 1% whereas the level is as high as 5.7% among management and general support staff.  These figures do not add up.  It is about time we held a serious debate on the issue.  People are getting full pay while on sick leave.  No changes have been made despite the restricted funds we have available for health care.  We need to get value for money.

          <p eId="para_121">Yesterday morning, I attended the publication of the Women's Aid 2011 annual statistics report.  As many Senators know, Women's Aid is the national organisation providing support and information to women experiencing domestic violence.  It has the only free national domestic violence helpline, with specialised and trained staff and an interpretation service covering 170 languages.  I was fascinated to learn that we could provide such a service.  Women's Aid offers a Dublin-based one-to-one support service and a court accompaniment service.  It also refers women to local refuges and support services throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">Women using the organisation's helpline disclosed 13,000 incidents of physical, emotional, sexual and financial abuse in 2011.  There were 2,000 disclosures of direct emotional, physical and sexual abuse of children in homes where mothers are being abused.  This is a 25% increase on the previous year's figure.  Ms Margaret Martin stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_123">1 in 5 women in Ireland are affected by physical, emotional, sexual and financial abuse.  The sad fact is that it can happen to any woman, in any home and at any stage in her life.  In 2011, women disclosed that they were punched, slapped, kicked, held down and strangled and beaten with household items.  Women told us that they were constantly belittled, criticised, blamed and stalked and harassed via technology both during the relationship and after leaving.</p>

The Commission must take responsibility and take action against the Bundestag, which does not deserve to receive another report unless it commits to preventing leaks without the agreement of all EU committees.  Our finance committee received the report from the Commission at the same time.  This situation is not good enough.  It is important the Leader asks the Tánaiste and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Creighton, to convey our concerns.  If every European parliament behaved in that way, we would never get anything done.  I agree with Senator Mullen, in that work should be done quietly until an agreement or decision is reached.

I feel strongly on this matter and I am seeking a debate with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, even though there has been no reform.  According to recent information, taxation receipts have increased dramatically in the past five months, but our expenditure has exceeded targets by 3.6%.  Between 2009 and 2011, the previous Government set targets to reduce the public service pay bill by 4% on an annualised basis.  The current Government has lowered that target to 1.75% during the next three years.  It is doing precisely what it recommended should not be done when it was in opposition, namely, trying to tax itself out of the current difficulty.  We are taking money out of the productive economy and hard-pressed home owners who are trying to meet their mortgage repayments to pay for the public service and unsustainable social welfare rates that are far beyond those found in other EU countries.  This situation cannot continue, given the fact our economy lacks competitiveness.</p>

I apologise if I make this a personal issue but I do so as the parent of a child with a disability and representing many people with disabilities in my area.  Recently, respite services for children with disabilities were reduced to ten days out of every 30 with no prospect of respite services for the immediate future due to a €1.5 million cutback this year and €4.5 million over the past several years.  It is imperative that services are available for our most vulnerable and youngest children with disabilities.  I recently heard someone ask why we need to pay nurses to watch over children when they sleep.  As the parent of a child who sleeps at most three hours a night, respite is my lifeline.  We talk about trying to encourage women into politics.  Oireachtas life does not particularly lend itself to being a homemaker.  It makes it especially hard when one is coping with a child with a disability.</p>

They were told the best solution for them would be to move into a nursing home where the average age would be 70 years.  No one would like to see a 37 year old told this is all that is left for him or her.  We need to examine our disability services and ensure the money follows the patient.  There have been cutbacks in many disability organisations.  Many of them cannot cut back any more.</p>

          <p eId="para_182">There seems to be no consistency in how District Court judges determine maintenance payments when families split up.  In many cases in Roscommon which involve couples on social welfare, I noted a judge made an award of €80 to the woman who had custody of the children.  In other neighbouring counties, if the man takes charge of the children, the judge will determine he gets a payment of €5.  Some judges are putting people into consistent poverty through the awards they make.  Talking to solicitors, I note many of these judges do not have the expertise to deal with these issues and come down on men unfairly over women.  Will the Leader organise a debate on this matter?  I am all for what is reasonable and fair so that those on social welfare can make the payments awarded by judges.</p>

Approximately eight Senators also raised the matter on Tuesday, and there is much repetition in that regard.

          <p eId="para_201">Senator Quinn spoke about the national procurement agency, rightly pointing out that we must maintain jobs, where possible, at all costs.  We should examine the procedures that exist, and the French have given an example of how to bend procedures in order to comply with the law.  That is something we should be doing and I will raise it with the Minister.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, will be here to deal with the Competition (Amendment) Bill.  There was a very comprehensive debate on all aspects of that Bill over a number of months, and the matter could be raised on later Stages of that Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">Senator Cullinane spoke about special needs resources and Senator Moran spoke about disability services.  I will certainly endeavour to have the relevant Minister in here to discuss those items.  Senator Mullins mentioned obstacles to employment creation, an issue which has been discussed on numerous occasions in the House.

She quite rightly highlights the domestic abuse taking place in the country and perhaps we can arrange a debate around that subject in the early course.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">Senator Walsh raised a number of items and the Minister for Finance will come to the House on 3 July.  Perhaps he will have the opportunity to discuss some of those items on that occasion.  Senator D'Arcy raised an issue on the Adjournment and is clearly not satisfied with the reply.  I am sure if he could take the matter up directly with the Minister, he will get the necessary response.  The Senator should explore that option before putting down motions in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">Senator Daly raised the matter of human rights issues in Northern Ireland, which concern the Good Friday Agreement.

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_226">(2) The Minister or the IMF-EU-ECB mission team for the duration of the memorandum of understanding support programme may request the authority to carry out a study or analysis of any practice or method of competition affecting the supply and distribution of goods or the provision of services or any other matter relating to competition and submit a report to the Minister or to the IMF-EU-ECB mission team for the duration of the memorandum of understanding support programme in relation to the study or analysis; the authority shall comply with such a request within such period as the Minister or the IMF-EU-ECB mission team for the duration of the memorandum of understanding support programme may specify in the request.".</p>
          <p eId="para_227">I welcome the Minister less than 24 hours after his last visit to the House.  I have tabled this amendment because I am trying to incorporate what the Minister found in the Dáil and the report on competition policy by Goodbody in the last month that we must strengthen his hand and adopt a more radical approach to competition policy because of its importance.  That is the purpose of the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">There is a view that the Competition Authority has been too weak and has not stood up where there have been abuses of competition rules.  There is also a strong view that this is an important issue for Ireland and that, although we have a strong internationally traded sector, it is held back by the privilege and regulatory capture of the sheltered sector.  That is a strong theme that the Competitiveness Council has been pushing — that we avail of the opportunity arising from the IMF-EU agreement to promote and develop competition policy as a means of developing the rest of the economy and that we have too many sheltered sectors and sectors protected by Departments, with too many instances of regulatory capture, where the industry takes over its own regulation.  There is a lack of a strong focus, whereby the Competition Authority would take on inefficient regulation in areas such as transport, energy and health insurance.  We also need a much smarter performance from the professions and other sheltered sectors.  The delivery of the programme is part of the rescue package with the IMF.  I heard Mr. Richard Downes reporting from Washington this morning that stricter enforcement of competition policy had been included in the IMF briefings in Washington on the scope of the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">This is also an opportunity.  I have in mind the Office of Fair Trading in Britain.  It found that the regulation of airports by the Civil Aviation Authority had been captured by the British Airports Authority and intervened to secure the competitive sell-off of these airports.  We have regulatory capture in transport; the Public Transport Regulation Act reserved all the routes for one company and all its subsidies with the agreement of the Competition Authority.  The Health Insurance Authority exists to protect VHI, as does Government policy, on which we have lost cases in both the Supreme Court and the European Court.  There is an outstanding case on how much money we owe the people wrongly accused of not insuring old people.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">There are people in the energy field who believe our energy costs — electricity and gas — are far too high and that stricter regulation of these sectors is necessary.  There is a €40 million subsidy in the case of peat and the same in the case of wind energy.  These sectors have captured their regulators and operate outside the realm of competition policy which we need so badly.  There was an interesting remark made by the Minister for Finance in the Dáil that the professions in Ireland had a rule that dog did not eat dog, but it is about time the taxpayer got a bite.  We need to open up all of these areas to competition.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">That is the purpose of my amendment, that we use, as the Competitiveness Council states, this opportunity when we are trying to help the economy out of the difficulties it experienced between 2008 and 2010, of which improving our competitiveness is part.  The general view when the Minister and the Minister of State were here to take Second and Committee Stages was that they were not being radical enough.  The Competition Authority issued only one summons and four warrants in 2011.  It does not reassure customers that it is acting on their behalf and does not scare the cartels.  This should be an all-government approach which would lead to huge benefits for the economy, some of which I will outline.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">The Milliman report shows the high costs of VHI do not stem from the fact that it insures a lot of old people but from the fact that it keeps them in hospital for 11.6 days for treatment that should take 3.7 days to complete.  The last time he was in the House the Minister quoted Adam Smith.  One of his quotations was that monopolists produced too little, charged too much and greatly increased their emoluments as a result.  Substantial benefits would derive from competing health insurance companies reducing the costs of hospitalisation, for instance, as it would have a cross-over benefit to the public sector.  It took a parliamentary revolt and subsequent policy changes by the late Jim Mitchell and Garret FitzGerald to open up the aviation sector.  Many of us will recall a time when it cost more than £200 to travel from Dublin to London, with one airline carrying 2 million passengers on that route annually.  This year, Aer Lingus and Ryanair will carry 90 million passengers between them.  That increased competition and enhanced service has allowed us to develop our tourism industry.  These are the contingent benefits of competition.  If energy costs can be reduced, for example, it will not only benefit householders but also help to stimulate those sectors of the economy which the Minister is trying to promote.  We all took note when one of the representatives of the EU-IMF troika observed on a recent visit to the State that the cost of a GP call-out in Brussels is approximately half what it is in Dublin.  In that regard, the Minister has received strong support in this House for proposals to open up the General Medical Services, GMS, list to new doctors.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">What is proposed in this legislation is merely part of what needs to be done to make ours a truly competitive economy.  The Goodbody review and the report of the National Competitiveness Council suggest that a more radical approach is required.  The IMF made the same call this morning, if I have interpreted Richard Downes's report correctly.  We are behind on the timetable we agreed for promoting a more competitive economy.  The purpose of my amendment is to strengthen the Minister's hand and to convey the support in this House for measures that would take on the sheltered sectors in our society.  We must make the economy more productive to bring the unemployment level back down from 14.5% to approximately 5%.  There are far too many restrictive practices in various sectors which have proven immune to the new economic realities.  We must step up to the plate and assume a much more active and interventionist competition policy.  Everybody will reap the benefits of such an approach.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FergalQuinn" eId="spk_162">
          <from>Senator Feargal Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_234">I welcome the Minister back to the House.  He has become very fond of us in recent days.  Senator Barrett has set out his concerns in regard to this amendment very well.  I am not quite sure the amendment would solve all the problems to which he referred, but it is a step in the right direction.  Senator Barrett referred to the observation by one of the visiting troika officials that the call-out fee for a doctor in this country is double what it is in Belgium.  There are many instances of this type of anomaly which clearly point to the need for greater competition.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">The question is how it can be achieved.  I consulted the Golden Pages recently in search of a dentist's address and was astounded by the number of advertisements for dental services north of the Border.  I have also noted newspaper advertisements offering medical services in Hungary and India, with packages including treatment and travel costs.  When I started in business, resale price maintenance was the norm.  We were told that one could only sell Jacobs biscuits or Cadbury's chocolate, for instance, at the fixed price.  That practice was accepted by retailers and by the Government of the day.  It was not until the British Government removed resale price maintenance in the neighbouring jurisdiction that we did the same and prices came down.  As Senator Barrett observed, there are many such cases of restrictive practices.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">The amendment seeks to insert several new provisions in section 30 of the principal Act.  The new subsection (1)(<i>h</i>) would broaden the remit of the Competition Authority by allowing it to have oversight of potentially anti-competitive practices in public as well as private bodies.  This is a very important point and Senator Barrett pointed to the areas of energy and health to support his case.  There seems to be little or no competition in these sectors for reasons that are not entirely clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">Another important element of the amendment is the provision in paragraph (<i>j</i>) that the authority should be able to make public any findings that are not commercially sensitive.  It makes perfect sense that any data that are commercially sensitive should not be released in this way, but all other findings should be available for examination and review by the public.  Paragraph (<i>k</i>) proposes the Competition Authority be allowed to act on its own right rather than requiring that investigations be initiated on some other basis.  Everybody will agree surely that these are sensible proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">The proposed section 30(2) of the principal Act, as provided for in the amendment, seeks to address the fact neither the Minister nor the troika team — the latter for the duration of the bailout programme — has the right to request the authority to initiate an investigation into a particular matter.  On each visit to Ireland, members of the troika team repeatedly urge that such and such be done.  They and the Minister should have the right to instruct to the Competition Authority to complete any such investigation within a specific timeframe.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">The examples to which Senator Barrett pointed can be well defended and should be in operation.  I urge the Minister to accept the amendment on the basis it will strengthen Government efforts to encourage increased competition, with all the benefits which flow from that.  It is a particular problem for this country that we have got into the habit of charging a much higher price than others for a range of goods and services.  Senator Barrett referred to the cost of flights between Dublin and London before the introduction of competition on that route.  I can well recall paying up to £300 for a flight when there were only two state-owned airlines operating on the route.  There was an assumption at the time that this was how it should and always would be.  The introduction of competition in this area was driven by Brussels and by those in Ireland with the vision to make changes which have been of huge benefit to the travelling public and to the economy.  We can do a great deal to improve competition, reduce prices and make this country more competitive in the marketplace.  The amendment is worthy of acceptance as part of our efforts in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_240">What is proposed in this amendment seems merely common sense.  It begs the question why these provisions are not already in place.  When the Government sets up an independent body, it does not set up a secret service. There must be some comeback in terms of a capacity to examine, without undue interference, the work it is doing and how it is organising its business.  The amendment proposes that the Competition Authority should be obliged to publish all findings that are not commercially sensitive.  Under the freedom of information legislation, unfortunately, many organisations are not covered and there is no way of getting this type of information.  In the area of competition, such scrutiny would be good commercial practice.  The provisions of the amendment are very much in line with the principles of good housekeeping which we have been discussing frequently in this House.  It is good housekeeping practice to ensure a regulator is independent, but an individual could go AWOL, in which case the Government has no comeback.  Perhaps there is something already in legislation to cover that, in which case the Minister might elaborate on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">I am particularly interested in the energy sector.  We have a very progressive Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, who has indicated his absolute commitment to renewable energy and to meeting our targets for 2020.  I understand, however, that representatives of commercial bodies, especially in the west, that are ready to go with wind energy production have been told it will be 2020 before they can connect to the grid.  Since 2004 there has been considerable liberalisation in respect of the energy grid, deregulation and so on, but I would like reports on whether it is working fast enough.  If we are to meet our targets, should we not do more to facilitate private sector renewable energy development?  I know of the fantastic work going on to promote grid 25 and to ensure we have the capacity to take it in.  Not having the capacity is one thing, but it is another if private organisations say the capacity would be there if they were allowed in.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">I am not too sure about the IMF, the EU and everybody else scrutinising our internal business because as everyone knows, we like our independence.  We want to get rid of the troika as fast as we can.  I hope we will be able access funding on the open market under Deputy Bruton's stewardship.  I compliment him on the work he is doing.  We should have the wherewithal to manage our own resources.  I would like information from the Minister.  What I said about energy applies to all areas of competition.</p>

          <p eId="para_243">I welcome the Minister and support this common sense Bill.  It is all about protecting the jobs created by the US multinationals.  However, we should also concentrate on maintaining indigenous jobs, an issue I have raised on numerous occasions in the context of the viability of businesses and commercial rates.  I still believe we should have a national review of commercial rates for small businesses in particular.  We should build commercial rates into the debate we will have on a proper property tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">We need to look at the way the Revenue Commissioners do their business, with which I have an issue.  I do not believe they look at the bigger picture.  The outcome of how they do their business has knock-on effects on other businesses.  I am privy to a particular instance where a small wholesaler in the west of Ireland was owed €52,000 by two small businesses, which were paying him over a period of time.  He brought down what was owed to him to €52,000.  He went to deliver to them one morning but both businesses had been closed down by the Revenue Commissioners.  He was owed €30,000 by one of those businesses.  The Revenue Commissioners had a fire sale of his assets and got €4,000 for them.  The €30,000 worth of stock they sold belonged to this wholesaler.  This threatened the viability of his business.  On top of that, the two businesses which closed down put 11 people on social welfare.  It makes absolutely no sense that they should conduct their business like that when it has an overall effect on our finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">I refer to a debate we had in the House on cartelism.  I recently damaged my iPhone.  The damage was irreparable but it was insured, and I am going to collect it today.  The person in the phone shop told me the phone was worth €390 so I asked if I could change it for two BlackBerry phones costing €130 each.  The person said I could not do so and that if I wanted to change it, all I could get for my iPhone was €40.  It begs the question as to what the phone is actually worth.  The person in the shop was only willing to give me €40 for it and yet I was told it was worth €390.  We need to look at the whole area of cartelism, as does the Competition Authority.</p>

          <from>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Richard Bruton)</from>
          <p eId="para_246">I thank Senators for very interesting contributions.  I agree entirely with Senator Barrett that we need to achieve much more competition in the Irish economy.  We have had a real problem with competition in the economy for a number of years but the problem has not been the lack of power in the hands of the Competition Authority to analyse nor the lack of power to publish outcomes of cases.  The problem has been a lack of willingness to act on recommendations which have been brought forward by the authority.  As the Senator knows, the Competition Authority reported on a number of sectors over the years, but the changes it sought were not implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">There is no doubt that since the IMF, the EU and ECB came to town there has been a new impetus, but the main new impetus has been to implement recommendations from the Competition Authority which were outstanding.  It has not been hammering on the door demanding new studies.  The truth is the Competition Authority has a free hand to undertake any study it chooses and to analyse competition in any sector where it believes there are problems.  Indeed, under the action plan for jobs, which I recently published, one of the actions to be delivered by the second quarter is that a selection of new sectors in which it is believed there are sheltered activities which are damaging competition will be investigated.  The Competition Authority will put forward proposals as to areas which should be analysed and I will commission such an analysis.  There is no lack of power to analyse the problems.  The problem has been the willingness to act on the recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">Clearly, one is now seeing action on the recommendations in reforming the legal and medical professions and so on.  The troika has created timelines for the implementation of various changes and the publication of various Bills, including this Bill to strengthen the enforcement powers.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">That brings us to what other things are needed to make competition much stronger.  That is the purpose of this Bill.  The reason there are not amendments on more powers of analysis is that there is no defect in the Competition Authority's power to analyse.  There is a desire — this is the whole theme of this Bill — to strengthen the incentive to comply and to make it a bigger risk for people who are engaged in anti-competitive activity.  That is why we are strengthening the penalties and bringing in other changes, which Senators have seen in the Bill, to show there are greater consequences for failure to comply with the requirements.  That is the focus of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">The Competition Authority also has an additional power which is rigorously applied, namely, it has a free right to comment on any legislation being initiated by the Government.  That comment goes directly to the Minister who cannot amend it or say he or she does not really like it.  It goes to the sponsoring Minister and it is put on record as the authority's comment — a free and independent comment on the legislation.  That is a very important power.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">Competition is not the entire gamut of public policy.  Senator Barrett said it was wrong that there were subsidies for those generating electricity from wind and asked whether that was anti-competitive.  We are giving people generating from renewable sources a bigger payback than others.  However, there is another dimension of public policy which says we need to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels and become more self-reliant and exploit our renewable resources.  The consequence of that is that one develops a refit price that gives a higher subsidy to people who generate power from wind than those who generate it from gas or oil.  That is a perfectly acceptable public policy to pursue.  Competition, while it is very important, is not the sum total of the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">We discussed the issue of out-of-town malls versus town centres on Second Stage.  The competition view would be to let everyone flourish and let people set up wherever they like.  However, there is a different dimension to public policy.  Some Senators expressed the view that we need to protect our town centres and that there is a value in having a town centre.  Obviously, I am an advocate of competition, but it must be recognised that there are limits to which the competition mandate runs.  That is not to say it justifies much of what has happened.  Much of it is unjustifiable.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">The other aspect is enforcement activity.  Senator Barrett stated that the cartels are not scared.  We have made a decision, which is on foot of the second quarter, that we will be putting ten additional enforcement staff into the Competition Authority.  The authority has been given the clearance to recruit to strengthen its capacity in the area of enforcement.  The Competition Authority is a relatively small agency which employs approximately 50 staff.  This is effectively a 20% increase in its scale, but it is focused very much in the enforcement area to ensure the authority has the enforcement capacity when investigating an issue of anti-competitive practice, whether it be cartel activity or abuse of dominance.  That is the real issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">The twin approach we need to achieve is to act on recommendations of public policy where regulatory problems are protected by an existing system, and to take enforcement action when problems are found and investigation reveals anti-competitive practices.  We are strengthening the Competition Authority's enforcement capacity, providing stronger penalties and adding further disincentives to anti-competitive behaviour.  Clearly, the Government is determined to implement changes that have been recommended and is committed to the undertaking of new studies by the Competition Authority into areas where there are potential problems that need to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">That brings me back to the amendment, which I do not support because I do not believe it is necessary.  First, there is no restraint under paragraph (<i>h</i>) on the Competition Authority investigating a sector in which a public body is involved.  It can investigate any sector without fear or favour and can analyse any sector that is regulated.  The only aspect of which one must be aware is that a regulator is not an undertaking within the meaning of the Act and the authority cannot investigate a regulator for an offence.  The authority has the power, however, to analyse the way in which a regulator is regulating a certain sector and state that in its view, the regulation of the sector is not a competitive approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">We recognise there is an increasing fear the regulatory regime we have established over the years has too little focus on the need for competitiveness in the current particularly strained nature of the economy.  Under the action plan for jobs, we are reviewing the operation of the regulators.  The Competition Authority can analyse them at any time, but we are reviewing whether the regulators, as a class, are working to the correct criteria and whether our competitiveness, benchmarked against other players with which we must trade, is sufficiently important in their consideration.  That work is being undertaken by Forfás.  The Taoiseach, in particular, is interested to see whether we can sharpen the focus of our regulatory environment across the board by way of public policy.  There is no constraint, however, on the ability of the Competition Authority to investigate any regulated sector, and it has done so.  It has spoken about retail planning guidelines when everyone might not agree with its view.  It has spoken about waste management and various professions.  It has analysed these at quite considerable length.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">Paragraph (<i>j</i>) raises the issue of whether the authority has the capacity to publish.  Section 30(1)(<i>g</i>) of the Competition Act 2002 gives the authority the function of carrying out such activities as it considers appropriate to inform the public about competition issues.  In this context, the authority publishes its economic and legal reasoning concerning selected investigations it has decided to close, either because it has found no breach of the Competition Act or it has settled the case with the undertaking concerned.  These publications are referred to as enforcement decisions.  The authority selects investigations for its enforcement decisions that demonstrate its approach to a particular competition issue on which it has not previously offered an opinion, or where the investigation is in the public domain and the issue has been subject to such considerable public debate that the decision would be of public interest, or where the matters involved raise broad issues of interest or complexity.  In the context of the proposed paragraph (<i>j</i>), I would refer the Senators to the authority’s website, <i>tca.ie</i>, on which the authority publishes non-commercially sensitive findings on foot of enforcement actions and examinations it has carried out.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">Senator Barrett and Senator Quinn propose, in paragraph (<i>k</i>), that the authority report to me annually on practices that limit or restrain competition such that they constitute a violation of Part 1 of the 2002 Act.  A breach of section 4 or 5 is an offence which the authority can investigate and pursue in the courts, either as a criminal or a civil matter.  The authority is independent in the performance of its functions and a requirement for it to report to me on breaches of the law and on proposed remedies is not in keeping with this statutory independence.   The authority includes in its annual report details of past investigations, and I am of the view that this is the appropriate course of action for the authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">As the Senators can see, the authority has powers to publish as it sees fit.  That is unconstrained by the Minister, and that is appropriate.  We need to do it in a way that protects the authority's power to investigate independently and not be answerable or give the impression it is under some obligation to the Minister in terms of what it does and its freedom to report independently.  The existing balance is correctly struck.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">I would share Senator Keane's views on subsection (2).  The IMF, EU and ECB, which are operating a memorandum of understanding to the end of 2013, should not be enshrined in law in such a way.  They are a party which is here because they are committing to fund and, as a consequence, the Government must be accountable to them.  They put forward proposals and negotiate with Government about what is the next phase of activity in a programme, and that is as it should be.  The Competition Authority has, correctly, an entire freedom to analyse anything it likes and I, as Minister, have the power to ask it to investigate an area about which I have concern, but it is not appropriate to give a new status in law to an international body which is here as a result of temporary difficulties we are experiencing.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">I applaud the sentiments behind the amendment.  We need to become much more effective in managing and delivering competition in our economy.  The process that will deliver for us involves acting on recommendations, giving strong enforcement powers, strengthening the Bill, as we are doing here, and commissioning reports where they are needed on sheltered sectors of the economy which need further action.  While I commend the motivation of the Senators in tabling this amendment, I assure the House it is not the extent of the ability of the authority to analyse or to publish that acts as a constraint on the delivery of more effective competition policy, rather it is many of the other issues.  The battle must be won on many fronts to deliver effective competition.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanDBarrett" eId="spk_166">
          <from>Senator Sean D. Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_262">I thank the Minister, as always, for his wisdom.  There is exasperation about how slowly we are moving in this field.  We will support the Minister's efforts to move things on.  This is a sentiment expressed in an announcement by the International Monetary Fund this morning.  On page 24 of the IMF agreement of December 2010, Ireland agreed to require the Competition Authority to lift restrictions in competition law which exclude certain sectors from the authority's scope and to identify processes to address these exclusions.  More activity is needed in this area.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, expressed this view in a speech to the Dáil on 5 November 2005 when he stated the performance of the Competition Authority and operation of the Competition Act had not been as effective as consumers were entitled to expect.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">It does not indicate a sense of urgency when the annual report of the Competition Authority for 2011 refers to the issuing of one search warrant and four summonses.  I regret to note that the position adopted by the authority in the health insurance case was against the consumer.  It also acted as an ally of the Health Insurance Authority whose role, as far as I can ascertain, is purely to prevent competition.  It also gave the nod on the issue of buses and was silent when the then Minister for Transport, Mr. Noel Dempsey, required a 41% increase in airport charges, a move that did serious damage to the country.  I would like to have a much more alive and alert watchdog, one which barks when restrictive practices come to light.  Unfortunately, such practices are inherent in the Irish economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">The National Competitiveness Council, which I am pleased the Minister has given a role, offered the following advice:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_265">In response to the Programme, however, Ireland should not undertake reform solely to satisfy the terms and conditions set out by the EU/IMF.  Instead, we should seize the opportunity to continue to deliver structural reforms that can lead to long term prosperity, recognising that competition policy is good for Ireland — benefiting consumers and helping to restore Ireland's international reputation.  Many sectors continue to engage in special pleading — seeking to maintain restrictions to competition and barriers to entry.  The Council support the principle of enhancing competition in <i>all</i> sectors — this was reflected in much of the analysis in the Council’s <i>Costs of Doing Business in Ireland 2011</i> report.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">This should be the agenda.  A proposal was made that the Minister amalgamate the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority.  I wonder if the National Competitiveness Council would not be a better fit to drive the kind of agenda about which the Minister has spoken.  While I appreciate his determination, progress in these matters has been slower than we had hoped.  We must be much more radical than we have been in this area and the Minister's radicalism will be supported on this side.  Given the special pleading and regulatory capture reported by the National Competitiveness Council, it is vital that progress is faster.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">All of the restrictive practices in electricity generation seem to be incorporated in the price of electricity.  This issue was the subject of strong debate at the Kenmare conference two years ago.  Who guards the guardians and who regulates the regulators?  These are questions the Minister himself asked.  Do the regulators get captured by the sector they regulate?  Does the relationship become too cosy, as was the case with social partnership for some time?  Driving competition will require great energy and force because our natural instinct is to prevent competition whenever we can.  Efforts are also made to capture the regulators.  The major change in the Dáil and Seanad at the most recent general election indicated we must move away from the type of economy we had and become internationally competitive.  I assure the Minister of my support in all his endeavours in that regard.  The fault I find with the Bill is that progress is not being made quickly enough.  The purpose of the amendment is to speed up the process and, more important, encourage the Minister in his efforts in that regard.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_268">I forgot to respond to Senator Kelly who, in fairness, raised issues which are unrelated to competition law.  Revenue is, if one likes, the supreme monopoly.  It will be a relief to people that we do not have two Revenue commissions in the State.  The Senator raised a dilemma.  If the Revenue Commissioners fail to intervene and allow a person to run up debts to the Revenue and others, their actions distort competition and expose people who are trading with the person in question to possible or even escalating losses.  The Revenue Commissioners have a duty to collect money on behalf of the State and must be aware that they have primacy in any ultimate wind-up of a business.  As their position will always be protected ahead of others, they must be careful to behave in a proper manner.  If a business is experiencing a temporary problem, the Revenue will be approached and I am sure it will try to deal with the issue.  However, if it were to show forbearance to a business in serious trading difficulties, it could result in others experiencing greater exposure to the business in question than should be permitted.  Revenue must ensure fair play between different parties.  While this is an area of expertise for the Minister for Finance, the issue the Senator raises is a genuine one.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">I do not have sufficient knowledge of pricing practices in the mobile telephone business.  However, it is the case that people buy packages that include a telephone, a billing system and the service offered by a specific provider.  The telephone <i>per se</i> is merely a physical object and much of its value is determined when it is connected to a specific network.  I do not know if this is an issue for investigation by the Competition Authority.  The scenario described by the Senator differs considerably from a cartel, which is where a number of agents who should be competing in a market collude to drive up prices.  While the Competition Authority is open to dealing with third party complaints, the issue to which the Senator refers is not a cartel.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">On Senator Barrett's view that movement should be quicker, it needs to be recognised that the Government has introduced legislation to reform the legal and medical professions and strengthen the Competition Authority.  We have also decided to strengthen its enforcement arm and the authority is also undertaking new studies in respect of areas of concern.  Significant progress has been made in the course of a number of months.  There is, therefore, a much greater level of activism around competition policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">The Senator raised many public policy issues and asked whether we have a sufficiently competitive environment in areas such as health, bus transport and the energy sector.  His question raises much wider issues than simply the powers of the Competition Authority.  Progress is being made in this regard.  We are reviewing the regulators to ascertain whether the framework within which they operate focuses sufficiently on competition and benchmarking prices against prices elsewhere.  Even in this regard, it is necessary to strike a balance.  For example, the focus on attracting new entrants to the electricity market probably did not bring down prices in the short term.  In some cases, public policy issues arise which make an issue more complex than its competition dimension alone.  I concur with the Senator, however, that it is important to ensure the competition dimension comes much more to the fore.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">The Competition Authority has commented on waste management and asked whether we have a proper competitive environment in the waste sector.  Its view is that changes are needed and its recommendations on the sector need to be taken seriously.  While I am content that there is new momentum in this field, it does not mean all the castle walls are falling down before the Competition Authority.  Achieving that outcome requires more persuasion.  Moreover, it is necessary to balance interests in some of the sectors concerned, including, for instance, wind energy, because public policy issues may arise.  While I do not propose to accept the amendment, I commend the Senators on introducing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">The next Bill from my Department will provide for the merger of the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority.   The National Competitiveness Council is different.  It is serviced by Forfás and it acts in an advisory role across the whole of government.  It deals not only with competition issues but also with labour market issues and all sorts of other issues.  Its role is different from the regulation of the market, which is the consumer and competition dimension.</p>

          <p eId="para_274">I thank the Minister for his sentiments.  Dr. Fingleton estimated that restrictive practices were costing every household €2,500 per annum.  The international ranking of Ireland for competition policy is 25th, which is way below OECD countries.  I hope the Minister's reforms will reduce that €2,500 cost and move Ireland up the rankings.  I wish him well in that regard.  We have sought to provide assistance and to stress the importance of competition policy.  The vested interests have had an undue say in policy.  They are the producers rather than the consumers and the sheltered sector rather than the unsheltered sector.  That is not the way forward for our economy and we wish the Minister well in his reform programme.  I thank the Minister and the Senators who spoke on the Bill.</p>

          <from>Senator Thomas Byrne</from>
          <p eId="para_278">I thank the Leader for allowing this issue on the Order of Business and the Minister for remaining here to deal with it.  We often propose amendments to the Order of Business in the full knowledge they will never be accepted.  I am glad it was accepted this time and I am grateful to the Leader and to the Minister.  It is a recognition of its serious nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">The Lagan Brick factory in Kingscourt, County Meath, with which the Minister will be familiar, is the last remaining brick factory in Ireland.  It was closed by its owners 180 days ago, leaving the workers completely in the lurch.  Some time later they went on an unofficial dispute and this dispute continues.  There have been several unsuccessful attempts at mediation.  Huge sacrifices have been made by the workers who have been badly treated.  All they want is fair and equitable severance.  However, the dispute raises much broader issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">We have denigrated our manufacturing industries in Ireland and it is a disgrace that the last remaining brick factory is being closed in an area that is naturally good for the production of bricks and other building materials.  It is a shame they will now be imported.  That is not good for the Irish economy nor for the local economy.  What is galling is that while workers are in dispute and are suffering, arms of this particular company still receive public contracts.  That just does not add up.  A particular insult to the workers was the contract awarded by Cavan County Council to an arm of Lagan to resurface the main street in Kingscourt, County Cavan.  We are seeing a race to the bottom here, where companies want to get rid of reasonably paid staff who are earning enough to live and work in their own communities and contribute to their local economy.  There is a race to the bottom to employ people at the cheapest possible price.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">This dispute began on the same day as the Vita Cortex dispute.  It has not had nearly the same media profile, but the workers deserve that same profile.  They also deserve more action from the Government to try to force this major Irish company into some kind of serious settlement arrangement with the workers.  The arms of the State that deal with industrial relations have not succeeded.  The laws are too weak and I do not think they were envisaged for companies that were closing down and laying off workers.  The Labour Court and the labour relations process seem to be more suited to dealing with the mundane issues that arise in the course of work such as work practices and shift arrangements in companies.  They do not seem suited at all to the circumstances occurring so often today, where companies simply close lock, stock and barrel.  We need major reform in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">As these processes have failed, I urge the Minister to take a much more proactive stance on this issue to get justice for these workers, but also to protect a native Irish industry which feeds off the natural resources of that particular part of Cavan and Meath.</p>

          <p eId="para_283">I thank the Leader for agreeing to this amendment to the Order of Business, and I thank the Minister for coming before the House this afternoon.  I endorse wholeheartedly everything that Senator Byrne has said.  This dispute began six months ago and we are no further on, in spite of a number of interventions.  We are asking the Minister to intervene personally to ensure these workers get the entitlements they richly deserve.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">I would also like to mention another difficulty taking place eight miles down the road in Bailieborough, County Cavan, involving Flair International.  Deputy Brendan Smith raised this issue with the Minister in the Lower House yesterday.  A provisional liquidator was appointed to Flair International on 6 June.  This company has a very proud tradition for many decades in Bailieborough, with a skilled workforce producing a quality product with a substantial export market.  Fifty six workers were laid off with very short notice last Monday by Flair International.  Along with the Lagan Brick workers in Kingscourt, I ask the Minister to intervene personally in this dispute and ensure these workers, who are only going to get their statutory entitlements, are given everything to which they are entitled.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">I endorse everything Senator Byrne said about the Lagan Brick workers in Kingscourt, County Cavan.  It is deplorable that State contracts are given to this company while it deals with these employees and their families in this manner.  I thank the Minister for coming to the House this afternoon.</p>

          <from>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Richard Bruton)</from>
          <p eId="para_286">I thank the Senators for raising this issue.  I met the Lagan Brick workers when I was there last month.  The workers have been involved in a protest outside the company's premises in a dispute over the decision by the company to close its operation on 15 December last, with the loss of 29 jobs.  The union wanted to retain maximum employment in the plant and secure satisfactory redundancy terms for any of the workers who would lose their jobs.  Subsequently, representatives of the company and of SIPTU attended conciliation talks at the Labour Relations Commission on 10 January and 16 January.  These talks were reconvened on 6 February following consideration by both sides of an examination of the trading position of the company, undertaken by an independent expert.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">Following the hearing on 6 February, SIPTU stated that it would be seeking the intervention of the Labour Court in the dispute, following the failure to reach agreement in the LRC talks.  However, I understand that Lagan Brick subsequently issued a statement to the effect that the company did not intend to pursue further negotiations with worker representatives on the matter.  In a ballot conducted on 1 March, SIPTU members in Lagan Brick voted almost unanimously to take strike action in response to the company's decision not to attend the Labour Court, and seven days' notice of strike action was served on Lagan Brick by SIPTU on 2 March.  An official strike began on 10 March.  Since then, I understand the parties have engaged in direct discussions in an effort to resolve the dispute with the assistance of a mediation panel, under an agreed independent chairman appointed jointly by ICTU and IBEC.  Unfortunately, that process has failed to reach a resolution.  It is of great regret that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement to resolve this long-running dispute.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">The Senators have raised the issue of whether we should reconsider our laws in this area.  We would have to be very careful about it.  Our entire approach to industrial relations has been based on a voluntary system.  The State does not impose on either party.  It does not make decisions that have a binding effect.  What we have is very experienced services in both the Labour Relations Commission, LRC, and the Labour Court, which over long difficult periods such as that in which we are at present, have succeeded in bringing the two sides together to resolve such disputes.  Ultimately, disputes must be solved by the two sides reaching an agreement.  I strongly urge the parties involved in this dispute to work together to break the current impasse by using the machinery we have that is available to assist at short notice.  The experience and expertise of the Labour Court offers the most appropriate and effective avenue for resolving such issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">The Senator also raised the issue of Flair International.  I understand that the High Court appointed a provisional liquidator to the company on 6 June and the assets, goodwill and undertaking of the business were advertised for sale on 8 June.  I am conscious of the anxiety that the appointment of a provisional liquidator to the company concerned creates for the workers involved and their families, as well as the local community.  People understand the concerns this action has raised.  However, one of the powers given by the court to the liquidator was to grant a licence to continue to trade in the short term.  A licence agreement was concluded between the liquidator and a new company on 7 June.  Sales operations commenced on 8 June and the employment of key people and further recruitment of staff for operation of the factory is anticipated.  Obviously if there are industrial dispute issues we have the machinery and the employment rights provisions to deal with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">The company is a client of Enterprise Ireland and the agency is continuing to liaise with the agency concerned and will offer any assistance it possibly can to explore opportunities to maintain and develop the business.  I hope that out of the unfortunate appointment of a liquidator we can see something re-emerge that would provide a future for the workers concerned.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)</from>
          <p eId="para_293">I am delighted to be here to speak about this important year for Irish science and, most particularly, the Euroscience Open Forum, ESOF, 2012, which is being held in our capital city this summer.  The programme for Dublin City of Science 2012 has been up and running since its launch on 26 January.  This is very much an historic year for science in Ireland.  We have already seen the science theme to the fore during the St. Patrick's Festival in Dublin.  The centrepiece of the year will be the largest science meeting in Europe, the ESOF, which we will be privileged to host from 11 to 15 July in the new convention centre in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">Preparations for the prestigious ESOF are at a very advanced stage as we seek to showcase Ireland and our scientific prowess to the very best of our ability.  As London is preparing to host the summer Olympic Games shortly, Dublin is essentially hosting the European scientific equivalent.  ESOF 2012 will place Dublin and Ireland at the centre of world science for a period next month, with lasting positive consequences for Ireland's scientific reputation.  It will connect with the people of Dublin and the rest of Ireland via the Science in the City events, in addition to the many initiatives running country-wide as part of the public engagement programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">The ESOF is a biennial, pan-European meeting, dedicated wholly to scientific research and innovation.  It is the largest and most prestigious general science meeting in Europe and it is held in a European city every two years.  It was first held in Stockholm in 2004, followed by Munich in 2006, Barcelona in 2008 and Turin in 2010.  The  ESOF can be described as a multidisciplinary, general science meeting and it aims to showcase the latest advances in science and technology and promote dialogue on their role in society and public policy.  It aims to stimulate and provoke public interest, excitement and debate about these subjects.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">The ESOF conference is unique in that it is both international and multidisciplinary.  It presents breakthroughs in many disciplines as varied as mathematics, music, geography and genetics through a range of formats, including lectures, workshops and lunches.  Moreover, the ESOF presents and discusses the frontiers of scientific and technological research in Europe, contributing to the development of a tangible European scientific identity.  It also bridges the gap between science and society and stimulates policies to support scientific research.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">The ESOF is the brainchild of the Euroscience organisation which was founded in 1997 by members of Europe's research community to provide an open forum for debate on science and technology and research policies in Europe, strengthen the links between science and society and contribute to the creation of an integrated space for science and technology in Europe.  It also aims to link research organisations and policies at national and EU levels, strive for a greater role for the European Union in research and influence science and technology policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">When it was first proposed in 2007 that Ireland should compete to bring the ESOF to Dublin, the motivation was very much to highlight, on the international stage, the benefits and fruits of Ireland's decade-long programme of significant investment in science and research.  Beginning in the late 1990s, Ireland began to invest considerable resources in science, technology and innovation as a means of pursuing economic development.  In the ensuing decade public investment in research through the Higher Education Authority, Science Foundation Ireland and the other research-funding agencies increased by approximately 14 % per year, which was twice the rate of growth in GDP at the time.  In total, some 3,200 new scientific posts have been added to our third level institutions.  In the past five years publication rates have almost doubled and the rate of citation of Irish science output, the standard measure of quality, is now above US and European Union average levels.  Moreover, business research and development investment has increased in parallel.  Figures from IDA Ireland indicate that, last year alone, nearly half of foreign direct investment was in research and development projects, which is most encouraging and promising.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">Our research and science infrastructure, in terms of the physical capital and the equipment in our laboratories, in addition to the intellectual capital in our scientists, is a key legacy from the boom years.  These investments have created real and enduring value and will now play a central role in our economic recovery.  With this in mind, a coalition of public and private groups, including the Government, third level institutions and industry, worked together for six months, beginning in 2007, to prepare a bid to bring the large-scale ESOF event to Dublin for 2012.  This bid was subsequently submitted to Euroscience and the good news that Dublin was successful in the face of stiff competition from the competing city of Vienna was received in Strasbourg in autumn 2008.  I acknowledge the role of the chief scientific adviser to the Government, Professor Patrick Cunningham, and his diligent team by reason of their important work in the bid phase and all the preparations for this year's significant events.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">The main ESOF programme will be held in the convention centre in Dublin and it is hoped will attract in the region of 5,000 scientists, business leaders, senior EU and government officials, international scientific media and science graduates and enthusiasts to our shores to discuss the best of Irish and European science.  The programme will cover all of the current major global scientific challenges, including those in the areas of health, food, energy and climate change.  It will also cover fundamental issues such as the origin of the universe and human evolution.  Traditionally, the Euroscience Open Forum, ESOF, has focused on the natural sciences, that is, physics, chemistry, biology, etc.  However, in view of Ireland's rich literary and cultural heritage, it was decided, for this conference, to broaden the remit to include the humanities, arts and social sciences.  Indeed, the confluence of science, technology, society and culture will be a pervasive theme over the course of the whole meeting.  An exciting list of international keynote speakers will address the conference, including: — and I cite a non-exhaustive list — Jocelyn Bell Burnell, president of the Institute of Physics, United Kingdom; Charles Bolden, a NASA administrator; Peter Doherty, a Nobel prize-winner in immunology, University of Melbourne; James Watson, a Nobel prize-winner in genetics, Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory; and Jules Hoffmann, a Nobel prize-winner in immunology and the research director at the National Centre for Scientific Research in France.  One also will have the opportunity to hear about science from humanitarian and human development perspectives and these viewpoints will be provided by Sir Bob Geldof and former President of Ireland and former UN High Commissioner, Mary Robinson, respectively.  Moreover, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, EU Commissioner for Research, Innovation and Science, will give a keynote address on policy day, which will be Friday, 13 July.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">The scientific programme for the five-day conference is acknowledged as being among the best ever and one can safely say the Dublin conference is already taking shape to be the best and brightest ESOF to date.  Across the five days of the conference, there will be more than 150 science, careers and science-2-business sessions, with more than 500 speakers, including 27 keynote speakers and, incredibly, five Nobel laureates, many panel discussions, an interactive exhibition, a busy marketplace and a lively social programme.  The science-2-business programme promises to be an excellent one and the 14 workshops over the course of four days will be extremely informative and valuable, for all concerned, in terms of highlighting the process of transforming the outputs of publicly-funded research into successful business innovations and outcomes.  The programme will enable and facilitate delegates of all backgrounds to obtain knowledge and advice, as well as to make valuable contacts, relevant to whatever stage of the journey from scientific discovery to business formation they currently are on.  The marketplace exhibition is another exciting element of the science-2-business programme and it will provide a meeting point for the different elements of the business start-up ecosystem, such as venture capital and a number of advisory services.  This marketplace will provide researchers with the opportunity to obtain expert advice and valuable contacts to assist them on their journey.  Furthermore, and as part of the marketplace, I have been informed there also will be a "Careers Expo", enabling researchers, of all ages and levels of experience, to meet and engage with leading international employers from the biomedical and engineering sectors.  I consider this to be a key element of the programme because ultimately, our greatest economic challenge is to create jobs and ensure we have people who are adequately skilled to take up those jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">The benefits to Ireland during and following ESOF are numerous.  There will be an immediate economic impact from the approximately 5,000 international visitors who are expected to attend.  Fáilte Ireland estimates that each delegate at a business conference contributes approximately €1,500 to the economy.  At a strategic level, the event will provide a platform to showcase the best of Irish science and research across all disciplines and reinforce the international image of Ireland as a leading centre of scientific and research excellence.  Domestically, it also is intended that the year will leave a positive legacy by serving as a catalyst for enhancing the understanding and appreciation of science, particularly in the eyes of our young people.  In addition, to maximise the overall economic impact of hosting the July event, a campaign has been under way to encourage all scientific, academic and professional associations to target the bringing of international conferences in their areas of specialty to Ireland during 2012 and there has been success to date in this regard.  ESOF has partnered with 37 conferences that focus the spotlight on Ireland as a scientific hub.  There are also several satellite events surrounding the ESOF conference that are intrinsically linked to the forum.  These include the Marie Curie Actions Conference, which will attract more than 4,000 Marie Curie fellows to Dublin, the European Union Science Events Association, EUSEA, annual conference of 2012 and the Robert Boyle summer school in Waterford.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">Members will be aware that for 2012, Dublin is the self-proclaimed city of science and this ties in nicely with our hosting of the Euroscience Open Forum.  The Dublin City of Science 2012 festival will consist of a year-long programme of science celebration that aims to engage the public to create a greater understanding and interest in science.  Outside of the ESOF conference, the Dublin City of Science 2012 festival is there to be enjoyed by all and is all about opening people's minds to science.  A total of 160 events will take place as part of this festival, as well as the science in the city programme element of the ESOF conference itself, all of which will serve to celebrate and promote the best of Irish and European science.  The Dublin City of Science 2012 festival is delivering science in a new way, through arts and cultural activities, and there are interesting events for all audiences, from those with little scientific knowledge to the more science-literate, which encompass all age groups.  The festival provides a new opportunity for science engagement with young people and is seeking to spark an interest in those not currently engaged.  Festivals are also taking place in Cork, namely, the CuriousCity festival and the Discovery Science Festival and in Galway, where the Galway Science and Technology Festival will take place in the autumn.  It is hoped that science and the wonder of discovery will be celebrated nationwide throughout the course of this significant year for science and technology in Ireland.  The events running as part of the Dublin City of Science 2012 festival include theatre and dance, tours and trails, street performances, exhibitions, public talks and lectures, all of which will include a core science message.  To this end, everyone is being encouraged to find further details on the festival's website, <i>dublinscience2012.ie</i>.  A central objective for the aforementioned festival is to raise awareness of science and of the possibilities for careers in science and this year presents a great opportunity to engage with the public on the theme of science.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">On the matter of Ireland's science heritage, Ireland has an extremely rich culture of science that goes back as far as the Irish monks who set up monasteries across the European Continent in the Middle Ages.  We have an outstanding scientific heritage in which we should take pride and we should pass on this positive legacy to our children.  It is clear the Irish have a proven aptitude for science and innovation, with Robert Boyle, John Tyndall and Francis Beaufort being just a few of our most famous scientists.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">As the Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation, Members will all appreciate that I consider science to be a core part of employment creation and retention.  It is through strategic investment, working with Science Foundation Ireland and in close collaboration with Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, other State agencies and the commercial sector, that Ireland is now perceived internationally as an emergent scientific influencer.  Many Members will be aware that our scientific research capabilities have been dramatically enhanced over the past decade and Ireland has leaped up the international rankings in terms of the quality of its research.  Ireland is now in the top 20 countries in overall scientific global rankings and is excelling in a range of key disciplines, including immunology, materials science and computer science.  Arising from this strengthened research system, we have established a strong base of enterprise in Ireland across a range of key sectors.  Nine of the top ten global pharmaceutical companies are located in Ireland and 11 of the top 12 global medical technology companies have a manufacturing base here.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">As for the funding of ESOF and the Dublin City of Science 2012 festival, the Government, through my own Department, has provided significant funding to support the initiative.  In addition, extensive fundraising has been undertaken and this has resulted in resources being raised from industry and international organisations.  Key sponsors and supporters include the European Commission, Robert Bosch Stiftung, IBM, Intel, Janssen, EirGrid, Bord Gáis, the Marine Institute, the Abbott Fund and the European Cooperation in Science and Technology, COST, framework, as well as Elsevier, Teagasc and Dublin City Council.  Expenditure of €6 million is being supported by revenue from the Exchequer, sponsorship, exhibition rental, registration fees and support from the European Commission.  Euroscience Open Forum, ESOF, Dublin City of Science 2012 has received extensive sponsorship from enterprise.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">We are fortunate we have been able to count on broad support from all sides from the outset of ESOF Dublin City of Science initiative.  We will be counting on that support even more as we ensure the year itself and the central conference will be a significant success for all.  The hosting of the ESOF 2012 and the associated designating of Dublin as city of science for this year is a significant achievement and milestone for all of us, whether we are scientists, members of the general public, public representatives, from industry, from academia, from the community and voluntary sectors or from the arts and cultural sphere.  There is substantial prestige surrounding Dublin's successful bid to host the renowned ESOF for 2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">I acknowledge the role of the many stakeholders involved in the process to bring ESOF to Dublin and those who have developed the accompanying Dublin city of science programme which is being rolled out over the course of the year.  They include the office of the chief scientific adviser, Forfás, the Dublin city of science local organising committee, the many associated working groups and committees and everyone who has volunteered to make this initiative happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">I wish all Members an enjoyable and positive experience at the ESOF and Dublin City of Science 2012.  I hope they will spread the word about these events as Dublin gets ready to assume the centre stage of European science and register to participate at <i>esof2012.org</i>.</p>

          <p eId="para_311">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and join with him in welcoming the ESOF that will take place in Dublin this July.  As he pointed out, it gives us an opportunity to showcase the best of Irish science and all the exciting developments in it to the international science community.  With 5,000 delegates in the Convention Centre, Dublin, it is also a great opportunity to showcase it as a top-class facility which could attract other high-value conferences and tourism to Dublin city.  I hope those who attend the ESOF will become ambassadors for the centre and for Dublin afterwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">The ESOF, along with the Dublin City of Science 2012, has a programme to engage the public.  We have seen from examples such as the Science Gallery in Trinity College Dublin that there are interesting ways of making science accessible and making it easier for people to learn about all the exciting developments in the science community.  Accordingly, I welcome the fact there will be so many public events as part of the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">I note part of the programme includes a section on entrepreneurship and on forming a company as part of a science-2-business programme.  There has been much success in Ireland with multinational and foreign direct investment.  However, we need to do more for Irish people with scientific ideas to enable them to become enterprises and convert their ideas into businesses and small companies.  This section will be of great value to the Irish scientists taking part in the ESOF.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">There has been significant investment in science technology and innovation over the past several years.  Considering our current economic strengths and niches it is an area with great potential for employment and growth.  It is central to both maintaining existing foreign direct investment and attracting more in the future.  While the Tánaiste quipped during the general election that we cannot all work in a laboratory, thankfully many do and I hope many more will.  As the Minister of State stated, we are excelling in niche areas such as immunology and pharmaceuticals and can still be world leaders in them.  The previous Government prioritised the areas of science and research with investment the whole way up from schools to research laboratories.  The PRTLI, programme for research in third-level institutions, was also established and through its five cycles approximately €900 million has been made available for research.  We have seen successes from that with Ireland in the top 20 countries in the overall scientific global rankings and that nine of the top ten global pharmaceutical companies are based here.  This shows this investment has paid off.  In the current circumstances with resources so tight, it is important we are investing in the right areas and there is a direct pay-off with jobs.  The Minister of State will have support from his side of the House when making arguments for budget funding in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">From previous engagements, I know the Minister of State is amenable to listening to some of the Opposition's proposals.  We need to improve integrating science with students' other interests, particularly at second level.  For example, sports science could be made part of the second level curriculum.  With the current interest in this summer's Olympic Games, such a programme could get kids thinking about sports science and deal with the practicality of a training programme for, say, the boxer, Katie Taylor, rather than heavy theory from textbooks.  University first-year science and technology programmes should be more generic.  The concern has been raised at conferences organised by the Higher Education Authority, HEA, that some university courses are too specific in their first year.  We should consider making science a general degree while medicine, pharmacy and psychology become graduate programmes as they are elsewhere.  This would address the issues we have with high points for entry into medicine.  The Minister will be aware of the criticisms made about the health professions admission test, HPAT-Ireland, which was an attempt to put in place a better entry system but it seems to have added extra burdens to students.  There is also the issue of an inequality being introduced through the test because private courses to pass the test can be purchased.  We need to examine greater interaction at third level between the humanities and the sciences.  Some colleges have been good at opening up the idea of a broad curriculum.  They get students in different areas to do modules in languages or a little science or, if one is in science, a little business.  From giving science students an element of entrepreneurship and giving humanities students a basic understanding of science, it would be good to have more cross-disciplinary options as well.  If one thinks of it, Leonardo da Vinci was not only a scientific genius, he was also a great artist.  There is much complementarity, and yet, increasingly, and with more specialised courses, we are separating the humanities and the sciences, and that is something that should be looked at.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">On a criticism which I offer constructively, I am genuinely concerned about how the Government can expect more students to study science at graduate level when all the postgraduate grants have been abolished.  It is creating problems right across the system.  Many postgraduate students are only becoming aware of it.  Many who will be looking to apply for postgraduate courses, now that they have finished their undergraduate examinations and are looking at what options will be able open to them in the autumn, are realising that they cannot afford it.  From a jobs point of view, as well as equity of access, that will cause considerable problems for us.  That should be looked at.  Perhaps the Minister of State, in his own brief, could consider increasing the level of funding for postgraduate grants to the new Irish Research Council, maybe even in only specific scientific areas.</p>

          <from>Senator Michael Mullins</from>
          <p eId="para_321">In deputising for my colleague, Senator Clune, I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, and compliment him on the fine job he is doing as Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation.  It is appropriate we would have the opportunity in the Seanad to discuss the forthcoming Euroscience Open Forum, which is to be held in Dublin.  This forum, as the Minister of State has said, is the highlight of Dublin's year as European City of Science.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">I congratulate Professor Patrick Cunningham, the chief scientific adviser to the Government, who was the key person who led the bid to secure Dublin's tenure as city of science for this year.  Four years ago, in Strasbourg, the announcement was made and prior to that Professor Cunningham would have led a team to ensure Dublin was successful in edging out Vienna.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">As the Minister of State has said, this prestigious event takes place every two years, and Turin, in 2010, and Barcelona, in 2008, were the previous hosts.  It is a great honour for Dublin to host this conference.  It is not only about the city of Dublin; it is about the island of Ireland.  In 2006-2007, as preparations were made for the bid to secure Dublin as the science capital of Europe for this year, the Celtic tiger would have been booming and science and its applications and potential economic value was far from the minds of many.  Looking back at how far we have come, we should acknowledge that the Government, at that time advised by Professor Cunningham, certainly was aware of what needed to be done to develop Ireland's capacities in the sciences, to develop Ireland as a smart economy and to promote it as an international hub for activities in science and technology.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">This ambition has continued with the present Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation and it underlines the commitment, as does the continued funding for Science Foundation Ireland, which was established in 2000 to oversee funding to the biotechnology and ICT areas which at that time were identified as the engine of future growth in the world economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">No doubt the commitment demonstrated by the State towards developing science and excellence in research would certainly have played a strong role in ensuring Dublin was awarded the title of city of science this year.  It is an important platform for this country.  We are renowned for our artistic and literary heritage and we are now making a name for ourselves in the area of innovation and research.  Not alone will this event be important for ourselves in terms of attracting investment in research or facilitating scientific projects, it will also be important in educating and informing the public on the benefits of science and the value that science technology, engineering and maths will continue to play in the future economic development of this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">There is a dual purpose to this event and I note the remarks of Dr. Gail Cardew, who is the chair of the ESOF supervisory board and vice-president of Euroscience.  She said she was particularly impressed with Dublin's clear vision in opening the event out to the world and the lengths to which the Dublin committee went to bring international partners, including industry, on board.  She was also impressed by the emphasis on maximising communication technology.  That appears to be the focus that swung it for Dublin.  Professor Cunningham has stated the events of the ESOF and the year of Dublin as city of science would underline a philosophy of ensuring the way in which science serves society is continually identified and promoted.  The list of more than 106 events that are being highlighted throughout the year and which range from weather to air quality to solar studies to water quality to the scientific value of music demonstrate how science interacts with our lives every day.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">I referred to Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, the body charged with ensuring investment in research teams identifies those who are most likely to generate new knowledge of value in the fields of science and engineering, especially across the areas of biotechnology, information and communications technology, and sustainable and energy efficient technologies.  One of the strengths of Science Foundation Ireland is that partnerships between scientists and industry are strongly encouraged and the needs of industry are identified.  Scientists and engineers become aware of these needs, and also industry has an insight into what new areas are being developed in our third level institutions.  It is important this would continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">Research and innovation in our third level sectors must focus on developing employment.  I was particularly pleased to read the Minister of State's recent announcement of the Science-2-Business programme which is due to take place in the Euroscience forum next month.  This also will bring academics and members of the business community together and highlight how publicly funded research, which is the type of research supported by SFI, can be transferred and can develop successful companies.  Science Foundation Ireland's figures show a continued increase year on year in the number of collaborations industry has with its researchers.  This is important to note as it was never the intention that SFI would support researchers to sit in their laboratories or at their computers and produce information for the sake of it.  We must continue to ensure the research that is carried out is made available to and is influenced by industry to ensure maximum return for this economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">The ESOF meeting next month will be an opportunity to bring together a range of individuals from all over Europe, from scientists to business persons to policy makers to communicators to members of the public, to discuss and focus on science, the humanities, the social sciences and the direction in which these areas are moving.  It comes at an exciting time in the world of technology which is developing at a faster pace than many of us can keep up with.  There are many positives in the research area that should be highlighted.  One last week of which we were informed was the valuable work being done by doctors in Cork who have shown that the level of radiation to which patients with Crohn's disease who have been referred for a CT scan are exposed can be significantly reduced while not losing any diagnostic accuracy.  This is just one example of the constant flow of new innovations and new therapies that are being identified from research funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">I especially welcome the joint announcement by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, on 8 June outlining the new structures they intend to put in place to make it much easier to commercialise ideas.  State-funded research stands at €800 million per annum, which is a significant figure, and we must maximise the return from that investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">This follows from the commitment in the programme for Government and the jobs action plan for 2012.  The initiative contains a range of ideas aimed at encouraging businesses to commercialise their research and access research in third level institutes.  The new central technology transfer offices will act as a one stop shop, an initiative for which business and those working in industry have been calling.  So much is happening in our third level institutes that it is hard to decipher what exactly can be of value and a connection needs to be built between research centres and would-be investors.  I refer to venture capitalists and individuals with business acumen who want to invest in innovations with commercial potential.  They need to be connected with the outputs of research.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">I also welcome the proposed improved management of our intellectual property and the standardising of terms.  This is also what the market has been calling for.  Money spent on research must be turned into jobs where possible and obstacles must be eliminated.  Clear lines of communication must be established and burdensome red tape minimised to get products to market.  I look forward to the Euroscience Open Forum as another important step in the development of the knowledge economy.  I hope the forum will be successful in its mission of engaging and informing the general public about science.  I wish the festivals to which the Minister of State referred well, including the Cork science festival and the Galway science and technology festival which has been running for several years.  I acknowledge the good work done by his predecessor and former representative of my constituency, Mr. Noel Treacy, on the Galway festival.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FergalQuinn" eId="spk_184">
          <from>Senator Feargal Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_333">I was delighted to hear the views expressed by the Minister of State.  I have a vested interest in this matter because two years ago I received a telephone call from the chief scientific adviser, Professor Cunningham, who asked me to serve on the group which put together the bid.  I assumed when he contacted me that he was aware of my great skills in science.  I was fortunate to have had a marvellous science teacher, Fr. Michael Casey, when I attended the Dominican College in Newbridge.  Just after I left Fr. Casey went on to become a professor of science at NUI Maynooth.  He fostered a deep interest in physics, botany, biology and chemistry among those who passed through his hands.  It was great to see a teacher who was enthusiastic and interested.  We almost got to know the famous Irishmen mentioned by the Minister of State as well as anyone else.  In recent years I came to know James Watson and his wife, Elizabeth.  They were in touch with me yesterday to say they were coming to our home for dinner next month.  James Watson is the man who discovered the double helix of DNA with Francis Crick in 1953 and was awarded the Nobel prize in 1962.  We attended his 80th birthday celebrations four years ago.  It is a joy to be in the company of a person who is as exciting as him.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">The Minister of State left out one of the names of the important people involved.  Dara Ó Briain, an Irish comedian who appears on British television, will also be attending because he is a science graduate and a real enthusiast of the subject.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">I hope the forum will make more people interested in science by connecting them with the international science community.  It is a challenge to interest young people in science subjects.  A Dutch study published in 2008 found that highly socialised extrovert students tended to drop science subjects at the earliest opportunity.  I presume they steer themselves instead towards more human areas of work such as law, politics and economics.  The <i>New Scientist</i> states: “Reintroducing into school curricula the humanity of science — with all its flaws, its tales of outrageous behaviour and even more outrageous characters — would give teens the opportunity to see scientists as role models”.  We have to bring back the human side of science and I hope the forum contributes to that goal.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">I am glad the forum will also include discussions on entrepreneurship and company formation because that is where the jobs will be created.  The science to business section includes presentations on how companies and university researchers can benefit from collaboration.  Gender also appears to make a difference when it comes to entrepreneurship.  There is so much potential for collaboration between business and science.  Several years ago Trinity College Dublin developed a new scheme called IdentiGEN, the world's first meat trace back programme, in a joint effort with my company, Superquinn.  The company has since won several international deals for DNA tracing systems.  We need to see more of these scientific start-up initiatives.  Another company that is doing very well stems from University College Cork.  It is called Nualight and develops LED lighting.  It is taking over several companies in the United States, Holland and elsewhere.  These were start-up companies which originated in one man's mind, but they have since become very successful.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">In terms of SMEs, we should be looking to the strength of the food industry.  I am glad the forum is considering food technology, but we could do more to support innovation and technology in the agrifood sector.  For example, the food innovation showcase which takes place in New Zealand welcomes visitors from all over the world to explore that country's leading edge food technology companies and products.  It is not only a question of developing good products but also of commercialising, marketing and selling them.  The New Zealand Government actively supports the development of new and innovative products that can help the country to become more successful through advantages such as its joined up dairy industry, with specific products for individual markets.  It has the ability to access markets more successfully than Ireland.  We have to explore growing markets in healthier and more environmentally friendly foods, as well as emerging markets in the food and drink industry because we are in danger of being left behind.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">The world's population recently passed the 7 billion mark and is expected to reach 9 billion by 2050.  Ireland's population growth rate is faster than any other European country.  We are well placed to benefit from this population growth in terms of food security.  Last year <i>The Economist</i> published a special report on food security which asserted that intensive agriculture along Brazilian lines, alongside extensive use of fertiliser and genetically modified crops, would be necessary evils.  Instead of dismissing genetically modified foods out of hand, should we not debate the issue now rather than risk being overtaken?  Are some innovations good and others regarded as bad?  Are we becoming anti-innovation and anti-science by dismissing genetically modified crops out of hand?  The irony is that most of us are happy to be injected with a vaccine that has been produced through biotechnology.  It is expected that the influence of Brazil, Russia, India and China on food markets will rise as Europe’s declines.  Europe’s decision to turn its back on genetic modification and the livestock revolution may be understandable, but given the need for higher yields, it is in danger of marginalising itself.  I can almost say the same about nuclear power.  While I know there has been a major problem with a nuclear power plant in Japan, there are many successful nuclear energy sites throughout the world.  Nuclear energy is not a fossil fuel and we should not turn our backs and have nothing to do with it.  Most politicians have been afraid to say something about hydraulic fracturing to access gas, but there have been major successes.  The one that comes to mind is in North Dakota which has been very successful and yet we are turning our back on these ideas.  I am not saying they are right, but we should at least debate these matters.  We should at least discuss and investigate the three areas of genetically modified food, nuclear energy and fracking.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">I welcome the debate on science and the interest in it.  I particularly welcome the Euroscience Open Forum, which I believe will be very successful.  We should be very proud of the input into it.  Its real aim is to ensure that science becomes of greater interest to young people in Ireland.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SusanOKeeffe" eId="spk_185">
          <from>Senator Susan O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_340">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  It is good to be here discussing something as bright and exciting as the Euroscience Open Forum.  I believe this debate is being held at the suggestion of Senator Quinn for which I thank him.  I also thank him for his contribution to getting Dublin to host the event.  It will be a wonderful event — the Minister of State has described it as the equivalent of the Olympic Games.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">The Euroscience Open Forum was founded in 1974, which is not long ago.  It had 42 academies attached to it then and that has increased to 72.  We are expecting approximately 5,000 visitors.  It is not about those kinds of numbers but about the prestige and profile in science and technology it will give Dublin and Ireland.  We need to build that profile because while we have a rich cultural heritage we also need to show we can cut it in the science and technology area.  I am glad that while Euroscience Open Forum has always stood for research and technology, it has been expanded to include the humanities and the arts.  Our capacity to be creative and see beyond the constraints should allow us in this case to be better at mixing the humanities, arts and science than other countries which might not have the same creative capacity.  In that perhaps we can excel both on this occasion and also into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">The forum offers the opportunity to demystify and make more attractive the idea of science.  As somebody who qualified as a food scientist, much of what was taught as science in school was quite limited.  From anecdotal evidence it seems that while some teachers try very hard to make it really interesting, they still struggle with the curriculum.  They also struggle with health and safety restrictions preventing children from doing certain experiments.  They are desperate to get their hands dirty and desperate, as Deputy Power said, to find a way into the area.  However, at the basic fundamental level perhaps only two students get a chance to put something in a bottle and shaking it to see it change colour, while the other 30 sit and watch.  That simply will not work and children want to do it for themselves.  We know from science museums and other such places that children will rush to participate in an interactive activity.  At an open day at my daughter's school, Ursuline College, the teachers had put together a great selection of things for the children coming to view the school to have a go at.  They were all really excited and there was a buzz coming into the room, which proves my point.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">I pay credit to the incredible work of the Young Scientist Exhibition, which was well ahead of the curve in terms of understanding children's interest in and capacity for science.  I sincerely hope the Young Scientist Exhibition is involved in the forum.  Even if not, I believe it offers great potential for us to build.  Perhaps the Minister of State in conjunction with the Minister for Education and Skills can investigate using that area as a springboard for greater things into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">I am delighted to hear of the "science hack" day that will take place during this event.  I love the idea of a 36-hour all-day and all-night event — perhaps some politicians might join them — as they try to find solutions to real life problems.  I would like to know if the euro crisis will be on the agenda and if the Minister of State is going to be there, we would like an answer.  I also love the idea of the author, Brian Greene, teaming up with the composer Philip Glass, in what is described as a futuristic reimagining of the classic Greek myth set in outer space about a boy who challenges the awesome power of a black hole.  Here we have exactly that kind of creative and imaginative approach to science.  If that approach were taken in schools, the black hole and all that goes with it would no longer be a boring piece of paper but would be an event that children would go home and discuss with their parents.  They might even talk about themselves being involved in science.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">There is also <i>A Man in Half</i>, the gripping drama of suspense, terror and humour, inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson’s <i>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde</i>.  This is the way forward for science.  Last year’s World Economic Forum report indicated that students here are failing in mathematics, physics and chemistry.  However, at a time when we know our children are bright and capable and with an education system which — despite the problems we have — is still pretty good, they are still failing.  It is not the children who are failing, but the system is failing the children.  As public representatives we go around the schools and see the children’s bright shiny faces and see the enthusiasm.  We must conclude the system is failing them rather than them failing.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">I love that science in this case will be reaching out well beyond its narrow remit with tours, trails, buskers, installations and also things such as the exploration of music and the brain.  Yesterday I was involved in the launch of the inaugural Yeats Day in Sligo.  However, with our great cultural hats on, we had not thought about science and perhaps next year we could have some food aspect.  As a food scientist it did not occur to me, but it has now.  We have nine bean rows and hives for honeybees.  At the very least I am sure we could find some way.  That is where we need to start building the science in, and with our great creativity we can do something.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">In third level colleges, the students who make it through the system are reaching out beyond the traditional areas.  Some months ago I attended a presentation in Sligo IT.  A student there, Anthony Blake, is trying to work out a cost-effective anchoring solution for the offshore energy industry, called a dynamically embedded plate anchor.  If Anthony Blake and his colleagues crack this, it will revolutionise how the offshore energy industry works.  He is in Sligo trying to work this out for the rest of the world.  If he cracks it, it will save enormous amounts of money and will make offshore energy much more cost effective and efficient.  John O'Toole is looking for cracks in bones using acoustic emissions.  Robert Carroll is looking at the development of first-generation portable system for the analysis of micro-damage in the behaviour in bone.  Joe Hynes is working on the engineered restoration techniques for degraded raised bogs.  These are the realities of what is going on once children get through second level.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">I am involved in discussions over how Sligo IT and the local secondary schools can come together in order to display to children the kind of work they are doing.  These students are in their early 20s and have a much better capacity to communicate with our children than those of us who are somewhat older.  We need to get those young students to get the students four, five or six years behind them enthusiastic about the potential of the STEM subjects, namely, science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and let them know that is where the future lies.  As Senator Power has rightly said it would be great to use sport as a way into science and it would be even better if we had great sportspeople to endorse that.  We have our own champions in every region.  We have them in all the ITs and in the universities.  Can we find a way in which we can encourage them to be champions for science and technology locally?</p>
          <p eId="para_349">I am negotiating with Sligo IT on a conference — for want of a better word — for parents, teachers and children from fourth year up in Sligo in October to show what it is all about.  It will be a microcosm version of the Euroscience Open Forum.  Sligo IT is certainly enthusiastic about the idea of selling the STEM subjects to secondary school pupils and their parents, in particular, and the understanding that there is a great world out there.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">The Minister of State spoke about the need to create jobs and he is correct.  However, it is about more than creating jobs; it is about creating an environment in which people understand, appreciate and enjoy science in their everyday lives in order that parents and teachers, even those who do not teach science, become enablers.  The Euroscience Open Forum has the capacity to break from its narrow remit over the five days.  It has the capacity to excite people beyond this period.  If the Government and the Minister of State, given his remit, can achieve this, it will put science on a good platform for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">I draw attention to one small project in the Dundalk area which involves Junior Achievement Ireland and the firm Prometric and of which I am sure the Minister of State is aware.  It uses the idea of education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics as the foundation for a rewarding and professional career and encouraging children to stay in school, telling them it is the way forward for them.  The firm is funding the project and working with the schools in the area.  Last year Google stated there was still a shortage of people to take up jobs.  I know the Minister of State will work hard to bring this together and the forum will do much to help.  We would like to work with him in whatever way we can to excite the public about science.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanDBarrett" eId="spk_186">
          <from>Senator Sean D. Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_352">I welcome the Minister of State and thank Senator Susan O'Keeffe for reintroducing W. B. Yeats to this Chamber which he graced for so many years.  This is a wonderful project for which the Minister of State will have the support of everyone in the House, as Senators Susan O'Keeffe and Averil Power stated.  There is excitement about it.  I can inform the House that the Science Gallery which Senator Averil Power mentioned will be a franchise and the first will be located in London; therefore, there might be a TCD Science Gallery in all big cities.  I endorse the comments in favour of Professor Patrick Cunningham and his work as the Government's chief scientific adviser.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">This year the Trinity Monday discourse was on E. T. S. Walton, still the only Irish Nobel prizewinner in science.  It was a wonderful occasion.  We found a quote from Rutherford who was his helper in that great project and joint winner.  He stated that in times of austerity in the United Kingdom, as they had no money, it was time for ideas.  This echoes very much what the Minister of State seeks to accomplish.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">Other speakers mentioned linking literature and the arts, in which we have a great track record, with the new developments in science.  The division is entirely artificial.  The former professor of music at TCD, Mr. Brian Boydell, who composed the wonderful television version of the national anthem which was played each night at the end of transmission before the advent of 24 hour broadcasting, was a geologist first and changed to music.  Some jokers in TCD said he changed from rock to the classics.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">I gather from very old teachers that in the 1920s we had rural science and nature study programmes in primary schools and that we also had language teaching, which we have moved out to make more room for the revival of Irish and so on.  We now know that learning the Irish language from a book for ten or 14 years and never speaking it is not the way to do it and that changing this approach would free up more time.  It is a pity we have a less broad curriculum in primary schools.  The reintroduction of a science subject should be considered.  I welcome Senator Susan O'Keeffe's suggestion that students be the ones to do this.  They are young and enthusiastic, whereas the rest of us might seem to be 100 years old to young people when we go into a classroom.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">That brings me to an issue on which I know the Minister of State has worked — mathematics.  I support his efforts in this regard.  Some of the institutions have not been as co-operative as they might be.  I do not think the bonus points idea means anything.  What we need are people who know a subject to teach it.  I wonder whether we should move towards the Finnish model whereby one must have a Masters degree to teach a subject.  One thing about the young people mentioned by Senator Susan O'Keeffe and others is that they know very quickly whether one is a real expert who is totally <i>ad idem</i> with the subject or whether a person did a degree in something else and is merely a few pages ahead in the schoolbook.  Children aged eight, nine or ten years become clued in quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">Surveys show that the most popular teacher is the English teacher, which is probably because this teacher has the atmosphere of teaching O'Casey, Yeats and others.  Serious discussions should take place between the Minister of State and the Department on the subjects in which we need a supply of teachers, including mathematics and the sciences.  The job of the Department of Education and Skills and the universities is to produce these teachers.  If there is not a proper mix between what the students and the Minister of State want and what the students are producing, what used to be called the H. Dip. in Ed. must be questioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">I welcome private sector and business involvement.  With regard to the genetics issue raised by Senator Feargal Quinn, the sugar company in Mallow and other places provided for the initial endowment for Professor George Dawson and the genetics department at TCD.  The Moyne Institute located near here is called after the Guinness company.  Sometimes the private sector in Ireland is inclined to ask for more subsidies and grants, but let them emulate those who put money in and offer bursaries and fellowships to people to study science, given the difficulties in the public finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">Many people studying subjects such as genetics would endorse what Senator Feargal Quinn stated.  There is a phobia about genetically modified food.  Let us have a proper debate on the issue without the stridency.  Perhaps the same applies to nuclear power.  I asked Professor Holland, the professor of geology at TCD, about fracking and he believes it can be done without the dire environmental consequences its opponents fear.  Let us have these rational discussions without the stridency.  Perhaps an anti-science mentality epitomised such discussions in the past.  The Young Scientist Exhibition is also important.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">I will make one plea.  We are developing many subjects, but, unfortunately — I say it against my own subject — it was the lack of a knowledge of economics in crucial places that caused the collapse in 2008.  Therefore, it is a subject that also needs to be developed.  We did not have the expertise when we needed it.</p>

        <heading>Euroscience Open Forum 2012: Statements (Resumed)</heading>
        <speech by="#MaryMoran" eId="spk_188">
          <from>Senator Mary Moran</from>
          <p eId="para_373">The Minister of State is always welcome in the House and I congratulate him on his work to date.  I add my voice of welcome to the Euroscience Open Forum, ESOF, 2012 coming to Dublin.  It is an exciting time.  As the Minister of State mentioned, it is a boost and an opportunity for Ireland, as hosting it gives us substantial prestige.  That nine out of the world's top ten pharmaceutical companies and 11 out of its top 12 medical technology companies are based in Ireland shows how serious we are in this field.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">ESOF 2012 will take place on 11 to 15 July during the school holidays.  I have a teaching background.  Have all schools been encouraged to take their students to the forum or advised them to attend?  Were it to be held during the school term, busloads of students would attend.  I hope they will be notified before the holidays rather than in September.  Public relations can sometimes be important.  Youth groups love to bring people to events such as this, but only if they know about them.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">When I attended school, science as a subject was only offered to the top stream.  Subjects were labelled depending on one's ability.  Many students believe that science is a difficult subject.  I brought some of my classes to the W5 science museum in Belfast.  It always provides a fantastic experience and shows a different side of science.  Science was one of my most difficult subjects in school and I went on to study music.  Senator Barrett stated it was a question of crossing the divide, but I always avoided chemistry, physics and so on.  I had a patient teacher.  After I finished my music degree, I studied for a masters in music technology.  Only then did I appreciate the link between music and the sciences, particularly in terms of psycho-acoustics.  For the first time, I learned the real science behind the music.  W5 houses an interactive harp that one plays by using laser beams.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">There is fantastic assistive technology for the disabled, and the scientific world provides advantages for children or stroke-afflicted adults who have no voice, in that they are afforded the opportunity to communicate audibly through, for example, Soundbeam.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">We have all attended school open days where food colouring changed mixtures and so on.  We want to encourage science in this way.  ESOF is a fantastic opportunity to do so, but let us get the word out there.  We should all register.  We could publish press releases and attract young people to the forum.</p>

          <from>Deputy Sean Sherlock</from>
          <p eId="para_385">We have all bought into the concept of ESOF and everyone acknowledges the positive role it can play.  Given our aims for research and innovation, we need to be able to measure impacts more accurately.  The prioritisation action group follows on from the research prioritisation exercise and was instigated by Mr. Jim O'Hara.  It was concluded that the State would focus its research on 14 key areas to create the requisite economic impact without taking our foot off the pedal in terms of funding basic science education.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">Through the action group, we are in the process of bringing all of the funders of research in this country to the table so that we can measure the impact of science, investment and outputs.  We will move the conversation towards bringing science closer to industry so that our universities and institutes of technology will be able to create the types of Irish company we desire.  This path has evolved from the situation to which Senator Power alluded and that obtained under previous Governments.  Initial investment to build capacity came through the programme for research in third level institutions.  We are moving into a phase of measuring impacts more accurately.  This is a major challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">There has been a significant realisation of the fact that the scientific community has the wherewithal, human capital and skill set to be able to deliver for Ireland a tranche of new types of companies.  We have not even begun to scratch the surface of what is possible.  It is a question of mining people's creativity, but I do not know whether one can measure the bounds of that.  There are boundless opportunities.  The Government's job is to ensure we are either on the money or ahead of the curve in terms of realising those opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">Senator O'Keeffe mentioned creativity.  I met the Crafts Council of Ireland last month.  Consider its creativity and products.  If that creativity could be married with what is being produced in the Tyndall National Institute, our institutes of technology and so on, one could create the types of company we need.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">It is significant that today Mr. James Whelton, a co-founder of CoderDojo, is in New York at the founders' conference.  Along with Mr. Bill Liao he is rolling out programming courses to children outside of school settings on Saturday mornings in centres throughout the country.  That is the type of platform we are creating but there is an inventory that has yet to be measured with the disparate initiatives happening around science, technology, engineering and maths, or STEM.  Senator O'Keeffe has brought a new initiative to my attention and I hope I will be able to assist her and lend a hand if I can as a Minister of State.  We must create the inventory of what exactly is going on with regard to STEM subjects so we can bring it together and co-ordinate those efforts.  CoderDojo is one example but it only happens in certain geographical areas.  We should see how we can replicate that across the system, which is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">What is happening is inherently positive but it is quite disparate.  My role as a Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation is to try to map what we are doing and replicate it across the system.  I do not want the Government to take control and become hierarchical, as much of it is an organic process of creativity.  It will, by itself, create the type of jobs and enterprise we so badly need.  Creating the inventory is important in assisting the various processes.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">I have responsibility for the STEM subjects with my role in the Department of Education and Skills.  We have moved to create a fund that will upskill out-of-field teachers on the mathematics side in particular.  That will be done through the National Centre for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching and Learning in the University of Limerick.  It will have a vital impact in ensuring that the deficits that exist in STEM subjects will be addressed.  It is only a first step.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">I visited Finland lately and we had a very positive engagement with the Finns about their system.  Our aim must be to move up the food chain.  Senator Barrett made the point about mathematics teachers having a suitable qualification and that would not be lost on me.  We should meanwhile ensure our teachers have the skill set and availability of continuing professional development that is vital to the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">I am struck by the point made by Senator Power about boxer Katie Taylor.  Arising from the suggestion, perhaps we could engage with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, in a way to try to introduce a short course in the junior certificate as a potential staging post for that kind of engagement.  There should be no reason the NCCA cannot engage on the most blue sky thinking and how to roll this back to the education system.  There may be a way to do this through the short courses on the junior cycle.</p>

          <from>Deputy Sean Sherlock</from>
          <p eId="para_395">That is one possibility.  With regard to the public and political engagement with science, we are talking about an apolitical space, which I mentioned before.  Professor Mark Ferguson, the new director of Science Foundation Ireland, has engaged with the Oireachtas through breakfast briefings.  If there are specific ideas that must come from this forum, we should try to facilitate it.  That is one idea.  If a representative group from this House wanted to explore some of those possibilities, I would more than gladly meet those involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">With regard to women and science, I attended the women and science event at the European Commission quite recently.  I agree with Senator Power's comments.  It is fascinating that the National Institute for Bioprocessing Research and Training, NIBRT, in UCD has a significant gender balance but when we move up the science food chain, we are more likely to find men in pinstripe suits.  There must be a mechanism to allow greater involvement by women in key decision making programmes.  How can a man like myself talk about this without sounding patronising?  That is the other challenge.  I can say I am from a generation of men with no issues of gender; my colleagues are female and if my boss is a woman, so be it.  I do not know how to speak about this with authority except to say there are initiatives through programmes involving women in science and mathematics.  There is the question of breaking the glass ceiling and if policy instruments or quotas can be used, and I do not know if that is possible.  It is a conversation I am willing to have.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">Senator Quinn referred to Watson and Crick and I am envious that Mr. James Watson is going to the Senator's house for dinner.  I would love to be there.  Senators Quinn and Barrett are correct in that we must create a space in this country for debate about issues like genetically modified organisms, nuclear fission and food security.  In my constituency there is Teagasc at Moorepark, and there is a deep engagement, for example, between food science, the dairy industry and food technology through UCC and places like it.  With regard to the Teagasc facility at Moorepark and elsewhere, I would very much like to create a space where Teagasc would have some degree of autonomy to try to spin out its own companies.  That would create huge opportunities.  I am scheduled to meet with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, to explore the possibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">Teagasc is an entity which faces enterprise and I know people like Mr. Paul Ross at Moorepark in Fermoy, who is part of a research cluster in UCC.  There is an engagement through Moorepark Technology limited.  I am not being too parochial about this but it is a microcosm of what is happening.  Perhaps further possibilities should be explored around that and I hope to have further engagement on that also.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">It is a key point that we do not know the amount of intellectual property that has been created through the decades or what is to come.  That is why we created the intellectual property protocol and the idea of having a central technology transfer office.  Every academic institution or research facility will be plugged into a technology transfer system and an intellectual property protocol, and that will at least give guidance to scientists, industry and the public with regard to funding of science and research.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">Many other issues have been raised and I would be happy to engage further with Senators on those.  I thank the Senators for the opportunity to contribute to this debate.</p>

        <heading>Referendum on the Thirtieth Amendment of the Constitution: Statements</heading>
        <speech by="#MichaelMullins" eId="spk_199">
          <from>Senator Michael Mullins</from>
          <p eId="para_401">I welcome the opportunity to make a statement in the aftermath of the recent referendum on the Thirtieth Amendment of the Constitution.  All Members — certainly those on this side of the House — welcome the outcome of the referendum.  I acknowledge the efforts of the Government parties which campaigned very strongly for a "Yes" vote, as well as the strong support of Fianna Fáil during the course of the campaign to ensure a result that would be in the country's best interests.  I must single out the directors of elections who did a tremendous job — the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, for Fine Gael, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, for the Labour Party and Deputy Timmy Dooley for Fianna Fáil.  I also recognise the tremendous work done by the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, who impressed and convinced the people to vote "Yes" in the referendum.  They rejected in an emphatic way the negative "No" campaign which wished to make it a referendum about everything but not what it was supposed to be about.  I am pleased the people have taken a positive step in keeping our focus on the economy and ensuring a sustainable track to recovery.  I am glad they responded to the hard-fought campaign for several weeks.  By endorsing the stability treaty, a crucial part of the jigsaw has been put in place as we rebuild a working Ireland.  The result will help to bring about the certainty needed for recovery and growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">The "Yes" vote represents a positive move by Ireland on several fronts.  We are sending a strong message to international investors that Ireland is a sound and solid economy in which to invest and create jobs.  Thousands of jobs have been created since the beginning of the year, 1,200 of them in County Galway, a fact with which I am pleased.  The result of the referendum will help us to maintain this stream of investment.  With 445,000 people unemployed, we need to keep the emphasis on job creation and attract foreign direct investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">The other issue which arose during the campaign was whether Ireland would have access to other funds at the end of 2013.  We now have the security and certainty of knowing that, in the event of us needing additional emergency funding, it will be available to us and that we will be in a position to pay doctors, teachers and nurses in the years ahead.  The stability treaty will ensure future Governments, irrespective of which parties are in power, will have to adhere to sensible budgeting rules, which is in our best interests.  As we gradually reduce our debt levels in the next few years, we will have more money to spend on public services such as schools and hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">Addressing our debt levels was the main issue in the campaign.  The Government will continue to ensure any proposal advanced at EU level will be in Ireland's interests as well as those of the European Union.  We will be watching developments in Spain, while the elections in Greece this weekend could have serious implications for the euro and the eurozone.  The Government will strongly support any proposal which will help to ease Ireland and Europe's debt crisis.  It has stated the need to break the link between bank and sovereign debt, a key element of our banking strategy.  It has actively proposed this approach at European summits.  Throughout 2011 the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, set out his position at and after ECOFIN meetings that the ESM, European Stability Mechanism, or other European funds should be directly investing capital in banks in return for equity.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">We have also pointed to the obvious benefits of an EU level approach to bank recapitalisation as not impacting on the general government debt of member states.  Members will be aware that the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, has stated there needs to be a separation of banks and state in the provision of assistance, which is a welcome approach.  The outcome of the recent referendum has strengthened the Government's hand when it comes to these discussions and negotiations.  Members will appreciate why the Taoiseach at times cannot be overly forthcoming on some of the negotiations at both ministerial and official level.</p>

          <p eId="para_407">In time, I have no doubt the Government will secure a successful outcome to the negotiations on the debt crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">I thank the people for the strong support they gave in the referendum.  I was pleased that in Galway East almost 64% voted in favour of the treaty.  It will not solve all of the country's problems, but it gives us grounds to continue the work of economic recovery commenced by the Government.  I appreciate the support given to us in the campaign by Fianna Fáil, the business and farming communities.  The people realised it was in the country's best interest which, as a Government representative, I greatly appreciate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AverilPower" eId="spk_202">
          <from>Senator Averil Power</from>
          <p eId="para_409">I welcome the opportunity to comment on the recent referendum result and join Senator Michael Mullins in welcoming the "Yes" vote.  While it is one small part of the solution to Ireland and Europe's economic problems, it is an important part.  Personally, I was very relieved that people decided to vote "Yes" in the referendum.  We discussed many of the arguments before the vote in terms of why a "Yes" vote is important.  It provides access to the ESM if we need it.  It was a crucial issue in the campaign to have the security and certainty that if we needed access to the European Stability Mechanism, it would be there.  That gives us options, even if the ESM is not our only option.  Every Member hopes Ireland will be in a position to return to the markets at a good interest rate as early as possible.  When the current EU-IMF programme runs out, if the ESM is cheaper than going back to the markets, that is what we should do.  Every euro we spend on interest is a euro less we can spend on education, health care and social protection.  Access to the ESM is important in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">A "Yes" vote has also sent a positive message to investors.  During the campaign, politicians from across the parties were joined by the business community, civic society and a wide range of groups.  IBEC conducted a survey of 700 CEOs and 87% of them said a "No" vote would limit Ireland's ability to do business in Europe.  In deciding to vote "Yes", the people took cognisance of that fact.  The people representing companies employing seven out of ten private sector workers, such as chambers of commerce and small businesses, were also calling for a "Yes" vote.  That is one of the reasons people got behind the referendum and decided to vote "Yes".</p>
          <p eId="para_411">There was much debate about the rules being put in place over the coming years.  Most of the rules that are part of the treaty are already in law and the treaty just improves enforcement but they are quite sensible.  With or without the treaty, Ireland must go through a period of closing the gap between income and expenditure over the coming years.  We must impose many of these limits on ourselves anyway even if they do not come from Europe.  It is in our interest to see that other countries are doing the same.  Problems in one European country affect all of us, particularly the eurozone countries.  It is in our interest to know that other countries will have balanced budgets, particularly when the Irish people are taking such hard steps and going through such pain to get the economy back on track.  We want to know the same is being done in Greece and other countries because it is in our interest.  The rules in the treaty are sensible in that respect.  There was much scaremongering and misrepresentation on the "No" side, which is unfortunate.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">I thank Senator Mullins for his comments about Fianna Fáil's contribution to the campaign.  Our party took a principled stance on the referendum.  We had a parliamentary party meeting, we thought it through and weighed up the "Yes" and "No" arguments before deciding it was the best thing for the country.  Our leader was very strong on this and he put aside party political differences and the opportunity to make capital, something on which other parties focussed strongly.  I refer specifically to Sinn Féin, whose campaign was deeply cynical and contained much misrepresentation.  On doorsteps, people were being told to vote "No" to water charges and household charges and were told it was a treaty on austerity, as if there would be none without the referendum.  That was very unfair because it makes it difficult for people to make up their minds if they are not being given the truth and are subject to misrepresentation.  Sinn Féin was criticised by many quarters for running a deeply cynical campaign but, thankfully, most of the people saw through it and decided to vote "Yes".</p>
          <p eId="para_413">That does not lessen the issues about which people are worried, such as the impact on families of extra charges.  I refer particularly to those on the lowest incomes.  That was reflected in the results, along with the worrying turnout.  That one in two people did not vote on an issue so important is worrying.  The socioeconomic divide was alarming and something of which we must take cognisance.  It reflects the fact that certain communities and poorest people were the hardest hit, particularly in the last budget.  This happened through DEIS schools and cuts to lone parents allowance.  Members of Fianna Fáil and those on the "Yes" side tried to tell people that this was not a referendum on those issues and that we appreciated they were angry and upset.  We asked them to put that to one side and vote on it another day.  The result reflected the anger and people took the opportunity to vote "No" to send the message to Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">Through the campaign, we emphasised that this is one aspect of the solution, not the full picture.  It is only the start of all the steps that must be taken.  In order to supplement the ESM and ensure we have a comprehensive solution to the issues facing Ireland and the EU, we must expand the mandate of the ESM so it can inject funds directly into failing banks.  This allows collective support for regional bank crises.  It must urgently be addressed if we are to operate as a currency union.  The other advantage is that recapitalisation aid would not add to countries' debt levels and would help Governments' chances of raising funds on the private finance markets to fund normal day-to-day operations.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">Expansion of the ESM should go hand-in-hand with pan-European regulation.  Europe can then collectively take responsibility for banking failures.  The Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, endorsed common banking supervision in his recent statements.  It is important to have a Europe-wide deposit protection scheme.  Currently, Greek and Spanish savers are moving their money out of local banks for fear the countries will leave the euro and their savings will be redenominated in new drachma or new pesos.  Irish savers are lucky that they have the savings guarantee scheme.  A common, appropriately funded deposit insurance scheme would eliminate this risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">In order to have public confidence in where we are going, particularly given the impact on families, there is an urgent need for a mechanism by which senior bondholders in bust banks take some pain for the cost of rescuing them.  I agree with most of what Senator Mullins said but I disagree with this point about the approach of the Taoiseach.  It is not that other people are exaggerating what is going on in Europe by putting undue pressure on the Taoiseach to reveal his negotiations.  The Taoiseach made a big deal of his conversation with Angela Merkel and when he was asked what she said in reply he would not answer.  That causes a confidence problem and the Government needs to be careful.  Talking up what is going on and making a big deal about presenting a technical paper, which the Taoiseach then admitted he had not seen and did not know if it is being done, damages public confidence.  The Government should be careful about that.  During the referendum, it came up as an issue that the Taoiseach was not prepared to debate on Vincent Browne's programme.  I know what his issue is but I do not mind doing the programme.  I was there last night.</p>

          <from>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</from>
          <p eId="para_419">I welcome this debate — it is good to reflect after the vote.  Often, we have many debates leading up to the treaty but we do not take stock afterwards.  Like the two previous speakers, I am delighted to be able to say today that we got the result Ireland needed in this referendum.  The stability treaty received a resounding "Yes" vote.  Many people are asking what comes next.  As we said throughout the campaign, the stability treaty is not the solution to all our ills or all the economic problems of the EU, but it is a significant piece of that solution.  Stability cannot be under-estimated.  A group of people told me that Chinese investors are showing a major interest in Europe but are nervous of the eurozone.  The sale of renewable assets worth €100 million was proposed recently in Italy.  Analysts and financiers were recommending it.  The due diligence was done.  The Chinese board that wanted to buy the assets ultimately decided to hold off on the purchase.  They decided now is not the time because Europe is not in a safe place.  This is why stability is important and why it was irresponsible of the "No" campaign to try to reject it.  We cannot begin to grow until we have economic and political stability.  That is a critical piece in the jigsaw.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">Now that we have accepted the treaty, we will continue to take further steps to resolve the crisis in co-operation with our EU partners.  Many possible solutions and proposals have already been tabled since the referendum.  At the last informal EU summit, the President of the European Council, Mr. Van Rompuy, was tasked with preparing a new growth plan.  That summit took place a few days before the referendum on the treaty.  The new President of France, Mr. Hollande, managed to get eurobonds on the table for discussion, which was a large step towards finding a solution.  I believe that in the near future, eurobonds will come into existence to deal with Europe's debt problems.  To be fair to the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach, they have been pursuing a growth narrative for some time.  It cannot all be about fiscal rectitude.  The election of Mr. Hollande was needed for that approach to become part of the dialogue.  Matters are heightened during election campaigns.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">Brussels has asserted that banks should pay for banks.  I was glad to hear that.  Under the proposal from the Commission, banks will be obliged to draw up recovery plans that will kick into place if their finances deteriorate.  It is proposed that national authorities will be able to appoint special managers to oversee weak institutions.  For many people who are suffering during this economic crisis, the most serious proposal is that senior bondholders should be made liable for the costs of bailing out a lender.  Many of us might think this is a late development, but it is definitely a positive one.  It is obvious that this has yet to go through the legislative process.  We have also heard about the possibility of a banking union.  We have to realise that Ireland is a member of a union.  We have a common currency, so why should we not have a common banking union?  This is not about our national sovereignty or our identity as a nation.  Ireland is an island nation on the west coast of Europe.  We have bought into the euro.  I do not suggest it is not flawed.  I think the way it was set up at the outset was flawed.  We are now trying to correct many of those problems.  That was one of the reasons for the introduction of the stability treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">There is a great deal of merit in examining the possibility of a banking union across Europe.  If a bank in Philadelphia goes down, it is not the people of the state of Pennsylvania who have to rescue the bank — it is the people of the United States.  If that type of process had been in place here, the Irish people would not have had to bail out Anglo Irish Bank.  It would have been done by the people of the EU as a whole.  One might argue that would have caused things to move on to another country and another bank.  I do not think that is necessarily the case.  If that type of cross-border responsibility existed, we would have far stricter banking regulation.  This country is in this mess because there was light regulation and no regulation.  We were too small.  It was such a cosy cartel.  There was an inner circle.  They were not doing their job.  We know that story.  There is a great deal of merit in having regulation that does not destabilise the entire economy of Europe, which is what we are seeing now with banks in Ireland and across Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">The President of the European Commission, Mr. Barroso, has proposed that there should be further and deeper political and economic union.  Regardless of whether we agree with the deepening of the union, at least we are still at the table as a consequence of our "Yes" vote.  That puts us in a position to influence the economic decisions made in the eurozone and allows us to choose to participate in these and other developments.  I would like to see a deal on bank debt.  I hope the Commission will make proposals to further that cause.  I would like such a deal to be retrospective so that Ireland's bank debt could be eased.  If the Commission proposes that banks should pay for banks — if banks are responsible for banks — our bargaining hand will be strengthened.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, knows the Irish people are not suckers.  I know it.  We all know it.  We also know that a deal on bank debt will have to be reached at some stage.  We will need to show patience as we wait for the right moment.  Perhaps we will not have our strongest negotiating hand as long as we are still in our current programme.  In the last few days, the president of the European Central Bank, Mr. Draghi, has said that Ireland is almost ready to return to the bond markets.  When that happens, we will be more independent again.  Perhaps that will also allow us to be stronger on the whole promissory note bank debt deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">I would like to speak about the High Court case that was taken by Deputy Pearse Doherty of Sinn Féin against the Referendum Commission and the question of whether it constituted an abuse of the judicial system for political gain.  The cost to the taxpayer of the case is approaching €200,000.  In my view, this is an abuse.  The case was brought against the commission late in the campaign.  It was close to the date of the referendum.  It seems obvious that the case was a political stunt.  If the High Court had found against the Referendum Commission, it would not have changed the fact that a "Yes" vote was still best for Ireland.  Obviously, it would not have had any bearing on what the treaty actually means for us.  There may not have been sufficient time between the High Court ruling and the date of the referendum to clarify the issue to the Irish people.  In essence, it would have caused massive confusion.  Little or no time would have remained to explain the issues involved.  Clearly, the case was taken in order to increase doubt and confusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">I recognise that it is difficult to speak about this issue without slipping back into the debates we had during the campaign.  Issues concerning the campaign itself must be addressed.  There was a negative aspect to this referendum, which was characterised by people being against the treaty as an expression of dissatisfaction with the Government.  This may have been represented more strongly in this referendum campaign than in others.  It is a very dangerous way to think about whether to approve an international treaty, especially one with such serious consequences for the economic future of our country.  Treaties like the stability treaty should be examined on their own merits.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">I accept that those on the "No" side had every right to campaign for the defeat of this referendum.  As they are not part of the Government, however, they would not have been responsible for dealing with the catastrophic uncertainty that would have stemmed from a "No" vote.  That fear would have continued for 18 months until we found out whether we could fund ourselves into the future.  They offered no real alternative way forward.  They advocated the rejection of a treaty that represents a real step forward for Ireland and offers us a safety net should we need it.  They wanted to reject it out of hand.  The Irish electorate needs to consider who would be responsible for the outcome of such a vote.  When one proposes that the people should vote in a certain way, one should be willing to take responsibility for ensuring the outcome of the vote is put in place.  The "Yes" side had all of the responsibility in this case.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanDBarrett" eId="spk_206">
          <from>Senator Sean D. Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_427">When I proposed the Fiscal Responsibility (Statement) Bill 2011 in December of last year, it received wide support in this House.  The problem with the recent referendum is that it was an attempt to make a fiscal response to a monetary problem.  As Senator Healy Eames and others have said, the design faults in the euro destroyed the banking system which we then bailed out.  The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General shows 676 people borrowed €67 billion and took out 35,000 mortgages.  Those are the numbers.  I am afraid we will end up in another crisis because of the design faults in the euro.  The single currency does not have an exit mechanism and does not cater for a scenario in which a large country such as Germany provides a tsunami of credit to a small country such as Ireland.  In addition, members lose the power to use the exchange rate and interest rate as instruments of economic policy and banking regulation is lacking.  The Government needs to strengthen its economic service to avoid making the same mistake again.  Milton Friedman and other economists warned that we were joining a system that was bound to fail.  We threw away the key when we did not provide for an exit mechanism.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">Now that we have the results of the referendum, we must move on and become much more insistent and outspoken at eurozone meetings.  If we have evidence from some of the best economists in the world that the euro is fatally flawed, let us not allow a series of countries to go bankrupt simply because people in Brussels do not want to admit their mistakes.  Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland have already suffered and Italy and Cyprus are next in line.  It would be ill advised of any eastern European country to join the euro at this stage.  The United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark were very wise to remain outside the currency.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">I am dismayed to hear reports that delegates or Ministers met for a working dinner.  There have been 18 summits.  If one's bus does not arrive in the morning, one cannot use the excuse that the bus driver was having a working breakfast.  We need to increase the level of economic expertise in the Government and in Brussels and Frankfurt.  The 40% of the population who voted against the fiscal treaty in the referendum did so because the failures of the past have had terrible consequences for the unemployed and those on low incomes.  Even the International Monetary Fund is concerned that the burden is not being spread fairly between, as it were, the haves and have-nots.  Massive economic mistakes have caused such misery through unemployment, emigration and so forth that we must be certain that legislation coming before the House is properly costed and debated.  The Seanad, with its 42 new Members, will ensure this is done but we must also ensure we do not sleepwalk into any other agreements that become impossible to adhere to.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">We need to strengthen the economic advice available to the Government economic and improve our performance when we attend international meetings.  We have experienced the biggest economic disaster ever to hit the State.  Those who founded the State in 1922 and those who succeeded them until 1972 were parsimonious in their running of the public finances.  While we made mistakes in the period from 1972 until 1987, we also learned lessons and reduced the national debt as a percentage of GDP to approximately 25%.  We had too much faith in a badly designed single currency.  As the former Commission President, Jacques Delors, has pointed out, the euro was not the currency he wanted.  I fear other countries will get into trouble or Ireland will need a second bailout unless someone from Ireland brings the message to Brussels that we must address the design faults in the euro, which have had appalling consequences for wider society.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#IvanaBacik" eId="spk_207">
          <from>Senator Ivana Bacik</from>
          <p eId="para_431">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this timely debate, coming as it does two weeks to the day since the referendum on the stability treaty was passed on 31 May.  This is an appropriate time for reflection on the consequences of the referendum and for a prognosis on what to do next.  Listening to Senator Barrett, I am conscious that even in this two week period, dramatic developments have taken place across the eurozone, specifically the recent events in Spain, and we also have the prospect of similar outcomes for Italy and Cyprus.  These developments remind us of the importance of trying to shore up the eurozone and ensuring we have a common set of financial or fiscal targets.  Of greater importance is the need to ensure we are bound into an agreement that allows us, if necessary, to access the European Stability Mechanism on communally agreed terms.  That is one of the major strengths of the stability treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">Like many Senators, I did a good deal of door to door canvassing in the weeks preceding the referendum on the treaty, during which I got a sense of the frustration and anger many people are feeling.  I certainly encountered it in Dublin South-East where I was canvassing.  What ultimately won through was an almost frustrated acceptance that the treaty was the best option available.  Nobody, including those who were canvassing for the treaty, suggested it would be some sort of panacea or would provide the solution to our economic troubles or the recession.  The argument we made, the one that won through most powerfully, was that the treaty was an important step and a piece in the jigsaw as we seek to ensure the stability of the eurozone and thus the stability and prospect of recovery for the Irish economy.  As others noted, the result was a very decisive "Yes" vote of 60% against a "No" vote of 40%.  Many of us believed in the final days of the campaign that the outcome would be much closer and it was a relief to those of us on the "Yes" side that the referendum was passed by such a decisive majority.  What the campaign taught all of us, on both sides, was that people require some sense of a positive outlook.  The concern and frustration arising from the effects of austerity can be offset if people believe the prospects for recovery are good, there is a way forward and they can see a glimmer of hope.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">The European Commission's forecasts for the economy are positive and Ireland is on target to meet the 8.6% deficit target for 2012 and reduce the deficit to below 3% by 2015.  The forecasts show a pathway out of our current difficulties towards economic recovery and the prospects for reaching our targets are good.  As I stated, however, gloomy forecasts from elsewhere in the eurozone present a problem for us given our strong reliance on exports.  The export sector is driving growth and recovery.  Our difficulty lies in trying to restore domestic confidence.  We see the loss of confidence in job losses in the retail sector and other parts of the domestic economy.  To get people spending again we must create confidence among Irish consumers.  I share President Michael D. Higgins's dislike of the term "consumer" and I much prefer the far more inclusive term "citizens".  I use the former deliberately because the difficulty we are experiencing is a lack of spending in the economy.  This is presenting a serious problem for the retail sector and other businesses that are experiencing the knock-on effects.  In light of the necessity to build domestic confidence, comments such as the suggestion made by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, that there may be compulsory redundancies in the public sector are unhelpful.  Such statements can undermine confidence among public servants who have already experienced significant cuts to their wages and are fearful of further cuts in future.  It is important that we maintain confidence among those who are still capable of spending in the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, has stated on a number of occasions that the social welfare budget should be seen as a massive stimulus in the economy.  The payments people receive stimulate local economies because such a large part of them are spent in the local community.  We need to build on this idea of social expenditure as a stimulus.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">To be a little more positive about the European context, the victory of François Hollande and his socialist party in recent elections in France has brought about an increased emphasis on the need to introduce stimulus and growth policies alongside the fiscal targets that have been set in the stability treaty.  Ireland strongly supports President Hollande's plans to generate a stronger growth package in the European Union.  We need to push forward on this matter because it is a tangible means of enhancing confidence in our prospects for recovery.   We are in good shape for going back to the markets at the end of 2013, provided we can restore domestic confidence and can keep on the steady path to recovery.  The passing of the referendum on the stability treaty has been an important step on that journey for us.  We need to keep on a steady path and to ensure that the actions we take as legislators and the policies we adopt are designed to ensure the restoration and maintenance of confidence so that we remain on the path to recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">These are the comments that occur to me in reflecting two weeks after the passing of the referendum by such a decisive majority.  Nobody suggests the referendum is a solution or that it marks the end of anything.  Rather, it is the beginning of the next stage of the journey towards the economic recovery on which we have now embarked.  I know that everyone in the House is hopeful of seeing that happen.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ThomasByrne" eId="spk_208">
          <from>Senator Thomas Byrne</from>
          <p eId="para_437">I am glad this debate is taking place today.  We could be tempted to look back at the success of the referendum campaign and expect that any future referenda on developments in Europe will be passed as easily, but that is not the case.  On this occasion people held their breath and voted "Yes" because they felt they had to.  There is much happening in the European Union currently.  We have seen a proposal for eurobonds and the German version of that proposal.  There have also been proposals for further fiscal and banking integration.  Some of these proposals may well require a referendum here, but we will not know for sure until a treaty is put together incorporating the proposals.  As normal, the Attorney General will then advise as to whether a referendum is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">It will be necessary for a different approach to be taken with regard to a future referendum and the Taoiseach must be more engaged in the process.  We cannot take anything for granted and the people want to hear the leader of their country engage on the issues.  There should also be equality of media time for the opposing factions.  It is only fair that both sides have equal coverage.  However, it is unfair for referenda campaigns to be used as an opportunity by some parties, particularly smaller political parties, to jockey for position and advantage and for them to get inordinate media time to do that.  This issue must be addressed.  While it is fair that the "Yes" and "No" sides get equal coverage for a referendum, there is a case to be made that where parties get disproportionate coverage during a referendum campaign, that coverage will be examined in the overall context of coverage over the calendar year so that coverage can be balanced between parties.  It is galling to see unelected MEPs getting huge coverage on television that will enhance their profiles.  During the recent campaign, unelected members of Sinn Féin also got huge profile coverage on television that may be helpful in future election campaigns.  It is unfair for them to get such advantages during referendum campaigns and if it happens, this should be balanced out throughout the year by the radio and television companies when they come to analyse their coverage and whether it is fair and balanced in accordance with the legislation.  This issue is urgent and what I suggest might be a way of dealing with it, without diverting from the issue of fairness in a referendum campaign.  It is not right for the Government to use all of its resources either to promote one side or other in a campaign.  These issues must be considered and addressed urgently.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">I wish to pay tribute to the Referendum Commission, which has done a good job since the second Lisbon treaty referendum.  Its work has been helped by the excellence of the judges appointed to it and of its members, including the Clerks of the Dáil and Seanad.  The commission has educated the public and has sometimes contradicted what the political establishment has said.  It is healthy that people get such information in a democracy.  However, it is not healthy that certain parties deliberately muddy the waters and contradict what is being said by the Referendum Commission.  All sorts of allegations were made that the Referendum Commission was wrong and that it was issuing wrong information.  A case was taken to court at the last moment, but it was not accepted because the argument was not made.  However, sufficient confusion was sown as to cast doubt in the minds of certain voters.  I have no doubt but that the court case had an effect.  It might not have had the effect desired by Sinn Féin, but it did reduce turnout.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">There are lessons to be learned.  We need a major public information campaign in advance of any future referenda.  We also need more engagement with opposition parties than was the case in the most recent referendum.  When Minister, Deputy Micheál Martin engaged proactively with opposition parties in previous referenda.  Not only do the Government parties need to engage with other parties, they also need to engage with the public so as to bring people with them.  At the time of the debate on the Lisbon treaty, we had the Constitutional Convention on the Future of Europe, which included representatives from all countries and civil society which met and came up with proposals that eventually led to the acceptance of the treaty.  That helped bring people along.  While the Forum on Europe became unwieldy to some extent and holding its meetings in Dublin Castle was probably not the best way to engage with the public, it was a place where the representatives of the public and civil society could come together and debate Ireland's future in Europe.  We need something like that urgently, because if we are to solve the euro crisis, major changes lie ahead of us.</p>

        <speech by="#KathrynReilly" eId="spk_209">
          <from>Senator Kathryn Reilly</from>
          <p eId="para_441">I welcome this debate.  It is good to be able to reflect on what was a long campaign and for us to be able to go back and talk to people we canvassed and worked with during it and bring their views here.  Referendum day was the people's day and they spoke out clearly in favour of the treaty.  I was proud to play a role in Sinn Féin's campaign against the treaty.  We mapped out an alternative and we went from door to door to try and convince people we were right, but the fear of the people won out in the end.  Although the turnout was low, I commend all those people who used their democratic right and voted on the day.  It is important people exercise their right to vote, particularly considering that only a small number of people across the European Union got to vote on the treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">The campaign was an unsavoury one in some ways.  For example, the Labour Party was campaigning, from the top down in particular, for rules that some of its own MEPs vehemently rejected not so long ago.  Also unsavoury was the sight of Fianna Fáil preaching about putting the country first and advising us the treaty was in our economic interest.  However, they had the right to do that, just as Sinn Féin had the right to put forward an alternative.  I disagree with Senator Byrne with regard to restricting media coverage or trying to moderate it or balance it out over the course of a year with regard to parties that get disproportionate coverage in referendum campaigns in the context of the side they are on, whether "Yes" or "No".  We do not want to introduce a section 31 that will muffle who appears on television or who can be seen, just because they belong to a smaller party or because those put forward to speak are not elected representatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">We will continue to put forward our alternative.  We will not stop arguing against austerity because we believe it has failed and will continue to fail and this was the basis of our argument throughout the referendum debate.  We will not stop arguing for the promotion and protection of Irish sovereignty.  Some 40% of the people agreed with our analysis that this is a bad treaty and they rejected it.  It is important to note that the number of those who rejected the treaty was higher among those classes of society who the Government has decided should shoulder the burden of the mistakes of others.  For example, working class areas voted "No" in general.  The people of Dublin North-West wisely rejected the advice of the two Labour Deputies in that area.  The people of County Donegal in which there is a huge rate of youth unemployment and emigration also decided that this would not be in their interests either.  They will be proved right in the future.  I also note the anecdotal evidence that young people voted "No", something that does not surprise me, given that this generation is increasingly rejecting the notion that it should suffer for the mistakes of its elders.  All in all, these results point towards the establishment moving further away from the interests of young people and working people and only reluctantly dragging enough of the remainder to scrape by this test.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">The purpose of this debate is to discuss the way forward.  The "Yes" side has a lot of promises to keep and we will not let it off the hook that easily.  When we talk about cynicism and misrepresentation during the referendum campaign, we need to look at some of the promises made by the "Yes" side.  We were promised jobs during the Lisbon treaty debate and we all know how things turned out.  Only one week after the latest referendum result Pfizer in Cork announced that it was laying off almost 200 workers.  Had we not already been told by international CEOs, including the managing director of Pfizer, that multinational corporations were awaiting our decision before deciding whether to invest in Ireland?  We gave them a "Yes" decision, but we are still losing jobs in these big companies.  Since the referendum, there has been a round of redundancies in my county, with the closure of Flair International in Bailieborough.  I accept that it will be some time before the true effects of the treaty will be seen, but the early signs for job creation are not promising.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">What about the stability we were promised?  Some €100 billion has been pumped into Spanish banks and their bond rates have spiked.  The eurozone has never been more unstable.  Stability comes from investment and employment in a working society, not from bailout treaties that shift power and money from working people to a protected class of capitalists.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">What about the slogan "Yes for investment"?  The rhetoric from the European Union and the Government has been grand and flowery, but what concrete measures have been promised?  We have seen the announcement of microscopic project bonds and heard some talk about an extra €10 billion lending facility for the EIB, but this €10 billion stimulus package for a European Union of 500 million people should be compared with the €100 billion given for a handful of Spanish banks.  I do not think this adds up.   The reality is that we are sitting on a potential €5 billion investment fund from the National Pension Reserve Fund.  If that was coupled with the billions of euro being paid out to Anglo Irish Bank, we would have the basis for an indigenous stimulus package that could be used to fund the creation of a world class broadband system, the eco-fitting of homes or help businesses the length of the State to create short, medium and long-term employment for young people.  However, like the other promises made to get us out to vote on referendum day, the "Yes for investment" slogan is just as shallow as "Yes for Stability".</p>
          <p eId="para_447">We were told that a "Yes" vote would strengthen the Government's hand in negotiating a better deal on our bank debt.  It was not long, however, before we got our answer on that one.  By signing up to this austerity rule book, we have weakened our hand and tied the hands of future, better Governments, although there will always be different opinions on that one.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">The people have spoken on the treaty and that is their democratic right.  Irish citizens who reside on this part of the island and who have not emigrated because of the failed economic policies to date are the only ones in Europe who were given the chance to use their democratic right to vote on the treaty.  We have to wonder where is the democratic scrutiny of such matters.  Those of us who opposed the treaty as a further giveaway of our economic sovereignty will continue to organise and resist the current failed policies and provide an alternative.  The alternative is a responsive and democratic European Union which respects the rights of states to control their own economic policies.  It is a Union that does not just do press releases on issues of major importance such as youth unemployment but actually starts to tackle them seriously and provide for real solidarity, not threats to member states in difficulty.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulBradford" eId="spk_210">
          <from>Senator Paul Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_449">I am glad to have the opportunity to reflect on the outcome of the vote that took place a fortnight ago.  This is a useful debate and we need to revisit the issue in a more substantial fashion.  There was a major parliamentary and civic society debate following the first Nice treaty referendum.  Now that people have voted "Yes", perhaps we do not see the need for such a debate, but it is important that we look at the circumstances surrounding the referendum and figure out the lessons we can learn.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">The first point we must acknowledge is that a fortnight ago about 30% of the people voted "Yes" in favour of the fiscal compact treaty, about 20% voted "No" and almost 50% said they did not know or care enough to vote.  The fact is that 30% decided to chart our course in a certain direction.  While I am happy with the direction chosen, I would be much happier if the turnout and the mandate were greater.  I have said previously from both sides of the House that in any vote — in a referendum, local, general or European elections — we must ensure everybody is facilitated to the maximum extent possible to cast his or her vote and exercise his or her franchise.  We have to live up to the commitments we have all made individually and collectively to allow weekend voting, either on a Friday or a Saturday, which would facilitate a larger number of people, especially young people, to vote.  When we ask the people to exercise their right to vote, we deem this to be a significant step.  We should, therefore, facilitate them by allowing the vote to take place over a day and a half — for half a day on Friday and all day Saturday.  I look forward to the day when we can have a referendum turnout of 75%.  If the trends continue and less than 50% of the people vote in a referendum, we will have to consider compulsory voting, as happens across much of the globe.  Compulsory voting is not necessary or desirable, but we certainly have to try to increase the turnout by facilitating people through weekend voting.  Having said this, the votes have been cast and we must move on.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">Senator Byrne mentioned the campaign and the constitutional requirement for balanced coverage.  I agree with the Senator in one sense, but subjects could come down the line to be decided by way of referendum, whether it be the children's Bill or other legislation.  In the late 1970s and early 1980s there were referendums on such issues as changing the adoption laws in which there was probably a 95% "Yes" vote.  We have to provide for balance and regardless of how substantial the political argument is on one side of the equation, the level of coverage is supposed to be 50-50.  We will have to look at a methodology to ensure that balance and fairness but not necessarily in the ways we have seen in recent referendums.  There is much merit in the Senator's suggestion that the people who take the liberty to support one side of the argument in order to increase their personal or party profile should be moderated in terms of political coverage over a 12 month period.  That is a very interesting suggestion which needs to be taken on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">The next fortnight will be a defining period for the peoples of Europe.  The people of Greece will vote on Sunday.  It is difficult to know how things will turn out because, happily, opinion polls are banned in Greece in the two week period before an election.  Apart from the Greek elections, the difficulties in Spain and throughout the eurozone and the European Union, there are major challenges facing the European political establishment.  We really are all in this together.  There is so much debate about the euro as a currency — we just look at the economics of it — but we are probably not focusing enough on the politics of Europe, as we did in the 1970s and the 1980s.  If we think back to those years and even to the European political institutions of the 1960s, there was a different approach because there was a bigger political picture on display.  In the late 1960s and early 1970s the picture being worked upon was the building of the European Economic Community.  In the late 1970s and early 1980s Europe was trying to survive and develop in the middle of the Cold War between the East and the West.  Then we had the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of communism, followed by the rebuilding of Germany and the continent of Europe.  That was a massive political prize and it brought out the best in the outstanding European leaders of the time, including Helmut Kohl, Jacques Delors and François Mitterand.  People of different persuasions worked to create a bigger political prize.  We are lacking that political leadership in Europe now.  It is more about management of the current crisis, which is obviously necessary, but we do not seem to see that there is a bigger picture or even want to create one.  If we travel back 30 or 40 years, we can see what that picture was: getting the countries of Europe to work together, building the original EEC and then the bigger European Union, moving on to the Maastricht treaty, uniting the continent of Europe and developing a currency.  People were working towards that political space simultaneously with economic development.  Now we do not seem to see a bigger political picture, but we need to work towards one.  Every European citizen needs to be part of one political project.  We have brought the peoples of Europe more or less together with one European currency, but we have not brought them together politically, which is necessary.  Perhaps there was a view that having a single currency would somehow unite the countries of Europe and result in a certain level of balanced economic development all over the continent.  That has not worked and I do not think it can work without political leadership and direction.  Some will say the only answer to my question is finding some type of federal solution such as a united states of Europe.  That is a step that can only be considered down the line.  However, there must be increased closeness among the European family of nations.  That is what we must reflect on.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">Europe's proudest achievements will stand and we must continue to acclaim the bringing together of a continent that had been at war — a continent in which countries spilled each other's blood and millions of citizens died.  We brought an end to war and brought people together.  The next phase must be ongoing political integration to a higher but acceptable level.  Considering from where we have travelled over 30 or 40 years, it is obvious that this must be the project for the next 15 or 20 years.  However, it must be driven by sound, dynamic, visionary political leadership which is lacking throughout the European Union.  This is urgently required, starting in the next number of years because massive challenges lie ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">I welcome the result of the referendum, although I am disappointed about the turnout.  I do not think the political establishment sought to engage people sufficiently.  The choice of date for the referendum was not helpful either.  There are lessons to be learned in this regard.  If we want to bring people together on a difficult and rocky political journey, we must engage with them and persuade them to join us.  I commend all those involved in the campaign on all sides.  They worked hard.  It is disappointing, however, that barely half of those eligible decided to vote.</p>

        <speech by="#CaitKeane" eId="spk_211">
          <from>Senator Cáit Keane</from>
          <p eId="para_455">Much has been said about the overall referendum campaign.  It is good that there was a "Yes" vote, but it was bad that many people who should have come out to vote did not do so.  However, that is their right.  The Government was complimented on its information campaign.  In the last three referendums the Government was criticised for the lack of information provided for citizens.  There are people who will not read what they receive and will still say they are not informed or ill-informed.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">I want to concentrate on the issue of misinformation.  The Government's hands are tied because of previous judgments.  Let us consider a hypothetical scenario.  Let us say in another referendum down the line all parties, including Sinn Féin, the Labour Party, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, are for the proposal, but there are two Independents — Deputy Luke ‘Ming'Flanagan, Deputy Mick Wallace or whoever else — who decide to advocate a "No" vote.  I would like to talk about the McKenna and Coughlan judgments in this regard.  It is time they were revisited.  I am not criticising any judge in this regard, but a 28 page judgment is too short for such a serious issue.  I would write 28 pages, as would the children in the Visitors Gallery for an essay.  These judgments have serious implications for every citizen of the State.  Did the Supreme Court do a persuasive job when it ordered RTE to hold the scales equally between the different views?  It should have put more thought into it and I would say the answer is "No".  It did not do a good job in that regard and I would like to see a better job being done on these two judgments.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">The McKenna judgment barred the Government from using taxpayers' money when making its case in a referendum.  The four judges who bound the Government in that way thought this could be done in 28 pages, yet we have the likes of Ganley's Libertas "party"— it is actually a group of individuals — which can use any amount of money it likes.  There is no judgment to prevent the likes of these individuals from going to every single country in Europe, raising whatever amount of money they can and spending it.  They must report it under the ethics in public office provisions, but I would like to see this issue being examined.  It is a serious problem that people such as Declan Ganley can do this.  There are other moneys coming from America or republicans, socialists or whoever that can be made available through other parties.  Everything spent in an election is accountable, reportable and so on.  However, the hands of the Government are tied, as are those of Opposition parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">I do not blame people for saying they find themselves misinformed.  RTE is bound to give 50% coverage to the "Yes" side and 50% to the "No" side, regardless of how valid the arguments are.  Who would be left to pick up the pieces in the ESM scenario if we could not draw down moneys?  I heard Senator Fidelma Healy Eames ask this question earlier.  I hope we will never need it, but we might.  This responsibility must be taken into consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">The Hamilton judgment boiled down to the assertion that "the action of the Government in expending public funds on the promotion of a campaign was not an action in pursuance of the executive power of the State".  The  campaign referred to was the 1995 divorce referendum campaign, yet the judgment did not go on to define the executive powers of the State.  Judges need to be asked to define them.  What is an executive power of the State?  In the 28 pages this issue was not dealt with.  It is a major flaw in the rule on 50-50 representation.  Judges need to define exactly what they mean.  Is it because of EU regulations?  Of course, EU regulations are linked with the executive power of the State, but why are we bound by environmental EU legislation and many other EU provisions?  That is a question I would like to have answered.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">One of the five judges who heard the McKenna case — I will not mention names — thought the whole thing was preposterous.  He took less than four paragraphs to state that neither the Constitution nor the nitty-gritty of the Referendum Act stated anything that could be read as blocking the Dáil from giving the Government cash to make its case.  It was one of the judges who made that statement and he wrote only about half a page, although I might be doing him a disservice.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">I read an article on this subject by John-Paul McCarthy and I am grateful to him for bringing it to my attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">As I listened to the referendum debates I wondered if almost every elected representative supported the "Yes" argument and one Member stood up in the Dáil and said, "I have a right to say no," whether that point of view should receive 50% of broadcasting time?  We must consider the Coughlan judgment, as well as the McKenna judgment.  None of the four judges who worked the equality lever in the divorce referendum really explained why RTE should be punished.  I would like to see this matter reopened and rejudged and a definition of executive power given.  Members of local authorities, of whom I was one, and Senators have their powers laid down.  In local authorities there are executive and reserved functions.  Similarly, the Dáil is separate from the Executive.  I would like to see a judgment on this.  As members of a Government party, Fine Gael members saw who would be left to carry the can in a financial fiasco.  Those who advocated a "No" vote also advised people not to pay the property tax.  They will pay the tax because they do not want to be brought to court or sent to jail, but it is all right to advocate that their constituents should refuse to pay and risk being sent to jail.  That is irresponsible.  If they are not prepared to bring forward an alternative proposal to ensure funds for ATM machines, social welfare payments and everything else, who will carry the can?  Who will be responsible at the end of the day?  To whom do we listen and who is telling the responsible story?  We cannot blame RTE or the media in this case, as they were bound by a judgment.  It is up to us, as politicians, to question it.  That is all I am saying.  I congratulate the "Yes" and the "No" sides on the work they did.  Everyone worked under the banner he or she was given.  It could happen that everyone would lose the plot and one person might be right.  For such an eventuality, we must define "executive power" and what is and is not legal.</p>

            <p eId="para_464">I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to take this Adjournment matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_465">In its five year plan for school building projects the Government, rightly, identified the need for a post-primary school in Lusk, County Dublin.  Lusk is a fast growing area in my constituency of Dublin North.  It has grown from a rural village to a sizeable town.  There are a number of primary schools in the area.  There is Rush and Lusk Educate Together national school, while the busiest school is Lusk national school.  Hedgestown national school is located just outside the town.  The need for a post-primary school is agreed and it remains to be decided who will be the patron.</p>
            <p eId="para_466">The Minister has received two applications of which I am aware.  One is from the vocational education committee, VEC, and the other from Educate Together.  When will the Department make a decision on the granting of patronage and what criteria will be used in making that decision?  The parents of more than 1,000 primary school children and more than 400 preschoolers in the immediate Lusk area, not including the outlying area of Rush, have given written consent to be added to the Lusk VEC campaign.  These parents have declared their preference for patronage to be granted to the VEC which has a proven track record of multicultural and co-educational learning.  Having been in the area and from meeting residents of Lusk, this appears to be the clear preference of the people of the town.  Educate Together has developed well in the area, which we also welcome.  We need choice in post-primary education provision, but we must also look at the express wishes of the community of Lusk.  Having attended meetings and conducted research on the issue, the clear preference of the vast majority of people in the Lusk catchment area is that the Department grant patronage to the VEC in this instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_467">I await the response of the Minister of State and thank him for coming to the House.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Ciarán Cannon)</from>
            <p eId="para_468">I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the current position on the provision of new post-primary schools and the new arrangements the Minister, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, put in place in regard to the recognition of new post-primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_469">The schoolgoing population has increased significantly in recent years and is expected to continue to increase in the coming years.  It is anticipated that, at post-primary level, an additional 24,900 pupils will need school places by 2017, with a further 40,800 needing places between 2017 and 2024, based on the Department's statistics.  The figures I have outlined indicate the situation at national level.  The challenge for the Department is to establish in which locations the schoolgoing cohort will increase most significantly in order that sufficient school accommodation can be provided to meet demand.  The Department is utilising a geographical information system, GIS, for this purpose.  The GIS utilises data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the General Register Office and the Department of Social Protection, in addition to the Department's own databases, and the local authorities.  The Department has carried out a study of the country to identify where there will be a requirement for significant additional school provision at both primary and post-primary level in the coming years.</p>
            <p eId="para_470">In June last year the Minister announced that up to 40 new schools were to be established within the next six years to meet our increased demographics.  These consisted of 20 new primary schools and 20 new post-primary schools.  Included in that announcement was a new post-primary school planned for Lusk, County Dublin, which is scheduled to commence in September 2013.  The provision of this new school will greatly enhance second level provision for the area and the new school will provide accommodation for a long-term projected enrolment of 1,000 pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_471">The Minister also announced new arrangements for the recognition and determination of patronage of these new primary and post-primary schools.  The new arrangements published by the Department provide for a balanced approach to allow applications to be made by prospective patrons for the establishment of schools. The criteria used in deciding patronage of the new schools place a particular emphasis on parental demand for plurality and diversity of patronage.  Applications for patronage of the new second level schools to be established in 2013 and 2014 were sought by the Department from prospective patrons.  Details of the applications received are available on the Department's website.  Applications for patronage of the proposed new school in Lusk were received from Educate Together and County Dublin VEC.  Departmental officials have assessed all of the applications received in line with the published criteria and a report has been prepared and submitted for the consideration of the new schools establishment group.  The group will, in turn, submit recommendations to the Minister for consideration and final decision regarding patronage of the new post-primary schools in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_472">I again thank the Senator for raising this matter.</p>

Will the decision be made before the summer break?</p>

            <p eId="para_474">It is my understanding it is hoped to issue a decision before the summer break.

            <p eId="para_475">I will be brief and to the point on this issue.  I seek information on the progress made to date on the provision of a new fire station in Virginia, County Cavan.  Approval in principle had been granted by the Department to Cavan County Council's proposal for the provision of a new fire station in Virginia, but that was a few years ago and it has not yet proceeded.  A site is available to accommodate the new station in Virginia.  A site is available also for a new fire station in Ballyjamesduff, the neighbouring town.  The last I heard on the issue was that contract documents for the Virginia fire station are with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government awaiting approval to go to tender.  All the plans, estimates and survey works were submitted.  All documents are in the Department but the delay is in respect of the granting of the project to go to tender.</p>
            <p eId="para_476">Is the Department dragging its heels on the issue?  What is the delay in moving this project forward?  When will tenders be invited?  When will construction work commence and when will this project advance or will it advance?  Does the Department have a timeframe or has it shelved the project and not informed anyone?  I would welcome any clarification the Minister of State can provide on the issue.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ciarán Cannon</from>
            <p eId="para_477">The provision of a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of fire station premises is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under section 10 of the Fire Services Act 1981.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government supports the fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_478">The Department's fire services capital programme has put in place infrastructure to support the local fire authorities in the development of a quality fire-fighting and rescue service.  This commitment to the fire service has brought major improvements in the fire service infrastructure nationally over the past decade.  This commitment to continuing investment in infrastructure and equipment, better training and the provision of improved communications infrastructure has brought major improvements.</p>
            <p eId="para_479">Cavan county fire service has ten fire stations and responded to over 700 call-outs during 2010.  New fire stations at Bailieborough, Belturbet, Cootehill and Dowra were completed in recent years at a cost of approximately €2.3 million which was wholly funded by the Department.  Upgrade works to Killeshandra and Kingscourt fire stations have also been carried out by Cavan County Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_480">Approval in principle was granted for the construction of a new fire station in Virginia under the 2000 fire services capital programme.  Approval to prepare contract documents was granted in 2008.  These contract documents were received in the Department in 2011 and are currently under consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_481">Much has been accomplished in the past decade to strengthen the infrastructure of fire services in Ireland.  The significant resources provided to local authorities under the Department's fire services capital programme have resulted in a quality fire and rescue infrastructure throughout the country.  Most of our fire stations have full facilities, the appliance fleet is in very good shape and specialist equipment is generally regarded as being of a very high standard.</p>
            <p eId="para_482">Continued investment in the fire appliance fleet has been identified as a key national priority for capital investment, given the current constraints on public finances.  To deliver cost efficiencies in line with the recommendations of the Local Authority Efficiency Review Group, a programme is currently under way which involves fire authorities aggregating demand and inviting tenders for 17 fire appliances following the development of an agreed national fire appliance specification.  Since 2007, the Department has grant-aided some €1.3 million to Cavan County Council in respect of new fire appliances and other necessary fire and rescue equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_483">Further investment to support the redevelopment of Virginia fire station will be considered under future capital programmes within the constraints of reduced public finances and will have regard to the priorities of Cavan County Council, the value for money offered by proposals, the level of investment to date and the totality of demands from fire authorities country-wide for the limited funding available.</p>

            <from>Senator Averil Power</from>
            <p eId="para_484">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, to the House.  I record my annoyance that this question is being answered by the Minister of State on behalf of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government rather than on behalf of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform because the impetus for the question arises from a specific commitment given by the Minister, Deputy Howlin, to this House.  However, when I tabled this Adjournment matter through the Seanad Office this week that Department refused to accept it and insisted on it being transferred to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I am annoyed about that because while it is an environmental issue, it arises from a commitment given by the Minister, Deputy Howlin, in his capacity as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  It refers to a project that will spend up to €2.7 billion of taxpayers' money and therefore if any issue deserves the attention and the oversight of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform I would have thought it was this one.</p>
            <p eId="para_485">I want to put on the record comments made by the Minister, Deputy Howlin, on 22 November 2011.  My colleague, Senator Darragh O'Brien, who has been proactive on the issue of the proposed wastewater treatment plant for north Dublin, asked the Minister, in the public expenditure context, about the proposed plant for north Dublin.  In his response the Minister stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_486">The issue of the greater Dublin drainage scheme has been raised on a number of occasions by colleagues of the Senator representing the constituencies directly affected.  I am giving an undertaking now to the Senator that I will have it investigated.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_487">[. . .] There is a propensity for engineers to have big schemes.  They much prefer to build reservoirs than fix leaks.  There is nothing sexy about fixing a hole but construction of a multi million euro dam and piping water for miles is a big event.  I prefer to fix the leaks.  I have given the Senator an undertaking that I will have the matter investigated.</p>
            <p eId="para_488">Members will agree that is a specific commitment to examine the issue given by the Minister, Deputy Howlin, last November.  More than six months later I raise this matter to ask if that investigation has taken place and regret that the Department refused to answer it.</p>
            <p eId="para_489">As the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, will be aware, the proposal is for a monster wastewater treatment plant in north Dublin.  Three preferred sites have been selected — one in Cloghran, Clonshaugh, another in Newtowncorduff and one in Annesbrook, east of Ballyboughal and west of Lusk.  The proposed plant, should it get the go-ahead from the Government, will produce 1,000 litres of sewage per second.  Initially, it will be the same size as the plant in Ringsend but it will double in capacity over a 20-year period to cater for a population equivalent to 700,000 by 2040.</p>
            <p eId="para_490">I objected to this plant as part of the consultation process, as did my colleagues and, I understand, colleagues of the Minister's party also, mainly for the reason that Clonshaugh in my constituency is an entirely inappropriate location for a plant of this scale but also because having one massive plant is misguided and does not make sense from a value for money point of view.  It would make more sense, and is best practice environmentally as well as economically, to have smaller, localised plants which could be phased in over time.</p>
            <p eId="para_491">From the point of view of Clonshaugh in Dublin north east, there is huge local opposition to this plant for a number of sensible and logical reasons.  The proposed site is immediately adjacent to over 2,500 homes in the Clonshaugh, Priorswood and Darndale area, all of which are within a one mile radius of the site.  It is also very close to other housing developments in Belmayne, Clongriffin and Clare Hall, and there is no doubt that building a massive wastewater treatment plant so close to housing will lead to an intolerable reduction in the residential amenity for those householders.  Also, it does not make sense in that there are area plans for the redevelopment of the north fringe area in the coming years and these will compromise and undermine future plans for the area.  It would also damage the economic potential of the locality which as I am sure the Minister is aware, with its close proximity to Dublin Airport, is an area of strategic importance not just to Fingal but to all of Dublin and should be planned in that context.  It would most likely render redundant the proposals to develop the neighbouring IDA site as a high tech hub and, in doing so, would prevent the creation of thousands of badly needed jobs in north Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_492">It is proposed that the outfall from the plant would flow into the sea at Portmarnock, Malahide and an area that is environmentally protected in Baldoyle and is of huge importance both in terms of the environment but also tourism in that it has great potential which could be tapped into and developed as a marine tourism area.</p>
            <p eId="para_493">Having one monstrous plant does not make any sense.  That is why my colleague, Senator Darragh O'Brien, asked previously that the proposal be examined in terms of public expenditure.  It is not too late for this to be checked out.  The Minister committed to investigating the matter such that the taxpayer could be sure of a satisfactory cost-benefit analysis.  It worries me that, six months later, this does not appear to have been done, despite the project having been valued at €2.7 billion.  I am quite concerned about this.</p>
            <p eId="para_494">I am most familiar with the Clonshaugh area, and Senator O'Brien has raised difficulties associated with the other proposed locations in north Dublin.  Clonshaugh is an entirely inappropriate location for the plant.  I ask the Minister of State, whom I know will give the stock reply from the Department, to ask the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to follow up on the commitment he gave to the House in November and ensure the matter is investigated in terms of public expenditure.</p>

            <p eId="para_495">I would not describe my reply as a stock reply.  There is a significant amount of information in it, much more than I was used to when I was a Member of this House.</p>
            <p eId="para_496">I thank the Senator for the opportunity to clarify the position about Fingal County Council's proposal to build a new wastewater treatment plant to facilitate development within Fingal and the greater Dublin area in general.</p>
            <p eId="para_497">When my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, was addressing a debate on infrastructure and capital investment in this House on 22 November 2011, Senator Darragh O'Brien raised the issue of the new wastewater treatment plant being constructed in north County Dublin as part of the greater Dublin strategic drainage project and cited a price of €2.3 billion to €2.7 billion for the plant.  He urged the Minister to re-evaluate the project as it "did not stack up in terms of value for money".  On that basis, the Minister agreed to investigate the matter and his Department subsequently raised it with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_498">The price tag that has been attributed to the project in some quarters, and referred to by Senator O'Brien in his statement, is well wide of the mark.  In fact, the cost he cited refers to the cost of all the wastewater projects in the greater Dublin area identified by the greater Dublin strategic drainage study in 2005.  The expected capital costs of the north Dublin treatment plant, outfall and orbital sewer are not expected to exceed €500 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_499">I wish to apprise this House of developments on the project.  In March 2011, Fingal County Council appointed consultants to prepare a preliminary report and environmental impact assessment for the north Dublin treatment plant and orbital sewer.  The identification of potential locations for the regional wastewater treatment plant is an important step in this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_500">In October 2011, as part of phase 1, based on the alternative sites assessment and route selection report, Fingal County Council identified nine potential land parcels in the northern part of the greater Dublin area within which a proposed regional wastewater treatment plant could potentially be located, along with a marine outfall and an orbital drainage system.  The council carried out an eight-week non-statutory public consultation seeking views on the proposals and the land parcels.  These nine land parcels were then assessed as potential locations in which to site the regional wastewater treatment plant.  The routes for the orbital drainage system and the marine outfall pipe locations were also assessed.  Site-specific information, more in-depth desktop research, consultations and detailed site surveys, in addition to feedback from the public, were used to assist in identifying the locations with the least impact under 15 criteria.  Of these nine land parcels, three sites have now been identified by the council as emerging preferred site options in phase 2 according to the alternative sites assessment and route selection report.  A further eight-week, non-statutory public consultation period commenced on Monday, 14 May 2012, and it is to run until 6 July 2012.  As part of this process, four open days are being arranged by the council on which the public can meet the project team and discuss the report.</p>
            <p eId="para_501">When the preferred site is identified, the council will prepare detailed plans and complete an environmental impact statement.  This environmental impact statement, together with a planning application under the Planning and Development Strategic Infrastructure Act 2006, will be submitted to An Bord Pleanála.  An Bord Pleanála will carry out its own statutory public consultation on the project.  I urge the north Dublin communities to engage in the current non-statutory public consultation process and in the important statutory consultation processes that will be available as the project proceeds.</p>

            <from>Senator Averil Power</from>
            <p eId="para_502">I thank the Minister of State.  He said the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, stated the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, agreed to investigate the matter with the former Department, and that the latter Department subsequently raised the issue with the former.  It does not outline the nature of the response, evaluation or investigation or whether the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is actually satisfied.  The report just states the issue was raised.  I ask the Minister of State to seek clarification from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform that he is satisfied with the value-for-money review of the plant on foot of the investigation.  A significant amount of taxpayers' money is to be spent and the project deserves oversight by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>

            <p eId="para_503">Senator O'Brien's concerns were first raised in the context of a belief that the project would cost in the region of €2.3 billion to €2.7 billion.  We now know the cost is in the region of €500 million, which is significantly lower.  I agree with the Senator that we must scrutinise every cent of public money spent.  Having worked in local government for 14 years, I believe that sort of assessment would be part of the overall planning process for the provision of such significant infrastructure to serve north Dublin.  I will undertake to seek the information Senator Power requires.</p>
