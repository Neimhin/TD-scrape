            <p eId="para_1">1. <b>Deputy Sean Fleming</b> asked the <b>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</b> the new measures he is putting in place to ensure all departmental expenditure targets are consistently met; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  [49664/13]</p>

            <p eId="para_2">This question concerns this relatively new Department, the primary focus of which is on dealing with public expenditure and the new measures to ensure all line Departments consistently meet the targets set in the annual Estimates. I am thinking not just of this year but looking forward to next year.</p>

          <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" as="#Minister_for_Public_Expenditure_and_Reform" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform<recordedTime time="2013-11-21T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_3">The Government decides departmental allocations in the budget each year, with the full detail of these allocations being set out in the Estimates approved by the Dáil. All Ministers and their Departments are responsible for ensuring their expenditure is undertaken in line with the voted allocations. At the beginning of each year every Department sets out its expected profile of expenditure on a month by month basis and during the course of the year each Department reports monthly on its actual performance against this expenditure profile. My Department is in regular communication with Departments and offices to ensure expenditure is being controlled and we monitor the drawdown of funds from the Exchequer against the published expenditure profiles. Where necessary, my Department regularly meets line Departments to review financial management.</p>
            <p eId="para_4"> The comprehensive expenditure report 2012-14 introduced a new model of multi-annual budgeting for current expenditure, called a medium-term expenditure framework, MTEF. The MTEF was initiated on an administrative basis and now, following the passage of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2013, the arrangements for fixed spending ceilings for each ministerial Vote group for a rolling three year period have a statutory basis. The details of the operation of the ministerial expenditure ceilings are set out in an administrative circular issued by my Department. The circular details the rules and arrangements for planning and managing current expenditure within the fiscal structures in place at European level. It includes provisions to assist with management of departmental expenditure, including control measures to ensure compliance with ministerial expenditure ceilings.</p>
            <p eId="para_5"> The new control measures provide for monthly reporting to the Government where a Department is spending in excess of its profile and there is a substantive risk. If any such overspend is not corrected within two months, a formal review will be conducted of the relevant Department’s expenditure and this will be led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. If the relevant Department fails to implement recommendations of the formal review, as agreed by the Government, and breaches the expenditure ceiling, the Government may require the Department to repay the overrun in the following year.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeanFleming" eId="spk_3">
            <from>Deputy Sean Fleming<recordedTime time="2013-11-21T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_6">The Minister has outlined the system, but I am more interested in how he implements the systems he has adequately described. I see the value of monthly reports. If there is no correction within two months, there is a full review. Has any Department had to repay expenditure and does the Minister envisage it happening?</p>
            <p eId="para_7"> Earlier this year after the Estimates for 2013 were published, people knew that the Estimate for the Department of Justice and Equality was flawed and would not meet the expenditure figures required for the running of the Garda Síochána. The figures were wrong and the Garda Síochána expressed concern about them.</p>
            <p eId="para_8">The committee met yesterday to approve an extra €51 million and correct what was originally a misleading Estimate. We said the same about the Department of Health Estimate, and I understand there is to be a Supplementary Estimate for that Department in the coming days. This is not because of overspending but rather that the wrong Estimate was presented to the Houses to start with. That has been known from the start. What will the Minister do about people bringing forward flawed Estimates?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_4" as="#Minister_for_Public_Expenditure_and_Reform">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2013-11-21T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_9">The Deputy has asked a number of questions and I will deal with the specifics. I consider all Estimates and we must ensure that we live within budgetary allocations. I am very confident that at the end of this year, the overall expenditure profile will be comfortably met across all Departments. Could there be changes in existing arrangements for Departments? There will be a number of Supplementary Estimates, and for example I will introduce a Supplementary Estimate for the €50 million for road construction stimulus package. There will be some technical Estimates to move moneys within Votes. It is normal practice when speaking to a budget profile across all public administration in excess of €50 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_10"> The Deputy mentioned the two specific areas of justice and health, and I know the Minister for Justice and Equality was before the committee yesterday. Some 90% of his budget is pay and there must be flexibility to ensure gardaí can deal with manpower issues in the way to best meet the security needs of the State. That determination is made by the Garda Commissioner in consultation with the Minister for Justice and Equality, which I am happy to support.</p>

            <from>Deputy Sean Fleming<recordedTime time="2013-11-21T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_11">I have stated before that I encourage the Minister's Department to take more of a hands-on approach rather than continuously leaving it to a line manager. For example, I have argued that the procurement office should take over the purchase of drugs and medicines on behalf of the Department of Health. I deal with this in a parliamentary question today but the Minister's Department indicated it was a matter for the Department of Health. I am sure the officials did not consult the Minister when they off-loaded it to the Department of Health. My question asked about bringing that functionality to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in dealing with procurement on behalf of the State. The Department did not want to take it. I am concerned that even when the Minister is encouraged to take more of a hands-on approach, some officials are not willing to do so.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_6" as="#Minister_for_Public_Expenditure_and_Reform">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2013-11-21T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_12">It is clearly a matter for line Departments to run their own Estimates, as otherwise we would only have one Department of public expenditure for running everything, which would not be right either. I will finish the point relating to the Department of Justice and Equality. We have allocated an additional €5 million for the first instalment of the Magdalen payments, which was not accounted for but to which nobody would object. The Deputy mentioned the €51 million, which is a gross figure, and there are savings being made within the justice Vote to make up a bit of it too.</p>
            <p eId="para_13"> With regard to drugs procurement, the new office of procurement has a new director of procurement and it works very closely with all procurement agencies, including the HSE. It might be worthwhile for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform to invite Mr. Paul Quinn, the director of procurement, before it to go through that process in some detail. It is important to see the really remarkable things happening on the procurement side.</p>

            <p eId="para_14">2. <b>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</b> asked the <b>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</b> the challenges the current difficulties regarding the ESB pension scheme will have for the programme of State asset disposal his Department is overseeing; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [49663/13]</p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryLouMcDonald" eId="spk_7">
            <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2013-11-21T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_15">The Minister is aware that the issue of the deficit in the ESB pension fund has been a long-running controversy and concern, and it now stands at €1.6 billion. He is probably aware that in 2010, ESB management on a solo run changed the accountancy treatment of the pension fund from direct benefit to direct contribution, shifting all the liability to the workers. In an effort to keep the liability off the balance sheet, the company subsequently borrowed very heavily on the international markets, having presented the balance sheet in an erroneous fashion. Now ESB workers have balloted for industrial action and we face the prospect of the first ESB strike in decades. The Minister's officials and the Departments which have promised dialogue have not been in touch with ESB management and unions since last June. What is the implication of this for the disposal of the assets?</p>

            <p eId="para_16">In so far as this issue relates to my Department, it relates to the sale of State assets; the responsibility for the ESB does not fall within my Department and I am not going to respond on that matter. With regard to the dispute concerning the manner in which the ESB currently accounts for its pension liabilities, I do not envisage that the matter will have any impact on the disposal by the ESB of its assets. These assets have been identified for disposal and I am confident the programme of asset disposals will proceed as planned.</p>

            <p eId="para_17">In 2010, the ESB management without agreement of workers or unions changed the treatment of the pension fund for the purposes of cleaning up its balance sheet. The Government had to sign off those accounts so I do not accept the Minister's position of not commenting on the matter. He should do so and he must do so, and I hope he will take the opportunity today to speak on it.</p>
            <p eId="para_18"> Was the Minister or the Government aware of the change in the treatment of the pension fund? It was not minor but it was a very significant shift in how the pension fund and its deficit were accounted for. The Government signed off on that but was it aware of the implications when it did so? Does the Minister appreciate the implication for the workers in the ESB, who now find themselves in a position where the management wishes to shift the burden of all that deficit on to their shoulders? This relates directly to any proposed disposal of any part of this State asset. Does the Minister appreciate the gravity of a position where a semi-State company alters its balance sheet in this manner to affect its credit rating for borrowing on the international markets? These are serious matters in the public domain and I do not accept that the Minister cannot comment on them.</p>

            <p eId="para_19">The Deputy is making very serious charges about altering accounts and it would be proper for her to deal with the line Minister, who has all the information relating to the issue. She has spoken of the Government collectively signing off the accounts, I presume, as they are not a matter for me. The Government collectively receives the report of the ESB and every other State agency and these are dealt with by the line Minister. This is a matter for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, and he has all the details relating to it. The description of the pension schemes in the accounts is a matter that could be properly explored with the people having the best information, and I do not have it.</p>
            <p eId="para_20"> The ESB in general is one of the most robust institutions in the State and there is no question of a hole in its pensions unless everybody in it was to retire next Monday, crystallising the cost. I heard a statement the day before yesterday from the Minister for Social Protection, who is responsible for pensions policy generally, and she has indicated the company is working to a scheme that will have a robustness by 2018. These matters would properly be addressed to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_21">I do not accept that. The Minister is proposing to oversee the sale of part of this State asset. The due diligence involved in this, from the Minister's perspective, must mean he has been through this company like a dose of salts, establishing its exact position. It is a bit hard to believe he would miss the magnitude of the hole in the pension fund in the ESB. I also find it strange or remarkable that the Minister has not yet been apprised of the actions of ESB management in 2010; that was a very deliberate act to change the description and treatment of the pension fund from a defined benefit fund to a defined contribution fund. The implications for the workers are enormous, and the consequences for the company could be very significant. This company is borrowing on the international markets, based on a credit rating directly linked to its balance sheet.</p>
            <p eId="para_22"> The Minister is passing the buck to another Minister, Deputy Rabbitte. E-mails in the public domain have been commented on by the media a number of weeks ago. The line Minister to whom the Minister opposite has referred ran for cover at that stage and had nothing to say, it seems. It is unacceptable that the Minister, who has told us he will oversee the sale of part of this company, is singing dumb on the matter. He might be running for cover too.</p>

            <p eId="para_35">The question is about the planning under way to ensure we have the optimal public service. We are heading into a new national spatial strategy. It is not just a dry strategy based on where one would develop; public services must accompany the development. One of my concerns is that demographic change does not play as significant a role as it should in order for services to be matched with population change.</p>

            <p eId="para_36">I am afraid I am not responsible for the spatial strategy. That is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. I am responsible for the public service reform plan, to which I assume the question refers. </p>
            <p eId="para_37"> The reform plan was published in 2011 and set out an ambitious agenda for reform across all areas of the public service. Good progress has been made in implementing the plan across a range of cross-cutting areas, including, for example, shared services, public procurement, to which Deputy Seán Fleming referred, public expenditure reforms and political reform. A progress report on implementation of the plan was published in September 2012 and a second progress report will be published early in 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_38"> Alongside the overall reform plan, all Departments and major offices have developed their own integrated reform delivery plans which set out the key actions required to ensure the successful delivery of the cross-cutting reforms in the plan, as well as sector-specific reform initiatives and actions from the Haddington Road agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_39"> Two years on from the publication of the current plan, it is timely to consider how we can build on the next wave of reform. My Department is developing a renewed and ambitious reform plan for the next two years which will be published early in 2014. The reform programme adopts a whole-of-government approach to reforming public services across all sectors, including health, education, justice and local government, as well as the Civil Service. The reforms at sectoral level are led by the relevant Ministers and their Departments. Owing to the nature of public services, they are delivered from many locations around the country. The Government’s reform programme is about ensuring these services, whether centrally or locally delivered, are efficient and effective. In that context, it is the role of all sectors to continually review how services are organised to ensure they deliver optimum benefit to the people.</p>
            <p eId="para_40"> On a related point, we need to manage our property portfolio which is the responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, in a co-ordinated manner. To that end, the Government published a property asset management delivery plan last July which is being implemented by my colleague, the Minister of State.</p>

            <p eId="para_41">I am pleased to hear there is a whole-of-government approach, as that brings in the national spatial strategy in terms of forward planning. The distribution of public services around the country is most unequal, but I do not need to tell the Minister that because Wexford is a case in point. For example, in terms of local authority staff, County Meath has half the number of staff in County Kerry, yet it has 40,000 more people. Class sizes are considerably higher in commuter belt areas in parts of west Dublin. Garda resources are half the strength in some locations, with County Kildare being the worst. Public service reform must be viewed in terms of having a minimum quality of public services. What we do now is important, but it also requires future planning because one cannot shift people from one part of the country to another in certain categories. The reforms are not visible in terms of equality of distribution, but they must become so.</p>

            <p eId="para_42">I have heard the Deputy make the case before and she makes a compelling case. Services were developed in an <i>ad hoc</i> way in health service delivery, for example, depending on what the priorities were in a health board region. We now have a national integrated health service, but there are still disparities in staffing levels and available services. Reference was also made to the distribution of gardaí. That is a matter for the Garda Commissioner. The distribution of gardaí cannot just relate to population size as crime statistics must be taken into account. There must be a concentration of gardaí where issues arise, as happened in Limerick.</p>
            <p eId="para_43"> There are two keys to service provision. One is proper integration in order that we have a joined-up system under which we can move people about and services are delivered in the optimum way to citizens. The next wave of reforms we are planning is citizen-focused to make sure people can access services. There is a need to be transparent in order that there is a proper public understanding and a rationale to deal with the platform of public services available to every citizen no matter where they are located.</p>

            <p eId="para_44">The issue is critically important. The Minister did not answer the part of the question about how public service reform would dovetail with the national spatial strategy in the future. I fully understand it is part of the role of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. We have a difficult situation to deal with and a dispersed pattern of settlement. We do not have an equal starting point. It is important that such a relationship is developed in order that whatever mistakes have been made in the past will not be made in the future owing to a lack of forward planning. Adequate attention must be paid to demographic change.</p>

Consultations are ongoing between my Department and all other Departments in that regard in order that when the spatial strategy is produced, it will be an integrated document into which everybody will have an input.

            <p eId="para_48">The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has been charged with co-ordinating the Government's approach to commemorating the many notable historic events within the decade of centenaries from 2012 to 2022. The general Government approach is one that seeks to promote tolerance, respect and inclusiveness and that recognises the all-island and east-west shared past nature of the decade.</p>
            <p eId="para_49"> The role of the Office of Public Works, OPW, is to support the various Government initiatives and events being held on State property managed by the OPW to commemorate particular historic occasions such as at the Garden of Remembrance, for example. That is similar to the role it has performed most successfully recently for the visits of Queen Elizabeth II and President Obama and Ireland's hosting of the EU Presidency. The OPW provides logistical, organisational and managerial input, as required and requested by various Departments involved in the national commemorations.</p>
            <p eId="para_50"> The OPW is also involved in the management of specific projects relating to and linked with the commemoration of 1916. Two notable examples are the redevelopment of Kilmainham Gaol through the acquisition of the adjacent former Kilmainham courthouse which will facilitate the anticipated increased volume of visitors to the gaol as the events surrounding the Rising of 1916 are commemorated and the major refurbishment of the National Gallery of Ireland. Both projects are scheduled for completion by the end of 2015, in time for the centenary commemoration of the Rising in 2016.</p>

            <p eId="para_51">I welcome the role of the OPW. I understand the initiative is being headed by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht but the OPW will have a key role. It had a key role in regard to the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, although the Minister of State's Department was not a direct line Department. I hope it will have at least as strong a role in these matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_52"> With regard to the previous question, we mentioned the medium-term expenditure plan for each Department. How much is allocated for the commemorations in the OPW medium-term expenditure plan on a year-by-year basis for the next three years? There must be a subheading. What is the outline?</p>
            <p eId="para_53"> The Minister of State mentioned the Garden of Remembrance. Are there plans to locate there a monument for children who were abused in institutions? Is everyone happy that it is the right location? I do not have a particular view on it and respect the people who are involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_54"> The OPW can play a key role. I am thinking of the declaration of the Moore Street area as a national monument and also of the GPO. Such locations should be central. We would not be here today without the people who were involved in the associated struggles.</p>

            <p eId="para_55">On the first issue, the Deputy rightly pointed out the role of the OPW in the EU Presidency. The total amount spent by the State was one third less than was the case during the previous Presidency, some seven years ago. This is an example of the co-ordination and shared service role of the OPW.</p>
            <p eId="para_56"> The only subhead concerned capital projects. Six years ago, the total amount of money for OPW capital projects was €400 million. This year, it is €80 million. We are still doing all the tasks in question with capital expenditure of €80 million. The only subhead is for the Kilmainham Gaol project, which involves an investment of €10 million over a three-year period.</p>
            <p eId="para_57"> With regard to the Deputy's comments on the Garden of Remembrance, I fully agree with him. It is a project of the Department of Education and Skills, from which the funding comes. However, my Department, along with that of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, has been central regarding the competition for architectural support and the siting of the new memorial. It is important that we proceed with that.</p>
            <p eId="para_58"> We intend to publish next year a full list of the commemorative events in OPW-specific historic sites.</p>

            <p eId="para_59">Essentially, the Minister of State's last sentence, on the fact that he will publish in 2014 a list of events connected directly with the OPW, is the one I was waiting to hear.</p>
            <p eId="para_60"> There are many relevant State properties. Even in Mountjoy, old records were found on people who had been interned there at various times over the years, or who had met the end of their days there, which are relevant to some of the commemorations. Could the Minister of State ensure, through the OPW, that any relevant information in State properties, be they owned by the Department of Justice and Equality, the National Library of Ireland or the National Archives - not necessarily the Department of Finance - can be utilised to enrich the celebrations and promote greater knowledge and awareness? It is a question of trying to get the information up on the website. I am impressed to see the Minister of State reading from his tablet this morning.</p>

            <p eId="para_61">That is a very good suggestion. There needs to be a whole-of-government approach because there will be hundreds of events all over the country between now and 2016. Obviously, there will be a focus on sites such as Kilmainham Gaol because of the significance of the events that occurred there and the considerable number of visitors who will be going there. It is the third most visited tourist site in the city at the moment. The numbers will grow exponentially between now and 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_62"> There are many events occurring around the country. I was recently at the Seán Mac Diarmada homestead in Leitrim, an OPW property on which we recently spent €30,000 re-thatching the roof. There are very interesting proposals coming from Galway on the Pearse cottage. The Pearse Museum is another OPW property. Large numbers visit it to see the work of Pádraig Pearse as an educationalist and as someone who was involved in the historic events in question. We need to bring the strands together and I very much accept the Deputy's point in that regard. The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, is co-ordinating the group, which operates rightly and properly on an all-party basis. We need to make sure people know what is happening, because there will be many events.</p>

            <p eId="para_64">Any workers in the public sector, be they in semi-State companies such as the ESB or the public service, who do not immediately swallow the austerity agenda of the Government and the troika are now routinely bullied publicly by Government spokespersons and the capitalist press. The semi-State organisations are not encompassed by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, but secondary teachers who are in dispute with the Government very clearly are. Has the Minister any plans to use the Act? Will he make a statement on that?</p>

            <p eId="para_65">I thank the Deputy for his question. Obviously, the commercial semi-state sector has taken no pay cuts except at chief executive level consequent to all the legislation that was passed. That has caused some commentary among public servants generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_66"> The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013 was enacted on 5 June 2013. The primary purpose is to implement the proposed pay reduction for public servants earning annual salaries of €65,000 or more, and the parallel reduction in public service pensions over €32,500. These provisions have come into force.</p>
            <p eId="para_67"> The Act also contains a number of contingency measures to permit pay bill savings to be secured. The individual or body, which may be a line Minister or public service body, having the power to determine terms and conditions of employment may exercise that power to reduce non-core rates of pay or to increase hours worked. However, under the legislation, unions and representative associations may conclude collective agreements with their public service employers. Where a union has signed up to a collective agreement - in this case, the Haddington Road agreement - it will avoid the need for the contingency measures in the legislation to be deployed. As the Deputy knows, the vast majority of public service unions have entered into a collective agreement with their public service employers. Obviously, there is no need for the legislation to be deployed in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_68"> One union, as the Deputy knows, has declined to enter the collective agreement negotiated for the public service. It is a matter for its members to decide whether they wish to conclude a collective agreement, and the matter is shortly to be put to ballot. The legislative position is that in the absence of a collective agreement being concluded for members of that association, the Minister for Education and Skills will have to take the necessary measures to meet the targeted payroll savings in 2013 and the following years.</p>

            <p eId="para_69">The reality is that the Minister uses the threat of the legislation to bully public sector workers, including nurses, teachers and local authority workers, into accepting the Haddington Road agreement against their will. In the first instance, it is quite a scandal that the Minister casts himself as a William Martin Murphy-type figure 100 years after the great Lock-out of 1913 with this type of blackmail threat.</p>
            <p eId="para_70"> In the event that the secondary schoolteachers organised in the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland reject the proposals or manifestations of austerity the Government is attempting to impose on them, what will be the role of the Minister and the legislation?</p>

            <p eId="para_71">The Deputy has resorted to name-calling. The only time his party's philosophy was ever employed in actually running anything was in the city of Liverpool. That ended up with the authorities running out of money and sacking public sector workers across the city. This is the experience we have of the Deputy's policies being deployed.</p>
            <p eId="para_72"> I spoke to public sector workers and their representatives a year ago, opening the books, as all good employers would, to demonstrate the state of the public finances. I stated that in order not to have a dramatic reduction in front-line services, we needed to make further reductions on the payroll side. Public sector workers responded to that positively by democratic vote. One cannot have it both ways. The Deputy cannot herald the staff if they vote in a way with which he agrees, saying that is their democratic decision and that it must be respected, while disrespecting them if they vote in a way with which he does not agree on the basis of a belief that their vote is a result of harassment, bullying or other tactics.</p>

            <p eId="para_77">In conclusion, in view of all the strictures and the Minister's lectures regarding public sector workers generally, hitting in particular low and middle income public sector workers, where is the Minister's policy left by the revelation of recent days of the sweet shops in hospitals being raided for tens of thousands of euro extra for chief executives? A huge gulf of inequality is being created between them and the workers at the coal face. Does that not make a mockery of the Minister's policy?</p>

            <p eId="para_78">It does not make a mockery of it inasmuch as the policy must be implemented. I have set out to make the adjustments on the basis of targeting those who are best paid. If there are means used to circumvent that, it is something I regret. I have placed a cap on public sector pay that has been implemented across the public sector. We have gone further under the terms of the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation and made additional reductions. Workers across the public sector, but particularly those in the Civil Service, earning more than €65,000 have made a very substantial contribution to making those deductions. We will ensure that public sector pay, as determined by Government, is implemented across the entire public sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_81">I welcome the outcome of yesterday’s vote in the European Parliament on the cohesion legislative package. This brings to a close more than two years of negotiations involving the Council of Ministers, the European Parliament and the European Commission. I am pleased that during our Presidency of the Council of Ministers, Ireland was able to play an important role in that process.</p>
            <p eId="para_82"> The legislative package that was agreed yesterday will provide the basis for the next round of Structural Funds spending in Ireland and across the European Union. The package comprises a set of six regulations covering the European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, the European Social Fund, ESF and the Cohesion Fund. Political agreement on four of the six regulations that were finalised yesterday was reached under the Irish Presidency of the Council of Ministers. Along with the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, EAFRD and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, these funds comprise the European Structural and Investment, ESI funds. </p>
            <p eId="para_83"> My Department has overall responsibility for EU cohesion policy and for the ESI funds, as well as specific responsibility for the ERDF. The Minister for Education and Skills has primary responsibility for the ESF while the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has responsibility for the EAFRD and the EMFF. Ireland no longer benefits from the Cohesion Fund. </p>
            <p eId="para_84"> Member states will have four months from the entry into force of the new regulations to submit a partnership agreement to the Commission. This will constitute a formal agreement between Ireland and the Commission regarding the use of the funds. Preparations for the new programming period have been underway in Ireland for the past year. This has involved public consultations as well as the preparation of needs analyses and ex-ante evaluations. The outcome of these processes will inform the preparation of the partnership agreement and related operational programmes through which EU funding will be drawn down. As regards the ERDF and ESF programmes, the issues likely to be addressed include combatting long-term and youth unemployment and social exclusion, promoting research and development investment and the competitiveness of the business sector as well as promoting an environmentally-friendly and resource-efficient economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_85">It sounds as if the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will have a key role but the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Education and Skills will also have key, but separate roles. To go back to my earlier theme, I would like to see one, joined-up approach on behalf of the Irish Government. There must be one lead Department to co-ordinate efforts in this area and I hope it will be the Minister's Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_86"> As I understand it, up to €3 billion could be available for Ireland through the aforementioned funds. The Minister did not make any reference to expenditure in the health area, which was included under previous rounds of ESI funding. The Minister made reference to employment and education, which are fundamental aspects of this but I ask the Minister to confirm that expenditure in the Department of Health will be allowable this time. </p>
            <p eId="para_87"> Matching funding will have to be provided by the Irish Exchequer. In view of the cuts the Minister is making to the capital expenditure programme, can he confirm that all matching funds that might be required will be made available by the Government to ensure all available funding can be drawn down.</p>

            <p eId="para_88">I can confirm that Ireland has been allocated approximately €1 billion from the Structural Funds, that is, the ERDF and ESF; €2 billion from the rural development fund, that is, the EAFRD; an additional €100 million for the Border and midlands region; and €150 million for the peace programme. Regarding the latter, it was not clear that there would be a Peace IV programme and we took initiatives in that regard. I met the UK authorities and we made a joint application to the Commission to ensure there would be a Peace IV programme and I know that was very much welcomed at the North-South Ministerial Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_89"> The rules regarding the six regulations and how they are to be co-ordinated are set at EU level. The ESF is a matter for the Minister for Education and Skills but, of course, bilateral discussions will take place to make sure there is no overlap and that our approach is co-ordinated.</p>
            <p eId="para_90"> On the issue of capital, the Deputy will be aware that the Department of Health is the only Department which did not have a diminution of its capital budget in the multi-annual capital expenditure programme. That Department's €390 million has been maintained and is being supplemented through the PPP programme and through the ring-fenced money for the national children's hospital from the proceeds of the sale of the national lottery licence.</p>

            <p eId="para_91">In the justice area funding was available previously for a European territorial co-operation programme. Can the Minister confirm that this funding is still available? My question on health was not about national spending but about whether spending in this area can be facilitated under these new EU programmes between now and 2021. Spending on education and employment is permitted but the last time, so too was spending on health. Is it in or out this time? I ask the Minister to elaborate on the funding for the Border and midlands region to which he referred.</p>

            <p eId="para_92">I will be in a much better position to answer the Deputy when we have the plan submitted to Brussels, which we are working on now. When the regulations are passed by the European Parliament, we can then formally get cracking on them. We might have some debate about it within the committee system before we make our submission to Brussels. I would be happy to facilitate that, as would other line Ministers, including the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister for Education and Skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_93"> The overarching priority, following the discussions we had in the run up to the adoption of the multi-annual financial framework, is youth unemployment. That will account for a big chunk of the spend. It was also agreed that we would front load that spend rather than spreading it out over the seven year programme. Prime responsibility in this area will fall to the Minister for Social Protection. </p>
            <p eId="para_94"> The territorial programme will involve ourselves, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Proposals will come from each of the three governments before the end of the year so that we can make a joint presentation. Again, once that is done, I will be very happy to give the Deputy the details.</p>

            <p eId="para_98">The Government is undertaking a significant reform programme in the public procurement sector. Part of this will involve a move towards centralisation of data collection in the area of procurement activity. Currently, public service procurement activity is transacted by several hundred contracting authorities throughout the State. Data relating to these individual contracts are not currently collected centrally and, therefore, they are not available for the Deputy. It is planned that under the new office of government procurement, OGP, a sizeable data collection project will be launched. That is crucial in order that we have full knowledge of the entire spend, which has not been the case up to now.</p>
            <p eId="para_99"> The national procurement service, NPS, does, however, collect statistics from across the public sector on all contracts in excess of the EU threshold where contract award notices were published on the national eTenders website. The data compiled represent a response rate of approximately 75% from all public sector bodies that were required to submit returns to the NPS to compile this data. The data have been collected from contracting authorities in respect of competitive processes that were in excess of the EU threshold and where contract award notices were published. In 2010 the value of these contracts for goods and services was just over €3 billion, and in 2011 the value was just under €2.3 billion. The figures for 2012 are currently being compiled and cannot be provided to the Deputy at this juncture.</p>
            <p eId="para_100"> It is a legal requirement that contracting authorities publish certain information on contracts awarded within 48 days of the award in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union</i>, OJEU. Particulars, including the type of contract, the procedure and award criteria used, the number of tenders received, the name of the successful tenderer, the value of the contract or the range of tender prices, and justification for the negotiated procedure, if used, are published. The necessary information can be submitted electronically to the OJEU through the eTenders website.</p>

            </p>
            <p eId="para_102"> Before signing any contract above the EU threshold, the awarding authority must write to all qualified tenderers to inform them of the result of the evaluation. This is called the standstill notice. In this notice, tenderers are informed of the name of the winning tenderer and how their tender compared to that of the winning tenderer. The Irish regulations governing the standstill notice were transposed from the 2007 EU new remedies directive under SI 130/2010. Under these regulations the standstill notice must give sufficient information to enable an unsuccessful bidder to decide whether there are grounds for seeking a review.</p>

            <p eId="para_116">The Deputy has rightly raised the significant issue of the concern of many businesses about whether they will be shut out of the new procedure. It is crucially important that people know that the procedure we are following is the best international procedure through which they can win a greater percentage of the pie. It will inevitably mean that businesses will have to come together and pitch for contracts. I have said to the director of the NPS that in the future, as we move towards framework contracts in which a number of operators are engaged, there should be multiple service users and instead of having only one contract for a large domestic or international plc, we need to have a range of businesses involved, including SMEs, indigenous and international companies and those involved in foreign direct investment. That is the way to go. We need to have that to make sure the SME sector gets the support this significant budget can provide.</p>

            <p eId="para_119">I have no difficulty meeting the individual. I meet hundreds of people engaged in this area and our office is open to that.</p>
            <p eId="para_120"> Deputy Naughten is correct, but the bottom line is that 70% of SMEs are not even registered on the eTenders website. How the hell they are going to know about this unless they are on the portal that explains the work that is coming up? This is a fundamental question. I am delighted this issue is being raised in the House in order that we can ask businesses to please register on the website and then they will know about every contract ranging in price from €3,000 to €3 million. There is no reason they cannot pitch for them. The portal is important because all of this information is shared on it. If we need to provide more help, I am more than happy to do that.</p>
            <p eId="para_121"> The Minister set a target of €500 million. We have to reach that target. I am pleased to announce that next year's target is €127 million, and that must be accounted for through savings in the new office. The staff know they must do this. There must be independent verification that those savings have occurred because it is crucial to the deficit reduction project and expenditure profiles that we make sure they are realised.</p>

            <p eId="para_124">I thank the Deputy again. A number of disposals are currently in train under the State assets disposal programme, some of which are likely to result in proceeds being received this year by the companies disposing of the assets. However, the timing of payment of such proceeds to the Exchequer by the companies by way of special dividend, which, as I explained previously, is the vehicle I will use, remains to be decided by Government at this stage, and will depend, <i>inter alia</i>, on when this funding is required by the Exchequer for the projects that are to be supported with these proceeds. The national lottery licence transaction is not part of the disposal programme because it involves the sale of a licence for a fixed time period rather than the disposal of an asset. I have explained previously how that will be dealt with.</p>
            <p eId="para_125"> No receipts have been provided for in the 2013 budgetary arithmetic in respect of State asset sales and I do not currently envisage any proceeds being required or received by the Exchequer in 2013. </p>
            <p eId="para_126"> In 2014, as I have constantly stated, I do not propose to set out publicly in advance my expectations of likely proceeds from the sale of State assets, as to do so would obviously signal the price that Government expects to receive in the middle of a sales process, which might influence bidders in submitting their bids rather than seeking to maximise the proceeds from the State asset disposals in question, which is our objective. However, as a provisional measure, a figure of €110 million has been built into the budgetary arithmetic for 2014 for projects to be funded from asset sales, €45 million of which will be used to fund the up-front Exchequer costs associated with the public private partnership programme. We need to put money in place in advance to tee up some projects and the remainder will be used to fund costs associated with the €150 million Exchequer stimulus projects announced in June of this year. It is my intention and hope to announce a further stimulus programme once the quantum of money becomes clear during 2014.</p>

            <p eId="para_127">I acknowledge the Minister's comment. There has been lots of talk over the past year or two about using the proceeds from the sale of State assets for job creation and debt reduction. The Minister trumpeted his great achievement in this regard. To my recollection, this is the first time it has been stated on public record that the Exchequer will receive nothing from the sale of State assets in 2013. This issue has been flagged by the Minister for more than 18 months. We were told money would be generated this year to fund job creation, but he is saying at the end of November that no funds will be recouped under this heading this year. He said the Government will decide what to do with the money that is generated depending on where it needs to plug a hole in future years. He mentioned a sum of €110 million. Is that the special dividend from the ESB? What heading does this come under?</p>
            <p eId="para_128">The Minister does not have to disclose the sale price of Bord Gáis, but he has put a figure on the sale of ESB plants in the midlands, notwithstanding the problems with the ESB's pension fund. We need to receive more information on this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_129">This is a multi-annual project. The first tranche of moneys that will come in to the Exchequer will be from the sale of the national lottery licence. I have outlined how we are spending €200 million of these moneys, with €50 million for roads, €50 million for the retrofit of local authority houses and €50 million for the schools building programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_130"> There are two sales processes in train, one of which involves the ESB. There is agreement on the sale of the Marchwood power plant in the United Kingdom, as well as a further shareholding in a Spanish plant. I will give the Deputy the exact quantum of these sales as soon as I get it.</p>

            <p eId="para_131">It is interesting that on 15 December Ireland will have exited the troika agreement. Despite everything the Minister and his party said about what Fianna Fáil had committed to in the sale of State assets as part of the three year programme, he has now confirmed that the troika will have left without any proceeds being received from the sale of State assets. Much and all as he tried to blacken us with the claim that we had tried to include the lottery licence in the sale of State assets, we never committed to it in the original memorandum of understanding. Now that the troika has left these shores, he is embarking on the sale of State assets to produce funds for the Exchequer in 2014, 2015 and 2016. It was never part of the three year programme while the troika was here. No funds were received from the sale of State assets during these three years, but the first sale will happen after the troika departs. The Government is in now complete control of State assets, but it will be selling them.</p>

            <p eId="para_132">I obviously do not have the same enthusiasm for the sale of State assets as the Deputy. Accordingly, we took a very measured approach to it and he is dead right. The fact that we have not had an extensive sale of State assets is not something about which I am crying. This will be done in a structured way and for the best benefit of the taxpayer. There will be no fire sale or panic. The resources we get from such sales will be utilised in the best interests of the Exchequer and the people to create jobs, boost construction and complete the targets we have set. We have much more freedom to do this now that we have exited the troika regime. We were able to do this because of all the renegotiations we undertook on the dreadful programme negotiated by the collapsing Government of 2010. We have renegotiated the promissory notes, the terms of the loan and the interest rates payable. That has given us flexibility to ensure moneys we raise from the sale of State assets are deployed in the best interests of workers and the people.</p>

            <p eId="para_134">Many of the functions of regulators have been amalgamated, but there are still 58 sectoral regulatory authorities. While we need effective regulation, as well as accountable and competent regulators, do we still need all of them to have separate offices and administrative structures?</p>

            <p eId="para_135">The Government’s public service reform agenda has delivered and will continue to deliver real improvements in the way public services are provided. A key part of this effort has been the reduction in the number of State bodies under the agency rationalisation programme, the introduction of shared services and a continued focus on streamlining organisational structures and modernising processes. As a result, the public service is much leaner and more efficient than before, with some 30,000 fewer public servants compared to five years ago maintaining service levels across the system, while dealing with more citizens. This has been made possible by real improvements in the way public services are delivered.</p>
            <p eId="para_136"> The same reform agenda applies to the regulatory sector, too. Effective regulation is a critical part of the State infrastructure, central to ensuring a competitive economy and protecting the consumer. The individual regulatory bodies also have an obligation to operate in an effective and cost-effective manner. To that end, in July the Government published a new policy statement on sectoral economic regulation entitled, Regulating for a Better Future, which was informed by a review carried out by Forfás and public consultation. Progress against this policy statement will be overseen by the Cabinet subcommittee on economic infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_137"> The Government’s policy statement requires those Ministers with regulators under their aegis to introduce legislative changes to provide for policy and mandate reviews on a statutory basis at least every seven years. It also requires that performance and accountability frameworks for regulators and regulated sectors be put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_138"> On the operational side, the statement addresses the issues of efficiencies, requiring parent Departments to develop a shared services approach between economic regulators in their sectors. An overriding principle is that, where appropriate, existing regulatory roles will be extended to take on new regulatory functions.</p>
            <p eId="para_139"> Under the public service reform plan there have been several critical reviews of amalgamations relating to regulatory bodies. These reviews examined the merits of amalgamating bodies such as the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and the Commission for Communications Regulation; the Property Services Regulation Authority and the Private Residential Tenancies Board; the Pensions Board and the Financial Regulator; and the Aviation Regulator and the Irish Aviation Authority. These reviews suggested that in some instances amalgamation should not be pursued, for a variety of reasons, including potential conflicts of interest and regulatory concerns.</p>
            <p eId="para_140">
              <i> Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_141">However, where it was deemed to deliver real savings and benefits, progress has been made, most notably through the ongoing merger of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency and the bringing together of the back-office and administrative functions of the Commission for Communications Regulation and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. Where similar opportunities arise, particularly in the areas of shared services and administrative efficiency generally, I expect the relevant Ministers to pursue them in line with the Government’s policy statement on regulation and as part of our ongoing commitment to public service reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_142"> The Forfás report confirmed that further rationalisation of existing regulators would have a limited impact on reducing costs and increasing efficiencies. Instead, the report noted the potential for shared services in relation to front and back office functions.</p>
            <p eId="para_143"> The new framework on regulation also requires sectoral Departments to facilitate the development of memoranda of understanding between regulatory bodies in order to share functions. Reductions in administrative cost should be targeted, where feasible.</p>

            <p eId="para_144">I thank the Minister for his response and commend the movements that have taken place in this area. An argument is made that particular regulatory functions cannot be amalgamated owing to potential conflicts of interest and so forth. However, a regulator can move from one regulatory authority to head up another. Various regulators have different offices and administrative structures. Why can we not designate one building in Dublin to centralise the backroom functions of all these authorities? Why do all 58 have to have their own receptionist? Why does each regulator have to have a private secretary? We can retain the independence of the regulator - I accept the Minister is right that there could be conflicts of interest - but there is no reason the administration of the authorities cannot be streamlined.</p>

            <p eId="para_145">The Deputy makes much sense. In the review published we set about having common or shared backroom services between the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children and other ombudsmen. Although most of them are women, the new Ombudsman is a man. It is important we have support services that are rationalised but do not interfere with the regulators’ autonomy and have clear lines of demarcation. We are working on the shared services agenda and requiring every line Department to ensure all regulators under their aegis create synergies. In the case of a new authority to be established, we require the first port of call to be to an existing regulatory body to see if it can be latched on to it.</p>

            <p eId="para_146">Will the Minister agree that having an effective regulator should be about putting itself out of business by improving compliance, reducing red tape and simplifying sectoral policing? However, many of us believe the opposite in that they are creating new regulations to justify their existence, administrative back-up and the fees they charge. Why are some of these agencies leasing different offices around the country and this city when there are vacant public spaces available in the Irish Life Centre, for example? Why can we not centralise them in the same office in order that access to them is through the one door?</p>

            <p eId="para_148">We discovered that there are many things from which we cannot get out because we are stuck with long-term leases and other contractual arrangements. That is really important work and it is being carried out by the Minister of State to ensure that we sweat out proper value for the buildings we own, many of which are not fully utilised, and that we are not leasing buildings we do not need when we can occupy buildings we already have. Everything the Deputy said is a rock of sense and will be acted upon by the Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_151">The delivery of the required expenditure consolidation to achieve our fiscal targets in 2013 is a priority for Ministers and their Departments. My Department is working with all Departments and offices to monitor all current and capital spending on a monthly basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_152"> At the end of October, net voted expenditure was €844 million within profile. That means it was less than we expected to spend by the end of last month. This highlights that, notwithstanding pressures in some areas, the aggregate expenditure is being managed well within the targets for the year. The figures at the end of October indicate that there are current expenditure pressures in the justice and health groups of Votes. A Supplementary Estimate of just over €51 million will be required for the justice area, largely in respect of Garda pay. There is also €5 million for the Magdalen laundries issue, but savings will be made in the justice Vote. The position in the health sector is under review and my Department is working with the Department of Health to ascertain the scale of any Supplementary Estimate required. Based on the position at the end of October, it is anticipated that any overruns in the health and justice Votes can be met from savings elsewhere across the Government and will not have a negative impact on the Government’s aggregate end of year expenditure position. Savings across all profiles will be utilised so we will be within the voted spend.</p>
            <p eId="para_153"> The expenditure report published on 15 October outlined the expenditure measures required to be implemented in 2014 to meet the fiscal targets for 2014. My Department is currently working with Departments and offices with a view to publishing the detailed Revised Estimates volume for 2014 in early December. The ongoing review and monitoring by my Department, and the commitment of Ministers and their Departments to manage within their allocations, has ensured that we continue to be in a position to meet our fiscal targets.</p>

            <p eId="para_163">The achievement of our expenditure targets is a key element of the required fiscal consolidation in 2013. To this end my Department is rigorously monitoring all current and capital expenditure, with Departments and offices reporting to us on expenditure issues from the Exchequer on a monthly basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_164"> The key points to note in relation to 2013 expenditure are that all Ministers and their Departments are closely involved in managing their expenditure; overall spending for the year to date is 2.3% under profile; and in aggregate, voted expenditure for 2013 will be on target. This means that we will achieve our 2013 fiscal targets. </p>
            <p eId="para_165"> At the end of October 2013, net total voted expenditure was €844 million within profile, as I have already indicated. Expenditure is being managed well within profile, although the figures indicate that there are some pressures in the justice group and health group of Votes. A Supplementary Estimate will be required in the justice group, primarily to deal with pressures relating to Garda pay, and also to allow for certain other additional expenditure including the first of the payments to the women who were admitted to and worked in the Magdalen laundries. The position on the health Estimate remains under review and the Department of Health is working to contain the level of the Supplementary Estimate needed. </p>
            <p eId="para_166"> A Supplementary Estimate will be required in respect of transport projects funded from the stimulus package I announced earlier this year. A small number of Supplementary Estimates will also be required to allow for some movement of financial allocations but which will be Exchequer neutral. While it remains a matter for each Minister and their Departments to ensure adherence to the Vote, my Department is in regular communication with line Departments about monitoring expenditure to ensure that any risks arising from overruns are addressed.</p>

          <p eId="para_175">I move amendment No. 2:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_176">In page 12, line 14, after “the” to insert “educational welfare,”.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">The Minister knows I believe it is very important that when the functions of the agency are specified regarding supporting and promoting the development, welfare and protection of children, educational welfare be explicitly stated in the functions of the agency within the legislation. It is an implicit function, as the Minister has presented in the first and subsequent drafts. However, it is a very important one. The views I expressed on Committee Stage were further supported yesterday by the contribution to the Joint Committee on Health and Children by Dr. Geoffrey Shannon who elaborated on his sixth report as rapporteur on children when he explicitly made the case on the inclusion of educational welfare. He referenced, in particular, the important role played by teachers as perhaps being the most important front-line engagement with children. He said teachers might be more relevant and more exposed to the make-up and needs of a child and what he or she had to face than others, including even those anchoring the home environment. It is very important that we do not confine ourselves to development, welfare and protection. Educational welfare is also critically important, as we know there is a significant link between child welfare and school attendance. This issue has been well aired and demonstrated historically and there is real importance attached to placing particular emphasis on educational welfare, so as not to depend on it being implicit but to make it an explicit part of the agency's functions. Therefore, I commend amendment No. 2 to amend section 8(1)(<i>b</i>) in order that it would read: "(<i>b</i>) support and promote the educational welfare, development, welfare and protection of children,".</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrancesFitzgerald" eId="spk_86" as="#Minister_for_Children_and_Youth_Affairs">
          <from>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald<recordedTime time="2013-11-21T10:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_178">I thank the Deputy for his amendment and support for the development of the agency in general. He wants the term "educational welfare" to be specified, but the functions of the National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB, will be transferred to the new agency. The Deputy will accept that this is included in the legislation and that it is very clear that the board's functions will be carried out by the agency. I agree about the importance of focusing on educational welfare. Non-school attendance is very often the first indication that a child is in trouble. It will be a critical part of the agency's work to work with educational welfare officers and ensure the issues regarding school, school attendance and difficulties children are having at school are part and parcel of the agency's work.</p>
          <p eId="para_179"> The welfare of a child encompasses many aspects and the terms "development" and "welfare" capture the functions which are being transferred from the NEWB. To include educational welfare in the manner proposed would not replace the broad focus of the section that transfers these powers and to which I have referred. Educational welfare is also a responsibility for many others, including teachers, schools, the National Educational Psychological Service and the National Council for Special Education. Consequently, I do not want it to be seen that by accepting the amendment it would be explicitly suggested educational welfare was solely within the remit of the agency. That, obviously, is not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> The legislation and functions as set out in the Bill will not in any way diminish the role that was previously carried out by the NEWB under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000. All of the functions of that agency will transfer to the new Child and Family Agency. Section 8(1)(<i>b</i>) which reads, "The functions of the Agency shall be to ... (<i>b</i>) support and promote the development, welfare and protection of children", encapsulates the question of educational attainment and any issue that arises in relation to it. Therefore, I will not accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_181">I do not accept the Minister's view that including a reference to educational welfare would give the impression that it would be solely within the remit and responsibility of the new agency. We must recognise that the NEWB will be an integral part of the new agency. Nowhere in section 8 which lists the functions of the new agency is education explicitly referred to. The word appears only in section 8(4)(<i>d</i>) which refers to "psychological assessments in accordance with section 8 of the Disability Act 2005 or with section 4 of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004". Nowhere in any of the subsections of section 8 does a reference to education appear. I accept that it is implicit and reflected in section 8(1)(<i>a</i>) which refers to the transfer of functions to the new agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">Bringing in the words "educational welfare" is important and adds to rather than takes from this section. Given all the other information we have, both in terms of the recent past and of the evidence presented in the sixth report of the rapporteur, Dr. Shannon, it is important that educational welfare is explicitly referred to here in regard to the functions of the new agency. The case I have put stands on its merits. It is self evident and I ask the Minister to reappraise her reply.</p>

        <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_88">
          <from>Deputy Denis Naughten<recordedTime time="2013-11-21T11:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_183">I support Deputy Ó Caoláin's amendment which has huge merit. We cannot disconnect the issues of education and welfare. For many school age children, the first indications of issues relating to welfare arise within the school setting. On a number of occasions here, I have raised with the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Social Protection the issue of truancy and the failure to link that with child benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_184"> This morning, the Minister for Social Protection has commented on the number of children attending school - 20% - who have no breakfast or who go to bed hungry at night. The proposal I have put to both Departments and which now through this legislation comes into this Minister's brief is that there should be a direct connection between the payment of child benefit and school attendance. This would assist in encouraging some families to ensure their children maintain a good attendance. I spoke on this issue in the House a number of weeks ago and brought to the attention of the Minister for Social Protection instances that have been given as case examples by the National Education Welfare Board. When parents have eventually been brought before the courts and fines imposed on them, the child's attendance record has improved significantly. However, it should not take 12 months of dragging parents through the legal system for that to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_185"> The great benefit of linking school attendance and child benefit is not only that this would act as an early warning system of welfare issues in particular families and as an incentive for those families to ensure their child attends school, it would also eradicate approximately €100 million of fraudulent payments relating to children who do not exist or are not resident in the country. Some of that money could be rechannelled towards supporting families where there are welfare issues. The Minister and the new agency face a huge challenge in regard to the resources available to meet the challenging needs of families, yet there is a pot of money being paid out on an ongoing basis for children who do not exist or who are not resident in this country. People should not be in receipt of these payments. Based on the Department of Social Protection's figures, the sum involved is approximately €100 million annually. Some of this money could be channelled towards supporting children where there is an issue of truancy and other underlying family difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_186"> On a related issue, I came across an amazing statistic in recent weeks, namely, that some 1,500 children a year finish primary school but never appear in the second level education system. There may be legitimate reasons for some of these absences, but these 1,500 children should not disappear completely from the education system in the space of one academic year. If school attendance was linked with child benefit, we would identify very quickly where the problems are and where those children are and ensure adequate resources and supports are put in place to ensure those children stay within the system.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrancesFitzgerald" eId="spk_89" as="#Minister_for_Children_and_Youth_Affairs">
          <from>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald<recordedTime time="2013-11-21T11:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_187">This is an issue of how, in legislative terms, we approach the welfare and protection of children. The particular issue we are discussing today is school attendance. Two weeks ago, I launched the most up to date school attendance records that are available. The good news is that there have been extraordinary improvements in school attendance in the country. All of the evidence suggests that the way to deal with non-attendance is to take a whole-school approach, where the teachers put huge emphasis on daily attendance and there is follow up on children who do not attend and there is high quality home school liaison. That is where we are seeing results. I have seen the results of the two pilot projects done on this, in Ballymun and the inner city in Dublin, which have resulted in enormous improvements in attendance. I have seen similar improvements in other areas also. This is the way to deal with issues regarding school attendance and we must also work directly with families.</p>
          <p eId="para_188"> With regard to dealing with the issue in the context of legislation and how best to frame the needs for working with children, let me go back to the Child Care Act 1991. In regard to the functions of the health boards at the time, that Act states that it should be a function of every health board to promote the welfare of children in its area who are not receiving adequate care and protection. Therefore, the need is framed in terms of "adequate care and protection". I emphasise that it is clear in section 72 of this Bill that all of the functions vested in the National Education and Welfare Board or under section 10(1) of the Education Welfare Act 2000, shall on the establishment day stand transferred to the agency. If we consider the legislation that created the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the section on education welfare deals with all of the issues relating to schools and attendance. One of the reasons for that is that attendance is central to children's progress. </p>
          <p eId="para_189"> I accept the point made by Deputy Naughten regarding fraud in the area of child benefit. In making his point about children disappearing from the system during the transition from primary to secondary level, I am not quite sure what suggestion he was making. These children may be out of the country, there may have been fraud involved or there may be other issues. These issues need to be addressed, but as far as this Bill is concerned, the functions of the National Education Welfare Board are a central part of the work of my Department and are central to the agency. Those functions are captured in the Bill in section 8(1)(<i>b</i>), which speaks of the functions of the agency as being to support and promote the development, welfare and protection of children.</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> I suggest to the House that combining the functions articulated there and in section 72, which deals with the transfer of the agency, adequately ensures the education welfare issues will get the kind of attention the Deputies suggest they should get. I believe their concerns are well captured in the Bill, particularly by the transfer of functions and by the phrase about "promoting and protecting the development, welfare and protection of children." There are many other aspects of children's lives we are not capturing at the micro level in terms of the functions, but we are using a phrase that states it is the obligation and function of the agency to promote the care and protection of the child, in the same way as the Child Care Act originally did and which has served us well in terms of care and protection. The functions of the agency are outlined and the element where education welfare is most effectively captured is in section 8(1)(<i>b</i>). That is the reason I suggest it remains as it is.</p>

          <p eId="para_191">We battled on this on Committee Stage and the Minister does not intend to change her view. I believe strongly that the National Education Welfare Board is an integral part - one of the three elements - of the new agency. The new agency brings together three different and separate entities.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">It is imperative that we reference educational welfare among the functions of the agency. It is not there. I believe the legislation should be explicit and that this should not just be implied, as the Minister suggests. However there is no point in prolonging the exchange. I indicate my intention to press the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_193">I wish to clarify that the €100 million I mentioned in fraudulent payments consists of overpayments and inappropriate payments. Connecting child benefit and school attendance would bring about these savings, which could be better spent in supporting children where there are challenges in the home. There are legitimate reasons for some of the 1,500 children who did not make the transition from primary school to secondary school - their parents might have emigrated, as sadly more and more are doing - but consistently over recent years, a thousand children per annum have not made the transition from primary school to secondary school, and according to the most recent figures the number has spiked at 1,500. The concern is that a large percentage of these children are falling out of the education system. If there were a connection between child benefit and school attendance it would ensure these children made the transition into secondary school.</p>
          <p eId="para_194"> We still have a huge problem with truancy, with one in ten primary school children and one in six post-primary schoolchildren absent for more than 20 days per year, which is a month of the school year. I accept that the Minister is correct in saying we need a whole-school approach on this, and the pilots have shown this, but we also need a whole-of-government approach. There should be a link between the National Education Welfare Board, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Social Protection so that we can link the databases available to each to identify these vulnerable children, support them and ensure the proper resources are allocated to these families.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_196">In page 12, line 15, to delete "families" and substitute the following:</p>

          <p eId="para_198">I seek an amendment to section 8(1)(<i>c</i>), which reads "support and encourage the effective functioning of families". This is one of the specified functions of the new agency, but the construction of this gives an interpretation that has applied historically to the word "family" and does not at all reflect the definitions that appear in the opening section of the legislation, where it is clearly stated that "family" means "spouse, parent, grandparent, step-parent, child (including a step-child), grandchild, brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, and any other person who, in the opinion of the Agency, has a bona fide interest in the child".</p>
          <p eId="para_199"> The idea and understanding of family make-up today in Irish society is very different from what it was when I was a child. Accordingly, we should reflect in legislation our shared understanding and acceptance of this new reality. I have sought to do this by changing the provision to read "support and encourage the effective functioning of all families and the role of parents or guardians therein as integral to the achievement of <i>paragraph (b)</i> above", which is the provision we discussed with regard to amendment No. 2. This better reflects the intent of the legislation. It gives clarity to the agency's role and function and to our understanding and acceptance of the reality of family and families in Irish society today. I commend the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_200">I refer the Deputy and the House to page 10 of the Bill as amended on Committee Stage. The definition of "family" included in the Bill is "spouse, parent, grandparent, step-parent, child (including a step-child), grandchild, brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, and any other person who, in the opinion of the Agency, has a bona fide interest in the child". The Deputy will agree this is a very encompassing definition of family, and it is one I am very pleased to have in the Bill. This definition is what must be borne in mind when one examines section 8(1)(<i>c</i>).</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> Section 8(1)(<i>c</i>) is sufficiently broad to capture the intent of the amendment proposed. It is important to note the definition of "family" already in the Bill is broader than just parents and guardians. We must take full account of the definition of "family" in section 2. The insertion of "the role of parents or guardians therein as integral to the achievement of <i>paragraph (b)</i> above" does not add anything to create or recognise a specific role for parents or guardians in supporting and promoting the development, welfare and protection of children. This is also provided for under the Constitution. We already have a very broad definition that is intended to apply throughout the Bill. The legislative framework and other legislation relating to the function of the agency are all framed and found in the constitutional commitment to the family.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> The Deputy's amendment would narrow the broad definition already in the Bill. Such a provision is not required to underpin the role of parents, as any statutory provision is to be interpreted within the constitutional framework. The definition in the legislation is clearly spelled out. When we discussed this on Committee Stage some Deputies recognised that the definition in the legislation is already very broad and encompasses the points made by Deputy Ó Caoláin.</p>

The truth is that it is under the explanation of the word "couple" that we find a much more explicit reference to the understanding of family, in terms of a married couple; civil partners within the meaning of Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act; a man and woman who are not married to each other but are cohabiting as husband and wife; or two persons of the same sex who are cohabiting in domestic circumstances comparable to that of a man and woman who are not married. It is all about clarity, and the interpretations are there. My sense of it, and the argument I have put, is that the expansion of section 8(1)(<i>c</i>) to read, as I indicated in the amendment proposed, "all families and the role of parents or guardians therein as integral to the achievement of <i>paragraph (b)</i> above" is very important. Not all children are necessarily in all of the circumstances explained by "family" or "couple". Some are placed in a variety of settings, including many of those who are in State care due to fostering. The wording "all families" would reflect the actuality with regard to a child's circumstances in all family settings. I do not believe the amendment as presented weakens, disturbs or distorts any of the intent of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">It offers the clarity that is needed and that many in our society would welcome. Again, I commend the amendment to the Minister and reiterate that the intent behind it is self-evident.</p>

          <p eId="para_205">The definitions contained in the Bill are very expansive. For example, the definition of "couple" refers to a married couple, civil partners within the meaning of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010, a man and a woman who are not married to each other but who are cohabiting as husband and wife or two persons of the same sex who are cohabiting in domestic circumstances comparable to that of a man and a woman who are not married to each other but who are cohabiting as husband and wife. There is no need for the additional provision contained in the amendment because the definitions contained in the legislation are sufficiently expansive and encompass the points the Deputy makes.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_212">In page 13, line 10, to delete "and accountability" and substitute ", accountability and consistency".</p>
          <p eId="para_213">The intent behind this amendment is to change section 8(5) which relates to the functions of the agency and currently reads, "The Agency shall, in the performance of its functions, demonstrate high standards of performance, transparency and accountability". I want to alter the subsection in order that it would read "accountability and consistency". This is extremely important. In recent months and years the inconsistency of approach to the application of specific measures in respect of children has been highlighted. It was highlighted again recently in the context of the views of children being taken into account, particularly by the courts in circumstances relevant to a child's interests and future. The difference in the approaches employed by people who are trained to the same level as professionals is a matter of great concern and was discussed by the Joint Committee on Health and Children on Tuesday in the context of the presentation made to it by the special rapporteur on child protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon. We must expect consistency across the board in all matters pertaining to the interests of children. Such consistency has not been present heretofore. The functions of the new agency under section 8(5) would be strengthened and enhanced by inclusion of the term "consistency".</p>

          <p eId="para_214">I support the amendment. One of the key reasons put forward by the Minister and the Government for the establishment of the new Child and Family Agency is the need to draw together the various child and family services throughout the country in order to ensure consistency of approach across these services. As it stands, section 8(5) states, "The Agency shall, in the performance of its functions, demonstrate high standards of performance, transparency and accountability". If the amendment were accepted, the term "consistency" would be added. It goes without saying one would expect consistency, but it is highly important that this be clearly reflected in the legislation. If the term "consistency" is included, it will place very important legal obligations on the new agency in the context of ensuring cases in various parts of the country which are dealt with at different times will be treated in a consistent manner. It should not be the position that a particular decision will be made in one case and a completely different one in another. It is important that the term be included in the legislation. I will be interested to hear any rationale as to why it should not be included.</p>

          <p eId="para_215">There is no question but that consistency is a key element of performance, transparency and accountability. The Bill states, "The Agency shall, in the performance of its functions, demonstrate high standards of performance, transparency and accountability". Clearly, having a high standard of performance would ensure a consistent approach; therefore, I do not believe a separate expression is required because a lack of consistency in the delivery of services would raise key performance questions. What is sought in the amendment is already encapsulated in the language used in the subsection. Obviously, I am committed to the concept of consistency in access to services for children and families. I do not disagree with the Deputies in respect of the fact that we should demand consistency in the delivery of services. A lack of consistency has been a problem across the services being delivered to children and families. We have been careful to outline in the legislation the key aspects of governance and management in order to ensure there will be a governance system in place and that the agency will be accountable to the Minister of the day and the Department. We have also clearly outlined the responsibilities of the staff and management of the agency in the context of the services they are obliged to deliver.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> Provision is made in the legislation for strong governance and performance oversight, which is new. This is more modern oversight and represents a departure from what was done in previous legislation on the establishment of new agencies. Stronger demands will be placed on those running the agency to be accountable for the work they do, to report back on a regular basis and to ensure the agency meets the necessary standards in carrying out its functions. As the Deputies are aware, I have put in place a very competent board led by Ms Norah Gibbons to oversee the work of the agency. The combination of this strong legislation in the context of key demands it makes, the clarity it provides in respect of the agency's functions and the governance structures it imposes and the experience of the members of the board, particularly their background knowledge of the services delivered, will make a difference in the delivery of consistent services.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> The main reason for putting the Child and Family Agency in place is to ensure the correct focus will be achieved. There will now be 17 managers instead of 36 and their key responsibility will be the development of child and family services in their areas. The Deputies will be aware of the story commonly told that in the past the issue of child and family services rarely made it onto the agenda of the relevant HSE board. The overriding focus of the new agency will be on the range of child and family services provided throughout the country and its key objective will be to ensure these are delivered in a consistent and effective way. It will also be charged with ensuring the children who are most in need will have access to such services. The combination of legislation, governance structures and clarity in respect of functions will ensure consistent services will be delivered. It is understood consistency is a key element of performance. It does not need to be spelled out in the legislation in the way the Deputy suggests.</p>

          <p eId="para_218">I absolutely disagree. It certainly does need to be explicitly stated in the legislation. The Minister used the word "consistent" not only in reference to the amendment, as presented, but also with regard to her expectations in terms of the agency's performance.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">Consistency flowed out naturally, yet it is not stated in the text as a requirement. Inconsistency in the approach to children has been very much in evidence across all the agencies and services, not only in recent years but for decades. How can it be in any way a challenge to provide that the agency shall, in the performance of its functions, demonstrate high standards of performance, transparency, accountability and consistency? A requirement to be consistent is not implicit and must, therefore, be stated in the interests of children and also of the way in which the State relates to and engages with their interests. Consistency is what we want and we have ample evidence of inconsistency in the State's response to cases in which children were central in the recent past. I will make further reference to this inconsistency when we discuss the next amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> I urge the Minister again to accept the amendment. It is imperative because consistency is about treating all children equally in every circumstance that can present. The amendment makes absolute sense and I believe the Minister recognises that. </p>

          <p eId="para_221">In her response to the proposal to insert the word "consistency" in the relevant line, the Minister outlined several reasons that consistency is important and noted that the need for consistency was one of the key factors in establishing the agency in the first instance. She then stated that, for the reasons she had outlined, it was not necessary to include the word "consistency" in the legislation. Her line of argument does not add up.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> Is consistency referred to elsewhere in the legislation? Is it made clear in the Bill that consistency is expected of the agency, especially given that it was a key objective when establishing a single agency? If the word "consistency" will not be included on the basis that consistency is taken for granted, why is the Minister going to the trouble of inserting the words "performance", "transparency" and "accountability"? If one uses her logic, these characteristics should also be taken for granted. Will she set out the reasons for including these three words, while refusing to include the word "consistency", which is of equal importance?</p>

          <p eId="para_223">The term "high standards of performance" in respect of children's services clearly encapsulates a requirement to provide a consistent service. One other point that needs to be made is that it is clear, for example, in terms of the volume or location of services, that one must take account of local need and variations in need. One must ensure that responses are being provided. While we want consistency in the application of specific interventions, we must also allow for relevant and necessary assessment of specific circumstances. Clearly, there will be variation in the responses provided in terms of the precise services provided in any one area at a given time. We need to be careful that such variation is permitted under the legislation and that we do not provide precisely what must be provided in every geographic area. If one inserts the word "consistency" in the definition, it could be interpreted in a manner that would preclude the type of local intervention and specific assessment that is needed in a variety of areas. On the other hand, we also want consistency of approach in the provision of services.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> The requirement regarding high standards of performance, transparency and accountability gives a clear direction to the agency about the standards that need to apply and the consistent services. While I use the word "consistent", it should be applied in the application and development of services. One has to allow for local variation and need. </p>

          <p eId="para_225">The Minister refers to local variation and need. High standards of consistency, which would be required if the subsection were amended, do not disallow flexibility in response to given circumstances which can and will present. The Minister's comments suggest, for the first time, that inconsistency is what she wishes to provide for. The only logical conclusion one can draw from her statement is that she regards inconsistency as meritorious in respect of the legislation and the agency it establishes. I cannot wear that view, which is absolutely wrong. Having the highest standards of performance, transparency and consistency would not preclude those entrusted with performance of responsibility on the part of the State from responding to circumstances as they require in light of all the facts that apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> The Minister's argument is a convenient way of refusing to accept further straightforward and logical amendments that seek to improve and strengthen the legislation in the interests of children and as a means of building confidence across society in the State's role in respect of children. Such confidence has been significantly weakened in the recent past as a result of certain actions and decisions which have clearly shown a lack of consistency or equality of response in relation to all children.</p>
          <p eId="para_227"> Having made the case for accepting the amendment again, I do not propose to add anything further, as it would be wearisome to do so. The amendment stands on its merit and it is a great disappointment that on Committee Stage and now on Report Stage, the Minister has not been able, for whatever reason, to accept the most straightforward, meritorious amendments which are designed solely to improve the legislation in terms of preparing for the role of the agency. </p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_229">In page 13, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_230">“(6) In the performance of its functions, the Agency shall have regard to the principles of equality and non-discrimination.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">The amendment proposes to insert a new subsection in the section setting out the functions of the new agency. The principles of equality and non-discrimination must be central to the agency's function and responsibilities. We must bear in mind that we have seen, not only in times long past but very recently, some of the most worrisome examples of questionable practice where inequality and discrimination may well have been practised. That is unacceptable. All children must be treated equally and it is essential that the principle of equality applies, not only to those who were born on the island of Ireland, whether of the indigenous population or newcomers who have settled here in recent years, but also those who are now among our communities across the length and breadth of the country. It must also apply to the children of the Traveller community who have not always experienced equality and know a little about discrimination. </p>
          <p eId="para_232">It must also apply to children in the family situations that apply across Irish society today, and to which we have already referred in some measure. It must also apply to young people who may be of lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender make-up. Irrespective of their domicile geographically, their make-up as individuals, their background, their disposition, their sexuality, children must all be treated the same and there is ample evidence that such has not always been the case. This legislation needs to state absolutely and explicitly that equality and non-discrimination must be cornerstones of the new agency's remit.</p>
          <p eId="para_233"> There can be no question of the colour of the hair or the eyes of a child being a factor in whether he or she can be brought into State care or not. There are many questions about recent actions taken and we hope that those answers will soon be forthcoming following on the inquiry being undertaken by the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan. I only cite those two experiences of the recent past, but there are so many. This new agency must put a marker down for a new reality in the State's relationship with children across the board and we must state firmly and absolutely that every child is treated equally, is respected fully and is provided for in a non-discriminatory way for all his or her needs in preparation for adult life.</p>

          <p eId="para_234">I assure Deputy Ó Caoláin that the Equal Status Acts of 2000 and 2012 apply absolutely to the provisions of the Child and Family Agency and, therefore, do not need to be restated in the Bill. As he will be aware, once there is primary legislation that is absolutely clear about discrimination and equality, there is not a need to repeat it in the Bill but it applies absolutely to the work of the Child and Family Agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_235"> The general scheme of the Irish human rights and equality commission Bill, as published in 2012, imposes a positive duty on the public sector which, I believe, addresses the issues of concern in this regard that Deputy Ó Caoláin raises as well. Head 36 of the general scheme proposes, "A public body shall in the exercise of its functions have due regard to the need to eliminate prohibited discrimination, promote equality of opportunity and treatment and protect the human rights of its staff and the persons to whom it provides services.", and any further developments in this regard should apply in a consistent manner to all agencies. We already have the Equal Status Acts on non-discrimination, and the human rights Bill repeats that public bodies and agencies will have a positive proactive obligation to eliminate discrimination, promote equality of opportunity and treatment and protect the human rights of its staff. That obligation, which Deputy Ó Caoláin correctly highlights as an important one, is already in legislation. As I stated, there are further legislative proposals in that area that will copperfasten it as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_236"> The issues Deputy Ó Caoláin raises are well covered by legislation already. As he will be aware, one would go to the primary legislation and it would not be the practice to repeat it in this or in any other legislation contemplated.</p>

          <p eId="para_237">It must be evident to the Minister and to all concerned that the legislation to which she refers has been in place yet some of the instances of inequality and discrimination are more contemporary than the legislation's passage. It has not actually made the critical difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_238"> It is important that in the functions of this new agency we emphasise and lay down a clear marker and indicator that the elected voices of the people of the State will not tolerate inequality and discrimination in relation to children in any circumstances across society. The legislation the Minister cites affirms that, but in relation to this agency, and, specifically, now that there is no question as to the weakened confidence in society on the State's position <i>vis-à-vis</i> children and the question of children at risk, there needs to be an absolute statement clearly outlining the importance in the view of these Houses that equality and non-discrimination will be cornerstones of the new agency's approach to dealing with children henceforth. It is in the Minister's and her Department's interest to ensure that such is affirmed strongly and clearly in this legislation. I believe that there is a public demand for that and that such is the least response that we could offer at this point in time, given all that has happened over recent months.</p>

          <p eId="para_239">I support this amendment. I take on board the Minister's points about other legislation in place, but the Bill would be strengthened by explicitly placing it here. It gives clear guidelines as to what exactly is expected of the new Child and Family Agency and how it is expected to do its business. Children are the most vulnerable sector of society. More than anyone, they can be subject to situations whereby they are not treated equally and are subject to discrimination.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> It should be put in explicitly to the Bill. The Minister has not offered up a strong reason as to why it should not be there. I would support its insertion.</p>

          <p eId="para_241">I disagree with Deputy McConalogue. I have given the strongest reason, that it is already in legislation. One does not have to repeat it. When one has strong legislation in place to deal with a particular issue, that is, equality and non-discrimination, it is not the practice to repeat it in new legislation. That is the reality of the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_242"> However, I take the point Deputy Ó Caoláin has made, that often there is failure in implementation. Of course, that is the purpose of the new agency as far as children at risk are concerned, to ensure that the focus is on children and on promoting the welfare of those children who have been failed by the State in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_243"> What we have now done is put in place an implementation plan to ensure that we do not repeat what happened in the past and that we operate in a different way. It will not be done overnight. There is a bad legacy in this regard. There have been changes, but there is a great deal of work to do to get to the kind of national standards in the delivery of these services that we need to. The way we have framed this legislation and the way we have brought the agency together, and the various services that provide for children, is what will make the most difference to how children receive these services.</p>
          <p eId="para_244"> We have in legislation already the principles of equality and non-discrimination. We now have a mechanism to implement the services in a way that they have not been implemented previously and that is what will really make the difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_245"> What we are passing here today in the Bill is an implementation of the Government decision to have a separate agency so that we can deal with those failures of the past and begin to deliver services in a much better and more cohesive way to the children who need them most, particularly those 6,000 children who are in care but also those children at risk in the community. There are 40,000 referrals every year. There is an increasing number of cases of neglect being referred to the services around the country. There are 1,500 cases of confirmed child sexual abuse every year.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">We have serious ongoing child protection issues in this country. These have to be faced up to not only by the Child and Family Agency but also by communities and everybody will have a part to play in ensuring that where children are vulnerable there is intervention so that they get a second chance.</p>

          <p eId="para_247">One could pick any of the other functions set out in the Bill and say "that is implicit". For whom is the message designed? Is it really designed for the board of the new agency? Is it designed for those who will be working at the helm or the coalface in terms of the agency's 4,000 employees on its establishment? It is definitely also designed for public reassurance. There can be no question this is not just a brief or terms of reference for the new agency. It is a public statement of the agency's role and functions in order to give a public assurance. I believe it is necessary to state clearly there will be no countenance of the practices of the past in respect of inequalities and discrimination, as they have applied across not just the areas I referred to in my opening contribution on this amendment but to all circumstances. We want to see the highest standards of performance and the elimination of practices that discriminate against children on the basis of inequality. Those are practices that must be banished and left to the past. This is a new beginning and we need clearly to state it publicly as well as for the agency and its board. That is why it should be there. I am pressing the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_361">There have been many debates on the pros and cons of selling State assets. The Government withdrew the option of selling Coillte, which was the right decision. Fine Gael had a plan in 2009 to sell State assets with a view to creating new jobs. One hour ago in the Chamber the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, confirmed no proceeds had been received from the sale of State assets, that none would be received by 15 December when the troika leaves and that none would be received in this calendar year. We all welcome the departure of the troika on 15 December. It is clear that during the three year plan no proceeds were received from the sale of State assets. Now that the troika is leaving and will no longer be here to ask the Government to sell them, the European Union is not asking the Government to sell State assets, as is no one on the Opposition side.</p>

As the leader of the Labour Party, will the Tánaiste move away from his programme for Government commitments? It may have been part of the troika arrangement, but the troika is now gone and no one is asking the Labour Party to do so except Fine Gael.</p>

          <p eId="para_385">The renegotiation by this Government was for a minimum of €1 billion, with a target of €3 billion and 50% of the total, to be used for reinvestment in the Irish economy to generate employment. We had always stated in the programme for Government that there could be a strategic sale of non-strategic State assets, with income arising from sales reinvested in the economy in order to generate employment and bring about economic recovery. It is almost to the day the third anniversary of Fianna Fáil's bringing the troika to the country, and it is almost to the day the anniversary of the party's putting the country into receivership. For the Deputy to come in today with this cant, hypocrisy and nonsense, it really does beat Banagher.</p>

          <p eId="para_443">There are reports in this morning's media that the Garda Commissioner has demanded the return of files from the Committee of Public Accounts with regard to the penalty points debacle. I hope the Tánaiste agrees that this a disturbing development. We can recap what has happened. Two Garda whistleblowers were very concerned about practices surrounding the termination of penalty points. They reported concerns to the internal Garda confidential recipient in March 2012 and the issue went nowhere, so the whistleblowers were essentially stonewalled for months. In autumn 2012, under section 62 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, the whistleblowers passed their evidence to Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, as they are entitled to do. No investigation that we are aware of had taken place within An Garda Síochána until the information was passed. The people in question were discredited and talked down afterwards. An internal Garda investigation that followed was not in the public interest, and there should have been an independent investigation. When the results of the investigation were published, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, sought to discredit the whistleblowers and downplay the extent of the scandal.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> There were ongoing attempts afterwards to discredit the Garda whistleblowers, but they have now been vindicated. We now have the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, which reveals that one in five motorists facing offences got off and half of all summonses that should have been served for road traffic offences were not carried through. It was a widespread problem and in some districts there were 50 times as many terminations as in other districts in the State. It was a major issue. We have seen revelations that senior journalists and one State solicitor allegedly had penalty points terminated.</p>
          <p eId="para_445"> The public must know all the facts. Will the Tánaiste ensure that the Committee of Public Accounts can do its work with the evidence it has and reveal the full facts of what was a scandal? Thanks to the whistleblowers, such events should not be repeated, as there are now clear directives to all gardaí concerning the termination of penalty points and the framework in which gardaí operate. Will the Tánaiste stand by the whistleblowers and protect them from this latest assault?</p>

          <p eId="para_447">I have not had notice of the question and there is a level of detail in it about which I am not briefed. As I understand it, the Comptroller and Auditor General's report goes to the Committee of Public Accounts, and as far as the Government is concerned, that committee is free to do its job; we do not and will not seek to influence how it does its work. The Minister for Justice and Equality takes very seriously the allegations made, and they will have to be fully investigated.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">It is fair to say that the Government has made its position very clear on whistleblowers. We introduced legislation for the first time in the history of the State to protect whistleblowers and prevent them from being discriminated against or dismissed from their employment. We are committed to the legislation which passed in the Seanad yesterday. Our position on whistleblowers could not be clearer. This is the first Government that has introduced legislation to protect whistleblowers so that people in the public service who become aware of any wrongdoing can bring it to the attention of the appropriate authorities, have it investigated and be sure there will not be recrimination against them.</p>
          <p eId="para_449"> As far as the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General is concerned, that is a matter for the Committee of Public Accounts and the Government supports the committee in the role it has to exercise in dealing with the report.</p>

The whistleblower has given the dossier of evidence he has to the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts. The Chairman would be prevented from doing his job if the Garda Commissioner demands the return of those files.</p>

Let us imagine if people within the financial services sector had shouted stop. One could ask whether we would have the current crisis if legislation had been in place for such people.</p>
          <p eId="para_453"> In this case we have two very brave men, one of whom has had to leave the force, the other one who is thinking about leaving every day, who are under severe pressure for taking a stand and changing a system that was demonstrably wrong, as was proven conclusively by the Comptroller and Auditor General. Will the Tánaiste stand by the two whistleblowers and ensure that the evidence they have courageously given to the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts is fully examined by the committee and all the facts and lessons will be learned? Will he also give the legislation that is coming through the best chance to be a real success in the future?</p>

          <p eId="para_456">An investigation is being carried out.

          <p eId="para_457"> We are in the process of bringing legislation forward on whistleblowers. The whistleblower legislation has passed in the Seanad and it will come before this House. As I understand it, the Bill extends the persons to whom information may be brought to their attention to include Members of the Dáil and Seanad. There should not be wrongdoing. Perhaps if we had legislation such as this in the past some of the wrongdoing that has taken place, to which Deputy Mac Lochlainn referred, would not have taken place. It is appropriate that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, is leading for the Government on the legislation because there are few people in this House who understand the situation as well as he does. In his case, information was brought to him about wrongdoing. He did not come to the House and make wild allegations but he sought to bring the information to the attention of the then Minister for Justice and ended up in the courts for his trouble. He was at considerable risk as a result of the entire process. We will now have whistleblowers legislation which will protect whistleblowers so that if people see something being done that is wrong they can bring it to attention and have it addressed. I look forward to seeing the Committee of Public Accounts doing its work on the report it has before it from the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>

          <from>Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly<recordedTime time="2013-11-21T12:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_458">A woman was charged in court yesterday with the crime of assisting the suicide of a multiple sclerosis sufferer. The charge comes under section 2 of the Criminal Law (Suicide) Act 1993 and it carries a penalty of up to 14 years in prison. It is the first court case of its kind in Ireland and it is being watched very closely by a constituent of mine, Marie Fleming. Marie has lived with multiple sclerosis for 35 years. The Tánaiste is aware that earlier this year Marie and her partner Tom Curran went to the Supreme Court to challenge the constitutionality of the 1993 Act. The court did not find it to be unconstitutional, but it was stated that nothing in the judgment should be taken as necessarily implying that it would not be open to the State, in the event that the Oireachtas was satisfied that measures with appropriate safeguards could be introduced, to legislate to deal with a case such as the appellant.</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> What of the appellant? I spoke with Tom this morning and he said that Marie’s condition has worsened since the Supreme Court case. He told me that Marie is now completely immobile, other than her mouth. He said she is in constant pain and that the last time they tried to adjust her pain medication to deal with the increase in pain she lapsed into a coma so they cannot do that anymore. Marie’s ability to swallow is getting worse, making it increasingly difficult for her to eat. Tom said that Marie wants to live and that she has a lot of reasons to live, but her ability to eat may deteriorate and Marie has said she is adamant she will not use artificial feeding. In that case, under the current legislation Marie Fleming would starve to death. I asked Tom this morning what question Marie would put to the Tánaiste and to all of us in the Oireachtas. He told me that she would ask us the following: “Come and live my life for 24 hours and see if you think helping me to die should be a crime. Come and spend 24 hours in my house and see what you think.” He said Marie would ask for all of us to protect her family, that she would ask us in the Oireachtas to change the law so that she could die on her own terms without the threat of Tom Curran spending 14 years in prison.</p>
          <p eId="para_460"> When I raised the matter with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, earlier this year he told me that the Government would not consider changing the law as he is obliged to have regard to the wider public interest. My question is a very simple one. Does the Tánaiste believe that Tom Curran, Marie’s partner, should face the threat, as is the case under current legislation, of 14 years in prison for assisting Marie to die if she so chooses in the future?</p>

          <p eId="para_461">First, I am conscious that there is a case currently before the courts on what is known as assisted suicide. Deputy Donnelly will appreciate that while the case is before the courts I cannot comment on it nor should any Member of the House. Perhaps it is best that the case would conclude before we as legislators have a discussion on assisted suicide.</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> I met with Tom Curran after the Marie Fleming case. Deputy Donnelly asked me a straight question. It is my view that as legislators we should address the issue in the House. It is a difficult issue. I have enormous sympathy for the situation in which Tom and Marie find themselves. There is no simple answer. When we come to look at the matter in terms of legislation it will not be a simple, straightforward issue. There is a range of ethical, legal and other issues associated with this topic. We should address the topic collectively as legislators. It should not be a Government and Opposition type of issue. We should address it first as human beings and then as legislators. We should approach it by putting ourselves in the situation that Tom and Marie are in.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">We should address it very honestly. One must consider what is opened up if what is now known as assisted suicide is legislated for. These are obviously some of the considerations. They are considerations on which the Minister for Justice and Equality and his Department will inevitably seek legal advice. This is a matter we need to address. I suggest that once the present court case is over, we should find a way collectively, perhaps through one of the Oireachtas committees, of having the issue dealt with in a non-partisan way. The issue requires to be dealt with legislatively. We have seen the Supreme Court judgment and I read it at the time I met Tom. The straight answer to Deputy Donnelly's question is that I do believe we should deal with this as legislators.</p>

          <p eId="para_464">I agree with virtually everything the Tánaiste said. It is a complex issue that the Oireachtas needs to address. The Tánaiste is very familiar with the case and will know, therefore, that both Tom and Marie have asked that guidelines, issued by the DPP, be put in place, probably with legislative backup from the Oireachtas. The DPP could provide guidance on what is considered a qualifying case where a penalty would not apply. The UK DPP has such guidelines already in place. We need them here very quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> I agree that we cannot talk about the current case. However, we should be able to debate this subject while the case is proceeding. We have no idea how long it will take. It is the first case of its kind in the country and could take a very long time. I and, I am sure, the Tánaiste would hate to have to meet anyone in Tom Curran's circumstances to explain we were not able to change the law in time.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> As a reasonable input to any Oireachtas debate, an expert report might be very useful. It seems an expert report could be produced quickly and in a way that would not interfere with the current case before the courts. I ask the Tánaiste to consider commissioning an expert report, to be concluded reasonably quickly, that we in the Oireachtas could use to inform our debate on changing the legislation on this matter as soon as possible.</p>

I question the practice of introducing serious legislation on a Thursday while making it convenient for Members not to be present. If we are introducing serious legislation such as that to be considered - I will not discuss the content - and a vote is necessary, we should not postpone that vote for four or five days to suit Government Members who choose to be present the following Tuesday. Although they want legislation to be discussed in the House tonight, they do not want to be present to vote on it if there is a division. We are downgrading the Dáil and demeaning the debate tonight. If legislation is to be voted on in the future, I ask that the Chamber vote on it at the end of the debate rather than five days later.</p>

          <p eId="para_476">With regard to the restorative justice Bill and given the comments yesterday of the Attorney General for Northern Ireland, Mr. John Larkin, can the Tánaiste commit today that there will not be any legislation introduced in the Oireachtas to prevent families of those people killed in the North from having the opportunity to secure justice? The Tánaiste will be aware that UK Prime Minister David Cameron said yesterday that he gave a commitment on this matter in the House of Commons. I ask the Tánaiste to do the same today. We all know there can be no price put on justice. The idea of a cost-saving measure worth up to €190 million is particularly callous. I want the commitment.</p>

          <p eId="para_479">The Government has no plans to introduce legislation that would prevent victims or their families from seeking justice arising from the Troubles in Northern Ireland. There is an agreement on these matters. There is an agreement on pre-1998 offences, which is part of the Good Friday Agreement. It provides for prosecution, conviction and for reduced sentences. We have no plans to depart from that. The whole issue of dealing with the past and the issues that arise from it is now the subject of an all-party discussion in Northern Ireland chaired by Dr. Richard Haass and we support that process. </p>

          <p eId="para_481">The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney has advocated, as part of his Food Harvest 2020 plans, the development of the aquaculture industry in Ireland. However, there is a difficulty at present with the licence application process, which is not time limited. This means that those objecting and the companies seeking to develop their industry do not know where they stand. I ask the Tánaiste to clarify whether the Government has any plans to amend legislation to deal with the fact that the licensing process is not time-limited and there is no deadline for the processing of applications.</p>
          <p eId="para_482"> The Tánaiste is aware that in recent years concern has been expressed, at times, about decisions of the Judiciary, particularly with regard to sex attacks and child pornography. The Government has expressed an interest in the development of a sentencing council, similar to what is in place in England and Wales, with clear sentencing guidelines for the Judiciary. Does the Government have any plans to introduce legislation in this area?</p>

To go back to the Tánaiste's previously expressed policies, is the Government considering embarking on a major and significant social housing programme?

          <p eId="para_509">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_510">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to permit medical treatment leading to termination of pregnancy in situations where the foetus has a fatal abnormality such that it is incompatible with life outside of the womb.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">The Bill provides for the termination in Ireland of a pregnancy where the foetus has a condition such that it is incompatible with life outside the womb. This issue has probably affected every Deputy and the Minister for Justice and Equality has described it as "an intolerable cruelty". The legislation is motivated by my desire to have something done about the matter. It affects, in the main, women and families who are dealing with much wanted pregnancies and experience a devastating diagnosis that the foetus will not survive. Dealing with that grief is compounded by the body blow of then being forced to leave the country for a termination. They are not given adequate information and the information that is provided is handed over in a climate of secrecy. They also are not allowed to bring the remains of the foetus back. They can sometimes be posted back. I have heard stories of people bringing them back in the boot of a car. This issue has correctly been taken up at the United Nations as a human rights violation and as inhumane and degrading treatment. That is happening now. Large numbers of people in Ireland experience this every year. One Liverpool hospital has made a special arrangement because of the numbers involved. More than 90% of Irish people believe a pregnancy should be terminated in these circumstances and the only argument against it is the unpublished opinion of the Attorney General whom we are told says it would be unconstitutional. Other opinions written by eminent legal people and a former Attorney General disagree with that view. The only way to resolve the conflict is to introduce legislation and have the Supreme Court adjudicate on it. </p>
          <p eId="para_512"> The previous Attorney General made the argument I am making in the case of D <i>v</i>. Ireland before the European Court of Human Rights. The court found that there was at least a tenable argument which should be seriously considered by the domestic courts to the effect that the foetus was not an unborn for the purposes of Article 40.3.3° or that even if it was, its right to life was not engaged as it had no prospect of life outside the womb. The State, therefore, has previously argued that it would be constitutional to legislate in this circumstance.</p>
          <p eId="para_513"> The Minister for Justice and Equality, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Alex White, and other Ministers have stated publicly that they believe this issue should be addressed. It will not be addressed in the Government's lifetime, unless we move legislation, bring it to the Supreme Court for adjudication and end the misery for these families in order that, as they put it so well themselves, they can deal with it as a normal tragedy without the added burden of having travel out of the country in secrecy and so on.</p>

          <p eId="para_715">I move amendment No. 7:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_716">In page 13, line 15, after “shall” to insert “facilitate and”.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">It was suggested that the insertion of "facilitate" into subsection (8) would bring clarity to the role of the agency. I said on Committee Stage that I felt the word "promote" adequately dealt with this issue and that it would include facilitating, but I have reflected on it further and I am proposing to insert "facilitate" into subsection (8). The effect of the proposed amendment is to bring absolute clarity to the precise role of the agency in respect of inter-agency co-operation. This is a serious obligation, which derives from my view - shared by most of those working in the field - that it is only with the co-operation of other agencies that real change and improvements can come about. There have been significant problems with inter-agency work, sharing of information and co-operation, and it is an implementation challenge for everybody involved in the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_718"> Under section 8(8), it will be a requirement of the agency to facilitate and promote enhanced inter-agency co-operation to ensure that services for children and families are co-ordinated, and to provide an integrated response to the needs of children and families. The agency will also be obliged, under section 8(6), to co-operate with any person or body that the agency considers appropriate in any matter connected with the agency's functions, which are outlined in section 8.</p>
          <p eId="para_719"> I believe these provisions in the Bill will give a good basis for ensuring that the services of the various agencies and Departments working with child and family supports operate in a single, unified fashion. We have seen from a number of reports, especially the child death report and the most recent report published two weeks ago on this issue by Dr. Helen Buckley, that this an ongoing issue. There are often quite a number of organisations and professionals working with families, and we want to ensure that there is proper assessment, proper intervention and really good-quality inter-agency work, that people are not working in silos and that they share information and make the best decisions for children. I believe these provisions will support that, because they make the system work in a singular, unified fashion in the interests of children.</p>
          <p eId="para_720"> My Department is leading an initiative to develop a planning model for local inter-agency activities to improve outcomes for children.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">The purpose of this initiative is to work towards better developmental outcomes for children through more effective integration of our policies and services, particularly through the children's services committees at local level. The local children's services are operating in 16 parts of the country and we can see this is the model we should use.</p>
          <p eId="para_722"> The children's services committees bring together a diverse group of agencies in local county areas to engage in joint planning of services for children. This includes representatives of all the local relevant organisations we have, such as Barnardos, the local HSE - now the child and family agency, local authorities, the Garda Síochána, the VEC and local schools. This ensures there is coherent, inter-agency work which brings together resources in a local area so that everybody knows what the other organisation is doing, which was far from the case before. This is a very good model to ensure the provision in the legislation is implemented at local level.</p>
          <p eId="para_723"> Amendment No. 8 proposes to insert a reference to "intra-agency", and is concerned with the development of processes between the formerly separate agencies to respond to weakness. Subsection 8(<i>a</i>) shows that no one agency can do this alone. As Deputy Ó Caoláin suggests, the introduction of the word "intra-agency" introduces a different concept - that we need a specific provision for effective operation of the agencies that are being brought together under the roof of the child and family agency. That intra-agency work is integral to the work of the agency because the agency must use the resources available to it in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner. The rationale for bringing together the family support agency, the education welfare service and child protection is to ensure that we get that intra-agency co-operation in the new agency. That concept is well covered in the establishment, governance and performance aspects of this Bill. The bringing together under the roof of the agency of these three services is to ensure that integration of services occurs. It does not need to be spelled out in the way the Deputy's amendment suggests.</p>

          <p eId="para_724">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the breathing time to allow me to return with my files. I am attending Committee Stage of another piece of legislation at the same time, although I have to be here for Report Stage of this very important legislation. The scheduling of the Joint Committee on Health and Children is most inconsiderate of Members who are trying to cover both. I support the Minister's amendment, No. 7. My colleague, Deputy Robert Troy, raised this matter on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_725"> On my amendment No. 8, "inter-agency" refers to work across different agencies, while "intra-agency" refers to work within the new body. It is very important to recognise the coming together of the various disciplines and the professional expertise that the three essential component parts of the new agency represent. There should be a reference to the level of co-operation, co-ordination and cohesion we expect under the new agency's remit. The reference to "intra-agency" enhances that expectation and its referencing here is not to suggest that we expect anything but the fullest co-operation and co-ordination of the approach of all disciplines and professional expertise.</p>
          <p eId="para_726"> With my amendment, section 8(8) would read, "The Agency shall promote enhanced inter-agency and intra-agency cooperation to ensure that services for children are co-ordinated and provide an integrated response." We have spoken about this on Committee Stage. That is the basis of my argument. We are listening to the same mantra again. Everything is understood, implied or reflected elsewhere. It does no harm to clarify our expectations and the level of co-operation we expect in the internal workings of the new agency, given the diverse component parts. It is no less than we would expect and it is a good thing to affirm it in the legislation at this point.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrancesFitzgerald" eId="spk_255" as="#Minister_for_Children_and_Youth_Affairs">

          <p eId="para_727">Section 50(2) provides that the first code of governance will include details of the methods to be used to bring about the integration of the governance systems deriving from a transfer of functions to the agency from the HSE and the other dissolved bodies. This subsection spells out the code governance that will apply to ensure we achieve integration of the three agencies that are becoming one in the Child and Family Agency Bill. It is well covered there.</p>
          <p eId="para_728"> Sometimes there is a problem in repeating what is already understood. The last amendment on which the Deputy called a vote undermines the equal status legislation by suggesting it does not have general applicability, which it does. To seek to put it into legislation again undermines that applicability because it is understood that if legislation is in place already it has applicability - for example, to this new agency. Likewise, this issue is dealt with, and it is understood that as the three agencies are becoming one, they must work together and a code of governance must be worked out for the integration of the different governance systems. That is the intra-agency work that is being done in a practical way under that governance structure.</p>
          <p eId="para_729"> I have reviewed the submissions that have come in and have approached this legislation in a co-operative manner. The amendments I have introduced have taken account of the range of issues raised by the Opposition and NGOs in this area. For example, the amendment I introduced on preventative family services is a key amendment to make it absolutely clear that early intervention and family support is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> When I examined the submissions in this area, I noted that people were concerned about the sharing of professional information. That was the key point behind the discussion about the term "intra-agency". As the Deputy is aware, there are very important principles with regard to sharing information with other professionals and there are principles and rights with regard to the privacy of data. Issues are arising to do with the sharing of data such as professional therapeutic notes, which will be dealt with in other legislation. The language we have used on inter-agency work covers a lot, and the intra-agency aspect is also covered by the performance part of the legislation and the governance aspects.</p>

          <p eId="para_731">To incorporate a reference to "intra-agency" is not repetition. The Minister refers to its being implied elsewhere. To put it into words is not to repeat it; far from it. I disagree with the Minister's view that the amendment I pressed earlier this morning would in any way have had a negative impact on the Bill and the agency's remit. Far from it. One could look at any of the agency's functions outlined in section 8 and ask why it is necessary to suggest that the agency should use the resources available to it in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">We could hardly expect it to do anything else, but the provision is there. I could parse any or all of the other provisions and say the same should apply. </p>
          <p eId="para_733"> It is important we affirm specific standards we expect to be adhered to. In the area of equality and non-discrimination, I make no apology for pressing amendment No. 8 in my name. I have put the case in this instance and it is the position of the Minister to accept or reject it.</p>

          <p eId="para_737">I move amendment No. 9:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_738"> In page 13, to delete lines 28 to 30 and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_739"><b>“9. </b>(1) The Agency shall, in performing its functions under <i>section 8(1)(a)</i>, <i>(b) </i>or <i>(c) </i>in respect of an individual child or family, regard the best interests of the child as a primary consideration.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">This amendment seeks to delete lines 28 to 30 and to substitute them with a new section 9(1). This is concerned with the views and best interests of the child. The legislation states: "The Agency shall, when making decisions in relation to the performance of its functions under <i>section 8(1)(a)</i>, <i>(b) </i>or <i>(c), </i> have regard to the best interests of the child in all matters." I believe the term "have regard to" is too weak. This section also fails to properly affirm the standards that have been set internationally in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. It is not enough to reference section 9(2) when talking about paramount consideration. I will come to that later because amendment No. 11 refers to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_741"> We should be very clear in section 9(1) and should not accept standards that fall short of the UN convention's construction. This provision is a weaker position. We need to affirm in section 9(1) that the best interests of the child shall be a "primary consideration". I argue this strongly because I believe section 9(1) should read: "The Agency shall, in performing its functions under <i>section 8(1)(a)</i>, <i>(b) </i>or <i>(c) </i>in respect of an individual child or family, regard the best interests of the child as a primary consideration.”. No other standard is acceptable. The provision in the Bill as it stands is: "have regard to the best interests of the child in all matters". The term "have regard to" is similar to "take into account" and does not place the provision in any particular hierarchy of responsibility. It is important we make it abundantly clear that consideration of the child's interests must be seen as a primary consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_742"> The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child states: "In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration." The amendment I have submitted seeks to strengthen section 9(1) by adopting the UN convention standard, which I believe we should adopt. The use of the terms "primary consideration" in section 9(1) and "paramount consideration" in section 9(2) are not self exclusive and are not in combat with each other.</p>
          <p eId="para_743"> I hope the Minister has given further consideration to this section and that she accepts that the substitution I wish to make in the Bill makes it abundantly clear that the best interests of the child, being the most important consideration, must be the primary consideration. Accordingly, I commend the amendment to her.</p>

        <speech by="#FrancesFitzgerald" eId="spk_260" as="#Minister_for_Children_and_Youth_Affairs">
          <from>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald<recordedTime time="2013-11-21T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_744">The Deputy referred previously to the recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children and their rights. These have been given substantial legal scrutiny since February 2010 and in as far as we could, the recommendations were contained in the Thirty-First Amendment of the Constitution (Children) Bill 2012 passed by the House. The amendment on the rights of the child, while substantial in effect, recognised the need to identify clearly situations where a child's interests must be paramount. That is reflected in section 9(2) of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_745"> My concerns about moving beyond the current text of the Bill are as follows. The section as drafted is not limited to the performance of functions in respect of an individual child. It is broader and seeks to ensure that at every level of decision making, the best interests lens must be applied. I want to and believe it is important to retain that breadth in the legislation. The scope of the proposed amendment includes a range of services where a specific child might not be the primary subject of the service provided. The effects of the application of the best interest principle in such a scenario is not clear. For example, some of the work of the agency may not be directly child related. It may relate to domestic or sexual violence, although there could be a child involved. Other work, such as marriage guidance counselling, may not involve a child. Therefore, to insert the proposed amendment would not accord with the balance to be struck between these rights and the rights of others, including those deriving from the Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_746"> In terms of the breadth and scope of services, my understanding of the likely legal interpretation of a "primary" consideration is a heavy weighting in favour of the best interest of one individual child. I do not accept that the agency, in making decisions relating to the breadth of its functions, could or should be given such a mandate, which would require a degree of interpretation without guidance in statute law as to what other primary interests there might be and how they would be balanced. Such interpretations are within the scope of judicial function and could not reasonably be expected to be balanced and assessed by every front line worker in every situation. However, what we have done in the Bill is to make clear that the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration should guide every front line worker.</p>
          <p eId="para_747"> I am satisfied with the section as published and believe it is reasonable and possible to ensure that the best interests are considered and that the decision making within the agency has a statutory underpinning for a child centred approach. In section 9(2) of the Bill, for example, the issue of paramountcy is acknowledged and restated. It provides that in the performance of its function in respect of an individual child under the Child Care Act 1991 or the Adoption Act 2010, the agency shall regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration. This could not be stronger and it reiterates the child centred approach in matters of welfare and protection where there is a distinction to be made. It is appropriate that where a child's welfare or protection is being considered, the best interests of the child would be the paramount consideration. This is an appropriate and proportional provision that can be given real effect in the new agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> With regard to amendment No. 11, both the Child Care Act 1991 and the Adoption Act 2010 already require the best interest principle to be upheld by the agency. Section 3 of the Child Care Act is explicit in this regard, with respect to the application of "best interests". It covers any action of the agency in the context of fulfilling its functions under the Act. This includes arrangements in respect of the adoption of a child, in section 6. The consideration of best interest in court related proceedings is a matter for the relevant court or relevant decision making body. Section 24 of the Child Care Act states that in any proceedings before a court under the Act in regard to the care and protection of a child, the court, having regard to the rights and duties of parents, whether under the Constitution or otherwise, shall (<i>a</i>) regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">Section 19 of the Adoption Act states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_750">In any matter, application or proceedings before—</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_751">(<i>a</i>) the Authority, or</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_752">(<i>b</i>) any court,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_753">relating to the question of the arrangements for the adoption of a child, for the making of an adoption order or for the recognition of an intercountry adoption outside the State, the Authority or the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">I am satisfied the provision I have made in section 9 will have the intended effect of creating a child-centred approach to decision making, while restating the specific requirements for paramountcy in certain specified processes. These are all with regard to the welfare and protection of the child. Where there is any question about a child's welfare, we have the paramountcy principle. It is included in existing legislation and it is very clear that it applies. It is not necessary to restate in the Bill the provisions on proceedings before a court or the Adoption Authority. I will not accept amendments Nos. 9 to 11, inclusive.</p>

          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin<recordedTime time="2013-11-21T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_755">With regard to the Minister's response on amendment No. 9, let us be very clear about what the Bill states: "having regard to the best interests of the child in all matters". It makes no real statement on how the child's interests are to be regarded. It does not make this clear. That is why I believe the introduction of the words "primary consideration" is necessary to give absolute clarity to what it is we expect. What is before us, "having regard to the best interests of the child in all matters", falls far short of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child where it particularly states this must be at all times a primary consideration. It is hugely important that we indicate exactly how the best interests of the child are to be not only evaluated but, most importantly, also adhered to and the words "having regard to" simply fall far short. It is no good repeating that it is understood, implicit or suggested. These are the functions of the agency. No other brief or term of reference for the new agency should be clearer than the best interests of the child. It is absolutely essential that we accept the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_756"> Amendment No. 11 seeks to insert in section 9(2) after the reference to the Child Care Act 1991 and the Adoption Act 2010 "whether in proceedings before a court or otherwise". This is very important because it is open to interpretation from the construction of section 9(2) that this is only with regard to a court scenario. We need to be very clear that it would be applicable in every scenario with regard to the new agency's functions under the Child Care Act 1991 or the Adoption Act 2010, whether in proceedings before a court or otherwise. There are other settings where issues pertinent to each of these and the child's interests will be evaluated. The amendment proposed to section 9(1) is essential. The best interests of the child must be a primary consideration. The clarification on section 9(2), with the addition proposed in amendment No. 11, should also be accepted.</p>

          <p eId="para_757">I support the amendments. I acknowledge the Minister's comments and her view, but the clarity which would be brought by the insertion of the word "primary" to make it clear the best interests of the child must be the primary consideration would strengthen the legislation. On this basis I urge the Minister to support the amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_758">Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin did a lot of work at the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children. In its report the committee endorsed the fundamental principle of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, as identified by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, which states the best interests of children are a primary consideration in all actions considering children. The point I am making is that the principle of paramountcy is built into every action where the agency will be involved in the care and protection of children, but there are functions of the agency where a child may not be involved and, therefore, to accept the amendments would not be appropriate because there will be functions of the agency where there may not be children involved. If I were to accept the amendments, it would mean paramountcy would apply in these situations, which would be inappropriate. Every time a decision is taken on the protection and welfare of a child, as the Child Care Act and Adoption Act suggest, the best interests of the child will be the paramount consideration. For these reasons, I will not accept the amendments.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_264">
          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin<recordedTime time="2013-11-21T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_759">This is in reference to the functions in section 8(1)(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>). Section 8(1)(<i>a</i>) concerns the performance of the functions, powers and responsibilities transferred to the new agency under section 72 from the National Educational Welfare Board which are relevant to children and section 82 which deals with the HSE. Again, the focus is on children in the main. Section 8(1)(<i>b</i>) concerns the development, welfare and protection of children, while section 8(1)(<i>c</i>) concerns supporting and encouraging the effective functioning of families. Families have children at their heart. This is not about a husband and a wife with no children; it is about families and children. Children are at the core of each of the component parts. We all understand and accept the Minister's argument that there are other responsibilities, but the amendment clearly states the child will be at the heart of the agency in performing its functions under section 8(1)(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) in respect of an individual child or family.</p>
          <p eId="para_760"> Regarding the best interests of the child as a primary consideration is exactly what we require and we should not be afraid to affirm it. We should not be afraid to embrace the highest standards accepted, endorsed and promoted by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. It is imperative that we reach the highest standards attainable, which is why I am seeking to ensure this particular section properly affirms this principle in the best interests of children. There is no other interest in my consideration in putting forward this argument. Again, I refer to amendment No.11; adding the words "whether in proceedings before a court or otherwise" would clarify that we were not only looking at proceedings in courtroom settings.</p>

          <p eId="para_870">I move amendment No. 12:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_871">In page 13, to delete lines 35 to 40, and in page 14, to delete lines 1 and 2 and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_872">“(3) The Agency shall consult when planning and reviewing the provision of services in connection with the performance of functions under <i>section 8(1)(a)</i>, <i>(b) </i>or <i>(c) </i>where relevant, and ensure that due consideration is given to the views of children as part of any consultation processes undertaken.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_873"> (4) The Agency shall, in performing its functions in respect of an individual child under <i>section 8 </i>ensure that the views of that individual child, where that child is capable of forming his or her own views, be ascertained and given due weight with regard to the age and maturity of the child.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_874"> There are critical differences between what is contained in the Bill, as amended on Committee Stage, and what I seek in the amendment. Section 9(3) of the Bill states: "The Agency shall, when planning and reviewing the provision of services in connection with the performance of functions under <i>section 8(1)(a)</i>, <i>(b) </i>or <i>(c)</i>, ensure that consideration is given to the views of children." I believe the words "due consideration" should be included. With regard to "consideration", I make the same argument as I made in respect of "best interests". The words "due consideration" are more clear as to what is intended - that is, that due consideration be given to the views of children as part of any consultation processes undertaken. That is not confirmed in section 9(3). It is very important to confirm that any consultation processes undertaken regarding children's interests must give due consideration to the views of children.</p>
          <p eId="para_875"> In the second part of the amendment I seek to supplement section 9(4) with the following: "The Agency shall, in performing its functions in respect of an individual child under <i>section 8 </i>ensure that the views of that individual child, where that child is capable of forming his or her own views, be ascertained and given due weight with regard to the age and maturity of the child.” The critical difference here is where the language in the Bill states, "where that child is capable of forming and expressing his or her own views". The use of the word "expressing" suggests a capacity to give one's view orally. There are many ways in which a child, indeed any of us, can communicate. I have a brother who cannot orally communicate. I have known it all my life but in most instances I know exactly how he feels about given matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_876"> It is important that we do not confine ourselves in the legislation to the ability of the child to form and to express his or her view, as the current wording suggests. On the contrary, every effort must be made to ascertain the views of the child where the latter has the capacity to form a view. That is not expressly provided for in the Bill, and it is deficient in that regard. I am not just speaking from my own personal experience; the information provided by a range of voices from the non-governmental sector clearly shows there is a wealth of experience in this area throughout the country. My objective in this amendment is to ensure that where a child is capable of forming his or her own views, every effort is employed to ascertain those views and give them due consideration. That is where my proposed subsections (3) and (4) come together.</p>
          <p eId="para_877"> I hope the Minister, having heard my case in regard to this amendment on Committee Stage, has given it further consideration and will offer me the welcome news that she is accepting it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrancesFitzgerald" eId="spk_267" as="#Minister_for_Children_and_Youth_Affairs">
          <from>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald<recordedTime time="2013-11-21T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_878">I am sure the Deputy will agree that the section as drafted makes the child's voice a central factor in decision making and the proofing of decisions. It breaks new ground to have it expressly articulated in legislation that consideration will be given to the views of children in planning and reviewing the provision of services under the new structure. It is there in black and white in the Bill. Moreover, having accepted on Committee Stage that the original wording was a little too limiting, I have broadened it out. I also made sure that the provisions that are relevant to the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 are now included in this section. That is particularly important given the many issues that arise in schools in respect of which the views of the child should be paramount. It is a strong provision which breaks new ground in making absolutely clear that the views of the child must be sought and considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_879"> When decisions are being made in regard to children a great deal of evidence will be gathered by a range of methods, including from client feedback in sessions with the parents and with the child, from the various audits that are done, via the complaints mechanisms and through the guardian <i>ad litem</i> service when children are before the courts. In addition, the reviews conducted by the Health Information and Quality Authority involve interviews with individual children. As part of its review of the child protection services, the authority is issuing a series of reports at regular intervals. Those reports show that there is a greater improvement in the delivery of services in some areas while there is work still to be done in others. We are also having a great deal more consultation with children and groups of young people, as referenced by the work of EPIC with children in care. A whole new approach is being adopted throughout the services which puts children's voices at the centre. This Bill provides a legislative base, which was not previously in place, for that type of consultation. In many respects, the practice had gone ahead of the legislation in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_880"> My concern in regard to the Deputy's amendment is that it might serve to paralyse some aspects of decision making. I am confident that what is in the Bill is strong enough. His amendment does include the phrase "where relevant", which might help to avoid an overly expansive interpretation of the section. However, without guidance being built into the legislation as to what is defined as relevant in this context, the effect of the provision would be unclear. The section as drafted makes the child's voice central to the proofing of decision making and, as such, it breaks new ground. Were I to accept the new subsection 9(4) as proposed in the Deputy's amendment, it would broaden the provision enormously. The way in which the section has been drafted will ensure children's voices are recognised as being central to decision making under the new agency. As I said, the practice has already gone in that direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_881"> I am satisfied that the importance of facilitating the expression of the views of the child is catered for in the legislation and that children will, in practice, be heard. I am very aware that the expression of views, as the Deputy outlined from personal experience, is not always a verbal process. There are many methods of enlisting the views of children, including through play, art and observation. That will be part and parcel of the way the agency seeks to arrive at the views of the child in a way that is respectful of how they communicate. Therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_882">I acknowledge that the Bill contains huge steps forward in terms of the best interests and views of the child. My efforts to improve the Bill, as I see it, do not take away from that fact. Indeed, I have already indicated my intention to support the final passage of the Bill. That remains my position. My objective is to arrive at the best possible legislation to cater for the needs of children into the future. I am strongly of the view that the inclusion of the reference to due consideration being given to the views of the child in the context of any consultation processes undertaken is the appropriate way to construct subsection 9(3). It broadens out the application of subsection 9(4) by deleting the specific references to the legislation as contained in the existing subsection (4). The point is that the views of the child should be taken into account across the board in all matters pertaining to his or her interest. That should apply in all circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_883"> I reiterate the point about the ability of the child to form and express a view. In most situations children are capable of forming a view and can, through a variety of means, give expression to that view. Expressing is understood in terms of verbal communication, but there are a whole variety of ways and means by which the child's views can be ascertained and that should be given due weight, with regard to their age and maturity. My objective in presenting this amendment is to improve what the Minister has presented. I do so for the obvious reasons, as I have explained, and for the very best reasons, as I have approached each of the amendments I have presented.</p>

          <p eId="para_884">I totally accept the Deputy's bona fides in this matter and am very grateful for his unequivocal support for the passage of this legislation and for the concept of bringing the different services together to work under the remit of the new child and family agency. I have considered his amendment carefully. From the very beginning of this process, I have taken the views of Deputies opposite on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">Some of the amendments I introduced were amendments I know Deputies Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin and Robert Troy were supportive of and wished to see made to the Bill, as did the NGO sector. The Bill has been strengthened by the inclusion of these provisions. The way we have drafted the legislation is ground-breaking and will ensure the views of the child will be part and parcel of the work of the agency. The legislation lays down that they must be an integral part of the work of the agency when decisions are being made. It is a strong and ground-breaking provision and will do the job it is intended to do, which is to ensure the views of young people are heard when decisions are being made about them.</p>

          <p eId="para_890">I move amendment No. 13:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_891">In page 15, line 34, to delete “the Minister for Education and Skills” and substitute “any Minister”.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">This amendment relates to section 13(2)(<i>f</i>) which reads: "other particulars that the Agency considers appropriate or as the Minister after consulting the Minister for Health and the Minister for Education and Skills may require, and". Again, I do not understand why we need to confine this measure to the named Ministers. I understand the reason for the inclusion of the Minister for Health and can see its direct application. However, we should substitute the words “Education and Skills” with “any Minister”. This would not exclude the Minister for Education and Skills, but it would ensure that, as appropriate and where necessary, the agency could consult other Ministers. I recall instancing a number of portfolios to the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, on Committee Stage where the interests of children would reflect on the work of the agency. We should be more open to providing for instances we can second guess and, more importantly, those we cannot even foresee at this time. We should not limit the provision to specified Departments. We should not exclude any Department. In changing the reference to the Minister for Education and Skills we would not exclude that Department or ministry but include it and others. I put the case to the Minister. I know the amendment is linked with a later amendment in the same vein.</p>

          <from>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Deputy Frances Fitzgerald)<recordedTime time="2013-11-21T14:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_893">Section 13(2)(<i>f</i>) is intended to focus on the special and unique relationships between the service delivery systems in the education and health areas and the effective functioning of the Child and Family Agency. Services within the remit of the Departments of Health and Education and Skills obviously have to work in tandem with the agency and may depend on one another. That is why the focus is on the particular relationship between the agency and other bodies. The services are being taken from under the umbrella of the HSE, but there is ongoing contact with, for example, public health nurses and the CAMHS. The task force recommended that aspects of the public health nursing service and the CAMHS ought to be under the agency. While that is not happening at this stage of development of the agency, we already have 4,000 staff transferring and it is intended that these staff will move across once the legislation has been completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_894"> There is a particular relationship between the Department of Health and the new agency, about which there is no question. We also have the National Educational Welfare Board moving in under the aegis of the agency to work in a very specific way on the issues affecting children in the education system. That is why both ministries are named in terms of the preparation involved. This is about the annual report. It is stating the agency, like all agencies, will prepare an annual report and that it shall comment on what happened in the previous year. It outlines what should be included in the annual report and inserts a provision that "An annual report shall include ... other particulars that the Agency considers appropriate or as the Minister after consulting the Minister for Health and the Minister for Education and Skills may require". That is simply to reflect the particular relationship between these two ministries, but, of course, it does not in any way preclude the agency in preparing the annual report from taking into account the various consultations in the preceding year, perhaps with other Departments, with some of which being more relevant than others. I will be consulting colleagues on an ongoing basis in terms of general Cabinet business and business related to the work of the agency. I will be preparing memos on any legislation I bring forward and it is mandatory, as the Deputy knows, to get the views of every Department on legislation. Therefore, there is already a mechanism in place for every Department to be involved in the legislative programme of the Department. That is standard practice. It is also standard practice to engage across ministries on an ongoing basis on elements of work being undertaken.</p>
          <p eId="para_895"> This amendment and amendment No. 15 particularly point to the strategic functions and close relationship of the Departments of Health and Education and Skills. It is important to focus on that relationship which does not have to be diluted by saying one has to consult "all Ministers" before one can prepare the annual report. There is more of a strategic relationship with these two Departments. One only has to look at the different bodies coming together in the agency to appreciate this, which is the reason they are mentioned. It is understood work will be done with different Departments from time to time and I have no doubt that this work will be reflected in the annual report of the agency. However, I do not believe it is necessary to build into the legislation that before the annual report is produced there has to be consultation with all Ministers.</p>

          <p eId="para_896">That is not what I was proposing. I am certainly not trying to straitjacket people into doing other than what they need to do. The annual report is meant to reflect on the work done in the preceding year. I anticipate that, in the course of any year, the agency will find itself engaging with a number of ministries, including the Departments of Social Protection, Justice and Equality and any number of others. My own sense is that it is particularly prescriptive. Make no mistake about it, the entirety of the National Educational Welfare Board is moving within the remit of the new agency, which is why I said I understood the reference to the Department of Health.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">The issues that arise are not only those related to public health nurses which the Minister highlighted but also other issues, as yet unresolved, pertaining to some other disciplines under the aegis of that Department. The Minister is of the view that the current wording does not impose a straitjacket or limit the agency to consulting only the two Ministries in question. I have tabled the amendment because I believe it may do so. My proposal is eminently sensible. </p>

          <p eId="para_898">I move amendment No. 14:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_899">In page 18, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_900">"(5) The Board shall always include three individuals with experience or knowledge of the legal environment as it pertains to children and families; the disciplines of child protection, psychology, family support and therapeutic services.".</p>
          <p eId="para_901">I am particularly anxious, as I have been throughout our consideration of this legislation and for a long time prior to its publication, about some of the services that will transfer from the Department of Health to the Child and Family Agency. I refer, in particular, to the family resource centres. I have expressed my concerns to the Minister on many occasions. I have also met representatives of the Family Resource Centre National Forum, as has the Minister. While the forum is supportive of what is taking place, it also has a number of understandable concerns. It is essential that this legislation which prepares the ground for the new Child and Family Agency provide the assurance family resource centres and others require, particularly in respect of the focus on family and family supports. The composition of the board of the new agency will be crucial in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_902"> I understand the position taken by the Minister in focusing on having expertise on the board, rather than representatives of the various sectors which come within the new agency's remit. I accept also that there is significant experience among those she has already appointed to the board, including the chairperson, Ms Norah Gibbons, whom I hold in high regard. </p>
          <p eId="para_903"> The purpose of the amendment is to ensure the Minister and her successors will ensure there will be, at all times, at least three members of the board "with experience or knowledge of the legal environment as it pertains to children and families". The family aspect is very important in this regard. The decision to drop the word "Support" from the title of the new agency caused significant and understandable concern. It is very important, therefore, that we affirm by every means available to us that the new agency will honour and stand over the responsibilities that have heretofore resided with the Family Support Agency, in particular, with regard to family resource centres. </p>
          <p eId="para_904"> I encourage the Minister to accept the amendment. It is all very well for her to take the view that she is doing this with good reason, but she is also setting down a marker for those who will succeed her. We want the same consideration to be shown by her successors. For this reason, I want the disciplines of child protection, psychology, therapeutic services and family support referenced in the legislation and reflected in the composition of the board and the knowledge and experience of those whom the Minister will appoint. </p>

          <p eId="para_905">The Deputy is aware of my view on this issue. The amendment is excessively prescriptive and could create inflexibility. I have observed such inflexibility on other boards where specific qualifications are prescribed for members. When appointing members to the board of the new agency, we must consider the broad range of skills and specific skills needed. Such flexibility must be available to the Minister in appointing the board of an organisation with 4,000 staff and a budget of close to €600 million. He or she must ensure the board has the correct mix of expertise at all times and this mix must include individuals with a good grounding in child protection and others with skills in strategic management, human resources and corporate governance.</p>
          <p eId="para_906"> The problems that arise with boards appointed in a highly representative manner, if one likes, is that the broader remit of the agency is lost somewhere along the line. It is to avoid such a scenario that I have left the appointments process open and flexible. This is the correct approach if we are to secure the proper mix of expertise required to run an agency of this nature. The Deputy will note from the individuals I have appointed to the board that I have sought a mix of experience in a range of areas central to the effective functioning of the board and the new agency. I introduced an amendment to clarify the issue of family support. There is no question that family support has been in any way excluded. It is, as stated in the text, central to the agency and many of the members of the board have a background in social work and family support services. However, we also have a mix of people who understand the governance of large organisations, human resource functions and so forth. That is the mix we need. As I stated, rather than specify qualifications, I have taken the view that the approach provided for is the best way to obtain the mix of personnel and experience that we need to have the board function effectively.</p>

          <p eId="para_907">When the Minister and I met recently to discuss Report Stage, I requested, among other things, biographies of those who had been appointed to the board. As I have not yet received that information, I am not privy to all of the qualifications, experience and backgrounds of those the Minister has appointed. I am only aware of some of those whose names are already familiar to me and with whom I have engaged during the years in other roles they have performed. I would appreciate it if the Minister arranged for her office to provide me with the information I requested.</p>
          <p eId="para_908"> I make it abundantly clear that I wish the chairperson of the new board and her team well. I hope they will have many years of personally satisfying service in their particular responsibilities. I have no doubt that the Minister is choosing appropriate individuals to serve on the board. If she is not willing to accept the amendment, I ask her to be specific and particular in the legislation and accept the spirit of what I am seeking to achieve. I am not implying that she is not doing this but commending that she and those who come after her do so. </p>

          <p eId="para_910"> Obviously, the Minister, in deciding to appoint a board to the agency, will reflect how best what is in the Bill can be delivered by the right mix of persons on the board. As I say, I myself have done that. I point out that the Bill does not prevent the Minister from appointing board members who have a particular professional background. Of course, the Deputy will get the details and the CVs of the board members I have appointed.</p>
          <p eId="para_911"> In terms of those who understand the sector and family resource, there are a number of persons who have detailed experience in that area. When the Deputy looks at the names, he will see that they have quite a lot of experience in local delivery from family resource centres. I am aware there was some concern about that, but we have made it clear. Family support is integral and that will be reflected on the board on an ongoing basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_912">I move amendment No. 16:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_913">In page 34, line 34, after "to" to insert "the Board of".</p>
          <p eId="para_914">On the power of the Minister to give direction to the agency, the Bill states, "Notwithstanding <i>sections 41 </i>and <i>44 </i>and directions issued under those sections, the Minister may give an additional direction in writing to the Agency for any purpose relating to this Act and concerning—", and it goes on with paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>), and then subsections (2) to (6), inclusive.</p>
          <p eId="para_915"> My sense of it is that the appropriate target for any directions in writing emanating from the Minister should be to the board of the agency rather than to the agency, and subsection (1) is open to misinterpretation. It could be to the chief executive officer or senior executives, as the case might be, but I believe that the chain of contact and the point of impact in terms of the Minister's position should be with the board. That clarification is necessary. The Minister, in issuing any additional direction, should do so in writing to the board of the agency. I hope that is self-explanatory.</p>

          <p eId="para_916">I will clarify that such is the case. In section 21(1), the Bill provides that the board is "the governing body of the Agency with authority, in the name of the Agency, to perform the functions of the Agency." This is clear and unequivocal. The Minister's relationship is to the agency and that will be to the board of the agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_917"> Sections 41 and 44 both provide for engagement between the Minister and the agency. In this connection, both the performance framework and the performance statement, that is, under sections 41 and 44, respectively, shall be developed by the Minister and provided - I clarify - "to the Board" of the agency. Clearly, the relationship is to the board of the agency. It will be up to the board then to develop the corporate plan and the business plan, respectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_918"> I assure the Deputy that references to the agency in this context are to the board of the agency, as defined in the Bill. Therefore, I am not accepting the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_921">It is not clear. When one looks at the definitions in the opening pages of the Bill, the first interpretation is "Agency", and it states, "means the Child and Family Agency established under section 7;". Referencing to agency, in this particular instance in terms of new directions in writing, does not specify that it is the board of the agency. It is, arguably, a small matter, but surely certainty is reasonable to achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_922"> I cannot for the life of me understand why the Minister, accepting the basis of the argument that it is the board of the agency, would not then accept it and provide for "in writing to the Board of the Agency for any purpose relating to this Act". Make no mistake about it, in referring back to the definition of "Agency", it does not state, "the Board".</p>
          <p eId="para_923"> This is all about clarification and strengthening so that it is not open to misinterpretation. Given my and the Minister's shared understanding that it is the board of the agency, that is exactly as it should appear in the legislation. I again commend it to the Minister. It will not alter the Bill in any way. The resistance to accepting it is beyond my understanding. It is about introducing certainty and clarity and I do not understand why there is this stoic opposition to any and every amendment presented despite the common sense behind them all.</p>

          <p eId="para_924">As Deputy Ó Caoláin will be aware, on Committee Stage I accepted quite a number of amendments on a clarification that the relationship was to the board of the agency. Section 21(1) is clear. It states, "The Board shall be the governing body of the Agency with authority, in the name of the Agency, ...". In other aspects of the Bill, I made it clear, in terms of the performance and governance of the agency, that at all times the relationship of the Minister is with, and the directions to the agency from the Minister are to, the board of the agency.</p>

          <p eId="para_935">Amendment No. 17 is unnecessary because the Minister clearly could not give a direction that is not consistent with the agency's functions. The agency can only act within the parameters set out in section 8. It is also inconceivable that the Minister would issue a direction that goes against the best interest principle. Directions from the Minister have to accord with the statutory parameters of the agency's obligations under the Act. The functions are laid out clearly.</p>
          <p eId="para_936"> In respect of amendment No. 18, section 48 deals with the power of the Minister to issue guidelines, not directions. Section 47 deals with directions. Unlike directions, guidelines do not have to be complied with, but the agency is asked to have regard for them. I think that is a reasonable provision. Even though the proposed amendment regarding professional judgment is not necessary, there is no intention whatsoever to interfere with the exercise of professional judgment in any particular case that falls within the agency's functions. It is it not implied anywhere that such is the intention. A wide range of professionals are required to exercise professional judgment in often complex and challenging scenarios. Their judgments are informed by years of working at the coalface and are crucial to both intervening and assisting. With the establishment of the agency, we want to ensure the professionals working on the front line feel more supported by management and that the relationship between management and front-line staff is closer. This is reason for the reduction in the number of managers from 36 to 17 and for giving them responsibilities in key areas such as supporting front-line social workers, care workers and psychologists, understanding the complexity of the cases coming before them and considering the supports and resources required. I am not accepting these amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_942">This is a straightforward amendment that deals with the arrangements for service providers. The Minister will probably respond that it is always understood and expected, but it is good to be specific. The requirement on a service provider to comply with section 9 where applicable should be enshrined in the legislation. The other amendments refer to specific areas where the same case can be made. They reflect the same intent.</p>

          <p eId="para_943">I support the amendments. Section 9 requires the agency to operate in the best interest of the child at all times. This group of amendments would require any service provider operating on behalf of the agency to do likewise. It would be wise to include them in the interest of clarity. I urge the Minister to accept these amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_944">Under section 56(13), the Minister may prescribe requirements which include requiring service providers to take into account the best interest of the child where they are engaged in relevant services. In addition, section 56(15) defines a service provider as a person providing child and family services that are similar to activities carried out by the agency. I refer Deputies to the phrase "consistent with its functions" in that section. We had a long discussion about the agency's functions. Service providers have to be consistent with the functions of the agency. As the agency will be required to observe the best interest principle in the performance of its functions, it is entirely reasonable that any service provider engaged in the provision of child and family services on the agency's behalf be required to adhere to the same principles. The agency will have overall accountability for the delivery of services, whether directly provided or commissioned. It is up to the agency to ensure the points the Deputies have made in regard to the amendment are in accordance with its functions and principles. I am sure the Deputies will agree that is good governance.</p>
          <p eId="para_945"> In regard to amendment No. 20, services in the context of this section include the use of premises, equipment and the services of employees. The focus is on the services that another statutory body might provide to assist the agency in the performance of its functions. I have already dealt with the proposed amendments to section 9 and their applicability to a person or body acting on the agency's behalf. I consider the provision to be unnecessary because the legislation is clear in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_946"> In regard to amendment No. 21, the placing of a child in special care or residential care is a decision that is not taken lightly. It is always taken with the best interest of the child at heart. It is recognised that the child's engagement with the courts, where necessary, must allow for the consideration of the views of the child. If the agency enters into an arrangement with any suitable person to discharge its obligation, by implication that includes the obligations set out in section 9.</p>
          <p eId="para_947"> All aspects of the care of such children are subject to the Child Care Act 1991. We have already discussed how the child is paramount under that Act and the Adoption Act 2010.</p>
          <p eId="para_948">I am not accepting that amendment. </p>
          <p eId="para_949"> With regard to amendment No. 24, section 59(4)(<i>b</i>) provides that the agency may impose requirements on a person to allow the agency to monitor the provision of services, where the person is directly providing services. Such requirements could include requirements to ensure the best interests of the child are observed where the person is directly providing services to children. Where providers are providing services, they are expected to demonstrate, at a minimum, that they are upholding the principles established in section 9 as an aspect of any proposal to provide a service to children or families. I will not accept the amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_950">It is a well trodden path back onto my feet to say that it is entirely reasonable to expect it would be understood. Affirming the adherence to compliance with section 9, which deals with the best interests of the child, is what we seek with this series of amendments. It should be properly affirmed in the arrangements with service providers that provision of services by statutory bodies, the particular arrangements of special care in residential places and supplemental services. In any of those, the point is not made as the amendments seek to do. Why would we not make it abundantly clear to all concerned? Those who do not come under the aegis of the agency can be outside providers. We need to say publically that we expect strict adherence at all times in the carrying out of their functions and the provision of services, whatever the setting, so that the best interests of children is paramount and is the primary consideration. I do not know what argument anyone can put for why we do not say that often enough. We should be saying it repeatedly so that it is properly understood and strictly adhered to. I expect nothing less of the agency. This is an address to those they will engage in the provision of particular services and support.</p>

          <from>Deputy Charlie McConalogue<recordedTime time="2013-11-21T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_951">Section 9 is core to the rationale of how the child and family agency is supposed to operate and its principal purpose, namely, the best interests of the child. The amendments want to make it equally clear in respect of service providers. The Minister's point, in respect of section 56, is that service providers can carry out services similar to activities carried out by the agency and consistent with its functions. That is a lot less clear than making it crystal clear that the service providers, in the operation of their duties and in their work on behalf of the child and family agency, should do so in the best interests of the child. Instead, the text is a fudge and is less clear. Does it mean they have parallel responsibilities if we say the service provider should provide a service that is similar to activities carried out by the agency and consistent with its functions? Does it infer the service providers have the same responsibility to act at all times in compliance with section 9 and in the best interests of the child? The presumption is that it is the case but it is not as clear as it could be in the legislation. I see no reason the same onus, as is on the agency in section 9, cannot be put on the service providers in the legislation.</p>

        <speech by="#FrancesFitzgerald" eId="spk_299" as="#Minister_for_Children_and_Youth_Affairs">
          <from>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald<recordedTime time="2013-11-21T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_952">Section 9 sets out the responsibilities for the agency when it is making decisions about children in respect of its functions and planning and reviewing the provision of services. Section 9(1) states "The Agency shall, when making decisions in relation to the performance of its functions under section 8(1)<i>(a), (b) </i>or <i>(c),</i> have regard to the best interests of the child in all matters." That is important. Section 9(3) states "The Agency shall, when planning and reviewing the provision of services in connection with the performance of functions under section 8(1)(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) or (<i>c</i>), ensure that consideration is given to the views of children." Section 9 takes into account the special interests of the child, gives consideration to the views of the child and spells out the responsibilities of the agency. It would not be consistent with the agency's functions to enter into a contract with a service provider where the service provider is not obliged to co-operate in compliance with the agency's responsibilities. That is common sense and is as the situation should be.</p>
          <p eId="para_953"> The matter of the service providers' compliance with section 9 can be dealt with appropriately and with the necessary flexibility in each contract the agency has with service providers. Inserting such conditions into a contract creates an obligation on the service provider, which is actionable if there is non-compliance as it amounts to a breach of contract. The need for absolute compliance with section 9 by service providers providing services on behalf of the agency is most effectively and appropriately dealt with in the contract the agency makes with the service providers. I will not accept the amendments. It is inconceivable and not consistent for the agency to enter into a contract with service provider that is not working in accordance with the various sections I outlined.</p>

          <p eId="para_954">A few months ago, we would have said that matters concerning children that have happened since that time were inconceivable. We could hardly have expected that a child would be taken from its family because of the colour of its hair or the colour of its eyes. It was inconceivable. I only instance those sad occurrences and I could go on and on about other matters. It is because the inconceivable presents itself in this strange world we live in that inconceivable is not a word we, as political voices, should employ. We should at all times be prepared for the unexpected. I do not accept the argument presented by the Minister is sufficient to jettison the importance of making it clear that there is a legal imperative on service providers engaged by the new child and family agency on matters pertaining to the interests of children, nor do I accept that we should not make it abundantly clear in legislation that the same requirements that apply to the agency apply to the service providers. This refers to the best interest of the child.</p>
          <p eId="para_955"> Deputy Troy and I crafted these amendments not to make it so closed that it is unworkable. We recognise that this measure shall operate in compliance with section 9 where applicable and there will be situations where it will not be the case because the best interests of children may not be remotely involved in the consideration of some aspects. However, it is where children are at the heart of any such arrangement that I want to see a legal imperative that the outside providers adhere to the exact same strict criteria of the best interests of the child, which is what this Bill is about.</p>
          <p eId="para_956">It concerns a new start in cherishing, protecting and providing for the interests of children in this State. That is something this country has historically failed abysmally in achieving. Why would we not go for the best possible protection or fall back on the idea that it would be "inconceivable" that something like this could happen? It is not inconceivable and it is only tragic when something happens that we have not anticipated.</p>

The provision will enable the agency to make such arrangements as it considers appropriate to monitor the use of grant aid by persons and the provision of services where the person provides services directly to a child. These changes are consistent with alterations made on Committee Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_989">Section 58D(9)(c) provides that the agency must remove from the register any provider that has contravened a condition of the registration within a 12-month period. There is no discretion attaching to this action. I am of the view that the period of 12 months is reasonable with regard to the application of the sanction concerned and is modelled on existing provisions governing the regulation of residential centres for children. I am further of the view that a breach of conditions that occurred three years previously might not be reflective of the current practice of a service provider. Accepting this amendment would require in such instances removal of that service provider from the register.</p>
          <p eId="para_990"> Deputies must bear in mind that this legislative framework will, once enacted, require services to be registered in order to operate. It will be an offence to carry on an early years service without such registration. Removal from the register and the necessity to cease operation of an early years service is the option of last resort but it is the right option when people are not complying with conditions. There is much work being done to prepare for the significant change in the way in which the inspection system will operate. I will remain in close contact with the inspectorate during the implementation phase and keep this and other related matters under review. At this point I do not propose to accept the Deputy's amendment. I will keep it under review as we get feedback from inspections and see the new regime in place.</p>

          <p eId="para_997">The purpose of the amendment is to ensure there would be annual visits to inspect services. It is important, particularly in the light of recent experiences, that the legislation is clear in terms of the requirement. Too often we have seen when it is not clear and a specific timeframe is not given within which visits should take place that visits do not take place and unsatisfactory situations arise as a result. I see no reason the Minister would not agree to a specific timeframe and commitment on visits to services.</p>

          <p eId="para_998">Section 58 deals with the supervision of early years services and provides for the agency inspecting early years services from time to time. The use of the phrase "from time to time" is measured and deliberate. It allows for inspections as often as is required, be it once every three years, once a year or several times in one year. The substitution of the phrase "from time to time" with "annually" would make the inspection regime more rigid. It would allow for one annual visit to an early years service provider. In effect, it could negate the registration process as the agency would not legally be in a position to expect adherence to any condition that might be imposed in accordance with the registration regime, other than on a 12 month basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_999"> While I accept that the principle of the amendment is to allow for an inspection on a yearly basis, I am advised that the provision, as it stands, allows for this and for more frequent inspections should that be required. The amendment would be too rigid. The way the Bill is phrased allows for several visits in a year rather than simply prescribing one annual visit. We have the experience from the inspections that where inspectors find non-compliance with conditions, they frequently return within a few weeks or months. Several inspections can be carried out to ensure compliance with the regulation. The phrase "from time to time" is measured and deliberate and it is an attempt to ensure those visits can take place, as opposed to a more rigid prescription on the frequency of inspections.</p>

          <p eId="para_1000">The prescription of a mandatory annual visit would not prevent more regular visits. As the Minister indicated, in cases where a service is not in order more visits are required. I do not believe such a change would inhibit extra visits. Adding a requirement that such visits should happen every year would ensure they would happen every year. If the Minister sticks to the general formula of “from time to time”, we run the severe risk that visits would not happen annually. We have seen from “Prime Time Investigates” the importance of ensuring there are regular inspections. I urge the Minister to reconsider the matter and accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1001">I support the broad thrust of Deputy Robert Troy’s amendment. If constructing it myself, I might have chosen the phrase “at least annually”, which would probably better reflect the Deputy’s intent and the supportive arguments presented by Deputy Charlie McConalogue. That said, we must recognise that “from time to time” might not provide for the required reporting parents seek in determining the suitability of early years services for their child or children or their desire to have an updated assessment of a service the child or children already attend.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002"> The insertion of the word “annually” is a step forward. The Minister made a point on inspections taking place every three years, two years, one year or whatever the case may be. Is there a requirement that a visit must happen within three years? "From time to time" could mean beyond three years. The broad thrust of the amendment is meritorious. While I would have worded it slightly differently, it is an advance on the words “from time to time”. Therefore, I join Deputy Charlie McConalogue in supporting it for these very reasons.</p>

          <p eId="para_1003">As the registration period is three years, an inspection must have taken place within the period if one wishes to register again. That is part and parcel of the new regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004"> We are appointing new inspectors so as to ensure there will be an inspector in every part of the country. Provision has been made in the budget for next year also for the recruitment of extra inspectors. New standards will replace the way services are currently judged. Clearer standards will shortly be outlined that will replace the current regulations. A range of factors will be covered.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005"> In the United Kingdom, for example, inspections take place approximately every two years. The frequency of inspections varies from country to country. If a service is non-compliant, inspectors can visit it again within a given year. That is the reason the provision has been framed more broadly. As we develop the services, we can continue to examine what is an appropriate regime of inspection and how often visits should take place. Currently, it varies quite a bit from county to county. We need to build up services, put inspectors in place and have a national standard. All of that is happening. It was not the case previously, but that is the system we are moving towards. The reason we have included the phrase “from time to time” is that it allows for inspections as often as is required. I accept the point that we want to see more frequent inspections than has been the case in the past, but we wish to allow for inspectors to make visits more than once a year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006"> Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin made a good point, that if the amendment had specified that visits should take place “at least annually”, it would have made the amendment more acceptable. I will not accept the amendment today as drafted, but I accept the principle of regular inspections. We are working towards ensuring the resources are in place to allow regular inspections to happen. Inspections on their own will not improve the quality of child care services. It is about the training of staff and mandatory levels of training for those who work in the service. It is also about putting in place a mentoring system to support child care workers on the front line. We have a preschool quality agenda and are working towards achieving targets in that regard. Much work requires to be done to ensure all services reach the standards we want to see. We are putting inspection reports online. We now have almost 1,700 reports online. At least ten reports from recent weeks have gone online. Parents are now in a position to see precisely what is happening in the services and what inspectors are saying about their nursery or the early years service their child is attending. That is very helpful in raising standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007"> Reference was made by Deputy Charlie McConalogue to the “Prime Time Investigates” programme which I accept generated concern. None of us liked what we saw on the programme and we need a range of initiatives to deal with what was raised in it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1009">I do not believe the wording “from time to time” is good enough for the inspection regime. If we want inspections to happen regularly, we should be specific about what we believe is a sufficient level of inspections. Given the way child care services have grown so rapidly in recent years and that in many regards it is a nascent sector, it is important that inspections are regular. The Minister indicated that the number of inspectors across the country might be inadequate. There are clear requirements for how a service is supposed to conduct itself and how service providers registered by the new Child and Family Agency will have to look after the interests of children. I do not believe acceptance of the amendment would prevent more frequent visits in cases where an inspection has highlighted that a service might not be operating in the way it should.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010">However, we should be making very clear in this legislation what the absolute minimum requirement is. Instead of the Minister saying to us today that she will keep the matter under review and that she may be more specific in the future, she should be specific today by saying an annual inspection is the least that people deserve by way of assurance that every service provider is operating as it should. Stating "from time to time" is not good enough. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment, which I wish to press.</p>

          <p eId="para_1014">In doing so my intention is not to be controversial or to contravene Standing Orders. I refer to the appropriateness of ruling out of order the amendment in respect of after-care for children in State care. Now, almost at the conclusion of Report Stage, I take the opportunity to say I would have withdrawn my amendment if it had been allowed to stand, because I understand the Minister has successfully secured Cabinet agreement to introduce legislation to provide for a statutory assessment of all those with care needs after their 18th birthday - that is, on their maturity or their move from childhood to young adulthood. I very much welcome that and commend the Minister on that success. In light of my amendment, No. 31, I hope she will be able to address this in her response. The development strikes a very positive note at the conclusion of Report Stage of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015"> I hope that the Minister, in her response, might be able to indicate to us how quickly she expects the new legislation to be presented. Its publication is something we have long campaigned for. There are many interested voices across the non-governmental sector and among those who have been through State care, who, from their experiences, have been advocates of the introduction of such a statutory right. I would be grateful if the Minister could elaborate in so far as she can on the assurances we would like to hear and if she could state whether the development is all we have been led to believe.</p>

          <p eId="para_1017">I will respond to the Deputy very briefly. I thank him for his words on the Government's decision, which was to provide a statutory underpinning for the assessment of need of children. Although we are not discussing the particular amendment, I must state that my proposal is to expand eligibility, including by extending the provision to children who are in care on a voluntary basis, not just children who are subject to a care order. Therefore, the provision will be broader. My proposals are intended to ensure the new provisions will be well integrated into the provisions that already exist on care planning. I have agreement from the Government in this regard. Officials are working on the draft heads of the Bill. I regard this as a priority given some of the stories we have heard about some of the personal experiences of young people who have had after-care. Having a statutory assessment of need available to children in care when they are around 16 would be very helpful in terms of planning their aftercare, and it should ensure better outcomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018"> I will bring the legislation before the House at the earliest opportunity. The next Bill I am likely to bring to the House will be the Children First legislation or the legislation regarding Oberstown. Irrespective of which comes to the House first, I will ensure that the after-care legislation is part of it. That is a priority.</p>

          <p eId="para_1019">I thank the Deputies who have contributed to this debate, including Deputies Ó Caoláin, Troy and McConalogue. I am thankful for the support of both Sinn Féin and Fianna Fáil on the establishment of the new child and family agency. As I have said from the outset, we are pursuing this legislation because of the commitment in the programme for Government to reform radically how child welfare and protection services are delivered. I do not have to repeat here the very well-publicised reports on the legacy issues that pertain to child protection in Ireland. They have been instrumental in providing the context for the agency's establishment. The reports have catalogued dysfunction, fragmentation and a lack of inter-agency work. Children have suffered, as we have seen from the Ryan report, the child death report and a range of other reports over the years. Everybody in the House would agree that the need for change was undeniable; hence, this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020"> The Bill, as discussed today and on Committee Stage, is not just about child welfare and protection, important as they may be. We really must examine the way services to children and families are delivered in the future. The reforms in this Bill are designed to enhance child welfare and protection, to support and encourage the effective functioning of families and to provide a significant focus on early intervention. The Bill is about child protection and undoing our legacy, but it is equally about prevention and offering services to families at an early stage. The functions of the new agency reflect the wider emphasis beyond the traditional focus on child welfare and protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021"> The Bill, as it stands, is a very strong, clear and direct statement of intent in regard to how the agency will be expected to deliver its important services and to be accountable. Accountability is very clearly spelt out in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022"> A key task in drafting the legislation was to ensure that the agency would operate within a strong framework of public accountability. Part 6 of the Bill, providing for a performance framework, an annual performance statement, the giving of directions and the issuing of guidelines by the Minister, will, I hope, herald a new era in effective resource allocation and accountability. The other important features of the legislation relate to the need to create the correct platform for inter-agency work. Time and again, we have seen that we did not have the amount of inter-agency work needed to deliver services effectively. The Bill lays out a very robust process for shared services arrangements and the commissioning of services from a range of providers which, I assure Deputies, will be subject to the provisions laid out in respect of the functions. I include best interests, the views of the child and the delivery of services in an appropriate way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023"> The Bill gives us a solid platform and sound basis for continuing change in children and family services. Very shortly, once the Bill passes through the Seanad, I hope we can make the establishment of the new agency a reality. I acknowledge that this is a very challenging time for front-line workers. There are many challenges in this area in regard to delivering effective services. We will not change everything overnight but I believe the new agency is an important lever in ensuring children receive the kinds of services they need. This is an exciting time. I thank the Deputies for their support and encouragement on the establishment of the agency. Many of the points made by the Deputies were incorporated into the amendments I introduced on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024"> Children at risk of abuse or neglect deserve the very best kind of service that we can offer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">The establishment of the child and family agency is a very important and positive step in the right direction and is a real attempt to do just that. I thank the Deputies and the Leas Ceann Comhairle.</p>

          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin<recordedTime time="2013-11-21T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1026">I commend the Minister's work and congratulate her on the successful passage of the establishing legislation for the new child and family agency. The Bill has been a long time in gestation and, having gone through this House, it will now go to the Seanad. This is a very important, if not historic - an often abused term - development in the context of the State's role <i>vis-à-vis</i> the care of children and the provision of protection for them in all situations and settings. I hope the agency will represent, as I have said on a number of occasions, a new beginning. It certainly has the potential to be that. The Minister has selected fine people to work at its helm. I wish the new chairperson of the board, Ms Norah Gibbons, and her team in service on that board every success in the years ahead. I also extend, unhesitatingly, my good wishes to the CEO designate, Mr. Gordon Jeyes, and the team who will work with him at the helm of the new agency. I wish them every success with all they have to face. I hope that those who are transferring to the new agency from a variety of different settings will find their future employment personally fulfilling and rewarding because of the very important area that they are entrusted to address, serve and provide for. So much rests on their best performance and their adherence to the highest standards. Not only we as political voices but Irish society generally would wish to see this as a new beginning. I wish everyone who will work within the new agency every success. I hope they will have a very personally rewarding future because of the very special area in which they will work. I also commend my colleagues on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children and the Chairman, Deputy Jerry Buttimer, on the approach taken to this and related matters in the last number of years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027"> I wish to appeal to the Minister with regard to a number of outstanding issues of concern in particular areas. The Family Resource Centre National Forum has written to the Minister regarding section 72 of the Bill and the transfer of powers. It is particularly concerned about the provision that relates to the National Education Welfare Board but not to all of the elements that have been, heretofore, under the control and aegis of the Family Support Agency. There are small outstanding areas of uncertainty that will require more than a written response. I have engaged with the Minister and with colleagues in her Department on this matter. Indeed, it is a matter on which we had a fairly feisty exchange during the course of the Committee Stage debate. We took the time to sit down, go through it and arrive at an understanding of the why and the what of her approach. I recommend that the Minister adopt the same accessible approach to those who continue to have concerns and doubts in that regard. To meet and sit down with people is the way to overcome their genuine concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028"> I wish the Minister continued success in her role as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. In the two and a half years she has been in that role, she has proven to be a very effective Minister and a very fine choice for the role that has been entrusted to her by the Taoiseach and her Cabinet colleagues.</p>

          <p eId="para_1029">First, I wish to pass on apologies from my colleague and party spokesperson on children and youth affairs, Deputy Troy, who was unable to be here today. I know he has worked very hard on this Bill. I commend the Minister on the hard work she has done in introducing this landmark legislation. I also commend Deputy Ó Caoláin, who has a great command of his brief and is very passionate about this area. He has done immense work in this regard, not only in this Dáil but in previous ones.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030"> The establishment of the new child and family agency is very welcome. Unfortunately, the history of our country is very much blighted by failures to protect children and to provide services to them. A lot of work has been done on this in recent years but sadly, it was too late for many people, some of whom are living today with the scars of not having had the services they needed and deserved when they were children. </p>
          <p eId="para_1031"> It is an exciting time for everybody involved in the new agency. It is also a very challenging time. We all know that the establishment of a new agency is not an answer in itself and we have seen that in the past. There is also a requirement for effective management, sound structures and adequate resources. A lot of work remains to be done in that regard. I wish Ms Norah Gibbons, the chairperson of the new agency, well. She has a great track record in this area and I have no doubt that her commitment will serve the new agency well. The same holds true for Mr. Gordon Jeyes, the chief executive designate, who has put immense work into this. He is highly capable and has a fantastic background in the area. His experience will be needed because a lot of the work remains to be done. I have no doubt that it has been challenging in recent years while this legislation has been in gestation. The fact that the agency is now established on a legislative basis is very welcome. I urge the Minister to ensure that the resources needed are made available. I know she is very aware of the gaps that exist and I hope she will do everything in her power to plug them. I hope this agency will serve the best interests of the children of this country.</p>

I thank Deputy Ó Caoláin, in particular, who has put so much work into the development of the agency. I would also like to thank Deputies McConalogue and Troy.</p>

          <from>Minister for Health (Deputy James Reilly)<recordedTime time="2013-11-21T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1035">We have been putting in place the building blocks for universal health insurance, UHI, including the introduction of money-follows-the-patient funding. We are currently working on a White Paper on UHI, which will be published before the end of the year. This involves the development of detailed policy proposals covering issues such as the design of the UHI model, the UHI basket of services and funding mechanisms.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036"> Revised risk equalisation credits to protect community-rated health insurance are an essential part of maintaining our community-rated system. I would like to focus on the specific changes made to these credits and corresponding stamp duties, which will apply from 1 March next year. The risk equalisation scheme, RES, provides for risk equalisation credits based on age, gender and level of cover in respect of insured people aged 50 and over. Under the Health Insurance Acts, the Health Insurance Authority, HIA, the statutory regulator of the industry, makes recommendations on the applicable rates to the Minister. Having considered the expert analysis provided and consulted with the Minister for Finance, I then set the rates for the risk equalisation credit and the Minister for Finance sets the rate of stamp duty required to fund those credits.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037"> A critical element of risk equalisation is to ensure it promotes efficiency. In its assessment of the required support levels, the HIA compares data across the market. Using market average data means that an insurer with higher than market average claim costs will continue to lose out to its competitors and will, therefore, have a strong incentive to reduce its costs towards, or even below, the market average. The availability of cheaper entry level products in respect of which there is no increase in stamp duty may encourage more young people into the market and may encourage others to remain in the market. This measure is intended to encourage sustainability, therefore, from the perspective of the market as a whole. This is in keeping with my overall commitment to community rating in the first instance and to progressively increase the extent to which risk equalisation compensates for the costs of insuring older customers. Otherwise, health insurance would become prohibitively expensive for older customers, the majority of whom would be forced to leave the market at the time in their lives at which they are most likely to benefit from having it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038"> Without an efficient RES, there are clear negative implications for older or less healthy customers. In addition, there are serious potential consequences in terms of the promotion of fair and open competition, the stability of the market and the sustainability of insurers. The scheme levels the playing field among all insurers by providing a mechanism for sharing risk and attendant costs in order that an insurer with a less profitable risk profile is not obliged to charge higher premiums than the market average or incur significant losses, other things being equal. Where premiums are higher than the market averages, an insurer is more likely to lose younger than older customers, and its worsening risk profile may oblige it to increase premiums further, resulting in a cycle that could drive the insurer from the market. This is the so-called death spiral. On the positive side, an effective RES creates an incentive for insurers to focus on innovation, greater efficiencies and improved customer service rather than selecting customers based on risk. This is the kind of competition that is best for consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039"> With regard to policy development, it would be valuable to set out a basic road map for risk equalisation for the next three years. I am committed, at a minimum, to maintaining the current level of effectiveness by age group as measured against market average claim costs; adjusting the hospital bed utilisation credit, HBUC, as a proxy indicator of health status pending the introduction of a more refined measure, while ensuring the rate never creates an incentive for unnecessary hospital stays; introducing a more refined measure of health status, for example, through the use of diagnostically-related groups, DRGs; and incrementally increase effectiveness between 2014 and 2016 with a view to further increasing effectiveness to 85% for those aged over 70 years and to 90% in respect of customers aged over 80 years. In line with existing legislation and other requirements, these policy aims are subject to the following critical requirements: annual expert current market analysis by the HIA; scheme rules relating to overcompensation as agreed under EU state aid approval; and the final decision on applicable RE rates set by me in consultation with the Minister for Finance in line with the governing legislation. The measures being introduced will continue to protect community-rated health insurance, which is a vital part of our health system now and in the future as we move to UHI.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040"> I have outlined the mechanics of how the RES works in terms of risk equalisation credits and corresponding stamp duties and what it is intended to achieve, which is the support of community rating, by ensuring older persons have access to affordable health insurance. I refer to the consequent improvements to the effectiveness of the scheme and I would also like to dispel some myths about the monetary impact of the revised rates for consumers. The stamp duty for advanced plans will increase by €49 for adults and €15 for children. This does not mean that each plan will increase by these amounts. It is up to the health insurers to decide their own pricing plans, an issue to which I will return in due course. These changes are necessary to further improve the effectiveness of the RES. I am fundamentally committed to progressively increasing the extent to which risk equalisation compensates for the costs of older customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041"> The HIA has determined that when luxury benefits are excluded, the revised risk equalisation credits will compensate for 78% of the higher claims costs of people in their 70s, which is up from 75% this year, and for 86% of the higher claims costs of those in their 80s, which is up from 83% this year. These improvements will make a real and substantial difference to older people and are in line with the gradual improvement I am aiming for under the road map I mentioned earlier. It has often been said before that the true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members and, in this respect, I am pleased to further help and support older persons in our society in having continued access to private health insurance at an affordable price.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042"> The 2013 scheme also provided for a measure of health status whereby €75 per night is payable from the risk equalisation fund in respect of each overnight stay in a hospital bed in private hospital accommodation, including in a designated private bed in a publicly funded hospital. Used as a general proxy for health status, this is called the HBUC and it benefits each insurer who pays for a customer to use an overnight hospital bed. From 1 January, the HBUC will also be payable in respect of patients with private health insurance cover occupying public hospital beds. For policies effected from 1 March 2014, the amount payable under the HBUC will be reduced from €75 to €60.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043"> All of the commercial insurers have declared their support for the principle of community rating, which is welcome. An implication of this support is that when a measure required to further support community rating is introduced - in this case, revised risk equalisation credits and corresponding stamp duties - every effort should be made by insurers to fully explore their capacity to manage their business and its attendant costs as efficiently as possible to minimise the requirement to pass the impact on to consumers directly. Insurers could examine a number of areas to ensure their practices are as cost-effective as possible, including administration costs, which can be a significant contributory factor to their overall business costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044"> Under section 7F(1) of the Health Insurance Act 1994, registered undertakings are obliged to maintain and furnish information returns, including a statement of profit and loss and a balance sheet, before 1 April each year, while the Central Bank also requires financial data returns by 1 May. To reduce the administrative burden arising from two separate dates for related data sets, I intend to table an amendment on Committee Stage to change the deadline to 1 May, which will have the practical benefit of providing insurers with an additional month to finalise their preparations and meet the requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045"> Currently, VHI is the sole net beneficiary of the RES. It is open to insurers to reduce their outgoings under the scheme by taking on a fairer share of older lives. The VHI has a disproportionate market share of the older age cohorts. For example, VHI holds 89% of the market share in the over-80 age group, compared with only 6% each for Laya Healthcare and Aviva Health. I am disappointed by the inability of some insurers to offer products that are more attractive to older customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046">The revised credits should make older clients more profitable for newer companies operating in a competitive health insurance market. I look forward to seeing their numbers increasing across all of the insurers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047"> I am also aware that other factors impact upon insurers' ability to operate efficiently while achieving profit, such as rising medical inflation, increases in claims costs, increases in the average number of treatment days, etc. By way of example, between 2004 and 2008, the average cost of claims per insured person increased by 6.7% per annum but between 2008 and 2012, this increased by 12.6% per annum. Between 2004 and 2008, the average number of treatment days per insured person fell by 12%. However, between 2008 and 2012, the average number of treatment days per insured person increased by 45%. I can see that Deputy Kelleher is as upset about this as I am, particularly when we are reducing the average length of stay in the public health system. There are some lessons for the private hospitals and insurers to take from the public health system, if they care to look at it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048"> With regard to health insurers’ costs, I have consistently emphasised the need to address the rising cost of private health insurance and the necessity for all private health insurers to address their cost base aggressively. Last year, I established the consultative forum on health insurance to generate ideas to address health insurance costs. In June of this year, I appointed an independent chairperson, Mr. Pat McLoughlin, who is working with my Department and the insurers on a review process to give effect to real cost reductions in the private health insurance market. I want all insurers to address the base cost of their claims, as well as procedures being provided in an appropriate, safe, health care setting. By that I mean I want the patient to be treated at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, efficient and as near to home as possible. I do not want procedures that could be carried out in primary care centres carried out in hospitals, day cases carried out as overnight cases or patients being kept in the day before and for a day later after a procedure. The incentives in the private health system do not seem to drive these types of efficiencies which are now being achieved in the public health sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049"> Numerous lower cost plans are available from all four health insurers. As with other types of insurance, it is quite possible for consumers to find the same level of cover in the market for a cheaper price. Members who are on the same private health insurance plan for several years, or who have all the family on the same level of cover, or those who have opted for higher cover for private room accommodation in private hospitals, should review their requirements regularly. It is important to explore the full range of products now available in the market to avoid missing out on potential cost savings.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050"> The Health Insurance Authority, HIA, provides information to consumers regarding their rights, as well as information on health insurance plans and benefits. It plays an important role for customers both in ensuring they have accurate information and enforcing the implementation of the law protecting consumers in health insurance. Its website, <i>www.hia.ie</i>, has a useful plan comparison tool which assists in finding suitable and competitive health insurance plans. With over 256 plans on the market, that advice is badly needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051"> Following the amendment to the Taxes Consolidation Act introduced by the Minister for Finance to limit the relievable amount of premium, I intend to bring forward an amendment to section 7H(b)(<i>ii</i>) of the principal Act so that the statement a policyholder receives from a registered undertaking will clearly set out the gross premium before risk equalisation credits are applied, the applicable premium after risk equalisation credits to which community rating applies and the premium payable by the insured net of tax relief at source.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052"> The key measures in the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2013 are as follows. Section 1 defines the principal Act as the Health Insurance Act 1994. Section 2 amends the definition of “net premium” in section 2(1) of the principal Act. Section 8 of the Finance (No. 2) Bill 2013 introduces new ceilings on medical insurance premiums that will qualify for tax relief as €1,000 per adult and €500 per child. This has implications for the manner in which community rating is applied under the Health Insurance Acts. This amendment clarifies that community rating applies to the gross premium, less any risk equalisation credits and excludes any applicable tax relief. Section 3 amends section 6A of the principal Act. This amendment includes a technical amendment to correct a reference and a consequential amendment to the definition of “hospital bed utilisation credit” from 1 January 2014 to reflect the enactment of section 55 of the Health Act 1970 where private patients will incur a hospital charge in respect of an overnight stay in a public bed, as well as providing for consequential amendment to the definition of ''relevant amount" and the deletion of the definition of “reasonable profit”' at section 6A(2) while a replacement definition is provided for in section 5.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053"> Section 4 amends section 7AB of the principal Act. For consistency, the timeframe by which a registered undertaking which wishes to vary benefits payable under a type of health insurance contract is required to notify the HIA is extended to 1 March from 1 January. This is in line with section 6.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054"> Section 5 amends section 7F of the principal Act. Under this section, an overcompensated registered undertaking is required to make a payment to the risk equalisation fund if it has made more than a reasonable profit. The HIA carries out the overcompensation test on a three-year rolling basis, as provided for in the legislation. This amendment specifies the HIA will take what would constitute a reasonable profit for a registered undertaking in respect of its relevant health insurance business as a return on equity not exceeding 12% per annum on a rolling three-year basis using approved accounting standards and having regard to the European Union framework for state aid in the form of public service compensation. A registered undertaking is not deemed to have made a profit in excess of reasonable profit if its return on equity exceeds 12% per annum in respect of that business for part of that period, the three-year period, but not for all of that period. Further, it defines relevant health insurance business in the State as all of the undertaking's health insurance business in the State and return on equity in the case of a registered undertaking or former registered undertaking established otherwise than under the Companies Act as the equivalent, using approved accounting standards, of a return on equity of a registered undertaking which is a company established under those Acts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055"> Section 6 amends section 11C of the principal Act to provide for 1 March 2014 as the effective date for revised risk equalisation credits to be payable from the fund. Section 7 amends section 11E of the principal Act. This amendment provides that where the HIA is satisfied that a changed existing contract is now a contract which it classifies as now providing non-advanced cover, it will make regulations accordingly. Where the HIA is satisfied that a changed existing contract now provides advanced cover, the HIA will amend the relevant specification. In addition, provision is made for the HIA to review any evaluation and analysis of sample types of contracts. Where an error occurred in the classification of a product, the HIA will amend the regulations and the register of health insurance contracts accordingly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1056"> Section 8 amends the reference on Schedule 2 to the principal Act. This is a consequential technical amendment to change the reference on the Schedule to section 7F from section 6A.</p>
          <p eId="para_1057"> Section 9 amends Schedule 3 to the principal Act to provide the revised amount payable from the risk equalisation fund in respect of the hospital bed utilisation credit will decrease to €60 in respect of health insurance contracts renewed or effected from 1 March 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058"> Section 10 replaces Table 2 in Schedule 4 to the principal Act. With effect from 1 March 2014, the applicable risk equalisation credits payable from the risk equalisation fund in respect of certain classes of insured persons are revised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059"> Section 11 amends section 125A of the Stamp Duties Act 1999. This amendment specifies the accounting periods as three consecutive months beginning 1 January, 1 April, 1 July and 1 October. It defines the due date for returns to the Revenue Commissioners as the 21st day of the second month after the end of an accounting period. It then specifies the applicable stamp duty rates for 1 January to 28 February 2014 and 1 March 2014 onwards. Finally, it deletes section 2(A) in each place. Section 12 provides for the Short Title, collective citation and construction.</p>

          <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher<recordedTime time="2013-11-21T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1061">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the private health insurance in general and address this Bill too.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062">It is hard to believe the Minister is in here, sponsoring this Bill, in view of all he has said about the viability of the health insurance market, the fact that it is contracting rapidly and the fact that what underpins intergenerational solidarity and supports community rating and risk equalisation is a flow of young people into the health insurance market. What we have had over the last few years is an outflow of young people dropping their health insurance or downgrading their policies. That clearly is not a sustainable position to maintain.

          <p eId="para_1065">He certainly did, unless the record is mistaken, but I doubt that. In 2006, the Fine Gael leader, Deputy Kenny, said he was opposed to the introduction of risk equalisation, the Government scheme that would see BUPA hand over €160 million over the following three years to its competitor, the State-owned health insurance company VHI. The leader of Fine Gael who said that is now the Taoiseach. In 2009, Deputy Reilly expressed fears that the premium levy of €160 would make private health insurance unaffordable and would result in a contraction of the market by at least 10%, or 200,000 subscribers. He said the €160 levy would also significantly increase the cost of employee benefits for companies. Deputy Reilly, now Minister for Health, said at the time: "The levy is anti-competitive and it is a means to prop up the State dominant player. VHI remains super dominant in the health insurance market." He concluded his speech in 2009 as follows.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1066">I would not commend this Bill to the House. I oppose it vehemently and believe it is ill advised. It is anti-competitive and is driving families out of the insurance market. It will put more pressure on our already pressurised health service. On all counts it is destined to be a disaster. We will regret the measure and, in fact, many people who have had to give up their private health insurance are already regretting it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067">He made this speech in 2009 when a Bill was introduced to bring in a levy of €160. The Bill today is authorising a €399 levy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1068"> The concept of risk equalisation, community rating and intergenerational solidarity is very important. We have supported it at all times. The difficulty I have is that I am being asked to support a Bill that will further undermine the very concept of intergenerational solidarity - that is, support from younger, healthier people who are coming into the insurance market for those who are older, sicker and needing medical care. This is the dilemma and it is being exacerbated by the Minister's continuing policy of undermining the private health insurance market. We had the bizarre situation a few weeks ago during the budget where the Minister for Finance drove a coach and four through the Minister for Health's stated policy on health insurance. The Minister for Health said he had not been consulted about this, so he should ask why not. However, we might at least think that the Minister for Finance would be consistent in trying to underpin what is a central tenet of the programme for Government, which is the need for a vibrant private health insurance market to underpin universal health insurance when it is introduced in 2016 or thereafter. Instead he put a cap on tax relief of €1,000 for an adult and €500 for a child, and he described this as only affecting gold-plated health insurance policies. We all know this is simply not the case. That particular policy announcement alone will increase the cost of VHI's Family Plan Plus Level 2 and other plans that are not gold-plated but are basic private health insurance policies. It will affect hundreds of thousands of people who have private health insurance. It will force people out of the private health insurance market. Not only is the Minister for Health undermining his own policy, but the Minister for Finance is doing the same thing. We are now engaged in a farcical debate in which the Minister says one thing and then does the exact opposite. Nothing in this Bill shows me that he is committed to encouraging people to retain private health insurance, nor to attracting younger people into the private health insurance market to sustain community rating and risk equalisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069"> I am not the only person out there who is saying this. Several reports have stated the same thing. The Minister referred to the death spiral. The death spiral is happening continuously, but the Minister is in the vortex of that death spiral, forcing families to give up private health insurance. Every day we hear about cases in which people must make decisions about whether to renew their health insurance or use that money to fill the tank with oil or purchase basic items for their families. That is where we are at. I will get the usual lecture from the Minister about why we are where we are and all the rest of it, but the Minister is where he is now, and his policies are forcing hundreds of thousands of people to give up private health insurance. The figures are there to underline that statement. It is not alarmist; it is a fact. Behind those statistics are families who just cannot take any more. This not a positive step when all the other policies being pursued by the Government and the Minister for Finance are shattering the very principle of risk equalisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070"> Let us look at the number of people dropping out of private health insurance. In 2011 and 2012, the fall-off among those aged under 60 was 133,735. We now have a situation where the risk equalisation and community rating requirement is falling on fewer shoulders. Therefore, premiums will go up, and we will then have a further drop-off in the number of people taking out private health insurance. The Minister is making no effort to introduce proposals on lifetime rating to encourage young people into the marketplace. He has made no advances in that area, so the idea that we are going to have a utopian universal health insurance system is further from reality every day, due to the Minister's policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071"> At the beginning of this debate, I asked if it would be possible to delay the introduction of the Bill in order that we could discuss the report of the Health Insurance Authority, which will be published in the middle of December. The Minister said we could not do so because the health insurance companies would have to trade in the pricing of this levy. Trading in just means trading up. Their costs are going to go up. The people who have to carry those costs will be people all over the country who are trying to forage around to keep their direct debits going or find the money to front-load one payment for the year. The Minister should know this better than anybody, because he was one of the most vociferous opponents of increases in private health insurance during his time on this side of the House. He used to be apoplectic with rage, claiming that inflationary increases in private health insurance of 3%, 6% and 7% were the straw that would break the camel's back.</p>
          <p eId="para_1072">The camel is in quicksand and there is much more than straw on its back. It is unsustainable and the Minister knows that as well as anybody, but the pretence continues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1073"> The Minister has decided to charge private patients in public beds the full cost. I do not expect the public health system to cross-subsidise private health insurance companies but there must be equity. People who take out private health insurance do so for a number of reasons but they are also ensuring the State does not have to treat them. They take out health insurance to lighten the State's health care provision burden. The Minister has stated that. He has said that people who fall out of the private health insurance market end up being treated in the public health system, which is under-resourced in its ability to meet its commitments to the people who do not have private health insurance. Now the Minister is lumping more people into the public hospital system day in day out.</p>
          <p eId="para_1074"> The Minister talks about the roll-out of primary care, treating people in the community at the point of lowest cost, outside the acute hospital setting. We all support primary care. The primary care strategy was published in 2001. The Minister said it went at snail's pace for a number of years and that there was no commitment to it. I could argue very differently. I could certainly debate the point that it is in reverse. GP services throughout the country are under great pressure and stress. In the next few months we will see surgeries amalgamating and closing and GPs having to go to other jurisdictions because they cannot sustain the level of primary care cuts. The Minister expects them to take on further demands regarding chronic illness and other diseases such as diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, to be managed in the community setting, but he is giving them no supports. There is a pretence that the Minister is fully committed to primary care but nothing could be further from the truth. He is committed to a few primary care centres around the country.</p>

The primary principle of this legislation is to support risk equalisation, as the Minister stated, but it is doing the opposite because of the other policies being pursued.

          <p eId="para_1086">I thought at some stage the Minister might realise his policies are undermining the very proposals of universal health insurance he and the Minister for Finance espouse. It was an appalling attack on ordinary families who, day in day out, are doing their best to retain their private health insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1087"> In October or November last year the Minister came to the Dáil with a Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill and we spoke about advanced care packages and non-advanced care packages. We on this side of the House were led to believe a sizeable number of the present plans would qualify as non-advanced care plans and would attract the lower stamp duty. However, when it came to publishing the list of advanced and non-advanced packages we found the average heath insurance policy was in the advanced plan section and therefore attracted the higher levy. A clear commitment was given in this House that this would not be the case and that many of the plans on the market would attract the lower stamp duty and levy but that has not happened. The ordinary plans families take out to protect themselves and pay for their own health care, lightening the burden on the State, were undermined by that U-turn on the number of plans that would be in the non-advanced plan attracting the lower levy and stamp duty. I cannot understand that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088"> There is another situation that goes back to the Health Insurance Authority's report last year. We all accept that there is confidential, market-sensitive and commercially sensitive information in this that must be redacted and there is no difficulty in that. The Minister could easily have published the report. It is probably in his desk and he has probably already read it. The report stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1089">There is a conflict between the maintenance of the principal objective (community rating) and the sustainability of the health insurance market. The recommendation of the authority has taken account of these conflicting objectives along with the evaluation and analysis of returns, avoiding overcompensation and the maintenance of fair and open competition in the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_1090">The Health Insurance Authority has stated that any further increases are at variance and conflict with the principal objective of community rating. This is because increases drive out of the health insurance market those people who would cross-subsidise older people. This is not just Deputy Kelleher having a go at the Minister, although he well deserves that for what he said. This is the opinion of the Health Insurance Authority of Ireland. Although the authority advises the Minister continually he never takes its views and recommendations into account. This is a glaring example from the 2012 report. If the report states the same again, the Minister is acting contrary to the advice of an authority whose remit is to analyse the state of the private health insurance market and make recommendations and observations on it. The Minister comes here and states the reasons he is doing that but none of them stack up.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091"> The other issue at the heart of this is VHI, which has an older cohort and a higher percentage of claims and will be the beneficiary of this. Is the primary motivation of this to address the impairment VHI will be in when it is regulated by the Central Bank as an insurance company? We all know VHI needs a huge capital ratio and reserve to be compliant and seek a licence from the central licensing body. The Minister could be honest and say he is doing this to ensure VHI will receive the largest amount of funding in transfers to benefit it for the purpose of off-loading it or minimising the amount of money the State will have to inject into it to bring it into compliance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1092">That would be fine. At least it would be honest. Clearly, this is what is at the back of many people's minds when the Minister proposes this increase in the risk equalisation levy, despite everything he said prior to 2011 when he was in opposition and vehemently opposed to these measures and stood up to protect hard-pressed families. All that has happened is that these hard-pressed families are being pressed and squeezed harder than ever. Let us get real on this issue. The measures the Minister proposes run contrary to everything we are trying to do in terms of risk equalisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1093"> The Minister mentioned universal health insurance and said he planned to move to the next phase and would publish the White Paper. We have been waiting almost three years for the White Paper. The Minister had proposals concerning the Dutch model, on which he had a fixation for some time. Those proposals have disappeared into thin air and we now are to have a White Paper which is to be published some time towards the end of the year. The difficulty I have with this is that in the meantime the Minister is pursuing policies that may undermine what the White Paper will try to achieve. I am sure he has set the terms of reference for the White Paper and provided for a recommendation to be brought back on how to implement a system of universal health insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094"> Regardless of what type of model will be recommended by the White Paper, we know that the basic principle of universal health insurance is that there must be a vibrant health insurance market. However, all of the policies the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance have pursued in recent times have shattered the health insurance market which is contracting at an alarming rate. Only the other day we saw private health providers laying off employees. They are not laying off staff for the fun of it but because the private health insurance market is contracting and no longer profitable. If it is no longer profitable, we will see a further contraction and shrinking of the market, leading to less competition. Currently, there are four health insurers. The big insurer is VHI which came from a single State-sponsored private health insurance company to its current position where it holds approximately 50% of the market. This position cannot be sustained if huge numbers continue to leave the private health insurance market.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095"> I accept that some insurance companies will cherry-pick their clients. The difficulty with a universal health insurance system is whether the Minister will be able to guarantee that there will be no cherry-picking of the cohort of people who will be targeted for health insurance. The Minister talks about having a nice suite of guaranteed services and cover - a set suite. However, if we look at the Dutch model of universal health insurance, it is in huge difficulty, with private health insurance companies dictating the coverage that will be available. The idea that the Minister will, somehow, with his vibrant health insurance market, be able to decide what cover will be available and the standards that will be laid down in terms of the insurers' obligation to provide cover is farcical, particularly when we have a situation where private health insurers find it exceptionally difficult to retain their premiums at an affordable rate and are unable to attract younger people into the health insurance market. This is completely at variance with stated policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096"> As I have mentioned the issue of tax relief, I will move on to the charge for beds for private patients in public hospitals. What the Minister has done in one fell swoop is to incentivise public hospitals to prioritise private patients over public patients, as private patients will now be seen as a revenue stream. We are faced with a bizarre situation where the Minister is trying to promote a single tier health system, under which people will access health care based on need rather than ability to pay - a policy championed by him all the time - but at the same time he is bringing forward a policy that will force public hospitals to prioritise private patients because of the possibility of generating income as a result. This runs contrary to everything the Minister has said. This proposal and change of policy will undermine the move to a single tier health system under which everybody can access health care based on need as opposed to ability to pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_1097"> We must realise that, by and large, the people who take out private health insurance are not part of the gold-plated circle to which the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, alluded. Perhaps the people concerned are at the Fine Gael €100 dinners, but the people I know who have taken out insurance are struggling daily. They are also taxpayers and entitled to enter the public health system. They have paid their taxes, made their contributions and are citizens of the State. Now they are being asked to pay on the double. They are also being asked to subsidise the public hospital system through the full cost charge for private patients in public beds. This is nothing more than another way to fill the black holes in the Minister of Health's budget year in year out.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098"> We are in the bizarre situation where we are back looking at an Estimate that is simply comical in terms of whether it can be delivered. We know that in 2014 the Minister must take €666 million out of the health system. He says there could be churn or a turnover of up to €1 billion in cuts. Is it credible to suggest this can be done without a massive upheaval in health services? At a time when the Minister is proposing to do this, he is forcing more people out of the private system into the public system, which will further clog up hospitals and acute hospital settings. This must stop at some stage. This is being done by the party that supports community rating and the concept of intergenerational solidarity which it implemented and brought forward against virulent opposition from the Minister and others at the time. The Minister cannot deny that he was virulently opposed to it. He opposed it tooth and nail. I do not mind a small U-turn from time to time, but I do mind U-turns of this magnitude being made without explanation. The Minister should at least explain why he has now decided that community rating is a good idea and why it was a bad idea just a couple of years ago.</p>

          <p eId="para_1100">The Minister opposed it. He opposed the levy. The only way we can have community rating is through a transfer from people who are low risk to those who are high risk.

          <p eId="para_1105">The Bill is a follow on from the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2012, a very important piece of legislation which significantly updated the regulatory regime for the health insurance sector in the State. The 2012 Act introduced a permanent risk equalisation scheme from 1 January 2013. Risk equalisation makes possible the scheme of community rating, which ensures all consumers are charged the same premium for a particular health insurance plan regardless of age, gender or health status, thus preventing price discrimination against those more likely to require medical treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1106"> The Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2013 has as its main purpose to specify the amount of the hospital bed utilisation credit and the amount of risk equalisation credits in respect of age, gender and level of cover that is payable to insurers from the risk equalisation fund from 1 March 2014. It makes amendments to the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 to revise the stamp duty levy required to fund the risk equalisation credits for 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107"> As I stated on Second Stage of the 2012 Bill, as long as we have the type of health insurance market and the type of health funding that exists in the State, the regulatory regime provided for in the Bill will be necessary. It involves a complex system of risk equalisation to support the community rating principle. This entails the transfer of compensation from insurers who carry lighter risk burdens to those who carry heavier risk burdens. All this requires regulation, monitoring, enforcement and penalties for infringements. Without such legislation the unregulated market would discriminate against the old and the sick, or any other group or individual insurance companies decided were a greater risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_1108"> The legislation is, therefore, supposed to be a protection against the working out of the raw profit motive in the health insurance sector. It is supposed to be based on solidarity between generations and between the healthy and those who do not enjoy good health. This is welcome, in so far as it goes, but time after time I have indicated to the Minister that we in Sinn Féin would go much further, extending the principle of solidarity to the way we fund, organise, structure and manage our entire health care system. The cost of health insurance premiums is rising and there is real concern this legislation will inevitably lead to further rises, by as much as 15%. In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Tuesday the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, stated the stamp duty increases provided for in the Bill do not have to be passed on to customers by the insurance companies. He stated, "I would also remind everyone again that insurers do not have to pass on the cost of the changes we have had to make. As I have said many times, they must look to their own cost base.” The Minister states it is up to insurers to decide their own pricing plans and insurers can reduce their outgoings under the scheme by taking on a fairer share of older customers, but he admits this is not happening. It is clearly not happening when we see the statistics cited by the Minister. VHI holds 89% of the market share of those aged over 80, compared to only 6% held by Aviva and Laya. For the 70 to 79 age group the equivalent figures are 78% for VHI and 9% and 12% for the others respectively. Clearly this is an unsustainable situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109"> The Minister reminds us he has commissioned an independent report on the high costs in the health insurance industry and he expects to receive it soon. Whether he will be able or willing to do anything about these costs is another matter. The Minister also stated in the article: "The last thing we want is for health insurance to become a luxury that existing customers can’t afford.” The Minister can write this, but where is the evidence this is something believes or intends? He certainly is not adhering to it. The option of health insurance has become a luxury that is no longer affordable to many thousands who previously held it. I am not an advocate of private health insurance and I do not hold it on principle. In 2008 2.3 million people had private health insurance. In 2012 this figure had dropped to 2.1 million and more than 60,000 people dispensed with private health insurance in that year alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_1110"> People who have dispensed with health insurance because they can no longer afford it are dependent on the public health system, which is under attack from the Government’s failed austerity strategy which it happily embraced when it took over from the previous Government. The State continues to heavily subsidise the private for-profit health system with private beds in public hospitals, a fast-track to care for private patients while public waiting lists grow, and the dual working of hospital consultants in the public and private sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1111"> The Minister claims that the Government is making progress towards its ultimate goal, which he describes as a single tier patient-centred system of universal health care for all. This is what I want, but the Minister states this is to be achieved by a market-based universal health insurance system, and here is where the big gap presents. The Minister states the maintenance of a healthy and functioning private health insurance market is an essential step in the transition to this goal. The Bill before us is, presumably, one of the steps he deems necessary in this transition.</p>
          <p eId="para_1112"> The Government wants to move to an entirely health insurance-based system of funding, managing and delivering health care. As I have noted here previously, the health insurance policies of Fine Gael and the Labour Party were conceived at the height of the Celtic tiger, when record numbers of people had private health insurance. Perhaps it seemed to be a ready-made solution for the State to extend health insurance cover to everyone, subsidising those who could not afford it or who made the choice not to take it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1113"> During the general election campaign in 2011 and following the election itself, Fine Gael and the Labour Party managed to play down the differences in approach in their respective models of universal health insurance. Let there be no mistake; the Fine Gael approach won out in the programme for Government. When one reads the Fine Gael FairCare policy, it is obvious that said party favours privatisation and the commercial insurance model. The policy states that once universal health insurance is introduced "the insurance market will double in size". It also states, "This will attract new entrants, increasing competition and driving down costs". This is a purely market-based approach, treating health care as a commodity and believing consumers or customers will benefit from competition. The market basis for his so-called reforms was confirmed by the Minister in the article he wrote for <i>The Irish Times</i> this week.</p>
          <p eId="para_1114"> Like its 2012 predecessor, the Bill is based on the recognition that there must be social solidarity within the insurance sector and that the market has to be regulated to prevent price discrimination against the old and the sick. As a result, normal commercial competition cannot exist because we would otherwise have a US-style law of the jungle where the young and the fit would benefit from cut-price health insurance and the old and the ill would be fleeced or driven out altogether. Instead, the principle of social solidarity is recognised. I never give up hope that the Minister might go that extra mile. In that context, why will he not extend social solidarity across the entire health care system? If one takes that solidarity to its logical conclusion, one moves to a system of universal provision of health care based on need alone and not on ability to pay. The question that then arises is how to pay for such a system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1115"> Health care is hugely expensive and must be paid for. The question is how to pay for it in a way that ensures the best possible care for all who need it and achieves the best value for money. The Government is proposing to introduce universal health insurance, with the State subsidising those who cannot afford to pay insurance premiums. The State will still have a huge regulatory, managerial and funding role. Why, then, give private for-profit insurance companies such a central place in the system? What contribution will they make? They are funded by the consumers who buy their products. The insurance companies, on behalf of policyholders, will buy services from private or public hospitals or other service providers. In addition, they will have to make a substantial profit in the process in order to satisfy both their hunger for such profit and the interests of their respective shareholders. The Minister has already recognised the failure of the insurance companies to reduce their outgoings and address their cost base. We await with interest the report he has commissioned in that regard. Perhaps he might inform us as to when he expects to receive that report and indicate when he will bring it before the House. </p>
          <p eId="para_1116"> Why not cut out private profiteering from the entire equation and retain that money in the health system and any surplus thereafter in the pockets of citizens in order to give them greater potential to succeed in life and to enjoy the comforts that life has to offer? The only possible reason for not keeping out the profiteers does not relate to health care. There can only be a commercial reason in this regard. In opting for the privatised insurance model – albeit including a slimmed down VHI in the mix – the Government is putting business before health. The Government should re-examine its position. Does the Minister also subscribe to this position, or are there other influences at play here? We need to remove business from the equation when considering health care because the latter is not about profit. People's ill health, the requirement to provide real health care and the protections that are necessary against the challenges that can present in the course of one's lifetime are not the bases on which profits should be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1117"> The bottom line for citizens is that when they need health care, they need it promptly. They also require the best care possible. I am a recent service user and wish to acknowledge that when one is in the system, it generally performs very well. Most people acknowledge having undergone a positive experience once inside the system. It is because of the need for greater urgency and the best care possible that Sinn Féin advocates universal health care based on equal access for all. We want that truly reformed system to be State-provided, funded from fair general taxation and free at the point of delivery. It will not actually be free because people will have already paid for it as part of their general taxation contribution. Such a system would involve a higher contribution in tax from the highest earners than they contribute at present. I make no apology for that at all. Such a system would give rise to comprehensive savings on costs, such as medicines and excessive top salaries, which we have set out in successive alternative budget documents, and would end the State subsidy of private health care. We do not favour the model of insurance-based funding advocated by the Minister for the reasons I have outlined, not only today but on many previous occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1118"> If health insurance is to be the basis for funding, then it should be a State insurance scheme. Labour once claimed to be in favour of this, but its former policy has been suppressed in favour of that advocated by the Minister's party. The least desirable model, as far as we are concerned, is an insurance system based on competing private health insurance companies. In that case, the profit motive and the interests of shareholders, rather than public health, become paramount. This is the Fine Gael model and it is clear that it won out in the programme for Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1119"> I make no apology for once again citing the important paper, The Future of Healthcare in Ireland, published by the IMPACT trade union a year ago. I remind the Minister that, in the context of the Government's plans, this document states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1120">The Government model of competing private sector insurers has not been properly tested. Delays in its implementation suggest that Government plans for UHI have been poorly thought out. If implemented, the model is unlikely to deliver equity, value for money, quality or universal access. Quite the opposite: lessons from the Netherlands show that a profit-driven commercial model led to an inequitable and inefficient system of funding, different tiers of entitlement, rising hospital deficits and even bankrupt hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1121">The IMPACT paper recommends examination of what it describes as a single payer social insurance model along the lines of the systems in place in France, Germany and the Nordic countries. It states the competing insurers model should not be adopted before all of the options have been evaluated on the basis of equity, quality, access to services and value for money. I have no doubt the competing insurers model will not tick the boxes in relation to any of these factors. </p>
          <p eId="para_1122"> The number of people with health insurance is decreasing; premiums for those who have health insurance are increasing; the public health system is under greater pressure as people leave the private health insurance system and the two-tier public-private system persists, with the struggling public system continuing to subsidise the private practice of many consultants.</p>
          <p eId="para_1123"> In the programme for Government a White Paper on financing universal health insurance was promised "early in the Government's first term". Two and a half years later, we are still waiting. I doubt if the first page of the White Paper has been written, not to mention agreed. I do not believe there is a White Paper in the offing and it will come as one hell of a surprise if the Minister is able to tell me-----</p>

          <p eId="para_1127">If the Minister is Santa Claus, nothing will surprise me any more. Here we are waiting on Santa Claus's White Paper. Perhaps we will have a white Christmas, too.</p>
          <p eId="para_1128"> A market based private health insurance system is not the route to real and necessary reform of the health service. I will repeat that message <i>ad nauseam </i>in the hope the Minister and his colleagues will listen to my argument. Meanwhile, the deeply flawed two-tier system deteriorates as a direct result of the futile austerity policy and scandalous health cuts of the Government. Earlier today Deputies discussed Committee Stage of another Bill that will change eligibility for health services. The cuts it imposes will hurt people who have given mighty service to the State for many years, targeting as they do at least 35,000 citizens aged over 70 years. None of these measures is doing anything to address the need of citizens to have access to a quality, universal health system. </p>
          <p eId="para_1129"> As with its predecessor, this Bill is a necessary measure for the insurance sector, as it stands. Overall, however, the future of health insurance and the health system generally under the Government is fraught with the deepest uncertainty because the Minister is unable to make up his mind and grasp the real prize. What a powerful legacy he would leave if he were to introduce a universal system of health care, one paid for from general taxation and available to all citizens on the basis of need. That would bring to an end, once and for all, the days of competing profiteers. Such a system would be at the top of my list for Santa Claus.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnHalligan" eId="spk_363">
          <from>Deputy John Halligan<recordedTime time="2013-11-21T17:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1130">The number of people with private health insurance dropped from more than 50% of the population in December 2008 to 45% in December 2012. This decline equates to approximately 200,000 people. New figures from the Health Insurance Authority show that 64,000 adults and children cancelled their cover last year. During the same period the Health Service Executive recorded a 9.1% increase in the number of medical card and GP visit card holders. The promised free general practitioner care for children aged under five years is set to bring another 250,000 young patients into the system at a time when resource allocation to provide this service has been reduced by approximately 35%. Notwithstanding this reduction, the Government expects general practitioners to provide the same level of service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1131"> This increasing reliance on the already overstretched public health service is a major source of concern, one which the Government is addressing in a dismal fashion. The permanent risk equalisation scheme is not nearly as effective as it needs to be compared to the systems in operation in countries such as the Netherlands and Switzerland. I understand the latest figures indicate the scheme is about 55% effective. Perhaps the Minister might indicate the precise figure. </p>
          <p eId="para_1132"> One certainty is that community rating will not prevent the health insurance system from collapse. The Government must acknowledge this. On introducing the permanent risk equalisation scheme, it claimed it was protecting affordability for those most in need. According to the Department, the Government is committed to keeping down the cost of health insurance for as many people as possible. In that case, why is it pursuing a policy that is completely contrary to this objective, as many commentators and experts have noted?</p>
          <p eId="para_1133"> Funds from private health insurance companies are effectively propping up the public system, yet from what I can discern the Government is intent on hacking away at the sustainability of the market. It has been estimated that the health levy has increased by 149% for an adult since its introduction in 2009, with the rate for children increasing by 155%. It has been claimed that charging private patients the full cost of using public hospitals will result in another price hike. Some believe the market could shrink by 40% in the coming years if premiums continue to rise. Only last week, the Minister called on insurers to absorb the cost of stamp duty increases, which the companies argue will result in an increase in premiums of approximately 15%, although I doubt the accuracy of that figure. </p>
          <p eId="para_1134"> Despite the consistent policy of pushing up premium prices, the Government has not shown any willingness to tackle underlying cost pressures in the sector. For example, hospitals are still fraudulently charging insurers in the region of €1,000 for patients who are sitting on chairs and trolleys in emergency departments. This charge is levied in addition to the public service charge patients are required to cough up before they may even pass reception in accident and emergency units. That is outrageous. </p>
          <p eId="para_1135"> The description of private health care in Ireland needs complete revision. Those who are lucky enough to have a private health insurance policy incur substantial costs if they are referred to a private consultant before their insurance kicks in. Last week I cited the example of a lady who had visited a consultant to have an injury to her hand diagnosed. The consultant who had been paid €150 or €160 for the consultation then charged the lady a further €300 to provide a letter the insurance company had requested setting out the diagnosis. He did so in the knowledge that the lady would submit a claim to her insurance company. The Minister is aware of this outrageous practice, yet consultants are able to get away with it. They can pluck a figure from the air on the basis that their patient will receive €10,000, €20,000 or €30,000 in compensation. </p>
          <p eId="para_1136"> The cost of health insurance has doubled in the past two years and now averages €2,500 per annum for two adults and two children. It has been predicted that 75,000 people will leave the health insurance market this year. As people leave the system, the public health service comes under even greater pressure. The current position is unsustainable. </p>
          <p eId="para_1137"> It is Government policy is to implement a system of universal health insurance by 2016. It is a wonderful policy, but, according to Laya Healthcare, 76% of medical professionals believe the Irish health system, in its current form, fails to protect patients and ensure best outcomes. How could it? Since 2008 almost 10,000 staff and 1,700 beds have been removed from the public system, yet it emerged in recent days that the HSE had agreed to keep quiet about perks, allowances and pension top-ups worth €3.2 million for top earners. Perhaps the Minister might confirm whether a directive from the Department of Health to cease making these bonus payments has been followed through. It will be interesting to know if that has happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_1138"> We are nowhere near having a fair, just and fully regulated health system of which the Minister has so often spoken. By the way, I believe he believes in a fair and just system. The problem many of us have is how he can deliver it. Private health care is being put beyond the means of increasing numbers of subscribers. We have yet to see any meaningful reform of how we pay for health care in a fair and equal manner and confidence in the public system is being hacked away. The Minister need only speak to any person who has private health insurance. He or she will tell him he or she is struggling and keeps it because he or she needs it. If he or she could find some way out of it, he or she would take it. Owing to the public finances, we are not in a position where everybody turns to the public health system because if people did, it would collapse, particularly because of the significant numbers in receipt of unemployment benefit. The 450,000 unemployed all avail of the public health system, which means that we must put billions of euro extra into it. As public confidence erodes further, the problem is that while few would want to leave the private health system, people will find that they have no option but to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1139"> I made this point earlier and will make it five or six times again. How does the Minister allow consultants to act in the way they do in the example I gave? How does he allow them to rip off ordinary people in the way they do? How can it be that a consultant would make such a request? When I heard of this, I thought it extraordinary that the consultant, having examined the lady concerrned and after she had paid him to examine her, would ask her, because she wanted a letter detailing what he had said to her in the examination, to give him another €300 for the letter. That is appalling.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MickWallace" eId="spk_364">
          <from>Deputy Mick Wallace<recordedTime time="2013-11-21T17:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1140">I do not profess to be an expert on the area of health. No doubt the Minister knows more about it than I do. I would like to understand it better. I am confused as to how the HSE works but, like most people, I see many problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_1141"> The Bill proposes changes to the risk equalisation credits and to stamp duty. Seemingly, stamp duty will be increased on advanced policies. Advanced policies are held by 94% of privately insured persons, while non-advanced policies are not subject to this measure in the Bill - non-advanced policies have lower levels of cover, largely providing for public hospital cover. Stamp duty for most private insurance holders will increase by 12.5% on a child's policy, and by 14% on an adult's policy. The Minister, Deputy Reilly, has told health insurers that they must absorb this increase. Obviously we understand that this will be passed on to the consumer and increases in premiums will mean that more subscribers will leave the private health insurance system. Fewer subscribers in the system, in turn, means that costs for everybody else will go up, and will result in even more subscribers joining the public system. The concern is that this will put further pressure on the public system, which is already struggling owing to funding shortfalls and budget cuts. Age is also significant here, as the numbers of those leaving private health insurance - 61,000 in the past 12 months, which is a frightening figure - and in the overall reduction in the population who were privately insured, from 50.9% in 2008 to 44.8% in 2013, are highest for younger people. This drop-off in the number of younger people is not surprising given the financial pressures they are under, including reductions in income and increased unemployment, which is added to by underemployment and insecure employment. Risk and community rating work by levelling out costs between older and younger insurance customers, which means that younger people pay more and older people pay less than they would in a risk-rated system. The problem posed by a flight of younger people from private insurance is that it will be more difficult for the system to be sustainable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1142"> The changes proposed in the Bill come on foot of budget 2014's capping of tax relief on health insurance premiums. Approximately half of all health insurance customers are affected by this, as the tax relief will now apply only to the first €1,000 spent on a policy for adults and the first €500 for children. Health insurers have noted that this reduction in tax relief will lead to people leaving the private health insurance system. The Government, however, has stated that the capping of tax relief and changes to stamp duty proposed in the Bill will lead to subscribers taking out different health insurance plans with lower levels of coverage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1143"> The Government is introducing several changes to the health system through budget 2014, the Health (Alteration for Criteria for Eligibility) (No. 2) Bill 2013, and now this Bill. It is clear from each of these instruments that the primary objective is to save money and to cut spending. Although the Government has committed itself to the introduction of a universal health care system, including free GP care for all during the lifetime of this Government, it is hard to see how such policies will be realised if the reductions in spending are simultaneously implemented. While much has been made of the introduction of free GP care for those under five, our health system is being crippled by drastic cuts introduced since the onset of the economic crisis. A recent OECD report, Health at a Glance 2013, which I only read about today, highlights the fact that the countries bearing the brunt of the economic crisis have seen the most dramatic reductions in spending on health in recent years. Ireland's <i>per capita</i> health care spending has been reduced by 6.6% between 2009 and 2011. We saw a similar reduction in spending during the last recession in the 1980s, and some would say that the health system did not recover from that. Repeating the mistakes of the past is not only short-sighted but has dire consequences for the lives and well-being of the people of this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144"> The Bill is another example of this dangerous and counterproductive approach adopted by Government. It introduces additional costs that will be passed on to the premiums of health insurance customers, regardless of the Minister's call for insurers to absorb costs. It will add to the growing number of subscribers leaving the private health insurance system, which will put increased pressure on our public system. The Government is increasing costs and cutting at both ends of the health system - it is more difficult for subscribers to remain in the private system with rising premiums, while at the same time the public system is overburdened, with those perhaps most in need of free medical care now being denied it through what the Government calls "medical card probity".</p>
          <p eId="para_1145"> The Minister's request to insurance companies to absorb these extra costs and not pass them on to the customer is probably fanciful. That is not really how the private sector works. That is what worries me most about the Minister's liking for the Dutch system. I do not know whether Deputies have spoken about it already, but it seems as if the Dutch system is beginning to unravel. From what I understand of it, the system consists of a series of private companies supposedly providing competition, and those who cannot afford to pay for their own insurance are guaranteed a certain basic level by the Government. In Holland, the basic level is being eroded and less is being offered at that basic rate all the time because of increased costs. Seemingly, in a short space of time, the Dutch have seen their health insurance bill rise by around 40%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1146">One may call it a universal health insurance system but, given that the private sector has its paws on it, the Dutch State must find it difficult to guarantee that the system remains fair. From my own limited experience, the NHS in England, at least in its original form, offers a better template. It would give the Minister more control over the system.</p>

          <p eId="para_1150">I accept that Fine Gael has more of an appetite for the private sector than for the public sector. I am not completely anti-private sector myself. I have done plenty of business in the private sector. However, the State sector does not have to be inefficient. In the area in which I worked, I saw many problems with what was being done in areas of the State sector but the problems were fixable. Similarly, it is possible to have a positive health system that is completely controlled by the State. Perhaps the Minister thinks that is impossible but I do not. If we leave matters in the hands of private companies, as is the case in Holland, we will be at their mercy. Private companies have a legal obligation to maximise profits for their shareholders. I do not think it is the perfect model or the one for which we should aim.</p>
          <p eId="para_1151"> The Government knows that its current strategy for achieving its policy goals is failing. This is why we still have not been given a clear statement of how universal health insurance will be financed and why we continue to await the mythical White Paper on universal health care announced two years ago. Deputy Ó Caoláin claimed that the first page of the White Paper has not yet been written. I hope that is not the case because I am looking forward to reading it. I have no doubt it is a challenging policy area but I will welcome the policy if it comes to fruition.</p>
          <p eId="para_1152"> Slashing the health budget on the one hand and introducing a universal health care system on the other will be difficult to reconcile. With the number of advisors the Government has on hand, surely one of them could have told the Minister what is obvious to a six year old child. It is bordering on fanciful for the Government to continue to pretend to the Irish electorate that it will introduce universal health care when its actions are actually working against such a system. If the recent report in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> on the Government's spin on the budget is to be believed, such delusion and deception are hardly surprising. Why has the HSE stated that the cut to the health budget is €1 billion when the Government is claiming it is €666 million? Was this part of a general public relations strategy, whereby people in Ireland were told one thing about budget adjustments and people outside of Ireland another? God knows, people outside of Ireland have a considerable interest in our budgets nowadays. Whatever the answer, the cuts to spending on public health have serious immediate and long-term consequences. The aforementioned report notes that Ireland has low numbers of doctors when compared to other OECD countries and, along with four other countries, has the lowest number of obstetricians and gynaecologists per 100,000 women in the OECD. In the wake of the Savita Halappanavar tragedy and the several reports that were prepared on her death, we now know that Ireland's low numbers of maternity staff are a significant factor in the risks to women's lives and well-being. Ireland has 30% fewer maternity staff than internationally recommended. The director of the National Maternity Hospital, Dr. Peter Boylan, has stated that his requests for more consultants have repeatedly been turned down. Have we learnt nothing in recent months? How many more lives are this Government willing to risk in the name of fiscal adjustments and austerity, which are bringing an already stretched system to the brink?</p>
          <p eId="para_1153"> Major issues arise with the Government's professed policy goals. Even if it could live up to its wonderful pronouncements on universal health care, there are serious questions about whether the model being pursued is the best or most suitable for Ireland. Several commentators have noted that Ireland is simply too small for a competitive health insurance market, and have pointed to the flaws in the Dutch system. The Netherlands introduced a universal health insurance system in 2006, the rationale being that competition among insurance companies would drive down spending, provide choice for consumers and improve quality of health care. It is not hard to see why these basic assumptions of a regulated but essentially market driven system should appeal to the current Government. However, the universal health insurance system introduced in the Netherlands has not to delivered any of the predicted benefits. Four insurance conglomerates control 90% of the Dutch health insurance market and costs have inflated massively, with Dutch families experiencing cost increases of 41% within four years of the system's introduction and government spending on health increasing by 5% annually. Given health insurers' drive for profitability, there have also been significant increases in spending associated with regulation. The tax office alone has had to hire 600 new staff to administer just one aspect of the new insurance system. So much for choice and efficiency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1154"> In general, the health market is not like any other market, such as the hotel or retail market. Market based health care systems are not efficient because private health insurers are in the business of making money. In the US, the country with the highest levels on spending on health care even though large swathes of the population are excluded from health insurance coverage, unnecessary costs are integral to the system because they make profits for private health providers. Unnecessary treatments and tests are prescribed and medically unnecessary procedures are recommended to increase profitability rather than the well being of patients. The inefficiency of market based systems is borne out by the World Health Organisation's assessment of the US as among the worst health care systems in developed countries in terms of death rates and reductions in suffering.</p>
          <p eId="para_1155"> Fine Gael's free market ideology is dominating the future of the Irish health system. Ironically, this means that its own policy goal of introducing a system of universal health insurance is being undermined by its adherence to neoliberal principles. Market based, universal health insurance has been discredited in the Netherlands and it is time we woke up to the need for a single not-for-profit health provider that will allow people to avail of a system that is patient centred, accessible and equitable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1156"> I have a friend, Molly Waters, who cared for my children when they were small and is a year younger than my mother. She needs a hip operation but she will have to wait a year before she can get one. She is in a wheelchair and her children want to expedite the operation because a year is a long time for a woman of her age to wait. God knows how long she might have left to live. The operation would cost €12,000 through the private sector but she will have to wait a year for public treatment. I do not know how the system works in other countries but I am sure the Minister will agree it should not be this way. It is unfair on this woman.</p>

          <from>Deputy James Bannon<recordedTime time="2013-11-21T17:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1157">I commend the Minister for Health on the fine job he is doing. He took over the portfolio at the worst time in history as far as funding is concerned. Funding is still scarce but he is doing a better job than previous Ministers who occupied the post at a time funding was in abundance. One former Minister compared the Department of Health to Angola in the worst period in its history. Morale in our hospitals has greatly improved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1158">The Minister has given reassurance to health professionals since taking this heavy task on his shoulders. </p>
          <p eId="para_1159"> I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. Private health insurance is of the utmost importance to many people and their families. I am delighted the Government has made changes to the private health insurance system to make it more affordable for older people. With the agreement of the Department of Finance, I understand there is an extra age related income tax credit for insured persons aged 60 and over. This credit, known as risk equalisation, is provided as a tax relief at source, which means the cost of the policy is reduced by the amount of the age-related income tax credit on all insurance policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1160"> The Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2013 sets out to adjust the risk equalisation credits and stamp duty payable so that the risk equalisation of health insurance can be changed. The adjustment is to increase the levy on advanced policies, which cover 94% of insured people. There will be no change to stamp duty on non-advanced policies, covering 6% of insured people. This stamp duty is a levy on health insurers and should not be passed on to consumers, which has been the case in the past. There is no better person to ensure it will not happen than the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_1161"> In February, the Joint Committee on Health and Children discussed the health insurance levy and aspects of the risk equalisation scheme. Appearing before the committee, the Health Insurance Authority's industry regulator outlined the level of impact risk equalisation has on market premiums and what determines premiums, stating:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1162">Risk equalisation in itself has no effect on overall market premiums. The determinant of overall levels of premiums is the insurer's cost of providing a service and the greatest element of this is the cost of claims.</p>
          <p eId="para_1163">I am sure the Minister is examining this topic. There is no foreseeable reason the premium should rise when the risk equalisation levy rises. The Minister has encouraged insurers not to pass on the increase in stamp duty to customers but every time the insurance companies receive a levy, they unnecessarily pass it on to the average person. I have every confidence in the Minister that it will not happen on this occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1164"> Risk equalisation schemes promote a fair and balanced health insurance market and ensure older or sick people can access the market on the same basis as others. Risk equalisation is a vital support to community rating, which is at the heart of the Irish private health insurance market. It means everyone pays the same price for the same product, regardless of age or health status. Health insurance should be as affordable as possible for older and less healthy customers. We have an aging population, with more people availing of health services than in the past. It is good that people are living longer, with the age profile having increased. In the risk equalisation scheme, there is a risk equalisation fund where the health insurance company receives credit for each customer deemed to have a higher risk. Risk equalisation credits are paid out to the health insurance companies in respect of the premiums of people aged 50 and over. The amount of the credit depends on the person's age, sex and the type of insurance cover. This credit can vary from €600 in the case of a person aged 60 to 64 years to €2,700 in the case of a person aged 85 or over. The fund is paid for by stamp duty levied on all open market health insurance policies. Risk equalisation is essentially a system that compensates insurers that carry heavy risk by means of payments from other insurers that carry lighter ones.</p>
          <p eId="para_1165"> The HIA has stated that, without risk equalisation, the incentive for the insurer is to insure younger and healthier people while avoiding older and less healthy people. Where insurers have older and less healthy people on their books, the incentive is to sell them a different product in order to charge more. The risk equalisation system protects the right of older people to purchase health insurance at a reasonable rate. Risk equalisation also supports competition. Without it, competition would be distorted in a community-rated market because insurers with the worst risk profile are at a significant disadvantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1166"> The Department of Health has stated that the changes to the levy are necessary to balance the risks based on data on market participation. The reason for the change is that taking into account such factors has altered the demographic profile of those insured as well as market developments. Since the economic downturn, large numbers of people have dropped their health insurance. Some 50.8% of the population had cover at the peak in 2008 compared to 44.8% at the end of September 2013. The drop in the number of insured is highest among those aged under 50 years of age.</p>
          <p eId="para_1167"> I am concerned at the decline in health insurance numbers as it is an issue for the market. It threatens the balance of health insurance risk in the community rating system. In this system, younger people, on average, make fewer costly claims, subsidising the claims of older insured people. The loss of a number of younger subscribers will upset this balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1168"> Having said this, a number of policy options have been put forward to support younger people entering or staying in the health insurance market to support the stability of the market. A greatly needed initiative to bring younger people into the market is the introduction of lifetime community rating. This system will make it beneficial for an individual to take out health insurance at a younger age with a cost saving benefit. The most common reason people have dropped their health insurance is cost. More than four in ten of those who have dropped a policy have done so for that reason. The private health insurers need to ease up on people and allow them access to an affordable health plan. At least four or five private insurance companies have entered the Irish market since it was opened up. This was a lucrative business and the companies will take any opportunity to make more money. The levy should not increase premiums but is being used by insurers as an excuse to justify a hike on prices. These measures help to create equality for all age groups as they intend to bring about no overall increase in premiums and to spread the risk more evenly between the healthy, the less healthy, the old and the young.</p>
          <p eId="para_1169"> In our programme for Government we stated that we would introduce a system of risk equalisation for the current insurance market. We are delivering on that promise. I compliment the Minister on that. I am also pleased to note that the Minister is reforming the health services to ensure the financing system is based on incentives that promote fairness and efficiency, while also reducing costs, improving control, and improving quality. That is happening. We are all well aware of the difficulties the Minister is encountering in delivering his reform programme while budgets and staff numbers continue to reduce.</p>

          <from>Deputy Derek Keating<recordedTime time="2013-11-21T17:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1172">I am always happy to share with Deputy Bannon, even if it means giving him an extra few seconds of my time. I am reminded that I have a Bill before the House, the Rights of Grandparents Bill 2013, which seeks to give more recognition to the role of grandparents in society. These are people from a generation that contributed to the building of our modern society, and I think of how these people could be celebrated during the centenary of the 1916 Rising. These are people from my parents' generation, the many hundreds and thousands of people who made a contribution to building the modern democracy we have in Ireland today. It is one of the reasons I support this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1173"> The purpose of this Bill is to adjust the risk equalisation credit with regard to health insurance. I refer to the Minister for Health's comments for a recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i>, which referenced the fact that we must retain the solidarity that exists between the young and healthy and the elderly who may require more health care. This legislation sets out to make private health insurance affordable, although we know that each year. and particularly in the past six years or so, health insurance costs have dramatically increased. If there were a free market, the elderly and those who are more vulnerable in today's society, including those who need protection from the market, would be abandoned. That is another reason I support the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1174"> The Bill sets out to observe the principle that everyone has the opportunity to pay the same for a health plan, regardless of age, gender or medical condition. The President of the United States, Barack Obama, has recognised that one of the important entitlements in that country is the right to health, and that is why there is now what is commonly known as Obamacare, which essentially provides more widespread access to health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1175"> At the heart of our health service is the Government's policy of aspiring to a universal health system, led by the reforming Minister, Deputy James Reilly. There are already plans afoot to provide free GP cover for children under the age of five, and this legislation offers similarly exciting protection for elderly people who have contributed to the development of the health service through their taxes. This Government is committed to fairness, equality and access, and underpinning that is the system introduced by this legislation. It will balance cost and ensure that younger holders of health insurance contribute to older people's care, and in turn those who are younger and middle aged will enjoy those benefits when, in time, they need to avail of community rating, or risk equalisation, as it is known.</p>
          <p eId="para_1176"> I welcome the Minister's call for the insurance companies to absorb all of this recent increase, or at least a significant portion of it. I also believe there needs to be a greater sharing of the burden between the companies, including VHI, Aviva and Laya, and I call on those companies to review their cost base and consider the medium to long term in the cover they offer. There has been quite a significant downgrading of cover in the past number of years because of our economic crisis, and a significant number of people have cancelled insurance for economic reasons. There have also been improvements in the health service in recent times, and we no longer have long waiting lists or daily news reports about large numbers of people on trolleys. The health system is being reorganised and solutions are being found to resolve the doctors' dispute. This comes despite the fact that we have less money in the health services, fewer staff and a significant increase in the number of procedures.</p>
          <p eId="para_1177"> I welcome the Minister's announcement that no small hospital will close, as the future of small hospitals is secure. The Government is committed to cutting the cost of services but not the quality, and it is determined to monitor and minimise excessive expenditure. Like others, I am unhappy to hear of bonus payments to hospital chief executives, and the Minister is investigating the matter. It is worth remembering that the Minister has only been in office for two and a half years. He has one of the most difficult jobs in the country, and I am not just saying that because he is in the Dáil tonight. This is clear when one considers the state of the health service he inherited from a Government that had so many resources in its time. I recall a previous Minister saying about those recent years that the country was "awash" with money.</p>
          <p eId="para_1178"> As I have noted, the Minister has got to grips with the numbers of people on trolleys and the junior doctors' industrial problems. There are new contracts for consultants, waiting lists have been tackled, and the Minister is now getting to grips with spending. I fully support the Minister's view that the money should follow the patient. The legislation contributes to the progress in achieving single-tier patient-centred universal health care for all living in this country, and at the very heart of that health service are the new primary care centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_1179"> I conclude by stating my support for the legislation. Through risk equalisation, the most vulnerable - including the coping classes and elderly in particular - will be protected from the consequences of a market-driven health service, which I would be opposed to.</p>

          <p eId="para_1185">Yesterday the Mater Private Hospital announced that it would axe 95 jobs, citing the fact that 170,000 insurance policyholders have cancelled their cover since 2011 and "the further erosion of resources in the sector due to the cap on tax relief on premiums over €1,000". The reduction in patient services in the Mater Private Hospital and further reductions in private hospitals throughout Ireland will have an inevitable consequence, imposing an even greater strain on the depleted resources of our public health system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1186"> I put a number of parliamentary questions to the Minister for Health asking what impact he felt the change in tax relief announced by the Minister for Finance would have on the number of individuals previously in the private system who will now be seeking to use the public health system. In his response the Minister informed me that there was no basis upon which he could make any such assessment. Surely the example of the Mater provides the sort of financial forecasting required, and I hope there will not be further announcements along the lines of yesterday's statement. Sadly, I am not in any way confident that that will be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1187"> As I have stated before, reducing the tax relief on health insurance makes no sense and does not stack up with stated Government policy. The Minister for Health knows this well and I suspect that many of the advisers and officials sitting beside him share that view. This measure was announced by the Department of Finance as a way of shoring up the VHI, and it is essentially an additional private insurance levy for all insurers that is being used to fill the capital regulatory hole that exists in the VHI.</p>
          <p eId="para_1188">We can debate the philosophical underpinnings of tax reliefs, tax increases or tax cuts but, basically, what the reduction in tax relief means for 1.1 million policyholders is that their premium will increase. That is the inevitable outcome and that has been verified by anyone who understands or is involved in the sector. People do not care about the semantics of the argument, but they do care about the impact it will have on their already depleted household budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_1189"> The Minister said in an interview last February with <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> that he did not believe another rise in VHI premiums was "fair, proper or right". I agree. Yet, here we are, eight months later and the changes in tax relief mean that tax relief on VHI's health plus extra plan, for example – not a gold-plated plan - will push the premium to €2,096 from €1,837, an increase of a substantial 14% or €260. The Minister is aware that these plans are invariably held by elderly people who are doing their best to avoid higher excesses and to ensure their policies will cover the full amount for common procedures which are run-of-the-mill for older people such as hip replacements and heart bypass operations in private hospitals. As the Minister said himself, VHI has 90% of the elderly health insurance market. The change is a direct increase in premia, the same increase that just eight months ago the Minister said would not be fair, proper or right. That is precisely what is happening. We can dress it up whatever way we want but that is the result for people who are paying the premia.</p>
          <p eId="para_1190"> I am working on the assumption that the Minister for Health does not support the changes imposed on him by the Minister for Finance. We had a flavour of that at the Joint Committee on Health and Children a few weeks ago, but that does not absolve him of the responsibility for it occurring. He is the Minister for Health. Even if the revenue generated from the changes to the relief are to be used for a capital injection into VHI, there were alternative means for how the VHI’s well-flagged difficulties could have been addressed. The matter has been rumbling on for some time since the European Court of Justice ruling in September 2011. We knew that the VHI had to shore up its reserves to the same levels as its private competitors. At the same time we were told that an additional €220 million would be required but it seems from the latest reports that this figure has been reduced significantly as a result of Warren Buffet's reinsurance deal. It has also been reported in the press that this deal is not yet over the line due to concerns relating to the Minister's commitment to the health insurance industry and to risk equalisation. It appears Mr. Buffett's concerns are being adhered to, and that is essentially the purpose of recent announcements but the question is at what price and to whom.</p>
          <p eId="para_1191"> It appears to me that the changes to tax relief and risk equalisation changes in the health insurance levy dealt with in the Bill have absolutely nothing to do with some form of strategic health insurance policy and everything to do with giving a very famous international investor every term and condition he has sought. As far as I can see, this is a large accounting trick, where instead of the State having to account for the €230 million or so additional cash injection for budget 2014, both Ministers have found other means to fill the capital hole and secure Mr. Buffett's investment on his terms. It is a short-term fix that will cause long-term problems. A net saving of €70 million or so to the State for next year’s budget year from Buffett's investment is not justifiable faced with the number of policyholders who will be affected and the 170,000 health insurance policyholders who have cancelled their policy since 2011. I assume most Members will be aware that Mr. Buffett is the world's most successful investor for a<b>
						</b>reason: he maximises returns and reduces risk but that comes at a price. On this occasion, the price is being imposed on 1.1 million Irish health policyholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_1192"> The Buffett solution to VHI was not the only solution, nor indeed were increased levies, tax relief and ultimately this major State capital injection. VHI could have been broken down and sold into different parts. The proposal was something we contemplated in opposition as a possible, indeed probable, solution. There clearly is an appetite for further international investment in the Irish health insurance market. That has been demonstrated by the arrival of new companies such as GloHealth. If VHI had been split up, instead of the taxpayer taking the €150 million hit or sweetheart deals being provided to Mr. Warren Buffett, the investors could have made the capital investment and there would not have been a requirement to inject taxpayers’ money.</p>
          <p eId="para_1193"> I do not suggest that we should abandon risk equalisation but let us engineer a far more efficient health insurance market that will benefit Irish taxpayers. At the moment it is simply a question of firefighting. No strategic reform has taken place and VHI is getting everything it wants. Mr. Buffett is getting everything he wants and the taxpayer and the policyholder are paying the price for both. A report was done by Goodbody stockbrokers and Matheson solicitors in 2011 on the future of VHI. It appears that the report has been suppressed. I urge the Minister to make it public so that, as legislators, we can all scrutinise the alternative options that have been put to the Government but have been ignored to date. That would be a healthy, open and transparent way to proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1194"> While not specifically dealt with in this legislation, albeit very much linked to the economic rationale for the legislation, the Minister must impose very strict conditions on VHI for receiving this taxpayer investment. Earlier this year it was discovered that the average staff cost at VHI in 2011 was €62,000 compared to €40,000 at Laya Healthcare. VHI continued to pay into a defined-benefit pension scheme for its 900 staff in 2012. In 2011 the pension provision amounted to €7.7 million. I understand former staff receive lifelong VHI health insurance and, equally, current staff also receive this top-up payment. It is important that if we write a cheque to the VHI on behalf of taxpayers that we do so with stringent conditions. The Minister will have no credibility in making statements that private insurers should make greater cost efficiencies in administration – I have heard that repeated by a number of Government backbench Deputies - when the State-owned VHI continues to maintain such disproportionately high staff costs. On average, they are 50% higher than competitors in the health insurance market. VHI staff benefit from large pension entitlements and private health insurance top-ups. That is not sustainable. If we inject taxpayers’ money into VHI there must be substantial, systemic and deep reforms. To date, I do not see much evidence of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1195"> One of the biggest failings the previous Government made after writing huge cheques and issuing the guarantee for the banks was that it did so without any conditions. I plead with the Minister not to make the same mistake. One could argue that the sum involved with VHI does not compare to the bank bailout in terms of quantity but it is an important principle and it is important to set down such a marker.</p>
          <p eId="para_1196"><i>
						</i>I urge the Minister to reconsider both the change in tax relief and the alterations in the risk equalisation measures and explore further the scope for breaking up VHI and avoiding the necessity for taxpayer investment that will be funded by these measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_1197"><i>
						</i>If the Government remains serious about implementing universal health insurance, it is inevitable that some form of tax incentive will be introduced to encourage people to take up policies. The cost of the tax relief in 2013 will be a future cost in some budget year most likely before 2016 if the universal health insurance policy is delivered when promised. Moving 50% of the population into private health insurance will not be done without some tax relief. I presume the Minister knows this. In the meantime, the very short-term savings to the State will merely impose longer-term costs on our public hospitals. I fear the Mater Private Hospital’s enormous staff reduction, announced yesterday, may be only the beginning as an increasing number of people move away from their private policy and into the public health system, thereby putting increasing pressure on the latter. Is this seriously the outcome the Minister set out to achieve when he came into office? I genuinely do not believe that was the objective but that this is a short-sighted, unintended consequence. It will make it far more difficult to achieve the objectives of universal health insurance. Logically, moving people out of private health insurance, only to try shift them back in the very near future through a universal scheme is simply not going to be practical or possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1198"> Fine Gael ran on a<i>
						</i>platform of ending the two-tier system of health service. The two-tier system, created by the previous Government, led to the unique position in which private health insurance holders were eating up public hospital infrastructure and staff. This reduces the amount of public hospital infrastructure available to the other half of the population that does not have private health insurance. This, in itself, is unsustainable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1199"> The consequence of the policy advocated, which is now enshrined in this legislation, is to reduce the number of private health insurance policy holders entirely, which is resulting in the reduction of services in private hospitals. This has no effect on tackling the two-tier health system; it reinforces it and further damages the public health system. I hope we will have an opportunity to return to this matter on Committee Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_1200">The health system is in crisis without a shadow of a doubt. In recent years, approximately €3 billion has been taken out of the health system. The system has lost thousands of staff and thousands of beds have been closed. This year, we are set to see between €666 million and €1 billion being taken out of the hospital system. This means hospital services are being closed. For example, we have seen eight of the nine HIQA watch-list hospitals lose their emergency departments. Our Lady's Hospital in Navan is now the last hospital on the watchlist but there is a threat to close its department by December 2014, despite the fact that there is insufficient capacity elsewhere in the system. These decisions are not being based on patient safety but on the fact that costs have to be cut due to budgets. The health chiefs of the major Dublin hospitals said as much in their letters. When the Minister was involved in the budgetary process, he said as much also.</p>
          <p eId="para_1201"> The health care system needs root-and-branch reform. We need a system that allows access at all levels for all people on the basis of medical need alone. The two-tier system is grossly inequitable and immensely inefficient. It must come to an end. We need a new universal public health system that provides health care free at the point of access on the basis of need and funded through the general taxation system. We need a new system based on public service and social solidarity. We need a system in which the State does not heavily subsidise the private sector while at the same time expecting public patients to languish on public waiting lists. We need a system whereby a baby in my constituency does not have to die from meningitis three minutes from hospital, having waited for an extended period for an ambulance to arrive. We need a system in which a rugby player does not have to wait 45 minutes for an ambulance on his having received an injury and in which a man does not have to die of a heart attack in the Newgrange Hotel having waited 40 minutes for an ambulance. We need a system in which a man in Canistown does not have to die after waiting 40 minutes for an ambulance, in which a road traffic accident victim does not have to die after waiting 25 minutes, in which a child stuck under a 1-tonne industrial gate for 50 minutes does not have to suffer internal injuries while awaiting an ambulance, and in which a victim of serve stroke does not have to wait 40 minutes for an ambulance before being brought to hospital. There was a case recently in Rathoat in which a person had a panic attack and became unresponsive and unconscious and stopped breathing. That person had to wait 35 minutes for an ambulance to arrive. The day of the health service we desire is not here yet. The figures I have outlined are admitted by the HSE in its press statements. The problems of the two-tier health service continue unabated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1202"> Significantly, costs continue to rise, for both the end user purchasing private health insurance and the State. The cost structures are not being properly tackled. A large number of people are caught in the austerity trap. In the past year, some 60,000 people have been forced to forgo private health insurance. Most of them, many with young families, are struggling to make ends meet and pay for health insurance. I fear the steps being taken may lead to further increases in the costs associated with the private health care system. Therefore, we will see many more tens of thousands of families shedding their health insurance over the next while.</p>
          <p eId="para_1203"> We will not change the Government's ideological bent on this issue any time soon. It is necessary to ensure that some social solidarity and intergenerational solidarity exist within the system. It is, therefore, positive that risk is equalised within the health system and that customers are not discriminated against on the basis of age, gender or health status. This element of the Bill is a step forward and I welcome the Minister's input into it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1204"> It is very important that the cost issues within the private health system be focused upon. There is a major imbalance with regard to the age spread of those with private health insurance, and there is also a major imbalance with regard to pay rates in the private health insurance sector and the health service itself. We have seen that come to light this week. Until these imbalances are actually dealt with, it will not be possible to lower the cost of health insurance for the end user.</p>

        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_380">
          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan<recordedTime time="2013-11-21T18:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1205">I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak and will not delay the House for very long. Over the years during which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I have been Members, we have heard many solutions to health service problems, and they have varied in extremity. They included the now-famous abolition of the health board system, which was regarded as the answer to everybody's prayer. It was argued that it would be much cheaper to run the health services under the HSE but we now know this did not materialise.</p>
          <p eId="para_1206"> I was less enthusiastic about the proposals than others over the years because, unfortunately, I had seen the failure of so many bright ideas on the way. The present Administration has done a reasonably good job in achieving targets that were almost impossible to achieve in an extraordinarily difficult economic climate. The tide has been against the changes the Government is trying to introduce. Within reason, it should be acknowledged that a reasonable attempt is being made to change things for the better. It is not easy to do so because there is no area of government like the health service that creates its own inflation to the same extent. It is almost impossible to watch, as the Minister and I will remember from our days on the Eastern Health Board. However, it used to be possible to monitor in a far greater way the changes as they took place and to identify emerging costs at an earlier stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1207">Health inflation costs will have to be borne in mind. I have tabled scores of parliamentary questions on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1208"> The age profile must be distributed evenly among the private health insurers. I am not so certain that is happening. When community rating was introduced and competition was brought into the marketplace, the intention was that it would improve the circumstances for the consumer, but we know that did not happen. I cannot get answers to parliamentary questions on the degree to which the age profile rotates between all the insurers, because that is the basis on which everything stands. We hear daily that old guys like myself should not really have private health insurance because we are a burden on the system. That fails to recognise that during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, when interest rates were at 17% and 18%, we had to pay high rates for health insurance while at the same time paying interest rates on mortgages that were equally exorbitant. It should not be forgotten that there were burdens in those years as well and that the families of the 1970s and 1980s had to pay a heavy price for private health insurance, so there is nothing unique about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1209"> The contributory costs must be assessed, acknowledged and monitored daily, because there is no other way to do it. When there is an increase or a proposal for an increase, the administration in the health service must get involved immediately, because it takes on a life of its own. For instance, if HIQA inspects a nursing home - I have tabled parliamentary questions on this as well - it will say that in order to achieve the highest quality and standards in health and safety, it will subdivide wards to modernise them, despite the fact that many people in those wards do not want that done and that it has nothing whatsoever to do with health and safety but with somebody creating a situation that will cost more. The result is that the staff-to-patient ratio is increased to that extent that it is no longer viable, we have fewer patients in the institution and it become less cost-effective. This happens on a regular basis and I cannot understand why it has not been arrested.</p>
          <p eId="para_1210"> I refer to the private versus the public health sector. I am not at all satisfied that adequate supervision has been applied to the extent to which both sectors contribute to dramatic increases in the cost of private health insurance. I do not want to go into the details of any of the cases with which I have dealt - I am sure every Member of this House has dealt with such cases as well - but I can assure the Minister of one thing, namely, that some of the bills I have seen for procedures, even minor ones, in public and private hospitals are appalling. If anything is to be done to curtail the escalating costs of the health service in this country, that area will have to be targeted as a matter of urgency. I have spoken to scores of people who have had experiences of that nature, as I am sure every Member has, when the cost of the procedure was such as to frighten them and place a burden on them which they could barely handle in terms of premiums.</p>

        <speech by="#DrJamesReilly" as="#Minister_for_Health" eId="spk_381">
          <from>Minister for Health (Deputy James Reilly)<recordedTime time="2013-11-21T18:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1211">I thank all those who partook in the debate on the Bill. I will address some of the specific issues raised by contributors. The main purpose of this Bill is to specify the number of risk equalisation credits, in respect of age, gender and level of cover, that are payable to insurers from the risk equalisation fund from 1 March 2014 and to make consequential amendments to the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 to revise the stamp duty levy required to fund the risk equalisation credits for 2014. In addition, there are some technical amendments to the Health Insurance Acts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1212"> This will have the effect of ensuring that risk equalisation continues to be as effective as possible in providing the necessary support to community rating while, at the same time, the scheme remains robust and transparent and promotes fair and open competition in the market. In particular, while improving the effectiveness of the risk equalisation scheme overall, these measures will make health insurance more affordable for older people by supporting community-rated premiums.</p>
          <p eId="para_1213"> I will not go over the specific details of the Bill again, but it is clear there are serious challenges to the maintenance of a competitive and sustainable health insurance market. The last thing I want is for health insurance to become a luxury customers cannot afford. There is a number of options that can be explored to help address the decreasing number of persons holding private insurance. The proliferation of plans available on the market and the increasing segmentation of the market due to strategies adopted by the commercial providers are of growing concern to me. A potential measure to address this would be the implementation of rules relating to the maximum number of products that can be marketed by individual insurers. Clearly, the fact that there are 256-plus policies on the market is destined and designed to confuse people. As I said earlier, the Health Insurance Agency has a good website that people can use to help them make a good choice in regard to the insurance they require. People should shop around and consider whether they need to have their children on the same policy as themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_1214"> The introduction of a standard plan supported by effective risk equalisation and optional risk-rated additions could have a beneficial impact on the market. People mentioned lifetime community rating, which I intend to actively consider. Currently, somebody the same age as myself can get insured at the same cost, despite the fact I might have been insured for my entire life while that person only decided to become insured for the first time today. There is an issue there at which we should look. </p>
          <p eId="para_1215"> There are a number of technical issues which have to be considered before any possible introduction of lifetime community rating, such as the age at which premium loading should commence and the rate at which the loading should apply. In this regard, I have instructed my officials to commence work immediately on assessing the full implications of introducing such a measure. </p>
          <p eId="para_1216"> In seeking to address the current market decline in tandem with the possible introduction of lifetime community rating, there are other initiatives which can be examined to aid sustainability of the market. Another potential change relates to amending legislation to allow insurers the option to charge adults aged 18 to 29 at discounted adult rates. Currently, they can do this with students up to the age of 23. A number of other issues will be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_1217"> The impact of the risk equalisation scheme, which is the purpose of this Bill, is that stamp duty for advanced plans will increase by €49 for adults and €15 for children. However, this does not mean the cost of the plans will increase by these amounts. Everybody knows what is happening in the market. Why is it that Laya and Aviva have so few people over the ages of 70 and 80? They are gearing their market products to attract younger people. The reason they are doing that is that these people are more profitable. They make more money out of a 25, 30 or 40 year old than they make out of a 70 or 80 year old. If risk equalisation was working properly, one would expect that Laya, which has 22% of the market, would have 22% of people over the age of 80, but it does not. It has something like 3% or 6%. One would expect the same of the other companies, but that is not the case. How can that be if their marketing is fair, equitable and does not seek to segment? However, that is not the case. It is very clear what is going on, and that is what risk equalisation is about. Let us look at it from another point of view. If they did have an equitable share of the higher-risk older people, there would be no transfer of funds whatsoever between the insurers but, of course, that is not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1218">They do not have to increase the cost of their plans by the equivalent of the levy increase because they can easily absorb it from the profit margin they generate on policies for younger age groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_1219"> Some media outlets have reported a doubling or more of insurance premia in recent years. I fully recognise that the increases of health insurance over the past few years at a time of financial crisis have made it hard for many households to bear but I would like to dispel myths about the increases. In 2008, the average premium paid for open membership insurance was €728 approximately before tax relief and this had increased to €1,048 gross in 2012, which represents a 44% increase. In the 12 months to the end of June 2013, the average premium paid was €1,095, which represents an increase of 59% since 2008. It has, therefore, not doubled or anything remotely like it but it is still difficult for families to deal with and nobody is denying that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1220"> Deputy Creighton stated the levy is used to prop up the VHI. It clearly is not given it is used to subsidise older patients. The fact that 89% of people aged over 80 are insured with the company means it will receive the levy. The position is similar for people aged over 70 but if the other insurers were playing ball and taking these older people on, there would be no transfer of funds. The tax relief subsidy is a taxation matter that is put centrally but I must correct a misstatement because the Deputy is wrong. The administration costs of the VHI are lower than Laya Healthcare and Aviva Health and they are considerably lower than its American counterparts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1221"> Why is the cost of health insurance increasing annually? Why do we passively accept medical inflation of 9% when most other sectors are experiencing deflation or inflation of 1% or 2%? There is no rationale for this. There has been no proper, aggressive attack on the base costs of health care. Two years ago, an individual made €1 million out of the VHI alone while last year an individual made €850,000 out of the company. That is before the moneys that may have been paid by the other insurers are taken into consideration and money paid in cheques and cash across the table in their practices. I do not care how good someone is because that level of remuneration is not sustainable in this country. It is clear that we have to benchmark what we pay and why we pay it and we must conduct a clinical audit which, astonishingly, has never been done. However, such an audit is being introduced by the VHI and this must be conducted by doctors. I do not mean any disrespect to nurses but a nurse cannot challenge a cardiologist, neurosurgeon or other specialist. It takes one of their peers to do that and there is little point in a cardiologist challenging a surgeon or <i>vice versa</i>. An audit would establish why the tests are being done, whether they are necessary and why there is such a volume of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1222"> I do not want to say anything that might upset Members and I am sorry people are losing their jobs in the Mater Private Hospital but there are reasons for that which do not necessarily relate to the reduction in the number of people who have health insurance. In the coming year we will have an opportunity when the consultants' contract and the private hospital contracts are up for renewal to drive down costs. We are paying the same rate for procedures that used to take two hours but now only take 20 minutes. This means that, in some cases, consultants can make between €4000,000 and €450,000 a year for a one-day week. That is not sustainable but none of this was tackled in the past. It will be tackled and Pat McLoughlin's group is examining this. This is not about consultant bashing. Excellent consultants work in the health services, some of whom work hard and do more work than they are contracted to in the public sector. However, there are others who do not and they are abusing the situation and they will be dealt with. Similarly, the cost issue has to be dealt with before we move to universal health insurance and we will deal with it. The average length of stay has increased in the private sector and it is reducing in the public sector. There is, therefore, a great deal of learning to be done on both sides. We can learn from each other and I am sure we will.</p>

          <p eId="para_1231">I beg the Deputy's pardon.</p>
          <p eId="para_1232"> Deputy Tóibín stated the health service is in crisis. I accept and acknowledge that we face a serious challenge and that a great deal of money has been taken out of our budget and many staff have left but if it is in crisis now, the Deputy should consider the position before I became Minister. A total of 34% fewer people have to endure long trolley waits now than in 2011. On one day in January that year, 569 people lay on trolleys throughout the State. We have reduced that number by 34% but there are still too many lying on trolleys and we continue to work on this. I commend the men and women working in our health service who have achieved this, despite a 20% reduction in budgets and a 10% reduction in staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_1233"> More than 90% of people last year were treated within nine months of going on an inpatient waiting list and during 2011, we had reduced the waiting time to a year. Prior to that, people were waiting two years. In addition, more than 90% of patients have been seen and had an endoscopy within the 12-week target we set while more than 90% of children have undergone inpatient treatment in less than 20 weeks. That is not a health crisis spiralling out of control; that is a health service, which is recovering and starting to do things in a different way. I again thank the men and women who work in the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1234"> I am sure there have been sad cases of loss of life due to meningitis. It is a dangerous, septicaemic-type condition but, thankfully, vaccines against a number of strains of the disease are available now and these have reduced the death rates. I would like the details about the ambulance wait to which Deputy Tóibín referred. He also raised the issue of strokes. Our clinical programmes have taken us from the bottom to the top of the league in Europe through the use of thrombolysis. In two years, we are at a point where we are saving one life a day as a result of a stroke through the use of stroke units and thrombolysis and we are also preventing three people a day from going into long-term care. There have been considerable improvements in our health services but we have a long way to go. We face serious challenges, as does the country. We expect to exit the bailout next month and that is another key step along the road to recovery. Deputy Tóibín will be very much in favour of us taking back our financial sovereignty and making decisions for ourselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_1235"> The Bill is about supporting community rating through the methodology of risk equalisation and it is not about making health insurance more expensive for people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1236">It is about enshrining the concept of social and intergenerational solidarity to which all sides of the House espouse. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

            <p eId="para_1238">I thank the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources for attending the Chamber to debate this important issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1239"> The Grid Link project runs through my constituency, Kildare South. EirGrid has shown five overground options in stage one of the project’s development and a consultation roadmap, but it has not shown any underground option. When questioned on why this was the case, it claimed undergrounding is the more expensive option. If it is more expensive and technically much more difficult, why not have a full open analysis to prove this to the public? The lack of confidence in EirGrid is due to the fact it has not explained how and why the underground option will not work, expecting the public just to accept it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1240"> The review by the international expert commission, established by the Minister in 2011, remarked on the ever-changing underground technology. While the report is already aged, the Grid Link project will not go to planning until 2016. We need a similar independent report for the Grid Link project to set out a full cost-benefit analysis of the underground option. People have genuine concerns about overhead lines and pylons which they believe have not been given due consideration. They have concerns about the impact on the local environment, the potential impact on their health, while farmers are concerned about the impact on their livestock. In County Kildare this concern extends to the crucial equine industry. It is intrinsic to the area, being the county’s second largest employer, hence the name the Thoroughbred County. The tourism industry is also vital to the rural economy of south Kildare. </p>
            <p eId="para_1241"> When EirGrid claims undergrounding costs more, does it take full account of the financial impact of pylons on the tourism industry and the devaluation of individual properties? I want a full cost-benefit analysis of the underground option. We need to have a proper and open debate on the matter instead of the current statement from EirGrid on undergrounding being more expensive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1242"> I also express my frustration with the appointment of a former chairman of An Bord Pleanála as the new chairman of EirGrid. Perception is important when one is looking for public confidence in a process. The perception that there may be a link between EirGrid and An Bord Pleanála is not helpful. We all know An Bord Pleanála will decide on this issue. Not only does this process need to be beyond reproach but it must also be seen to be beyond reproach.</p>

It is hard to understand how Carlow, the second smallest county, can have four designated Grid Link routes running through it.

The Department’s strategic plan in 2012 set down a roadmap which stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1245">The Government underlines the imperative for the State companies, and all developers of energy projects, of early, transparent engagement and consultation with local communities and stakeholders and the appropriateness of building community gain consideration into project planning and budgeting and as an intrinsic part of the ongoing consultation with local communities and local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1246">Having local communities on side and knowing how they will gain from such a project are key to the whole Grid Link project. At the meetings I attended in my constituency people accepted that we needed to upgrade our electricity transmission infrastructure. Their issues are with how it will be done and the lack of information on the whole project.</p>
            <p eId="para_1247"> There is no cost-benefit analysis of the implications of an overground versus underground option, the impact on the environment, tourism and land devaluation. The only way to sort out this problem is to have an independent expert group analyse these costs and issues to produce a definite analysis of the whole matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_1248">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for taking this important topic. We need to have a wider debate on energy security and demand as there is much public concern about this matter. We, as public representatives, have a responsibility to advocate the people’s views and concerns on the floor of the House to have them addressed. Communities in my constituency have expressed deep concerns to me about the lack of engagement by EirGrid on this project and public confidence is suffering as a result. Reasonable people from communities affected told the Oireachtas committee that EirGrid just seemed to be ticking the boxes as regards consultation. It is speaking in broad generalisations without any transparency in the process involved. There has been no specific engagement on the costing proposed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1249"> Up to €500 million is proposed to be invested in EirGrid in the south east but no transparent, accountable cost-benefit analysis has been provided for the public which it should have. It is proposed to place a transmission line across the centre of County Waterford, over the Comeragh Mountains and through the Blackwater Valley, scenic areas, some of which are protected. However, EirGrid has decided not to provide an office for public engagement in the county. It also chose not to advertise in local newspapers in west Waterford regarding these proposals. If we want real consultation, the public must be informed fully and openly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1250"> The Oireachtas energy committee heard these concerns from the public. A cross-party consensus was reached by the committee to write to EirGrid to seek an extension of the deadline for submissions on the project which is to close on 26 November 2013. At the very least, submissions should be allowed until the end of the year to allow the public to have its say.</p>

            <p eId="para_1251">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing us to raise this issue. It has taken about three weeks to get this raised under Topical Issues. One of the frustrations a Deputy encounters is the difficulty in even getting a parliamentary question answered about EirGrid. I have had a number of such questions ruled out of order.</p>
            <p eId="para_1252"> Rather than repeat everything that has been said by previous speakers, I would like to raise the utter inadequacy of what has been passed off as consultation thus far in this process. About 18 months ago, EirGrid published a consultation area, including all of the nine southern and eastern most counties in the country. Most of the area could never have been a potential route for the construction of any of these power lines. In spite of this consultation in area encompassing a population of over 1 million people, there were only 500 responses, which gives the impression that the consultation was far from effective in alerting the general public on what was proposed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1253"> I join with my colleagues in stating that the very bare minimum the public deserves is that EirGrid examine all the available options. In 2012, the Government produced a new set of guidelines for EirGrid to examine new technologies. It is just not satisfactory that EirGrid would now state that it is considering four or five routes across the country, including in my own county of Kilkenny, where it is considering putting up pylons and power lines and not provide to the general public a detailed cost-benefit analysis on the potential of putting these wires underground. Nobody to whom I have spoken believes that this infrastructure should not be built, but the general public at least deserves a detailed cost-benefit analysis. It is proving almost impossible for that to be delivered.</p>

            <p eId="para_1254">This issue is causing major concerns in County Laois, which is my own constituency. We in Sinn Féin handed a submission today to EirGrid on this issue. We are very concerned about it. We see the need to upgrade infrastructure and we do not have an objection in principle, but there has been very little consultation about it. We are very concerned about the huge pylons planned, which are over 45 m in height, or almost 150 ft. We cannot ignore the communities along the route. The Minister said that he does not have any great problems with these pylons, but we cannot ignore the communities who live along these routes. There is a fantastic landscape in County Laois along the proposed route through Rossmore, Crettyard Killeshin and Ballylinan, with houses and farmland dispersed right across it. We must try to protect that. People in Laois are concerned about the impact on farming, landscape, hedgerows, the visual impact and particularly the impact on tourism, which the county council and local community groups are trying to promote in the south east of the county, the impact on architecture and the potential health impacts, along with the devaluation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1255"> Putting these wires underground for much of the route has to be a real option. We all agree that it will cost more initially, but we must look at the long-term benefits of this. It lasts longer, it has longer life span, it reduces the loss of power through transmission, there is less disturbance of the cable, it is not affected by severe weather, there is lower maintenance and less environmental and visual damage. Let us look at the long-term factors and if we have learned anything recently, it is that we should not always go for short term solutions. Let us look at this over a 30 or 40 year period and the long-term benefits of putting this underground where possible. I accept that it may not be possible everywhere, but there are areas where it is possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_1256">The Cathaoirleach may be right. The Government's plans here are leading to total gridlock. The North-South interconnector goes through County Meath and has been pushed for the last six years, but it looks like the Government has opened too many fronts. This is not just a regional issue any more; it is now a national issue and it will get bogged down as a result. There is no doubt that there is a need for an improvement in infrastructure in allowing sustainable energy onto the grid, as well as plugging into the European grid. However, the most important issue for me is health. The European Commission body SANCO opinion states the following.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1257">The conclusion that extremely low frequency magnetic fields are a possible carcinogen, chiefly based on childhood leukaemia results, is still valid...For neuro-degenerative diseases and brain tumours, the link to ELF fields remained uncertain...New epidemiological studies indicate a possible increase in Alzheimer's disease arising from exposure to ELF. Recent animal studies provided an indication for effects on the nervous system at flux densities...which warrant further investigations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1258">Any family with children growing up in these areas will be really concerned about this.</p>
            <p eId="para_1259"> These pylons eradicate the value of people's homes. There have been many studies carried out which show that houses within 2.5 km of these lines suffer price reductions, while anything within 50 meters of these lines will be valueless. We have carried out studies in the north east which have shown that the fallen value of housing and land will cost €303 million. By EirGrid's own figures of €30 million cost per year delay, we are now at a €108 million delay in the north east. If these lines were put underground, there would be no problem in this respect. In respect of the issue of areas needing energy, Meath will get nothing from the North-South interconnector.</p>

            <p eId="para_1260">I would like to thank the Deputies who have given me an opportunity to make these remarks about this issue. I do not know why it took three weeks for Deputy John Paul Phelan to get it on the agenda. I was out of the country on energy business over the last couple of days, but other than that, I am available to deal with the queries any time they are raised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1261"> EirGrid's Grid25 national programme, and specifically the Grid Link infrastructure project, is vital for future socioeconomic progress in Ireland. The Grid Link project is a key initiative under Grid25. The project consists of a new 400 kV power line linking Leinster and Munster. Without this project, the grid in the south and east of Ireland would not be sufficient to meet the region's future electricity needs. The Grid Link project will help enable a secure supply of electricity for the region well into the future. It will empower growth in the south and east of Ireland and involve an estimated €500 million investment. It will also enable Ireland to meet its 40% renewable target and reduce our reliance on imported fossil fuels.</p>
            <p eId="para_1262"> In the Government policy statement, to which Deputy Phelan referred and which I published in July 2012, the imperative for the State companies and all developers of energy projects of early, transparent engagement and consultation with local communities and stakeholders was emphasised. Currently the EirGrid project team is undertaking detailed analysis of the study area in order to identify the best possible corridors for development. As part of this process, on 3 September EirGrid published the first state report on the Grid Link project, identifying a number of overhead route corridor options for the new 400 kV power line. The publication of that report coincided with the beginning of a 12 public consultation period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1263"> I am aware that EirGrid is fully committed to extensive public consultation and that the company has been engaging in a comprehensive process in regard to the Grid Link project which has involved opening regional information centres, a lo-call project information telephone line and local radio advertising, backed up by national and local print advertising. EirGrid opened five project information centres at Midleton, Carlow, New Ross, Carrick-on-Suir, and Kilcullen. I understand that 33 open days were held within the project area over the last 16 months and that since autumn 2012, the grid link project team has visited marts, shopping centres and agricultural shows, attending over 120 events where thousands of stakeholders have engaged with the team and had an opportunity to inform themselves about the programme in more detail. I am also aware that the project team briefs and updates county councils, town councils, chambers of commerce and other local organisations and national and local politicians regularly, and have done so since the launch of the project in April 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1264"> The current consultation process is a key opportunity for public input, as no decisions have been made regarding the final route of this electricity line. EirGrid has stated that it will fully take on board information and views about the grid link project, which is still at an early stage. Ultimately, it will fall to An Bord Pleanála to determine whether the views expressed have been adequately taken into account in the final project design.</p>
            <p eId="para_1265">EirGrid, under its licence as the transmission system operator, is obliged to plan the electricity transmission network in the most safe, secure, economic and reliable way possible. It has set out in its information brochure for the current consultation process the rationale for preferring overgrounding to undergrounding generally for this project. In the same document it states it is recognised that underground cabling may have to be considered to mitigate identified environmental constraints for the project and that this will be thoroughly investigated during the project development process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1266"> I understand the concerns raised about the various aspects of grid development and there should be a full opportunity to explain all aspects of the Grid Link and other projects under Grid25. I am aware that the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications met yesterday with a number of anti-pylon community groups from the south east, north and north east regions which raised their concerns about grid development. The committee intends to write to EirGrid on foot of the discussions and meet representatives of the company and my Department at a meeting scheduled for 4 December.</p>

            <p eId="para_1267">The eastern uplands area of County Kildare is singled out in the Kildare county development plan. In recent months two of my constituents had planning permission refused by Kildare County Council for a two-storey house and a dormer bungalow owing to the Kildare county development plan LU 1 which states it is the policy of the council "to ensure the development will not have a disproportionate visual impact (due to excessive bulk, scale or inappropriate siting) and will not significantly interfere or detract from scenic upland vistas when viewed from areas nearby, scenic routes, viewpoints and settlements". Planning permission was denied to both individuals because the structures, both of which would be less than 9 m high, would be contrary to proper planning, yet the same individuals could see a 45 m high pylon receive planning permission at the same location. One can plant hedging and trees around a dwelling to screen it, but it is very difficult to screen a 45 m pylon. People do not understand how this could happen.</p>

            <p eId="para_1268">I thank the Minister for his response, but I do not think he got our point. The consultation process is flawed. A number of offices have been opened in the past 18 months and a number of meetings have taken place at marts and shopping centres, but nobody took any notice of this until the lines were put on a map. Human nature being what it is, that is when people sit up and take notice, which is why the consultation process is flawed and an independent expert group is required to come in and undertake an analysis. EirGrid has no credibility in the matter because of the way it has carried on and its arrogance in the way it has dealt with the people so far. I spent a day last week listening to Mr. John Lowry, project manager of EirGrid, being very determined that it would go underground because of the cost. There were no other issues involved. Two days later I heard EirGrid's outgoing chairman, Mr. John Fitzgerald, express a different opinion. This is where the issues arise and I ask the Minister to consider establishing an expert group to undertake an independent analysis which would have more credibility.</p>

            <p eId="para_1269">Public confidence has already been seriously undermined. There is concern that EirGid will drive on, irrespective of the concerns being expressed. This will meet huge resistance and add to the cost of the project. At the very least, the public deserves a full cost-benefit analysis of the underground option to be put on the table, with all the facts and figures, in an open and transparent way in order that it can be debated. That would show whether it was technically possible. Let us decide that issue first. Then let us decide if it would be feasible. What is being presented consists of broad generalities and it is not convincing the public. That is unacceptable. There is already a public highway running east to west in County Waterford, the N25, which also runs north to Kildare. This is an option as a route for underground cabling. I need to know whether that would be a viable option but no figures have been presented, except a €500 billion cost for overhead lines, with no specific details. We need more.</p>

            <p eId="para_1270">The report produced by the independent consultants on behalf of the Government on the North-South interconnector was based largely on information and data from 2007 and 2008. EirGid has already admitted in its public documentation that this Grid Link project will go to planning in 2016. In the eight year intervening period it is reasonable to suspect technology will change substantially. I am struck by one point on the last page of the Minister's comments where he spoke about the responsibility of EirGrid for the transmission network in the most safe, secure, economic and reliable way possible. The cost-benefit analysis it conducts will be flawed if it does not include a judgment on the economic impact on individuals in terms of their households, the potential health impacts and, in particular, the potential impact on tourism, remembering that the south-east region already has the highest unemployment rate in the country. The analysis must encompass all aspects of cost.</p>

            <p eId="para_1271">I thank the Minister for his reply. The concern is that the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act will be used to ram this project through. That Act was brought through the House in 2006 and the Minister abstained in the vote. We opposed it because we saw the powers it would give to large corporations to drive through such large projects. The process has been flawed, as many speakers said. We must amend the Act to give communities a real say in how it happens. The N9 runs from the south east through the middle of Leinster. My colleagues who were in the Chamber at the time highlighted the need to lay these cables beside motorways. The ducting should have been put in alongside the N9. Had it been, we would not be having this discussion. The consultation process closes on 26 November. Everybody who has spoken agrees that the process has been flawed. I ask the Minister to extend the consultation process to 1 January 2014.</p>

            <p eId="para_1272">In the past few months we have seen an old Fianna Fáil trick, where Fine Gael and Labour Party Deputies have played Government Deputies in Dublin but Opposition Deputies in their constituencies. They correctly complain that EirGrid's consultation is a merry dance, but that is all it is. EirGrid is not an independent fiefdom. It must operate within the boundaries of Government legislation. None of these pylons and power cables will be built in the Deputies' areas if they ensure the legislation to place them underground goes ahead. They have the power and must not outsource it to EirGrid. On the question of whether it is technically feasible, of course it is. There are 70 km of undergrounded cable in the State. The Danes, the French and the Spanish are already placing such cables underground with high voltage direct currents. I ask the Minister to create the legislation to provide for this option. None of this infrastructure should be forced on communities that are against it.</p>

            <p eId="para_1273">I get the point. Deputy Pat Deering said there was a formal consultation process but that there was no real engagement. I am concerned about this because after the North-South project I had a number of direct discussions, apart from the republication of the 2012 policy statement, in which I made it plain that I wanted those involved to engage with citizens along the route in their own language and explain to them why we needed a safe, secure energy supply in this country. Much money has been spent and it is very disturbing to hear a wide cross-section of opinion saying the quality of engagement is defective. I gave figures for the numbers of open days held and outlined the extent of interaction at community level in marts, shopping centres and so on. It is disappointing that that is the view of colleagues in the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_1274">Why criticise the consultation process because there are four, five or six corridors? EirGrid's position is that if it went down to Waterford, for example, and said the line there was the one selected, there would be an outcry. It would be asked how dare it come down and inform them that was the line and would be told there ought to be public consultation to decide on the best route. There is no line selected yet, but I understand the point being made.</p>
            <p eId="para_1275"> Deputy Coffey raised the issue of a cost benefit analysis, CBA. As I said to my colleague Deputy Jack Wall who approached me today on this issue, I am satisfied to examine whether there is merit in that suggestion. We did that kind of assessment on the North-South project. The Government promised that it would have an independent international assessment of the North-South project and three experts were brought in from Scandinavia and Belgium. They did the report and concluded it would cost about three times the cost of an overhead line. I do not draw from that the cost for the line from Knockraha to Great Island and back up to Kildare should be similar, but that is what the assessment found in that case. I take the point made by Deputy Coffey on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_1276"> Deputy Stanley asked why the line was not put along the motorway when it was being built and I do not know. That was not done and we are where we are. We need to ensure the regions of Ireland have adequate power and energy for the purposes of employment and economic development. Time does not allow this evening for us to go into the kind of detail needed on this. Somebody asked for a debate on this issue and I am happy to have a debate at any time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1277"> Deputy Tóibín said that countries across Europe are putting the lines underground, but that is not true, as can be seen. Denmark is going underground with the 120 kV cable, but has decided not to do so with the 400 kV line. It has taken that decision and it has a wealthier economy than we do. I do not want to put it stronger than that. Many of the claims made do not stand up. What stands up is that in politics, perception is everything and there are many concerns among the people. I accept and understand that. However, I repeat that no line has yet been selected. The public consultation process is under way and when concluded, we will see whether EirGrid is as dismissive as is being widely alleged. So far, there is no line selected.</p>
            <p eId="para_1278"> Some of the proposals put to me, not just here but outside of the House, seem far fetched. For example, why if the line was going from Knockraha in Cork to Great Island, it would go via this way as distinct from via that way and so on. By a decision of this House, we established an expert agency whose task it is to deliver a safe secure energy supply to the country. It is supposed to have the technical, professional and other expertise to do the job. The days of Ministers drawing lines on the map and saying something shall go there are gone. Perhaps they should not be gone. Perhaps Ministers, who are accountable, should have more of a say in the system, but it is the way it is. Nobody challenges the technical and professional competence of EirGrid, internationally or locally. However, how well EirGrid interacts with local citizens and so on is clearly an issue on which Members have strong views. I hope we can provide reassurance on that. </p>
            <p eId="para_1279"> I hear what colleagues are saying and there is much food for thought in what they have said. I am doing considerable thinking at the moment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1281">I am glad the Minister of State is present to take this debate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1282"> More than 3,600 people died in the troubled era that scarred this island for more than three decades. The wave of violence that consumed so many lives in the North has left a dark legacy for an entire generation, in particular on the shoulders of the families of those who lost their lives in the Troubles. Out of that bleak period, the Good Friday Agreement emerges as a shining light. For the first time since 1920, the entire island voted as one, overwhelmingly in favour of moving beyond the bloody battles of the past towards a shared future. It was a privilege for all of us to vote in the May 1998 referendum, which received massive endorsement both North and South. That was the first time since 1918 the one question was put to the people on this island. That Agreement was not a free pass to the individuals who chose the route of violence that terrorised the North over 30 years, nor was it a general moment of collective amnesia. My constituency, a Border county, was of course affected badly by the Troubles, as was all of the island.</p>
            <p eId="para_1283"> Yesterday's announcement by the Attorney General of Northern Ireland, John Larkin, that all prosecutions of crimes related to the Troubles committed prior to 1998 should cease was a shocking sign of indifference towards bereaved families and their inherent right to truth and justice. Beyond criticisms of the constitutionality of such an action or its viability in the face of international law, it is a basic fundamental tenet of common decency - the very bedrock of society - that victims deserve the truth. Yesterday's policy kite flown by the Northern Attorney General denies that basic claim to justice. It comes at a deeply unfortunate time when the Haass talks are tasked with setting out a coherent framework to confront the myriad of issues surrounding the past. The announcement would also appear to be co-ordinated with a PSNI report lamenting the costs of investigating cold cases and the burden of resources employed by the historical investigations team. I sincerely hope that it is not softening the ground up for a move away from the State's obligation to uphold the rule of law, which exists regardless of timing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1284"> The Attorney General in the North has called for amnesty legislation to be enacted in Westminster to encompass the UK and advocated that mirror legislation should be put through the Houses of the Oireachtas. In effect, this would mean that grievous crimes perpetrated here, such as the Disappeared who continue to languish in a limbo of terror or roving unaccountable British army death squads, as uncovered by BBC Panorama investigators, would go unmarked by the State. Anne Cadwallader's recent publication details the bloody activities of some of those who were employed in the State forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_1285"> The past on this island is touched with sadness and tragedy. It represents a grave challenge to all of us who are working towards building a future free from the sectarian passions and violence that tainted the lives of previous generations. However, this does not mean running way from difficult questions. It does not mean that all victims were the same and that all who lived through those decades share the blame. In reality there were those who took up the gun and resorted to ruthless violence for their own ends, while the majority sought peaceful means to achieve legitimate aims.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Joe Costello)<recordedTime time="2013-11-21T19:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1286">I know all Members of the House will agree these statements offer a timely opportunity to recall the suffering which so many victims and their families endured as a result of violence in Northern Ireland. In recent weeks we have marked painful anniversaries of horrific events, including the Shankill bombing and the murders at Greysteel. A recent publication, <i>Lethal Allies</i>, recalls allegations of collusion in 120 murder cases while the recent BBC and RTE documentary, "The Disappeared", reminded us vividly of how deep is the suffering of bereaved relatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_1287"> I understand a BBC "Panorama" programme to be broadcast tonight will include allegations of killings and shooting of unarmed civilians by members of the British Army. For many of these people, the past is their present, lived and recalled every day. Some may talk of drawing a line under the past but many of these relatives cannot do so and we cannot say that we are truly reconciled until their needs have been recognised. This serves to underline the importance of addressing the past in a manner that addresses the needs of victims and also allows to society to move forward. However painful, we must find ways to acknowledge and to deal with what has happened.</p>
            <p eId="para_1288"> Substantial efforts have been made since the Good Friday Agreement to address the legacy of the past and the Government has been steadfast in its support for the existing institutions such as the historical inquiries team and the Police Ombudsman. While there is undoubted pressure on the courts system and on the policing service in the North arising from legacy issues, the needs of the victims and their families must be accommodated in any future process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1289"> Richard Haass, at the request of the Northern Ireland Executive, is chairing the panel of parties talks which is looking at how best to deal with the past, as well as with other contentious issues such as parades, flags and emblems. He has undertaken to make proposals to the Northern Ireland Executive before the end of the year. As part of this consultation work, he has met many victims groups and is continuing to do so this week. The panel of parties talks chaired by Richard Haass provide an opportunity to make progress on how we deal with the past. This is an opportunity for the parties of the Northern Ireland Executive and also for victims groups and wider society.</p>
            <p eId="para_1290"> The Government is fully committed to supporting this process and to finding a way forward on all the issues within the remit of the panel of parties talks. We will continue our work as co-guarantors of the Agreement to progress reconciliation in Northern Ireland and across this island. Dealing with the legacy of the past must be part of the transition to long-term stability and peace. We remain convinced that efforts to address the legacy of the past should be motivated above all by a commitment to making progress towards reconciliation and a cohesive society.</p>

            <p eId="para_1291">I thank the Minister of Stage for his reply. It is very clear to all of us that dealing with the past must be victim centred. Abandoning justice for victims would be an abdication of our moral and civic responsibility to those who endured during the grim days. It would be a betrayal of our duty to the men and women who were always committed to peaceful means. The history of the Troubles cannot be left to those who bloodied their hands on either side of the conflict, be they perpetrators of state violence or paramilitaries on either side. I trust the Minister of State and the Government will take this opportunity to rule out any such mirror legislation being enacted in this jurisdiction and will endeavour to, within his remit, ensure it is not promulgated in Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1292"> The comments of the Northern Ireland Attorney General suggest he wants an end to prosecutions, inquiries, inquests and civil proceedings into killings related to the Troubles, whether carried out by paramilitaries, police or the army, with a line drawn under the past at the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1293"> Recently in Armagh I listened to Denise Mullen, the daughter of Dinny Mullen who was shot dead. I listened to Seamus Mallon outline the terror inflicted on so many people in Armagh and Tyrone with collusion from so-called state forces including the British Army, the UDR and the police in the North. The people who suffered so much must have justice if at all possible. I am realistic enough to know in many instances it will be very difficult to bring some of the inquiries to a conclusion. I listened to members of the Finucane family, sons of the man who was so brutally murdered, and they were understandably angry about the suggestions of the attorney general. As far as I recall, some of the phrases used by the Finucane family were "ill-judged", "ill-advised" and "very irresponsible". How can we deal with the past if there is no process of examining it? The proposals put forward by the attorney general would cause untold distress to bereaved families and those who were victims of collusion by state forces, which was so well laid out in the work of Anne Cadwallader in <i>Lethal Allies</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_1294">The timing of the announcement by the attorney general is indeed very curious in the circumstances Deputy Smith described. I agree with him entirely the needs of the victims and the bereaved are paramount. This has been a difficult year for Northern Ireland. It is clear the past is exercising a corrosive effect on political life and community relations. The ongoing issue of finding mechanisms to deal with the past require the ongoing commitment of the two governments along with the Northern Ireland Executive and wider society. The Government remains committed to playing an active and constructive role in dealing with the past, including through the management of commemorative, cultural and community events in a sensitive manner. In this context the decade of commemorations is under way.</p>
            <p eId="para_1295"> As part of this process the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste attended remembrance events in Enniskillen and Belfast on 9 and 10 November. The Government's view is that the overriding objective is to make further progress towards a more reconciled society in Northern Ireland. The nub of the issue is the fact the two sovereign governments are the guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement and the process as a whole and as such make the commitments. They must ensure there is no weakening of the commitments. We will continue our work as co-guarantors of the Agreement to progress reconciliation in Northern Ireland and throughout the island.</p>
            <p eId="para_1296"> Dealing with the legacy of the past must be part of the transition to long-term stability and peace. The suffering of all victims of violence in Northern Ireland must be acknowledged and addressed as an essential part of the reconciliation process. Richard Haass and his team are chairing discussions on a range of contentious issues, including dealing with the past, with a view to making progress before the end of the year. We have faith in this process and will be supportive any outcome which can command sufficient support of the talks participants and helps progress reconciliation in Northern Ireland and throughout the island.</p>

            <from>Deputy Gerald Nash<recordedTime time="2013-11-21T19:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1297">I appreciate the opportunity to raise this issue and I am grateful the Minister of State is here to listen to my concerns and those of my constituents and I hope she will be in a position to respond.</p>
            <p eId="para_1298"> We are all very familiar with the generally excellent work carried out by our local authorities and contractors in terms of housing adaptations for older people and people with disabilities. Most of this work is carried out to allow elderly people to continue to live independently and overcome any difficulties associated with their advancing years. One of the most common problems encountered is people no longer being able to get up and down stairs. Usually, as Members of the House are only too well aware, the solution is the provision of a downstairs bedroom and bathroom, or the installation of a chair lift or a through-floor lift. There was always an emphasis on trying to provide accommodation on ground floors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1299"> It is the option of a through floor lift which has caused me some concern in recent times. There are a number of issues at stake. I know of one case where a constituent only wanted a chair lift, which is a much easier and cheaper solution, but the local authority insisted on installing a through-floor lift based on the recommendation of an occupational therapist who simply refused to take into account the expressed wishes of the older person affected. In this case the elderly person was told to take it or leave it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1300"> The second and really important issue of which we must be aware is that these lifts are sometimes installed in houses for which they are totally unsuitable. This means they could represent a danger to the lives of the people who use them. I have been in a number of small - often terraced - houses in which these lifts have become the sole method of access to the upstairs bedroom. Effectively, their installation has led to windows being blocked off. One does not need to be an architect, a civil engineer or a fire officer to be aware that there is an inherent danger in this regard. I have examined the guidelines which obtain in the UK. Those implemented by Isle of Wight Council clearly state, "Accommodating the occupant wholly at ground floor level should be a first consideration whenever possible." I can understand how, in these straitened times, more must be done with less. However, when less means a through-floor lift - in respect of the installation of which there are no official guidelines in place at local authority level - we should all be very concerned. Where through-floor lifts must be used, stringent requirements must be put in place. Such requirements include fire barriers, smoke seals, alarms and sprinklers. Critically, there must be an insistence that bedrooms have windows capable of being opened and large enough to facilitate a rescue or escape in the event of a fire or other emergency. At present, local authorities here are operating in the absence of guidelines such as those to which I refer. I would appreciate if the Minister of State could establish whether such guidelines are made available to local authorities by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. A much more transparent system must be put in place in order that all of those involved can be clear on what are the obligations. This matter must be dealt with before any kind of unnecessary or avoidable tragedy occurs.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Jan O'Sullivan)<recordedTime time="2013-11-21T19:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1301">I thank Deputy Nash for raising this important and serious issue. As housing authorities, local authorities have an overall role in respect of ensuring that the dwellings they provide meet the needs of tenants and, through the housing adaptation grant schemes, to support people with disabilities and the elderly. Clearly, technological solutions play an important role in this regard and all reasonable and feasible solutions merit consideration. In the context of the specific points raised by the Deputy, I will seek to discover whether - if it does not already do so - the Department can supply guidelines similar to those already available in the United Kingdom in respect of this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1302"> I feel very strongly about the need to make real and meaningful provision for vulnerable groups and, in particular, those with disabilities or older persons. In this regard, my Department published the design guidelines Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities for local authorities in furtherance of the need to deliver high-quality homes and sustainable communities in a manner that aims to ensure all households can access good-quality housing appropriate to household circumstances and in their particular communities of choice. These guidelines promote the essential requirement that dwellings should be capable of adaptation to meet the changing needs of residents during the course of their lifetimes. Section 5.2 of this guidance deals specifically with the flexibility and accessibility aspect of the design of homes and recognises that older people or persons with moderate disabilities who wish to remain independent in their own homes should be able to do so without the need for costly redesign and disruptive remodelling of the dwellings The aim of the guidance is to inform by setting out key design principles rather than prescriptive solutions. That said, appendix (ii) draws on the Joseph Rowntree Foundation's lifetime homes standard, which states: "The Design should incorporate provision for a stairlift and a suitably identified space for potential installation of a through the floor lift from the ground to the first floor."</p>
            <p eId="para_1303"> A key aim in the National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability 2011-2016 is to support people with disabilities in living independently in their own homes and communities, where appropriate. The promotion of independent living requires the implementation of a range of targeted actions and supports to assist people with disabilities in remaining at home, including the provision of equitable access to specific design options and mechanisms to support people with disabilities who wish to live independently. In this regard, priority will continue to be given to ensuring the most effective operation of the adaptation grant schemes for people with disabilities and older people. While these grant schemes do not specifically reference through-floor lifts, they do, however, place an emphasis on ensuring that the most appropriate works are carried out to meet the needs of the applicant and that the potential long term needs of the applicant are addressed having regard to his or her disability. This is the correct approach where individual needs and solutions may vary widely. We are way past the point at which a one-size-fits-all solution is tenable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1304"> As a longer-term policy objective, and in line with the commitment in the programme for Government to promote and support universal design, an examination of lifetime housing policy will be undertaken. This will also consider the accessibility needs of wheelchair users and the increasing role of technology in supporting people with disabilities in living independently. In this regard I will certainly consider the points made by Deputy Nash. I am aware that his concerns are very specific to through-floor lifts, and if there is a lack of guidelines in respect of the latter, I will seek to rectify the position.</p>

            <p eId="para_1305">From my experience of dealing with local authorities and others in respect of this issue, I am in a position to state that there definitely appears to be an absence of such guidelines. I am very concerned that there seems to be no guidance available from the Department to local authorities. I am also concerned about the fact that local authorities do not have access to any other form of guidelines and that they have not taken it upon themselves to introduce such guidelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_1306"> There has been a move away from extending the ground floor accommodation of older persons and those with disabilities on the basis that such extensions are costly. I understand that we live in difficult times and I am aware of the demands being placed on the resources of the Department and local authorities. By and large, local authorities do an extremely good job in terms of working within the limited resources available to them. I am of the view that the decision to focus on the provision of through-floor lifts as opposed to extending ground-floor accommodation is motivated by a lack or finance rather than any other consideration. I do not believe that fire officers are consulted with regard to the appropriateness of introducing this type of equipment into people's homes. I am currently dealing with the case of an individual who is obliged to take a substantial amount of medication and whose GP and consultant are, as a result of the type of condition with which their patient is dealing, absolutely opposed to the installation of a through-floor lift in his home. They are of the view that his health will suffer and that using the lift would - for a range of different reasons I prefer not to discuss - prove extremely problematic for him.</p>
            <p eId="para_1307"> The approach being used at present is not working. Notwithstanding the financial constraints that apply, the Department must work with local authorities, chief fire officers, occupational therapists and others with an interest in this area to introduce some kind of guidance and ensure that the kinds of solution that will work for older persons and those with disabilities will be forthcoming.</p>

            <p eId="para_1308">I share the Deputy's concern regarding the need for proper and appropriate solutions that meet people's individual needs. I accept that local authorities probably use different approaches and that some of them still carry out extensions to tenants' dwellings. We are reviewing the scheme at present because we want to ensure that maximum value will be obtained. In that context, I will pursue the issue of the guidelines on the Deputy's behalf. Deputy Nash raised a number of serious issues in respect of safety. I assure him that I will deal with this matter as quickly as possible and communicate with him further in respect of the specific points he raised.</p>
