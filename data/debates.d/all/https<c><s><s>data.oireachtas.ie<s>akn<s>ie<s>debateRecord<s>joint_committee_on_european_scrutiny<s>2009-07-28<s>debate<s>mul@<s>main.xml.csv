Their involvement in this forum is very important.Apologies have been received from Deputy Creighton.  We will go into private session to deal with some housekeeping matters.The joint committee went into private session at 12.05 p.m and resumed in public session at 12.20 p.m.

It is proposed that the proposal does not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.COM (2009) 255 is a proposal regarding the signing of the arrangement for the management of operational co-operation at the external borders of the member states of the European Union.  Given that this proposal has no implications for Ireland due to our non-participation in the Schengen acquis, it is proposed that it does not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?

In the light of the committee's two previous reports which have highlighted the need to protect the interests of the Irish fishing industry, it is proposed to note this measure and request the Department to update the committee on the progress made in the negotiations.  The proposal will also be sent to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for its information.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.COM (2009) 275 is a proposal for a Council regulation opening an autonomous tariff quota for imports of high quality beef.  Given that the regulation has been adopted, it is proposed that it be noted by the committee.  However, given that the regulation is of some significance and could have implications for Ireland's beef industry and the Irish agri-food industry more generally, it is proposed to forward the measure to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for its information.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.There are no CFSP measures under category 4 and no title VI TEU or title IV TEC measures for consideration under category 5.  Category 6 concerns early warning notes.  EWN C142-05 is a notice of initiation of a partial interim review of the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of polyester staple fibres originating in the Republic of Korea.
