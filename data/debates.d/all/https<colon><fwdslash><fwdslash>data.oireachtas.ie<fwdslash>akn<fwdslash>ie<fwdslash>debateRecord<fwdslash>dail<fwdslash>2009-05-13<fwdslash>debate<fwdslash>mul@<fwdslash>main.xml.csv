#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I ask the Taoiseach about reports in this morning's newspapers that Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin will have to close a ward almost immediately and another later this year because of a cost overrun of €10 million.  The Health Service Executive, when it was set up, was purported to be a method of delivering a world-class health service for this country, funded by the Taoiseach, who was then Minister for Finance.  Yet he has stood over a budgetary situation in which at the first sign of trouble in any hospital, when the cost base is examined, the answer is to close wards and not to treat patients.  This is a policy of lunacy.Of all the hospitals in the country, the children's hospital, as the Taoiseach is aware, does exceptional work which is extremely sensitive and personal to potentially every family in the country.  We are four months into the year and a ward is being closed, with another to be closed later in the year, because of a €10 million overrun.  This was announced on the same day as the now absent Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government announced a toothless mayoralty for Dublin.  It has the potential to affect every family in the country.The Taoiseach has been at the children's hospital, as have I and members of all parties, and we have seen the exceptional work done there.  What is the Taoiseach's response to this?  A ward is being closed, with another to follow, and children denied operations in Crumlin will either go on a long waiting list or be sent to the UK under the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  This is a crazy policy.  Has the Taoiseach considered the situation?  The hospital has expensive equipment, trained consultants and trained front line staff, and it is now being denied the opportunity to treat patients from all over the country.  What is the Taoiseach's plan to deal with this?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	2	Every year the service plan devised for all hospitals must be adhered to in the interest of budgetary sustainability and in order to provide services in all our hospitals.  It is important to point out that Crumlin hospital was allocated just under €140 million for this year, which is an increase of more than €38 million, or 39%, since 2004.  There is a need for greater co-ordination between Crumlin, the National Children's Hospital, Tallaght, and the Children's University Hospital, Temple Street, to avoid duplication in the provision of out-of-hours services and so on.  Such an approach would provide the services required while avoiding extra costs.  Co-ordination of services across all three hospitals, in the interest of providing services for children in our straitened budgetary circumstances, is the way forward.  A meeting has been held between the chief executive of the HSE and the chairman of the medical board of Crumlin hospital, and progress was made in that respect.As I said, there is a need for a more co-ordinated approach among all three hospitals.  Closing wards should not be an initial response; the initial response must be to obtain better co-ordination of services.  That is the best way of ensuring we maintain service levels, and it is the approach that will be taken.  Savings of €6.5 million have already been identified by the hospital in respect of its budgets and these are being implemented, but it is important to point out that better co-ordination should help alleviate the worst aspects of the problem.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I accept the Taoiseach's comments about the need for co-ordination.  Crumlin hospital has found €6.5 million in cuts from its cost base but that will not solve the problem.  A ward has been closed; trained staff and expensive equipment will lie idle and, as a consequence, children will not be treated.  The system is all wrong.  At the first sign of budgetary difficulty, the hospital looks at its cost base to see what to do.  It cut €6.5 million and stopped treating patients.  In other systems, the opposite would happen.  Fine Gael has proposed that money should follow the patient and hospitals should be paid for what they do.  If they are given €140 million for 2009, why is the patient seen as an obstacle, not a resource?  Does the Taoiseach believe the system he has stood over for 12 years can deliver the services we need and patients deserve?  Four months into the year a children's ward is being closed in this hospital.  Does the Taoiseach not accept it would be a far better system if hospitals were paid for what they did,  if they saw that instead of closing wards and leaving expensive equipment unused, they should be used more, with theatre times extended?  Trained consultants and front-line staff should see patients as a resource, not as an impediment.  This has been ongoing for 12 years and it is not working.  Will the Taoiseach consider the proposal made by Deputy James Reilly on behalf of Fine Gael, that the "FairCare" system should apply here, where the money follows the patient, rather than the other way round?  In the immediate term, to meet the €10 million shortfall in 2009, the Minister for Health and Children has repeatedly spoken about her redundancy programme within the HSE.  This would save more than €10 million at any one time and allow the hospital to keep its children's wards open, while enjoying better co-ordination between hospitals.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	10	In Dublin there are three such hospitals.  More than €300 million is being spent on the budgets of Crumlin, Temple Street and Tallaght hospitals.  If they were to co-ordinate and act as one in the provision of services, savings could be made without affecting service levels.  That is the approach being taken.  Under the new consultants' contract, there is a proposal to have a single clinical director for the three hospitals to co-ordinate services and work with professionals within them.  The patient, therefore, would not be affected and savings of up to €20 million could be made if there was greater co-ordination between hospitals.  That is the approach that must be taken.

It is the common-sense way forward.  I hope everyone in the hospitals concerned will agree with that approach and proceed on that basis in order that we can provide the levels of service required, given that we have limited resources available.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	14	Two years ago the country was shocked by the tragic death of a young family in Monageer, County Wexford.  Adrian Dunne, his wife, Ciara, and their two children, Lean and Shania, aged five and three years, were found dead at their home in Monageer a couple of days after Adrian Dunne had inquired about arrangements for their funerals with a local undertaker.  Following the tragedy, the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, established an inquiry to find out what had happened, to look at the appropriateness of the response of the State agencies and to learn from the experience with a view to seeing what could be done to avoid such a tragedy happening again.The inquiry reported to the Government in October 2008 and the report was eventually published yesterday.  When I say it was published, only part of it was published because pages of the report have been completely blacked out.  I have heard of a report being a whitewash but this is a blackwash, where entire chunks are blacked out.  Extraordinarily, even some of the recommendations are blacked out, something I have never seen in an official report.  I have a number of questions about this.  The report states that ultimately there is no way to prevent such a tragedy, even with the best intervention in the world.  Sometimes these things happen, which I accept.  However, the value of an inquiry such as this is to learn some lessons from the event, to establish if everyone in the chain was doing his or her job, if agencies were acting appropriately and if matters can be improved to prevent a recurrence.We do not have the full report.  Is there some way it can be made available to the House?  The House has privilege and there were occasions when reports of a sensitive nature were made available to the relevant committee of the House.  Will the full report be made available to the Joint Committee on Health and Children?  Has the Taoiseach seen it?  Is it true the HSE has not seen it?  A representative of the HSE was on radio this morning to claim it had not seen the full report and recommendations.  How are recommendations to be implemented and enforced if we do not know what they are?  The Government has had the report since October 2008.  Can the Taoiseach tell us what recommendations made in the report have been implemented or acted upon since?A central recommendation that we can see concerns the necessity for an out-of-hours child social work service to be established.  The difficulty is that if a problem arises with a family at risk or having trouble after 5 p.m. or at the weekend, there is no service available.  These are the very times the service is most needed — at night and weekends.  The problems that arise in families that lead to tragedies such as this are not normally ones that arise between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Monday to Friday.  The Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs has said that in current financial circumstances, it is impossible to put in place an out-of-hours service.  It may not be possible in the sense of putting in place a fully staffed and resourced replication of the service available during the week but surely it is possible to have some emergency arrangement in place whereby if a garda, a priest or someone in touch with a family comes across something like this, there will be some support and service available to intervene, find out what is happening and try to avoid such a tragedy occurring again?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	15	On the publication of this report yesterday, all of us in this House revisited the tragic situation that happened in Monageer two years ago.  We send our deepest sympathy again to the family concerned and their relatives.  It is a very difficult issue and time for them whenever this issue comes back into the public domain in the way it has as a result of the publication of this report.  All of us are sensitive to those concerns and conscious of the sensitivities of the family members.The redaction in the report is for legal reasons.  The full report would have been seen by the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister of State at the office of children.  The report brought to Government would have included the redactions but the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister of State with responsibility for children would have indicated in broad terms the issues involved.It is important to point out that it is not for the purpose of censoring the report that these redactions were made.  There are other points raised in regard to the provision of and the need to improve services, which are clearly part of the report and are published.  I want to make it clear that it is for legal reasons only that the redactions have been made.

That is the legal advice that we have.  That is why the redactions have been made.On the question regarding the services being provided, it is true to say that as a result of this report an out-of-hours service has been put in place for children who are at extreme risk in order for them to be taken to a place of safety.  That service will be provided between the Garda and the HSE from June of this year.  That is an important service that was not in place previously and, clearly, it was pointed out that it has not been in place.I also make the point, which is made in the report, while not wanting to in any way take away from the need to address the issues as best we can in a comprehensive way, that it appears there was nothing that could have been done in this instance that could have avoided this tragedy.  We all know unfortunately that tragedies occur but clearly, whatever lessons are to be learned can also be learned.

Whatever the legal reasons may be, four people died in this tragedy, including two young children who were not given a chance of continuing their lives.  We need to know what went wrong here, what went astray.  It is not a matter of curiosity; it is a matter of trying to learn lessons from this tragedy in an effort to avoid this type of tragedy occurring again.There is a way that the report can be published.  It can be brought to a committee of the House where it would enjoy the normal privilege of the House.  I put it to the Taoiseach that he, the Minister of State with responsibility for children and the Minister for Health and Children seated next to him, should find a way to do that.  This is about finding out what happened here and learning some lessons from it.I have never seen a report where the recommendations were blanked out.  How do we learn from a report if we do not know what are its recommendations?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	44	Hear, hear.

About whom or what are these blanked out recommendations?  Whatever justification there may be for part of the narrative in the report being blacked out, perhaps to protect individuals or whatever, there is no case whatever I can think of as to why the recommendations should be blacked out.  The recommendations at the very least need to be published in order that we know where we stand on them.The Taoiseach said that the chief executive of the Health Service Executive can have the report.  He did not say whether he has already seen or being supplied with it.  Can the chief executive officer of the HSE do anything about the report, if it is privileged?  If there are issues that require attention within the HSE, issues of a managerial nature which require to be progressed within the HSE arising from the report, how does the chief executive officer of the HSE do that, if he is the only person who can see the report and if he cannot discuss it with the people directly involved?  This is nonsensical.  This is a cover-up of some kind.  I do not know what kind it is, but it is not acceptable.  It is something that should be put right.The Taoiseach did not answer the question I asked him about the out-of-hours service.  We have a problem in this country, which is adverted to in this report where, as I understand it, a garda superintendent attempted to make contact with the child care services of the HSE over the weekend but found those services did not activate until after the weekend.  I have had reports on that problem in regard to different cases, admittedly not as serious or tragic as this one, where gardaí, those in schools, people who are active in the community and sometimes families who have needed to get the assistance of the social services of the HSE have not been able to do so because they are not available out-of-hours, including at weekends.  That problem must be addressed.In respect of families who are at risk, sometimes the issues that arise and put families and children at risk arise much later in the evening than 5 p.m. and arise over the weekend period for a variety of reasons, which everybody in the House who has any understanding of this area of life knows full well.  There is no service available at those times.  That must be addressed urgently.One need only imagine the consequences if the fire service operated on that basis, that it only operated from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and not at night nor at the weekend, of if the Garda Síochána operated on the basis of providing a service from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday.  We are concerned here with children and their protection and the services which are supposed to be there to provide protection and support for families who are at risk.  This service is closed from 5 p.m. on a Friday until 9 a.m. on a Monday.  It appears, as much from the blacked out sections of this report as from what is contained in it, that is what happened here.

The mental health services, the acute hospital services, the GP services, all of these services are also available to assist in these matters if problems arise, in addition to what is now being proposed by the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, as a solution to the question of providing out-of-hours emergency care for children at extreme risk.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	76	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.Some 23 member of staff appointed to my Department are subject to temporary contracts which will expire when the office-holder concerned ceases to hold office.  In several cases, where the individuals concerned held Civil Service posts prior to their appointment, they will be entitled to return to their previous posts on termination of their appointments.The number of persons working on temporary contracts in the Central Statistics Office is 203.  The majority of such staff are involved in short term data collection operations for various CSO surveys.  In total, 105 contracts are due to expire by the end of 2009.  A total of 159 staff are employed as pricers to collect data one day per month to compile the consumer price index.From August 2009, due to the introduction of a revised collection process, 98 pricers will be employed.  A total of 40 staff, 32 enumerators and eight field supervisors, are working on a census of population pilot survey.  Their contracts will terminate by the end of May 2009.  The contracts of two staff employed as temporary tourist enumerators will expire by the end of May 2009.  In addition, the contracts of two contractors carrying out IT consultancy work will expire in May to June 2009.Four members of staff in the National Economic and Social Development Office are working on temporary contracts.  One of these contracts will expire in 2009.  In addition, the chairpersons of the National Economic and Social Forum and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance and the director of the National Economic and Social Council were appointed following the establishment of those bodies on a statutory basis.  The Law Reform Commission will discuss its staffing needs with the Department of Finance in order to ensure that an appropriate research function is maintained.  The Ireland Newfoundland Partnership employs one person on a temporary contract which is due to expire in April 2010.It is difficult to predict the exact numbers of vacancies which will arise by the end of the year.  However, I am aware that two officers of my Department are due to retire later this year.  It is not possible at present to estimate if any further vacancies will arise by the end of 2009.In keeping with the moratorium on recruitment and promotions in the public service which came into effect on 27 March 2009, no public service post, however arising, will be filled by recruitment, promotion or payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade.  Therefore, the vacancies arising in my Department will not be filled.  This may necessitate reviews of how staff are deployed within the Department to ensure that key activities are adequately staffed and the overall priorities of the Department are met.With regard to the National Economic and Social Development Office, one employee is currently employed on a three year contract which is due to expire shortly and this vacancy will not be filled.  The Central Statistics Office anticipates that six retirements will take place later this year, four of which are currently being processed.  The other two relate to staff reaching the mandatory retirement age of 65 years.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	77	I wish to raise two points with the Taoiseach.  First, are there any staff employed on a contract basis in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Office of the Attorney General who will be affected by this embargo?  Are there any staff on fixed-term contracts and when are they due to expire?  Is it intended to replace such staff?  Will the Taoiseach indicate what work is being carried out by such staff?Second, I ask the Taoiseach for his understanding of the terms of the decision on the embargo.  The circular issued by the Department of Finance on 27 March 2009, is very explicit in that no public service post, however arising, may be filled by recruitment, promotion or by the payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade.  I understand this is clear in respect of the situation where a person leaves, retires or the post becomes vacant, in that it is simply not to be filled and it is to be left vacant.  Nobody does that job or at least the post is not filled in the normal way.I want to ask specifically about the fixed-term contract jobs because the circular states that the decision also applies to temporary appointments on a fixed term basis and to the renewal of such contracts.  Is my understanding correct and is it the Taoiseach's understanding that what this decision means is that the jobs of everybody employed in any area of the public service, on anything other than a permanent contract of employment basis, will end and they will be let go when the contract expires?  Is this the position?  I ask the Taoiseach to answer specifically about the position regarding the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Office of the Attorney General.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	78	I do not have the specific information with regard to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Office of the Attorney General.  I can come back to the Deputy as to whether or not the couple of vacancies referred to in the general reply are in those offices.We are not concerned here with an embargo in that it does not imply that no filling of vacancies whatsoever can take place in any circumstances as that would be the effect of an embargo.  The Minister for Finance will have the authority to allow for the filling of some vacancies although in very exceptional circumstances.  The Government decision provides that vacancies may also be filled by redeployment of staff from other Departments or public bodies with the sanction of the Minister for Finance.  In addition, arrangements for the health and education sectors have been modulated to ensure that key services are maintained in so far as possible.  The moratorium decision also applies to temporary appointments on a fixed-term basis and the renewal of such contracts.  Any exceptions to this principle which will arise in very limited circumstances only require the prior sanction of the Minister for Finance which will be forthcoming only when he is satisfied that the post is essential to the delivery of a public service or performance of an essential function and that every effort has been made to fill the post by redeployment.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	79	I will await what the Taoiseach sends me in respect of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Office of the Attorney General.  Let me return to the general question.  Leaving aside the exceptions which the Minister for Finance may grant, will everybody on a fixed-term contract of six months or one, two or three years, or in temporary employment be let go?  For example, many hospitals have employed nurses on a fixed-term basis.  When these contracts expire, will the nurses be let go?  Is that the effect?  Is that the Taoiseach's understanding of what is contained in this circular?  Does he think, considering the extent to which fixed-term contracts have been used across the public service in recent years, front-line services can function in these circumstances?Take any road or public infrastructure project.  Most local authorities in the management of these projects employ a project engineer or a project manager, usually on a fixed-term basis.  When these contracts expire, will the project manager be let go and what will happen to the project?  Will county managers spend their time sending letters to the Minister for Finance seeking exceptions to the rule?  Will everybody on a fixed-term contract lose his or her job, no matter what area he or she works in?  Will he or she be let go on the date on which his or her contract expires?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	80	No, as I said in an earlier reply, arrangements for the health and education sectors have been modulated to ensure key services will be maintained in so far as possible.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	81	Does that mean the nurses can be kept on?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	82	Let me reply to the question.  There will be flexibility to allow for continued development of health care services, particularly primary and community care services, and services for the care of the elderly and people with disabilities.  Based on the 2008 employment outturn and the provision for development posts in the 2009 budget, the opening 2009 employment control ceiling for the health sector is 111,800.  There will be a general moratorium on recruitment, promotions and acting up appointments to all management and administrative grades and all other grades in the health sector, except hospital consultants, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, clinical psychologists, behavioural therapists, counsellors, social workers and emergency medical technicians.  Posts in these key grades which become vacant may be filled and a limited number of new posts may be created within the overall numbers ceiling and moratorium policy.  There will need to be a reduction in the number of posts in non-priority areas to compensate for the new posts created and we will need redeployment between institutions and the hospital and primary, community and continuing care sectors.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	83	In his comments yesterday the Taoiseach said priorities had to be decided on, which I accept.  However, I note his comment this morning that in this recruitment blockage positions will be allowed to be filled only in very exceptional circumstances.  The Taoiseach said that in health and education these were carefully "modulated to ensure key services will be maintained in so far as possible."  That is the overall principle on which he appears to be operating.  Let me bring to his attention an memo on community care given to me by Deputy Naughten from Roscommon?  The reduction in the community care budget is €6.5 million.  Will the Taoiseach listen on the impact in human terms of the recruitment embargo?  The memo states all posts are gone, even those in valuable front-line services such as nurses.  The Taoiseach uses the words "in so far as possible".  Respite services for the elderly will not be available.  Long stay geriatric hospitals and psychiatric services will see beds removed from the system.  Meals on wheels will not be provided for any new clients and may be withdrawn.  Only those "actively dying" — the phrase the HSE is using — are to receive home help.  What are we at?At last week's meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts the HSE director for primary, community and continuing care, Ms Laverne McGuinness, said the HSE had planned to employ thousands of allied health professionals to support hundreds of primary care teams in delivering diagnostic services and managing chronic diseases and ailments in the community.  However, she said that would not happen now.  Instead, most primary care teams will be made up of existing hospital-based staff transferred to community-based centres.  The HSE, on Government policy, was to establish 530 primary care teams on 200 sites by 2011.  This cannot happen.How does the Taoiseach's comment that positions in the health area have been modulated in order that key services can be maintained in so far as possible relate to Ms McGuinness's comment at the Committee of Public Accounts last week that these thousands of health care professionals will not be hired?  How does it relate to what is happening in Roscommon where, in the HSE's words, only those "actively dying" will receive home help?  That is not what the Taoiseach stands for, as far as I can figure out.  The sledgehammer the Minister for Finance has used will impact in human terms on thousands of the people concerned.  The Taoiseach might like to respond.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	84	The overall situation regarding the need to control numbers is that 36% of our total budget relates to pay.  This issue must be controlled and watched very carefully given the fact that the Government has to borrow €20 billion this year, in addition to the revenues it takes in to try to maintain services.  Fine Gael's critique has been that we are not cutting enough.  Its spokesperson on finance has said we have ducked decisions and need more cuts in expenditure, yet every expenditure control is criticised by Fine Gael as unnecessary.  That is a matter for it to figure out.We need to recognise that the moratorium has its effects.  Given the limited resources available to this or any other Government, we need to have greater flexibilities in the workplace, redeployment of staff and the ability to move staff around to various parts of the service in order that we can provide staff where the need is greatest.  That needs to happen and it requires continuing discussion and agreement with staff interests.  That will be necessary if we are to maintain services.  If there is no change in flexibility and putting in place redeployment policies, service levels will be affected.  The people for whom we provide the service will be the first to be affected if we do not get flexibility from those providing the service.  Whether in the health service or any other service, we must continue to work to get a greater degree of output for the available resources.  The level of resources available this year is €20 billion in excess of what the State is able to provide for itself within its current capacity.  Everybody, including all social partners, agree this must be addressed in the next number of years to bring it back to a situation whereby the public finances are sustainable.  If that is to happen — and it must — only by getting greater flexibilities in how we deploy our staff can we seek to maintain to the greatest possible extent the level of service in the priority areas where we want it.  In the absence of such flexibility and redeployment the only alternative whereby we can meet some of the issues raised by the Deputy is to increase levels of staff.  However, the position of the Deputy's party is that we have not cut back sufficiently on expenditure levels in order to deal with the wider problem in the public finances.  Which way does the Deputy wish to go?  We cannot go four ways at the same time and end up in a coherent position.

Deputies send their queries to the political section of the HSE.  They might get an answer in six weeks and the situation continues in the same way.The Government has failed to decide which are the real priorities, namely, children, the vulnerable, the dying, the intellectually challenged or those who need treatment.

We cannot go four ways at the same time and I realise that.  We are spending €16 billion on this system and it is not working.  During Leaders' Questions I asked the Taoiseach if he could stand over that as a way of delivering the kind of health service that people need.  I disagree fundamentally with the way it is being driven.  When I hear phrases from within the Health Service Executive down the country——

I have a question about the blockage created by the Minister for Finance whereby appointments can be made only in exceptional circumstances.  On Tuesday, the Government considered a range of issues dealing with crime, gang warfare and so on.  We have been calling for this for quite some time.  The situation now around the country is that there are vacancies for chief superintendents, superintendents and inspectors.

There are exceptional circumstances whereby the Minister might feel that redeployments, or whatever, might work out and assist in sorting out the problem.  That is not the case in the situation the Deputy mentioned, where there is an absence.  There are a number of options for Departments and organisations to consider.

How are exceptions to the embargo identified?  Are there specific categories for consideration or examination?  Are terms of reference set down within all Departments where potential exceptions might be considered?  Is it the case that all exceptions are referred for the personal sanction of the Minister for Finance?  Is it for his personal sanction?Does the Minister for Finance make the determinations in respect of certain categories?  Is there already a predetermined list of such categories for possible exception to the embargo or is he actively considering individual applications for exemption as they are sought by the Taoiseach's and all other Departments?We understand there was notification of the embargo a couple of months ago.  Does the Taoiseach know how many exception applications have been made by the Taoiseach's Department and by all other Departments to the Minister for Finance?  How many exception applications have been granted since the embargo was put in place?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	118	I am not aware that my Department has made any applications for exception.  These are matters best referred to the Minister for Finance.In order to achieve significant savings and costs in providing public services in the coming years there is a pressing need for greater flexibility and efficiencies in the allocation of resources.  It is intended that staff will be available to be reassigned to areas of greater priority, including where there are sudden surges of activity that cannot be met adequately by existing staff of the Departments or bodies concerned.  The decision on moratorium also applies to temporary appointments on a fixed-term basis and is renewable in respect of such contracts.Regarding the question of measures to be taken to monitor compliance, the Department of Finance will be contacting Departments and offices about more detailed arrangements for confirming compliance with the requirements of the moratorium.  If necessary, suitable measures can be incorporated in the administrative budget agreements.  Regarding the wider public service, the onus is on each Department to monitor implementation in bodies under its aegis.  As an initial step, each Department is required to communicate the terms of the moratorium immediately to all relevant bodies under its aegis and to send a copy of that communication to the Department of Finance.The Government is conscious of the need to protect certain services and that is why it has provided for a degree of flexibility, especially in the health and education sectors.  The focus of the provision for redeployment is to allow resources to be moved from activities that are no longer priority to areas of greater need.

The Ceann Comhairle will probably tell me I am not permitted to ask about the position regarding other Departments but I will attempt to do so.  Is the Taoiseach aware that exceptional applications are being made by other Departments?

At a time when we are facing serious economic challenges we now have the primary Department, whether the Department of the Taoiseach or any other, making a determination that an exception should apply, otherwise it would not be making the application in the first place.  It has gone through all of the rigours of examination in detail and made a decision to recommend that an exception should apply.The matter then goes to the Department of Finance.  I presume the Minister is not going through each of these applications on a personal basis.  One would have hoped he is much too busy to give such matters his personal attention.  Is another set of civil servants going through the whole process again, and going over the same detailed examination from another Department's perspective, making a second determination and giving the green light?  Is this not all very bureaucratic, unwieldy and unnecessary?  Surely the primary Department is the appropriate one to make the determination in relation to exceptional need.I should like if the embargo did not apply at all.  That is my position and I would argue strongly against it but given it is in place, can it not be fine-tuned to a point where we do not have unnecessary bureaucratic layers making a decision in regard to one person's approval to proceed in employment or have his or her contract renewed?  Will the Taoiseach not agree that it is unwieldy and unnecessary and that the primary Department should be left with the responsibility within its budget of determining the public need and the provision of the essential staff to provide it?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	124	No, I do not agree with that and past experience would confirm that it would not work.  There have to be controls and a policy laid out.  It is the job of Departments and agencies to support  and implement the policy.  When we talk about exceptional circumstances, that does not mean that every time a vacancy comes up a case is made to keep it.  The policy is implemented.  This means that in the majority of cases people will not be reassigned or replaced.  Cases are not being made for people to be kept on when the policy is that they should not be.  There is no need for a bureaucratic mist to descend, it is a question of implementing the policy.  That is the simple answer to the Deputy's questions.

The Deputy has no coherence to his position.  He keeps criticising me for implementing policies that are trying to bring control to our public finances, but from his perspective he wants to continue on with the idea that it is "game on" as usual.  The fact that we are borrowing €20 billion more this year than we are taking in is not his issue.

That is the way it works.With regard to the question the Deputy asked, I have explained to him that a moratorium is in place.  I have explained in detail how it would work.  The Deputy does not agree with it, he has the luxury of sitting on the back benches opposite and agreeing with nothing if he wants.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	131	I believe the Taoiseach has explained the thinking behind the whole approach of not renewing fixed-term contracts, and thousands of people are becoming unemployed as a consequence.  To take an example, the contracts of five members of staff at my local recycling centre are coming to an end.  There is a great amount of community support for the retention of these staff and they were invigorated in their campaign to renew their contracts when they received a letter signed by the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen.  In the letter, the Taoiseach writes that the council has been asked to depart from its initial plans and to renew the contracts of the existing temporary staff in Bray Recycling Centre.  It concludes: “I hope that with the support of people like yourself, that a positive outcome may emerge from the current review of the council’s plans.”  It ends, “With best wishes, Yours sincerely, Brian Cowen”.The staff got great heart from the Taoiseach's letter but it seems to me there is some ambiguity or confusion now because his Department does not seem to be clear about what is happening.  The letter seems to me to be very clear to the effect that the Taoiseach is ensuring that the council will review its plans to hold retain these staff.  Will the Taoiseach explain precisely his position regarding the five members of staff that he has written about and who have received this letter, consequent to a deputation from my town of Bray that met him?  They attended his clinic and he wrote the letter to Mr. Damien Meaney on 29 April.  When it was presented to the members of the staff they were enormously heartened because it was clear to them that the Taoiseach was saying in his letter that a review was being called for by the council and that it should, in effect, back-track on its initial plans not to renew the contracts.

It is also of great concern to the clients of the front line services which may be affected.  I am constantly asked, by people who are likely to be affected by the termination of short-term contracts, what I think will happen.For example, I was approached by 11 staff who are on fixed-term contracts in An Bord Altranais, which registers the nursing profession.  Will their contracts be discontinued?  What am I to say to them?  The Taoiseach spoke about other staff being moved in to do certain jobs.  Is it intended, for example, to move staff from the Department of Health and Children to An Bord Altranais and to let the contract staff go?These contracts are coming up for renewal.  When the decision was taken and the circular sent out, the termination of contracts was thought of in general terms.  It is now becoming a reality and people want to know where they stand.  What is the answer?  The Taoiseach spoke about exceptions.  Is there a list of these exceptions?  Do the respective Departments and agencies have flexibility in the implementation of the circular?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	149	I have been as helpful as possible to Deputies, beyond the remit of my own Department.  In previous replies I outlined how the modulation is expected to work in the health sector for example.  I have indicated the areas where a degree of flexibility is being applied.A fixed term contract does not provide for an automatic entitlement to renewal.  As with anyone on a fixed term contract, management will inform contract holders whether they will be kept on or not.  That will be a matter for management.  If the body concerned is under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children the matter will be worked out with the Department itself.The implementation of the moratorium is outlined by the Department of Finance in those areas generally.  In respect of specific issues which arise, it is a matter for the Department concerned to determine whether there will be any prospect of renewal.  The moratorium refers to all contracts, including fixed-term contracts.  Therefore, the question of exceptional circumstances will arise and provision must be made for redeployment so that essential priority areas are catered for within existing staff complements.

Questions relating to this matter in general should be directed to the Minister for Finance.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	151	I will be brief as there is very little time left.  I understand the missive issued uses the word "indefinite".  Can the Taoiseach give us some sense of his own expectation of the duration of the embargo?  Was this discussed at Cabinet when the decision to introduce the embargo was taken in March?  Was serious consideration given to the duration of the embargo?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	152	This policy must be implemented as part of control measures necessary in view of the public finance position.  It will require a degree of flexibility by everyone concerned, including management and staff, in the interest of making sure that those who depend on the provision of public services are not unduly compromised.  That is the challenge before all of us in the provision of public services in the years ahead.  Any suggestion that we can simply proceed on the basis of existing arrangements and that more resources will be provided, regardless of what Government is in office in the next five or ten years, does not take account of reality.  Redeployment, flexibility and avoidance of duplication are absolute imperatives in ensuring that we get the best possible value for limited government resources in the provision of basic public services.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	154	The arrangement will remain in place for the foreseeable future.  We must find ways which do not assume that extra staff will be provided, regardless of any other consideration.  Government must reprioritise and everyone must work within the new realities.  The Government has an expenditure position vis-à-vis an income position which is not sustainable in the long term and must be managed and reduced, as agreed, over the next three to four years.  Within those constraints, we must find new ways of providing basic public services.  We cannot provide the same level of service by going on as things stand and based on existing agreements.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	155	Does the embargo on fixed-term contracts apply to services which have been contracted out?  For example, if one Department employs cleaners on fixed-term contracts, under the terms of the embargo those cleaners must be let go.  If another Department engages contract cleaners, would that contract also expire under the terms of the embargo?  The same might apply to two hospitals, one of which employs nurses on fixed-term contracts while the other employs nurses through an agency.  Are contracts entered into with an agency covered by the embargo and must they be terminated also?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	156	The detail will be dealt with by the Minister for Finance.  The general principle is that all fixed term contracts must be dealt with on the basis of the moratorium when they come up for renewal.  Where basic services must be provided it is a matter for management to decide how that will be done.  Within many organisations greater efficiency and effectiveness in the provision of front line services and their maintenance at their current level can be achieved by simply not having staff complements dealing with all types of ancillary services.  It might be more effective to organise matters otherwise.  That system is in place in many areas of the public service and is an integral part of how we manage service on fixed budgets.

A further 155,000 people applied for benefit in the first three months of this year, representing an 80% increase on the same period in 2008.  Rapidly escalating live register figures are impacting on such claims, which are part of the supposed cradle to the grave social provision.  This is now under attack due to Government cutbacks but is a lifeline for those forced out of employment.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	162	I welcome the fact that the Government is moving the writ for the by-elections in Dublin Central and Dublin South and I note that it is proposed to be taken without debate.  We have had two debates on the writ already, one in respect of a Labour Party motion some time after Christmas, in which we sought to move the writ and, more recently, a Fine Gael motion some two or three weeks ago which sought to move the writ.  The Taoiseach indicated very strongly yesterday that he does not like talk in the House about elections, a new disposition for the Taoiseach.  The year in office has had a terrible effect on him.  He used to love elections and debating elections and it is dreadful to see this happening to him.  However, in deference to his desire not to discuss elections I agree to have the two motions taken without debate.

The reason I ask is to do with candidates and election posters.  Some of these people have been fined already.  We wish to comply with the rules, but we cannot do anything until the Minister makes an order naming the date.  When does he expect to do so?

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	167	We are in a situation where the Finance Bill will get the most cursory review.  Essentially, there is no opportunity to have a proper, full Second Stage debate, not simply on the content of the Finance Bill but the commitments made by the Minister at budget time, for example, to either tax or means test child benefit.  There is no opportunity to have a debate in the House about such a significant change in Government policy and whether it can technically be implemented.  Women in Ireland deserve an opportunity to hear what the Government has in prospect for them.  The one benefit women rearing children get from the State is child benefit but the Government is preparing to launch an all-out assault.  There is no opportunity for women Members to contribute to the debate.  We oppose the guillotine.There is also the situation in respect to the tax changes proposed by the Obama Administration in the United States.  There will be no opportunity whatever to debate the implication of these and what the Government proposes in respect of them.  The Minister for Finance acknowledged yesterday that the average, effective tax take for a family on an income of €80,000 is 36%.  The marginal rate will be from 51% to 53%.

The proposal to guillotine Second Stage of the Finance Bill at 7 p.m. will ensure there will be very limited participation and that the vast number of Deputies will not have a chance to contribute to Second Stage of the legislation.  This is very important legislation, an outworking of the supplementary budget of 7 April.  It has significant consequences for low and middle income families placing an extra steep and stiff burden on their already hard-pressed condition.However, with all that is entailed in the Bill, there is no provision whatsoever for the National Asset Management Agency.  As legislators, we are expected to allow the Government to proceed with the proposition without any legislative basis whatsoever.  A burden is being placed on the citizenry of the State that will have potentially serious consequences for all citizens for many years to come.  This is, yet again, another lost opportunity for any real proposals in the area of job retention and creation.  The Government has completely failed to address this essential and integral part of any effort to deal with the current difficulties in the economy and to rejuvenate economic activity throughout the State.

That was my experience when I held that position and it is one fully taken up by members of that committee.  The Bill can then return to the House for Report Stage.  The provisions in the Finance Bill are as outlined in the budget.  Any other legislation required in respect of other announcements made in the budget will be forthcoming in due course.  The question of how we extend the taxation base in the country will be taken by Government in future budgets, taking into account whatever ideas or recommendations may emerge from the Commission on Taxation.

Does he have an idea whether it will be at the end of September, in October or possibly later?  Will the Bill giving effect to the referendum include a clause requiring parties or organisations that intend to campaign in that referendum to produce evidence of where their funding comes from?

Until such time as the June Council meeting is finished and we see what is being provided by colleagues at the European Council in respect of the reassurances we sought and it was agreed at the December Council we should get, the question of calling a date for a referendum is premature.  The position of the Government is that on the basis of obtaining and giving legal effect to many of these commitments, we would then be in a position to consider favourably the question of a further referendum.  It is an issue we should defer until after the June Council meeting.On the question of levelling the playing pitch for everybody, it is something we should all work towards.

Certainly, there is more information in today's The Irish Times, namely, that the Government is apparently negotiating a protocol that would be introduced with some future accession treaty for Croatia, which is more than the Taoiseach has said in the House.  We have no idea of what the content of the guarantees might be and there is no opportunity to debate the matter in the House.  When will that happen?What is indicated in the media today is that the Taoiseach would present something of a fait accompli at the summit on 15 June.  When will we have an opportunity to know what is in the mind of the Taoiseach in regard to the content and method of implementation?  This House and the Opposition parties deserve to know.  Nothing at all has taken place since the middle of December last in regard to informing, discussing or consulting with the other Members of this House as to the intentions of the Taoiseach and what direction he is taking.  If he negotiates a deal with the other countries without discussing it in this House, what will happen?  We do not want a repeat of the situation which happened the last time.

I have asked time and again in the House in regard to how it is intended to present legally binding guarantees, how it is proposed to have such in place, what methodology will apply and how will that come to pass, and what specific areas are being addressed by the Taoiseach and his representatives who are engaging with the other European member states.  These matters must be addressed in this House and, irrespective of one's position on the Lisbon treaty and the first referendum, we all have a shared entitlement to that full exposure and to a proper debate on these matters in this Chamber.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	181	In the normal way, statements were made after every European Council meeting as to what took place.  We had that debate in the House and the position was clear.  I outlined to the House that political undertakings had been given to the Government and we believed that if they were transposed in the way we sought and agreed by the June Council, we would be prepared to call a referendum.  I also indicated we have to work with the Presidency in that matter and there have been a number of developments in regard to the current Presidency.  We took the opportunity in Prague last week to again discuss that issue with the outgoing Prime Minister and the newly appointed Prime Minister, Mr. Fischer.  We are working with the legal services division, the Commission and the Presidency and we must get agreement from other member states as to the exact wording they will agree to, based on the undertakings we have received.  When we know there is a consensus emerging on that, we can then conduct a discussion at home prior to the Council meeting taking place.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	182	There is only a month until the summit.  The Taoiseach has indicated he intends to have everything tied up at the summit so whatever guarantees are agreed will be approved at the summit by the 27 leaders, and that is the end of it.  Will we have a debate in this House prior to the Taoiseach going to that summit in the middle of June, making the arrangements with the other countries and agreeing the way forward?  We could find ourselves in a situation where issues are agreed that this House has not discussed and we would have no opportunity to make our views heard.  For example, we have not heard one word about the workers' rights issue and we do not know whether the Taoiseach will proceed with a protocol.  These are legal guarantees.  None of the issues raised in media reports has been the subject of discussion in this House because we have had no opportunity to do so.  What has been going on behind the scenes may have been going on since the middle of December but we do not know anything about it.  When will we know about it?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	183	We obtained commitments last December from member states as to the nature of the reassurances they were in a position to give, short of re-ratifying the treaty themselves.  That is the situation.  We are now dealing with the wording and drafting to give expression to that so a decision can be made at the June Council in regard to these matters.As the Deputy knows, in the aftermath of the December Council discussion we outlined our position in regard to each and every one of those matters, including the issue on workers' rights.  We have set that out on the record of the House.  The technical work that must be done is ongoing.  We must make sure that all other member states agree to the texts so we can give effect to the undertakings we received in December.  That work is ongoing, primarily through the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State with special responsibility for European Affairs.  As soon as the finalisation of that process comes about, which we would hope will happen in the coming weeks, we can explain what it is that member states are prepared to agree to, based on the undertakings we have received.

That was over five weeks ago, but it has not been established yet.  No legislation has been published for it and the Government has now rejected the sensible proposal being put forward by the Labour Party for an alternative way of dealing with the banking crisis.  When will the legislation to establish an bord bailout be brought before the House?

The matter is being dealt with as a priority in the Department of Finance.  Interim arrangements regarding preparation of the work that will be conducted by the NAMA are being undertaken by the Minister.  There is also a debate underway in the House where these matters are being discussed.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	188	Given the recent announcement by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, that directly elected lord mayors would be put in place, has this proposal been agreed by the Government?  Will it require legislation and if so, when can we expect to see it?  I believe a sum of €250,000 per year has been agreed for this post, or that this sum has been suggested by the Minister.

Householders have just received a further bill for a sinking fund for €500, which they are legally obliged to pay.  The only service provided is that the grass is cut, but not very well.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider the urgency of stopping this rip-off of young families in housing estates, particularly when there are no apartments on the estate and no need for a management company.  Will he bring forward the legislation on management companies as soon as possible?  Will he give us a date for the legislation rather than say "as soon as possible"  or "this session", as we have been hearing such responses for a long time?It is four years since we started calling for this legislation in the House.  I am aware the Taoiseach has said the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is the person responsible and am aware that Department has a busy legislative programme, or used to have.  However, will he indicate when we will see some direction in this area so that we can provide precise advice to these people?

Has the Government considered that matter and when is it likely to be brought before the House?The recent budget provided for a charge on second homes.  When will the charge on a non-principal private residence be given legislative effect?  The upward-only rent structure is beginning to have a major impact on employment.

While I took heed of the Taoiseach's responses to the Leaders' questions put to him this morning, I note the HSE indicated this morning it had not received a copy of the uncensored report, even though the Taoiseach had indicated it would be available to the CEO of the HSE.  There was, also, a lack of clarity with regard to that exchange earlier.  Apparently, the report has not been received.  Will the Taoiseach comment on that?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	203	I call Deputies Kehoe and Neville on the same issue.

The report must be discussed in the Dáil as soon as possible.  Would the Taoiseach be in favour of making time available through the Office of the Whip to have the report debated or to have statements in the House so we can ensure its recommendations are implemented?  This is a significant issue and we do not want to see what happened in Monageer happen anywhere else.  We must take steps to have this debate as soon as possible.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	205	I support the request that this issue be debated as soon as possible, perhaps tomorrow.  Clear suicide ideation and intention were expressed by the father of that family and picked up by the funeral undertaker, but the psychiatric services were not engaged.  They should have been engaged immediately, with regard to the psychiatric condition of the father in particular.  That was not done.  We should have a full debate on all issues, including the failure to involve the psychiatric services which could have saved that family.

I also support what my party leader, Deputy Gilmore, said that a mechanism should be found to publish the full report, perhaps through the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children.  Will the Taoiseach indicate whether the Government will review again the failure to publish all of the recommendations of the report?  Whatever about the rest of the material in the report, it is inexplicable that the recommendations have not been published in full.  Will the Taoiseach respond on that and will the Government review the failure to publish the full recommendations so that we can learn from this event?Will the Government also review the decision to continue not to support the idea of having full social service out-of-hours at weekends when these kinds of issues arise?

It is remarkable that some of the recommendations were deleted from public view.  I ask the Taoiseach to ensure that some mechanism is found whereby we can know all of the recommendations made by those who formulated the report.  The recommendations were independent and objective and for them to be deleted is most regrettable.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	210	To make the point again, the recommendations that were redacted were done so on the basis that the manner in which the report was brought forward meant there were legal issues arising with regard to those aspects, as there were with regard to the narrative itself.  It is not a question of censoring the report, but a question of having to act on legal advice in terms of what information can be made available consistent with the protection of everyone's rights in these matters, including the families concerned.  These are the reasons behind the decision and there is no other reason.  I wish to make that very clear.Now the report has been published, the question of a debate in the House is a matter for discussion by the Whips.  That issue can be taken up in the normal way in terms of how published reports might be debated in the House, if that is deemed appropriate.  On the question of the HSE and the chief executive officer, there is a statutory duty of care that puts him in a privileged position.  The Attorney General confirmed that to us recently and the report will be made available to him on that basis.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	211	Two issues arise in connection with promised legislation.  In an unprecedented display 5,000 people wearing red jerseys walked on the streets of Limerick last Sunday in a plea to the Government to deal with gangland crime and criminal activity.  In response, after the march, the Minister for Defence, on behalf of the Government, promised new legislation which the Cabinet was to approve yesterday.  Has it approved such legislation?  When will it be published and enacted?  Is the Taoiseach prepared to give the details of the legislation the Minister described?A new crime of blasphemy has been reached on Committee Stage but to date has not been defined in law.  The House did not debate the matter on Second Stage because it was a new measure in the form of an amendment that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform suddenly introduced.  Does it represent Government policy?  The Taoiseach might note the comments of the Green Party Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources who appeared somewhat surprised by and less than supportive of the measure.  Will the Taoiseach detail why the legislation is being brought forward now and confirm that it has the full support of the Government?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	212	The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform brings forward such legislative matters on behalf of the Government.  In respect of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill, while the Garda Síochána has been successful in arresting and achieving the conviction of gang members, this has not stopped people involved with gangs committing further acts of violence and engaging in intimidation.  Recent killings of citizens and relatives of persons who have given evidence against gang members are attempts to intimidate witnesses and undermine the criminal justice system.  This demands a response from the State.  Several measures have been introduced to address organised crime, including the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill 2009.  I confirm that at its meeting this week the Government discussed a series of legislative proposals from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, including measures to deal specifically with gang-related crime.  Details of these proposals will be announced in due course.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	219	The Taoiseach's predecessor, Deputy Bertie Ahern, gave a commitment to televising the proceedings of the House and its committees.  Those of us who have been cavassing on the doorstep for the past couple of weeks realise that not alone is there an information deficit about the Lisbon treaty but also in respect of what happens here and at committee meetings.  This stretches to people writing articles in newspapers who have no knowledge of what committees do.  Will we proceed with televising the good work committees do?  Many hours are spent there, yet nobody knows what exactly is going on.  For example, last week the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service spent two and a half hours discussing with two professors the National Asset Management Agency.  It was a very informative meeting in which there was good participation by committee members.  We might as well have been sitting in private.  When will we start to televise meetings as most other parliaments do?  It would not cost a great deal of money.  The cameras are here.  There are 54 television stations available today.  We might as well have 55 and at least give people the option of tuning in and arriving at a correct appraisal of what happens in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Will the Taoiseach please honour this commitment as quickly as possible?

The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is making some timid efforts to raise his voice in respect of the rising level of crime but he is not proceeding with the legislative programme, nor is he raising his voice sufficiently because those involved in organised crime know that they are unassailable and can continue.  Will the Taoiseach tell the House whether the Cabinet has discussed the heads of the Bill and, if not, why not?

The House is united in doing all it can within the terms of the Constitution to ensure we deal with those who would attack the democratic institutions of the State by the intimidation of witnesses and jurors and that we bring forward proposals to assist in every way we can the Garda Síochána which is achieving a fair measure of success and whose members have all our support.

#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	234	I very much welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on Second Stage of the Finance Bill 2009, one of the most important and difficult Finance Bills any Minister for Finance has had to introduce in the House in modern times.  The key tasks facing the Government in terms of the economy and the public finances are restoring stability to the public finances as a matter of priority; dealing with the serious issues affecting the banking system through the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency to rid the system of the property-related loans clogging it at present; revaluing our cost base to ensure that, when we emerge from the recession, it will be more competitive and position the country in such a way that it can benefit in a very positive way from the economic upturn when it arrives, and taking whatever steps are necessary to support enterprise and those in employment and to support every initiative that creates further employment.The backdrop to the Finance Bill is formed by what is probably the most adverse set of global economic conditions in modern times.  In this regard, one should consider the statistics on GDP contraction among some of our main trading partners in 2009.  In Germany the figure is to be in excess of 5%; France, 3.3%; Italy, 4.3%; the United Kingdom, almost 4%, and the United States, 4%.  World trade is expected to contract in 2009 by in excess of 13%, according to a recent OECD publication. This highlights the difficulties the economy is facing.  The economic contraction is placing unprecedented pressure on Ireland's public finances.  The International Monetary Fund has predicted that advanced global economies will contract by 3.75% in 2009.  The performance of the Irish economy, a very small, open economy, is linked directly to the performance of global trade.  One might ask why Ireland is to expect a contraction of 8% in 2009 when some of our main trading partners are to expect contractions of 3%, 4% or 5%.  The fact is that global trade will decrease by an expected 13%.  We have a particularly small, open economy with a very limited domestic market.  We have an export-led economy and the growth we experienced in the Celtic tiger years was driven by exports and a boom in the property sector.  Those exports are now under severe pressure.  It is inevitable that we will be hit harder than many of our trading partners because of the small and open nature of our economy.  We are expected to experience a contraction of approximately 8% this year which, by any measure, is very sharp.  This and the measures the Government must introduce as a consequence will have very serious implications for every family and the public finances, as we have seen.It is clear that the way to achieve economic recovery in Ireland is by putting the public finances back on a stable footing.  The measures in the Finance Bill are fundamental to creating the necessary conditions.  We must get the public finances in order and simply cannot expect to build a base for economic recovery on a deficit of €20 billion.  The deficit will grow a lot more in the years ahead if the Government does not take the corrective action it is proposing in the Bill.  That is why in January the Government made a very detailed submission to the European Commission setting out a programme which will take us through to 2013 to return the public finances to the requirement stipulated in the Stability and Growth Pact, namely, a 3% deficit within the next four years.  This is a very difficult challenge and will require significant shifts in fiscal policy, a broadening of the tax base and cuts in expenditure.  The Government has taken very serious steps towards achieving this goal.  It is heartening to note some of the comments made by the European Commission that have endorsed the Government's plans and commended it on taking what are extremely unpopular, unpalatable and difficult decisions.  These decisions affect everyone in the country but are essential in the long-term interests of the economy.  We have no choice but to make them in the longer term.While people are to have less money in their pockets arising from the decisions taken in the Finance Bill, it is worth noting that prices are falling.  The consumer price index is expected to fall by almost 4% in 2009.  The purchasing power people will have, albeit with less money in their pockets, should be maintained in real terms vis-à-vis the prices that prevailed until now and the new prices that have emerged.  I very much welcome the recent announcement by Tesco to reduce the prices of grocery products significantly right across the board.  This must be replicated throughout the economy in order that families who experience the pain of extra levies and taxes will still be able to afford essential goods and services such that they can continue to run their homes.It is important to say the economic cycle will take its course and the wheel will turn once again.  The economy must be ready and well positioned to capitalise on the upturn when it arrives.  It is important that we do not allow a spiral of negativity to take a stranglehold on the economy.  I was heartened to hear on 9 April an interview on "Morning Ireland" with Mr. Peter Sutherland who I am sure everyone in the House will agree knows a thing or two about economics.  The transcript of the interview is worth reading by all.  Mr. Sutherland highlighted a number of strengths of the economy.  He essentially said we needed to be more positive and focus on our strengths and make the decisions required to work our way through the crisis. He stated, for example, that if 100 was to be taken as the average GDP per capita in the European Union, the average for Ireland, following an expected decline of 8% in 2009, would be approximately 135.  The averages for the United Kingdom and Germany would be between 114 and 117, while that for Japan would be 107. He said that, in 2009, Ireland’s exports were expected to decrease by approximately 5.9%. Other countries with which we trade significantly are to experience greater decreases. The exports of Germany, for example, are to decrease by 16.5%, while those of Italy are expected to decrease by 15.9% and the United Kingdom by just under 10%. These are important comparisons that we need to bear in mind.  While it is true Ireland is in a very grave position, so too are all of our main trading partners throughout the world.  Many are suffering to an even greater extent in terms of their exports.  The necessary recovery from the recession will be export-led.  Mr. Sutherland also states we must stop talking ourselves down excessively, while recognising the pain of the remedies everybody is facing which will bring a great deal of negative comment.  We need to bear in mind what he said because he has had tremendous economic experience in very large companies throughout the world.Many have money to spend and invest but are not doing so because of the negativity and lack of confidence in the economy and the constant downplaying of our strengths and highlighting of our weaknesses.  Tax increases are unavoidable and must play a role in helping the country work its way out of the recession by putting the public finances back in order.  To suggest to the people that there is another way out of the recession and that there is a way of making the €20 billion deficit disappear in 2009 would be to mislead them.  There is no easy or cost-free option that will result in the regrowth of the economy.  It will not do so as long as the public finances are in decline.  We must arrest that decline and put the public finances on the path to recovery.I listened with interest in recent weeks to some of the comments of Deputy Bruton following the budget.  He stated people on the average industrial wage would be paying tax at a rate of 51%.  Yes, it is true they will be paying tax at 51% on a small part of their income, if one adds up income tax, levies, PRSI and so forth, but the real measure of the amount of tax a person pays is the total of all of the elements expressed as a percentage of his or her total income.  This gives the effective tax rate.I will give a few examples if the Acting Chairman will allow me.  Under the measures in the supplementary budget, a person on €40,000, which is just over the average industrial wage, will have an effective rate of tax of 22.1%.  In 1997, when Fianna Fáil came into power, that person was paying 40.6% tax.  Thus, the rate of tax he or she is paying on that income has effectively halved in that time.  Deputy Burton stated on the Order of Business that we have taxation levels akin to those of the 1980s.

Deputy Richard Bruton said a person on the average industrial wage was paying tax of 51%.  Yes, he or she is, on a tiny proportion of his or her income.  A person on €40,000 is paying an effective rate of tax of 22.1% following the supplementary budget.  The equivalent in 1997 was more than 40%.  We have brought taxation levels back to those which pertained between 2005 and 2006.  In 2005 this person was paying 24%; in 2006 he or she was paying 21.9%.  Thus, we are now back to 2005-06 levels.Let us take another example of a married couple with two children and one income of €60,000.  In 1997 they had an effective rate of tax of 36%.  Under the supplementary budget measures, their effective tax rate is 24%.

Again, this couple is going back to levels of taxation that pertained in 2004-05.  In a final example, a married couple earning €100,000 in two incomes, with two children, had an effective rate of tax of 42.6% in 1997, but under the measures in the supplementary budget they now have an effective tax rate of 27.9%.

#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	281	When I am on doorsteps people often ask me why middle income families are being hit.  This is a difficulty for any government.  The majority of people are within that category and if we want to make a serious effort to restore stability to the public finances we cannot, unfortunately, ignore the large swathe of the population that occupies the middle-income bracket.  Yes, they are being asked to make a significant contribution to bringing stability to the public finances, as is everyone who is living in this country and working within our economy.I welcome the Minister's decision not to back-tax redundancy payments from the first four months of the year at the higher income levy rate, which would have been unfair.  I raised this issue personally with the Minister and at parliamentary party meetings, and I am pleased he has taken this on board and has agreed not to backdate the higher income levy for redundancy payments.There will be some issues with the administration of the income levy and the composite rate that has now been set.  If we take, for example, a person who is generally a PAYE worker but receives a bonus in the first few months of the year, will he or she be required at the end of the year to file a tax return?  If he or she does not do so, will the Revenue Commissioners take action?  Could he or she potentially have an outstanding tax liability?  Some powers are being devolved to the Revenue Commissioners to deal with that issue and I have full confidence in them to do so.  It is important they are given that opportunity.The Minister has also announced the termination of some property-related accelerated capital allowance tax relief schemes, particularly in the area of nursing homes, which will save approximately €60 million in a full year.  I welcome the transitional arrangements that have been set out in the Bill, because there are some important projects in the pipeline and they should be given the opportunity to be completed.  They were planned on the basis of reliefs and allowances that currently exist and I welcome the fact that these are being phased out rather than terminated suddenly.The Minister has engaged with the motor industry and he announced on budget day a shift in VAT policy whereby the industry would be allowed to move to the margin scheme.  However, some further engagement has taken place since then and that change will not now be implemented.  However, the Minister indicated in his Second Stage speech that he would continue to engage with the industry, particularly with regard to the overhang of second hand vehicles which are clogging up forecourts at the moment.  If the Minister can find a fair mechanism for assisting the industry to get out of this crisis it will be welcome.  Every TD with dealerships in his or her constituency will be aware of job losses and the 60% to 70% drop in sales that they have experienced.  Other sectors are also facing such difficulties, but there are particular issues in the motor industry.  I ask the Minister to re-examine the area and identify policy instruments that could help the industry to work its way through these difficulties.Do I have much time left, a Chathaoirligh?
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	282	The Deputy has two minutes, but if he is not finished I will allow him another minute.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	283	That is fine.Much has been said about what happened in the good times when Exchequer surpluses were being returned every year.  It is important to put on the record all the good things the Government did at that time, including the significant reduction in the national debt to among the lowest in the EU, which has given us the capacity to borrow at a time when we need to if we are to work our way through the current financial difficulties.  We dramatically reduced the burden of direct taxation — the higher rate of income tax went from 48% to 41% and the lower rate went from 27% to 20%.  This is forgotten.  If we consider the effective rates of tax that I mentioned earlier, we are taking people back to 2004-06 levels.  This is based on the statistics published by the Department of Finance.We established the National Pensions Reserve Fund and invested significantly in it.  We dramatically expanded the numbers in front line services, including teachers, gardaí and nurses, and we invested massively in the infrastructure of the country.  Clearly, the money was spent in important areas, and we have benefited from that.  However, we are now in a different situation.  The significant issues in the banking system must be resolved as a matter of urgency and supports must be given to assist companies in maintaining employment, attracting new people and supporting new employment.  This is essential.  One of the key areas in which we must emerge from the recession in a better position is our cost base and competitiveness.  The economic cycle will move on, but if we are not in a position to avail of the upturn when it arises we will not have availed of the opportunity afforded by this recession to reposition our economy, to become leaner and more competitive and to move into the industries that will characterise and dominate this century.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	284	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The Minister for Finance claims it is designed to protect jobs and build confidence but this is not the case, it is more of the same of what we have got from the Government over the last two budgets.  It squeezes every last penny from lower and middle income families and does little to stimulate the economy or restore confidence.Deputy Michael McGrath mentioned the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party meetings and the work Fianna Fáil backbenchers have done to secure U-turns from the Minister on some aspects of the budget.  I welcome some of those, particularly the U-turn on the income levy.My constituency colleague, Deputy Dooley, was very concerned about the Fine Gael candidate in Dublin South, George Lee.  He should be more concerned about the Government's failure to deal with this crisis instead of grumbling about the selection of Mr. Lee as a candidate in the forthcoming by-election.  Mr. Lee wants a new direction for Ireland and the people of the State will soon have an opportunity to pass judgment on the Government's record.  From what I hear on the doorsteps, the people are waiting in the long grass for the opportunity.The Minister has included a welcome amendment to the Bill to extend the deadline for applications for the mid-Shannon corridor tourism investment scheme.  This scheme has the potential to bring significant employment along the Shannon basin, particularly in east County Clare.  Tourism is vital to the area and will continue to be important because it has so much to offer.  There is huge scope for further development.  I welcome the Minister taking on board my concerns for this scheme because projects could have been put in jeopardy had the deadline not been extended.  The success and benefits of the scheme, however, can only be assured if these projects secure credit, something which is proving difficult in the current environment.I do not understand why the Minister is persisting with the air travel tax when the aviation sector is in free-fall.  The introduction of any tax on air travel at this time is counter productive.  Yesterday Dublin Airport Authority announced 400 jobs will be lost at Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports.  Questions must be answered about the mismanagement of the authority and the Minister for Transport must explain the situation in the House.This is a huge blow to the aviation sector, coming so soon after the major restructuring in Shannon, which led to the loss of 200 jobs.  It is hard to see where further cuts can be made when staff have already made huge sacrifices.  Ryanair has already curtailed services at Shannon Airport, reducing the number of aircraft from six to four.  This morning Aer Lingus announced that it is going to reduce the number of aircraft based at Belfast International Airport.  We told the Minister for Transport this would happen a year ago when Aer Lingus opened a new base for aircraft at the expense of the Shannon-Heathrow route.  It was the first Aer Lingus base outside Ireland and it was the beginning of the end.Having said that, we must protect Aer Lingus.  It is a valuable airline and we do not want it to disappear. It is vital for the country to have an airline, particularly on trans-Atlantic routes that could otherwise be cut.  Aer Lingus states there is poor consumer demand but I fear there will be further cut-backs in services at all our airports and as airlines struggle to retain passengers at this difficult time.The introduction of tax relief to support research and development, including intellectual property, as a means of supporting the smart economy, is welcome.  The aim is to make Ireland the innovation capital of Europe and the Bill could allow US multinationals that establish Irish subsidiary companies to acquire intra-group intangible assets.There is an important research and development facility in my area, the Intel plant in Shannon.  Recently Intel announced an investment of €50 million in the research and development facility, creating 134 extra jobs over the next four years.  I was at the opening with the Tánaiste, Deputy Coughlan, and we were given a tour of the facility, which was very impressive.  It is a state of the art operation and over 75% of the employees have higher level qualifications in science, engineering and technology.  We must continue to invest in third level institutions.  The future is bright for science graduates and the Government must make the necessary resources available to the colleges so we can continue to produce such graduates.Three weeks ago I visited Israel with my party leader, Deputy Enda Kenny.  We met the manager of Intel there, which employs 6.500 in Israel, similar to the numbers in Leixlip and Shannon.  The company is looking at employment costs — it has opened a new plant in India, where it can employ ten engineers for the same cost as one engineer in Ireland.  That demonstrates the competition we face.  The good thing about Intel, however, is that many of the Irish workers travel to the plant in Jerusalem for specialised training and any initiative like this would help attract foreign direct investment in this high end of the market and is welcome.That is why I welcome the Shannon Development proposal to develop the Shannon estuary.  In February I highlighted the potential of the mid-west region for renewable energy resources and I urge the Minister to support the initiatives to help the region become a centre of excellence.  The Shannon Development proposal points to the fact that there are 100 companies employing 7,100 in the Shannon free zone, generating €3.5 billion in sales, 94% of which are destined for export markets.  It also highlighted the high profile job losses at Molex, Element Six and Avocent.  There is huge potential in this area and I urge the Government to support these initiatives because there are enormous possibilities for job creation in the area.The Spirit of Ireland is another programme that could help economic revival in the midwest, particularly in County Clare.  We must make more use of wave and wind energy in the Shannon estuary and, if captured, it could make a major contribution to meet our national electricity demand, making us less dependent on fossil fuels.  The Minister for Finance met the consortium, as did Deputies Coveney and Hogan.  The project is massive in scale and it has the potential to create thousands of jobs.  I ask the Minister to take a serious look at the project and to ensure every support and encouragement is given to it.Jobs are the main issue, as we are hearing on the doorsteps every day.  It is vital that we support job creation initiatives if we are to fight back.  The Government has no job strategy and the budget had nothing to offer.  People are losing their jobs every day, they know there is a major crisis but they need hope.  It was Private James Frazer in "Dad's Army" who coined the phrase, "we are doomed".

#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	287	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I would like to deal with the issue of the resources allocated  to mental heath and suicide prevention services.  It is appropriate to speak on this issue in light of the Monageer report published yesterday.I will refer briefly to it because I strongly believe if intervention has taken place in the case of that family, that tragedy could have been avoided.  I will outline briefly why I believe that.  The man in this case was highly suicidal.  No suicide assessment of his condition was done but it should have been done.  Suicide is a complex issue.  A headline carried in one of today's newspapers states that it was that man's level of debt that caused him to take his life.  That is a simplistic and dangerous comment.  There is never a simple explanation for suicide.That man had shown warning signs of suicidal tendencies.  If his condition had been assessed, I am certain intervention would have occurred.  Such intervention would include psychiatric intervention, which would have ensured that he, and therefore his family, would have survived.  The person who picked up on his suicidal condition was the funeral undertaker.  She became extremely concerned about his condition.  The concern may not have been overtly expressed that he was in danger of taking his life but she knew there was a danger in this respect.I will outline some of the suicidal warning signs I have identified in regard to this man's experience.  He was a young man with a young family making detailed funeral arrangements.  That may not indicate suicidal tendencies but combined with the fact that his brother hanged himself a month prior to that, the risk of suicide within his family increased.  His father died 12 months before that, another factor that could increase the risk of suicide in his family.  They were a very socially isolated family, which is also an issue around suicide.  He suffered a disability and was unemployed; there is a higher incidence rate of suicide among the unemployed.  He suffered from a psychological and emotional disability and had a physical disability in regard to his sight.  He also had financial problems.  Having regard to that combination of facts, if a risk assessment of his suicidal ideation has been made, immediate intervention should have taken place.  Social services knew the history of and the difficulties faced by this family.  Combined with all the issues I mentioned, that person was highly suicidal.No psychiatric intervention was made because no intervention was made during that weekend.  If that man had been psychiatrically assessed and psychiatric intervention was made, I believe his life, and therefore the lives of his wife and two children, would have been saved.  I take strong exception to somebody saying that intervention would probably not have saved his life.I make this point in the context of this Bill because the necessary resources are not available to do what I outlined should have happened in the circumstances surrounding this tragedy.  I have seen this happen in similar circumstances, although perhaps not as tragic a familicide.  I am aware of people who were highly suicidal, whose families had alerted the authorities of their suicidal ideation and the danger they might commit suicide, but the services were not in place, no intervention was made and they took their own lives, a tragedy with which their families have to live for the rest of their own lives.Funding is needed for services in this area.  It is highly relevant in light of what I have said that when funding of €15 million for an out-of-hours support service was mentioned yesterday, the Minister concerned immediately knocked it on the basis of financial considerations.  Why does that happen in regard to issues concerning social services, suicide and psychiatric illness?I welcome the fact that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs allocated €11 million towards addressing difficulties experienced by families due to the rise in unemployment in this recession.  Such funding will assist families to deal with costs associated with a bereavement and general difficulties they experience in their new circumstances having become unemployed.  I support 100% what is being done and what I am saying is no criticism of that.  Why can such funding not be made in response to the publication of the report on this tragedy?  It would require only an extra €4 million in addition to what the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, has done.  I am regularly asked why such provision cannot be made.Some 460 official deaths by suicide were recorded in 2007 — we do not have the figures for last year —  but the incidence of suicide is under-reported.  Most experts say that the incidence of suicide is nearer to 600.  Last year 279 people died on our roads.  Some 600 deaths by suicide occurred as against 279 deaths on our roads.  Just over €3 million is allocated to the National Suicide Prevention Office to deal with suicide prevention, but this year the allocation to that office is being reduced by 12.5%.  The allocations to all the voluntary organisations dealing with suicide prevention, suicide bereavement and issues in that area are being cut by 12.5% this year.During periods of recession — we have had recessions going back to the 1890s, including during Durkheim's time, and in 1929 — there is an increase in the incidence of suicide and psychiatric illness.  The Government should respond to that need.  It rightly responds to the needs of those who are unemployed by allocating finances towards their unemployment benefit.  The Minister has responded also to family and other crises that arise because of unemployment.  Why can the Government not respond to the need for suicide prevention and help those who self-harm, attempt suicide and suffer from psychiatric conditions, especially depression?  A higher level of psychiatric difficulties are experienced by people who lose their jobs, especially among young or middle aged people.  I do not want to exaggerate these difficulties.  There is also greater pressure on those who anticipate losing their jobs or their homes, and on those who actually lose their homes.  These events exacerbate the psychological, emotional and psychiatric difficulties people experience, yet the Government responds by reducing the amount of resources allocated to provide for their needs to achieve a saving.Some people ask me why the Government does that.   It does it because it is not a political issue.  I was on the doorsteps last night, as I am sure were many Members, and the people raised the issue of the health services, but did they raise the issue of psychiatric services, given that one in four people suffers a psychiatric illness at some stage in his or her life?  It is not a political issue.  The Government does not respond to the non-political needs of our people because there are no votes in them.

I compliment him on it.  I will make sure the Minister reads it.  It was a calm and appropriate response on the day after that dreadful report was published.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	289	I thank the Minister of State for those comments.
#SeanArdagh	unknown-#SeanArdagh-party	unknown-#SeanArdagh-dob	unknown-#SeanArdagh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	290	I am delighted to have an opportunity to make a contribution to the debate on the Finance Bill.  With regard to the current state of the economy, the Government is making strides in trying to resolve the issues to be addressed.  Four cornerstones have been identified, the first being improving the fiscal position, which the Government is accomplishing well by bringing the general government deficit to a level which is manageable, even though it is still high.  The next cornerstone is getting the banks to give credit and resume lending to some extent.  This is very difficult but, again, is being dealt with by the Minister for Finance through the proposals for the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency which will be discussed later this evening by means of a Labour Party Private Members' motion.With regard to training and education, the Government is making good efforts and has recently increased by 1,500 the number of PLC places allocated to the vocational education committees.  The Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, is making a great effort in this regard and getting results.I refer to the proposals in the budget and the Social Welfare Bill to provide incentives for those in the 18 and 19 year age group to return to education.  Unless young people have an education, their chances of having a decent income in later life are minimised.  The jobseeker's allowance is being decreased for 18 and 19 year olds from €204.30 to €100 but if a young person is in full-time second level education or returns to education after two years, the amount will increase from €100 per week to €204.30.  They are also encouraged to participate in the Youthreach programme if that is an option that would suit them.  They will have the general opportunity to move from PLC courses to third level education.  The number of FÁS training courses has been increased dramatically.  Therefore, good work is being done on the so-called cornerstone of training and education.  Work is being done on job creation initiatives but there is a long way to go in tackling competitiveness and innovation.  I will return to this subject if time allows.Instead of having four cornerstones, I would like to think there is a pentagonal or five-sided structure.  The fifth cornerstone as such should be the care we show to those who are suffering the most from the adverse effects of the current economic downturn.  Deputy Neville referred to the effect financial troubles might have on people's ideation of suicide.I propose that a special initiative be taken for those who are unemployed but who have mortgages.  I will give as an example a couple where the main earner in the house loses his or her job.  They have a mortgage of €300,000 to be repaid over 20 years, with a loan to value greater than 80%, as is generally the case.  I am suggesting that in a case where such people lose their jobs and are making large mortgage repayments, they should have an automatic entitlement to reduce their payments to the value of the interest only on the basis of the ECB marginal lending facility rate of 1.75%.  This is the overnight rate at which banks can borrow liquidity and it is a reasonable rate to offer to those in dire straits.  For instance, if a person with a mortgage of €300,000 was paying interest at a rate of 1.75%, it would cost €5,250 per annum or €440 a month.  I suggest that if this amount cannot be repaid, there should be subsidies available to meet the repayments in order that the capital amount would never increase in the case of a person who is unemployed and in a tough mortgage repayment position.  The normal repayment on a 20-year mortgage with a loan to value greater than 80%, on the basis of the AIB rate available this morning, is €1,647 per month.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	291	I agree, it is impossible.
#SeanArdagh	unknown-#SeanArdagh-party	unknown-#SeanArdagh-dob	unknown-#SeanArdagh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	292	Yes, it is absolutely impossible.  I am suggesting a system should be put in place which would not only set the economy right, with the credit system, an increased number of training places and job creation, but would also look after those who by necessity are suffering the greatest problems as a result of the adverse effects of what is happening.  When I go knocking on doors, I note that the ones who are most vulnerable are those who have lost their jobs and have large mortgages.  I have huge sympathy for their predicament but sympathy is not enough; we must put a system in place.  When the Land League was first established in Castlebar in 1879, it had as its aims the three Fs — fair rent, free sale and fixity of tenure.  We must ensure security of tenure for those who are in danger of losing their homes.  I ask the Minister to consider bringing forward an amendment to the Bill to ensure persons with a mortgage would have an entitlement to have their mortgage repayments reduced to interest-only payments at the ECB marginal lending facility rate of 1.75%.On the question of whether the Government is making the right choices and going in the right direction, I refer Members to a very interesting article by Colm McCarthy in which he refers to our nostalgia for things as they were in 2007.  It is a short, sharp article published on www.irisheconomy.ie.  It reads:In three or four years time, if we are lucky, we will have an economy which needs to look very different from 2007, the final year of the first credit-fuelled bubble in the State's history. It should look like this: (i) Government debt ratios stabilised and sovereign credit spreads back to low levels; (ii) competing banks strong enough to lend (a little); (iii) a competitive economy producing more exports, less houses, and (iv) a smaller and less leveraged balance sheet.  This economy will inevitably be smaller than 07 for a while, have lower employment, a smaller construction sector, smaller aggregate bank balance sheet, bigger Exchequer debt, lower public spending, higher tax rates and possibly BOP surplusses for a few years.Mr. McCarthy has described a scenario which we have to achieve and the sooner, the better, but it will be very difficult to do so.  He further states:All policy wheezes emanating from the commentariat over the next few months should be smell-tested for 07 Nostalgia, and rejected at the merest whiff.  We have been there and it didn't work.When discussion of the Bill resumes, I will show that Fine Fail's — rather Fine Gael's — "Enronomics" have not been smell-tested, amount to nostalgia and are not suitable for the future.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	293	It is my stated intention that enabling legislation for the establishment of NAMA will be introduced during the summer Dáil session.  As is the case with all legislation, the Dáil will have the opportunity to debate the Bill when it is brought before the House.  I have established a steering group comprising representatives of my Department, the Office of the Attorney General and the NTMA to oversee preparatory work for the establishment of NAMA on a statutory basis.However, to avoid uncertainty and minimise further deterioration in the banks' loan books, it is important that NAMA is established on an interim basis as soon as possible.  This will also allow preparatory work on the necessary legislation to be informed by the initial work of the interim agency.  The interim agency will be well positioned to help identify the technical issues which will have to be addressed in that legislation and to assist in discussions with the EU Commission.I recently announced the appointment of Mr. Brendan McDonagh as interim managing director of NAMA.  The appointment of an interim managing director will ensure the implementation process is driven forward in the interim period pending legislation.  Mr. McDonagh will be assisted by a high level interim advisory committee, whose names I am finalising.  I have also directed the NTMA to provide the necessary staffing and other facilities through its existing resourcing arrangements to support the interim operation of NAMA, pending its establishment on a statutory basis.I appreciate that the question is whether I will publish the heads of legislation on NAMA in advance of the legislation.  Draft heads of legislation are not normally published and it is not my intention that the draft heads of this Bill will be published.  However, it is important that the maximum amount of briefing be provided on the proposed legislation and it is my intention to provide that briefing to Opposition spokespersons in advance of the legislation.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20513	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	294	While I thank the Minister for briefing us, the question is very clear, will we have an evaluation of this project?  This is on the scale of Napoleon's invasion of Russia.  We are undertaking huge risks on the part of the taxpayer in saying the taxpayer will shoulder up to €90 billion in impaired loans.  Does the Minister think it is acceptable that all that has been published is a ten-page document summarising a report that has not been seen?  Is that enough for the Oireachtas to have confidence in the course the Government is taking?  Why should the Oireachtas participate solely in processes designed to implement this when it is clear there is major scepticism on whether this is the correct way to go, on whether it will get credit moving quickly and on whether it will prove one of the most costly ways of dealing with the problem, and the taxpayer shoulder everything?  Does the Minister agree we have time to have a proper evaluation of this?  Let us get all the opinions on the table and make our decisions based on the best possible information, not simply on the basis of just one approach to this that has been pioneered by one group.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	295	This is not a matter of one approach pioneered by one group.  This was a very detailed exercise carried out within the NTMA, which advises the State on financial matters, building on its expertise and the analysis of the banks' loan books, which has been demonstrated since last September.  The Government examined matters carefully.  The Government and I agree with Deputy Bruton to the extent that the crucial issue regarding the operation of NAMA is the valuation of the books and the precise price at which the agency will acquire the assets.  That is at the heart of the successful operation of the agency.  That is why I have confined myself to date to a general statement of principle about how we will go about this approach.  If we predetermine the valuation without further expert advice and analysis, we would expose the taxpayer.  It is essential that a proper evaluation procedure be elaborated.As I indicated in yesterday evening's debate on this, I am open to constructive suggestions from the Opposition on how we can proceed on valuation.  No alternative system has been advanced in this House to address the question of how credit can be made to flow in the banking system again and how the banking system can be repaired.  The approach taken by the Government is in accordance with best international practice and advice and the IMF has repeated again and again the need for states to clean up the balance sheets of the banks.  If an alternative proposal exists, it can be evaluated, but no valid alternative proposal has been advanced from the Opposition benches.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20513	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	296	Has the Minister examined the evidence that other attempts to do this ended in less recovery on behalf of the national agency than private sector recovery of this loan?  That is the French example.  Has he examined the fact that this will get bogged down in legal wrangling?  This will be a bonanza for lawyers and accountants, not for those awaiting credit.  That is clear.  Does he agree there are many more disputes about the validity of this than simply the valuation?  People have asked why non-performing loans in sectors other than development would not be included.  Why does the Government want to take on €90 billion — a truly enormous portfolio for the taxpayer to shoulder — in a single State agency?  Why have such a Napoleonic vision?  Why should Ireland try to design something in a highly risky world?  It is a single throw of the dice, a major gamble which we should not embrace.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	306	In the recent budget, my Department projected that GNP would contract by 8% this year and by 2.8% next year.  Combined with the 3.1% contraction which was recorded last year, this implies a cumulative decline in national income of almost 13.5% over the 2008-10 period.  In other words, over the period there is virtually no difference between my Department's assessment of aggregate national income trends and that of the ESRI.In terms of labour market developments, the recent budget is based on the assumption that employment will fall by 7.8% this year and by a further 4.6% next year; this is the equivalent of a quarter of a million job losses between this year and next.  As a result, an average unemployment rate of 12.6% is projected for this year, rising to 15.5% next year.  The ESRI assessment is somewhat more pessimistic, with the unemployment rate assumed to average 13.3% this year and 16.8% next year.  However, I point out that the latest data show the unemployment rate to have been 11.4% in April so that, in the absence of data revisions, an average figure of 13.3% for this year seems excessively pessimistic.  Although they are not designed to measure unemployment, trends in the live register can provide a more up-to-date indication of trends and in this regard the latest figures provide tentative evidence that the rate of increase has slowed down somewhat.With regard to next year, it should be noted that the ESRI projection for unemployment is at the upper end of the range of forecasts.  The current consensus among economic forecasters is that the unemployment rate at the end of 2010 will be 15.4%.  Focusing on minor differences among the various sets of economic forecasts misses the point.  We are in for a very sharp fall in economic activity and unemployment has risen sharply as a consequence.In broad terms, the Government's response to the rise in unemployment consists of both demand and supply side elements.  We are working to improve our competitiveness and achieve export-led growth, thereby boosting the demand for labour.  At the same time, we are investing in education and skills so that those who are losing their jobs in contracting sectors of the economy are able to secure employment in new, expanding sectors.  In the recent supplementary budget I announced a range of activation initiatives which will go further to encourage individuals into employment.

What is his opinion on the European Commission forecast that the fiscal deficit will reach 15.6% of GDP in 2010?  Does the Minister accept this comes as a result of depressed demand and soaring job losses?What I find difficult to understand from the triumvirate in charge of the country, namely, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance, is that none of them seems to have any imagination concerning what unemployment figures of 380,000 — possibly heading for 500,000 — will do to Irish society.  The Minister mentioned some measures he included in his budget but even judging by the record of FÁS these amount, at most, to about 90,000 places on various initiatives.  Does the Minister expect to have any serious offer for people who are losing their jobs, particularly young well-qualified graduates?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	308	First, the European Commission forecasts were issued on 4 May and predict GDP to contract by 9% in 2009.  Concerning its forecasts on the size of the deficit, the Commission warmly welcomed the recent budget introduced here and was very supportive of it.  Both the Commission and the chairman of the Finance Ministers at Eurogroup have praised the approach taken by this country with regard to budgetary matters.  The Commission, the European Central Bank and the Council of Finance Ministers made very clear to me that they believe the Irish Government has taken the correct course of action given the scale of the difficulties we face.  That has been made abundantly clear in recent days and it is important we notice that, as a country.  It means that international confidence is being restored in Ireland and that is very important.I was asked about the awareness of Government — which, I am glad to advise the Deputy, is a collective entity, comprising 15 members — of these difficulties.  First and foremost, the Deputy questioned whether the Government recognised the gravity of the social crisis facing Ireland.  In addition to the financial and banking crises, there is a very severe social crisis caused by the increase in joblessness.  That is why the Taoiseach has continued to engage with the social partners to see whether they can work towards a common approach in addressing this social crisis.  In addition, various measures were announced in the budget, including the stabilisation fund for enterprise and the various job training opportunities.  These go only some of the way, as Deputy Burton pointed out, and clearly we must deepen and intensify such approaches.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	309	I met people on the way back from Killarney where the Minister had addressed a credit union conference.  He boasted that Irish people took pain that would cause riots in other countries.  Where are the Minister's measures to deal with the 90,000 or so graduates and the additional tens of thousands of qualified apprentices?  These are not unskilled people but have high levels of training and have been educated to a high level.  What has the Government got to offer them and their distressed parents?  They see their brilliant children, who have achieved academically and in apprenticeships, being offered nothing by this Government.The Labour Party has put forward a series of proposals, including a graduate and apprentice internship system, while the Minister's Government has offered nothing.  Is the Minister prepared to read the Labour Party's programme and to take on some of our ideas?  We proposed that European Investment Bank funds for small and medium industries and enterprises should be utilised but so far this has been taken up to only a tiny degree although it is a €30 billion programme across the EU.  We suggested a much bigger stabilisation fund than the small one the Minister announced he would start.  We proposed a series of other initiatives to get people back to work but there has been no meaningful response from the Minister or from the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  They seem to be asleep on the job

First, with regard to the pain I acknowledged to have been taken in this country, I was certainly not boasting about it.  I was pointing out——
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	311	That is what the people in Killarney thought.

A large number of delegates came over to me, thanked me and said, "Thank God, there is hope for this country".We must face facts here.  A huge burden of adjustment must take place in order that our economy may become competitive.  What is exciting the admiration of other European countries is the fact that we are prepared to take on that burden.  Our unit labour costs are no longer the highest in the eurozone but now lie behind one country.  We must face facts if we want to be competitive.  That is all I rightly wished to draw attention to because I believe it is important that Irish people understand the course of action we are taking.  We are making ourselves more competitive, adapting our work practices and making real sacrifices in terms of the income we pay ourselves during the present period.  All these initiatives, taken by many Irish people in their places of work around the country, are improving our competitiveness and generating international attention.  That is very important if Ireland is to be put on the right track.Deputy Burton raised the question of EIB funds.  I was present at a ceremony in Dublin some weeks ago where these funds were committed to the Irish banking system and are now available——

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	320	These are the sums the European Investment Bank has made available to us.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	321	Data on business credit are available to me from a number of sources including the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator.  Returns are also made by institutions covered under the guarantee scheme.  From the available reports it is clear there has been some reduction in business credit.  The most recent Central Bank monthly statistics show a reduction in total credit outstanding from non-financial corporate bodies of €1.3 billion in March 2009, compared with February 2009.However, the cause of the reduction in business credit is not clear.  Some reports state that customers with viable business propositions are being refused credit, while other reports suggest that falling demand for credit is the main cause of reduced credit flow.  It is important that there should be a clear understanding of the basis for the slow down in business lending so that policies can be targeted to ensure that necessary corrective actions are taken, as required.  The Government therefore decided, when it announced the recapitalisation of the banks in February, that there should be an independent review of bank lending.As part of the recapitalisation package, Bank of Ireland and AIB agreed to fund an independent review on credit availability to SMEs in Ireland.  The review is supervised by a steering committee consisting of representatives from the banks, the business sector and the public sector.  Consultants have been appointed and have commenced their work.  I expect that the result of the review will provide a clear picture of credit demand and credit availability to businesses and will identify ways to improve the flow of credit.  The report on the review is expected at the end of June.

The Minister gave a commitment to the House on 26 March that a report would be quickly brought forward on the issue of credit flowing to small business and oversight in terms of declined cases.  Why is there no urgency in bringing the report before the House?  When will it be brought before it?  Furthermore, the figures the Minister is quoting as regards the Central Bank are grossly inadequate.  Since last September we have seen declines in private sector credit of the order of nearly €8 billion.  The Minister speaks of credit flowing to small business and the Opposition coming forward with alternative proposals, aside from the establishment of NAMA.  We brought forward a motion last night on Private Members' business on the establishment of a State-sponsored wholesale bank to borrow funds from the ECB and provide them for existing banks for good loans, effectively taking ownership of the assets.  Will the Minister take this on board in terms of providing credit for small business and mortgage holders?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	323	I shall consider the matter when Fine Gael outlines its proposals in relation to bad loans because the availability of EU funding through the European Central Bank would be contingent on this.  When there is a scoped proposal, I shall examine it.As regards the review, it is progressing well, but to ensure it was comprehensive extra steps were taken, including the inclusion of banks other than those recapitalised, in order to obtain a full picture of overall credit availability.  This is a vital question because all the evidence suggests those banks with external ownership are deleveraging more than those based in Ireland.  The addition of extra third parties to the review, a review of the detailed terms of engagement of the consultants, the inclusion of a credit insurance issue, consideration of confidentiality concerns of participating banks and the inclusion of banks other than the recapitalised banks to obtain a full picture of overall credit availability were vital.  Allied Irish Banks and the Bank of Ireland had committed to the review as part of the recapitalisation package.  Other banks, including Ulster Bank, Bank of Scotland (Ireland), NIB, ACC, Anglo Irish Bank and KBC, were invited to participate, even though they had not made a commitment to become involved.  The intention was to include the main banks involved in lending to businesses in Ireland, but their inclusion created a need for more formalised conditions attaching to the review.  Some of the banks involved had head offices outside Ireland and were obliged to consult their parent companies about participation in the review.  Publication of the review will be at the end of June.

He gave a commitment on the floor of the House last March to the effect that he would bring forward such a report.  We expect him to honour that commitment.As regards Fine Gael dealing with toxic loans, we proposed a detailed review needed to be carried out and brought to the House within a period of six weeks which would look at the details in dealing with all the providers of capital, including bond holders, who are not getting full value in the market.  We have brought forward a comprehensive proposal which we hope the Minister will take on board.  Unlike his proposal, ours would lead to the provision of credit for small business.  When is the Minister going to produce the report and what is the reason for the delay?  Why is publication to be at the end of June, not now?

As I announced in early April, the potential book value of loans that will be transferred to NAMA is in the region of €80 billion to €90 billion, although the amount paid by the agency will be considerably less than this.Pending the establishment of the agency on a statutory basis, an interim managing director has been appointed.  I will announce an advisory committee in the coming days.  The establishment of NAMA and interim preparations will also be overseen by the steering group recently established by me and including representatives of my Department, the NTMA and the Office of the Attorney General.The valuation of the loans will be a very important variable.  Preparatory work for the establishment of NAMA which has commenced will include an extensive due diligence on the loan books of the banks to ensure the appropriate categories or portfolios of loans are transferred to NAMA and that the banks are cleared of their identified riskiest loan portfolios.  Loans will be transferred from the banks to NAMA at an appropriate written down value.  The development of a valuation methodology by the interim agency will take account of the advice of the advisory committee and such other advisers as may be appointed and will be consistent with European Commission guidance and subject to EU state aid approval.  This will take into account the risk being transferred to the State and an appropriate adjustment for the value of the State support being provided.The Government has received expert financial, economic, legal and valuation advice at every step of its measured response to the turbulence in the banking sector.  Likewise, specialist expertise, including valuation expertise, will be procured by the NTMA to ensure the work to be done by NAMA when established is accomplished in the most efficient manner so as to safeguard taxpayers' interests.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	327	I should like the Minister to answer three points as regards the NAMA proposal, the most importance of which is how are the toxic assets to be priced in a transparent manner that commands public confidence?  The Minister mentioned an advisory committee.  Presumably, like all of the other parties in this process, it will be a secret committee because that is effectively what has been happening since the giving of the guarantee — secrecy with minimum information.  The Minister has told  us nothing about the funding of the asset purchases and the year by year cost of the associated public debts, the enormous increase in our interest costs and the cost of servicing our debt, as a consequence.  There is the absence of a commitment to public accountability and oversight, similar to the procedures put in place in the USA and most successfully in Sweden where the banks had to be rescued, as well as in Finland.  The Government has avoided all three points and the Minister will not tell us how he proposes to deal with them.  No wonder people on the doorsteps are in a rage as regards what they are going to be charged in respect of NAMA.

To ensure best value for money for the taxpayer, loans will be transferred from the banks to the agency at an appropriate written down value, depending on an assessment of the value of the loans and the risk being transferred to the State.  Valuations will be assessed in line with European Commission guidance and will be subject to EU state aid approval.  Clearly, the advisory committee will have a great deal of work to do——

Loans will be transferred from the banks to the agency at an appropriate written down value as determined by it.  The assessment will have to be in line with European Commission guidance.  The identity of the members of the advisory committee will be announced by me in the coming days.  The level of discount and the terms and conditions of the transfer of assets will ensure the banks will not get off lightly.  They will have to take an appropriate written down value of loans, taking account of the objective of the agency which is to operate commercially and optimise the return on such loans over time.On the suggestions of secrecy made by the Deputy, with the charge that minimum information has been made available, I have always made it clear that the Governor of the Central Bank and the National Treasury Management Agency are available to brief her on these matters.  However, there are commercially sensitive matters in relation to all the loan books which would affect the stability of the banking system and which, therefore, cannot be published in the House as a matter of course.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	332	Does the Minister understand that the banks, the covered institutions, are partially bankrupt?  Some of them may be wholly bankrupt.  He has mentioned the Governor of the Central Bank, his own Department and the regulator.  Does he have confidence that these institutions have served well in this crisis?  He said he had paid a minimum of €2 million to Merrill Lynch and up to €6 million for its advice.  I still cannot figure out what it advised him to do.  It would have been better if he had read the newspapers in Ireland; at least, he would have received more advice.  He paid €3.8 million to PricewaterhouseCoopers for stress-testing exercises which, to be honest, were mathematical mumbo jumbo.  Credit from the banks is frozen and many of their assets are impaired to the tune of more than 80% of their book values.  The Minister's reference to book value sounds like a cleverly written lawyer's formula for going soft on the valuation issue.  In other words, he values assets high and the taxpayer takes a hit of up to €50 billion.  That is what Professor Patrick Honohan said at the joint committee, and there is a man who knows a lot.  Can the Minister come clean with the House?

That is very wide of the mark.  The purpose of this exercise is to clean the balance sheets of the banks so they can be restored as normal entities lending into the economy.A few moments ago Deputy Burton stated that covered institutions, namely, the Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Bank, Irish Life & Permanent, Anglo Irish Bank, the Irish Nationwide Building Society and the Educational Building Society are wholly bankrupt.  That is a highly irresponsible statement.

We had an extensive discussion at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service.The covered institutions are not wholly bankrupt.  I am not warning Deputy Burton off.  As the Minister charged with responsibility for banking, I am telling her that what she says is not in accordance with the facts.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	344	The first fundamental way to protect and expand Irish jobs is to get our competitiveness right and to put the public finances on a sound footing.  This we are doing.  The second key strategy is to invest in the smart economy, maintain high levels of capital spending and direct that into labour intensive areas.  This we are also doing.  For example, I announced the establishment of a stabilisation fund of €100 million over two years, to support vulnerable but viable enterprises and a research and development target of 2.5% of GNP by 2013.In addition to that, I announced in the recent supplementary budget a further range of activation initiatives which will support individual enterprise through enhanced access to the back to work enterprise allowance scheme; facilitate some 1,400 additional claims; encourage further education through earlier eligibility for the back to education allowance; facilitate work experience through a new scheme, to include placement of graduates, which will cater for 2,000 people; expand activation opportunities for over 14,000 people; support redundant apprentices to receive additional training in the education sector — for up to 700 people; enable participation in further and higher education for over 6,000 people; and initiate pilot training schemes for workers on a three day week.Each country must pursue its own jobs strategies in line with the resources it has available and the particular features of its economy.  There is no "one policy fits all" approach.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20513	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	345	I am disappointed with the vary narrow agenda the Minister is pursuing. The ESRI has told us we face 300,000 extra people out of work.  Unemployment is growing at twice the rate of any other country in Europe or any of our competitor countries.  The Minister's strategy is simply to pursue the economy down.  His tax increases offer no hope, vision or chance for people to see something worthwhile for their effort.The number of initiatives in other countries is startling.  There are initiatives on tax deferral, carrying back losses, accelerated depreciation for certain key investments, deferrals of due date, prompt payments from the State, reduction of compliance costs for small businesses and cutting VAT for small business to generate activity.  Other governments, which are facing much less stress in their labour markets than we, are developing such initiatives.Why will the Minister not look at the job protection agenda allowing small businesses the scope to retain employees?  Instead, they are having to tell workers who have served them well for many years that the doors are closing and they are being let go.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	346	I examined Fine Gael's proposals in this regard.  I provided access to my Department before the budget and I am glad Deputy Bruton used that facility.  Many of the Fine Gael proposals replicate the Government document, Building Ireland's Smart Economy, which was published last December.  Almost none of the programmes proposed by Deputy Bruton in his party's document is new.However, I welcome the fact that Fine Gael acknowledges and supports the Government's positive initiatives in that area, such as smart metering in every home by 2013, electrical vehicles, the national grid as a smart grid, microgeneration, renewable energy and the extension of broadband.  A number of initiatives being taken by the Government are very much in line with what Fine Gael is proposing.  I welcome the fact that these were in that party's document.There are serious questions about the sustainability of some of the investment Fine Gael proposes, including the use of the bulk of the national pension reserve and increasing borrowing significantly, whether on or off balance sheet, at a time when the State already has a substantial borrowing requirement.  I question the wisdom of setting up four new commercial State bodies when the Government is intent on rationalising State agencies.  I am also concerned that some of the proposals are to be funded by selling off public assets when their prices are so depressed.  That said, I acknowledge that many of the ideas Deputy Bruton is putting forward are part of mainstream Government policy.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20513	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	347	It is enough to make a cat laugh to hear the Minister question the wisdom of putting equity from the pension reserve fund into creating an energy infrastructure and a telecommunications infrastructure for the future while he is putting that money into buying toxic loans which will be a burden on taxpayers forever and a day.Where are his initiatives on VAT for labour intensive sectors, on PRSI concessions for people expanding their workforces or on  changes to the social welfare rules to allow employees to cut back to 80% working but remain in employment?  These are all prevented by rules which the Minister continues to endorse in the budget.

If we repair that motor we will repair our economy.  The idea that we can ignore this and engage in endless theoretical debate mixed with low political abuse as a form of addressing our banking problems is wrong.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	361	The European economic recovery plan was endorsed by the European Council at its meeting of 11 and 12 December 2008 and amounts to more than €400 billion.  The Community part of the plan, which has been agreed by the European Parliament and the Council on a proposal from the Commission, will finance projects in the field of energy and rural broadband Internet, as well as new challenges identified under the CAP health check.  This Community financed package of measures, which aims at providing additional stimulus to the EU economy and improving energy security, amounts to €5 billion.  Almost €4 billion will be made available for the financing of the energy projects.  The balance of a little more than €1 billion will be made available for developing broadband internet in rural areas and strengthening operations related to the new challenges defined in the context of the CAP health check.Responsibility for implementation of energy and broadband projects rests with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in respect of the CAP health check.  However, in regard to the energy aspects of the proposals, the Deputy should be aware that this critically important package represents a comprehensive and co-ordinated EU response to the twin challenges of supporting economic recovery and achieving EU energy policy objectives, especially security of supply.  It will provide tangible support to priority energy projects, ensuring the further integration of European energy markets and it will underpin our collective actions to tackle climate change.  The package proposes undertaking a programme of investment measures during 2009 and 2010 for energy projects in the following fields: gas and electricity interconnection projects in the amount of more than €2.3 billion, carbon capture and storage in the amount of more than €1 billion and offshore wind projects in the amount of approximately €0.5 billion.Recently, the Government announced that it has given a green light to the development by EirGrid of the €600 million east west electricity interconnector linking Ireland and Wales, running from Meath to Deeside.  I am informed that, as a further stimulus to this project, the interconnector has been included on the list of energy projects under the European economic recovery plan, with a proposed allocation of €110 million.  This is a welcome recognition of the strategic importance of the east west interconnector, which will underpin regional energy market development and the all-island single electricity market.  It will ensure that Ireland, as a peripheral island nation, can benefit from and contribute to the development of a strong internal energy market in Europe, enhancing competition, contributing to security of supply and assisting Ireland in meeting our ambitious renewable targets.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseIreland could also benefit from the proposed allocation of funding for the North Sea grid, involving projects to support the integration of off-shore wind energy.The opportunity to invest a little more than €1 billion in rural broadband is very welcome as is the opportunity to meet the ongoing challenges of climate change adaptation and mitigation, renewable energies, water management, biodiversity, innovation measures relating to these areas and the restructuring of the dairy sector.I am informed that the rural broadband and CAP health check elements of the recovery plan are currently being finalised within the community.  The European Commission will then allocate the funds according to an agreed distribution key.  It is expected that the allocation of funds will use the historical rural development distribution key and this could mean an allocation of some €30 million for Ireland.  As soon as the allocation of funding is agreed, I understand that Ireland's rural development programme will be revised during 2009 to incorporate both the additional funding and the new measures following consultation with the rural development stakeholders.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	363	The €5 billion community fund of the European economic plan must be matched.  The Ireland to Wales interconnector has been included on the list and €110 million has been earmarked for that project.  The list also contains a €165 million overall contribution towards the North Sea offshore grid which includes Ireland as a location along with the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Belgium, France and Luxembourg.Ireland also expects to draw down funds from the broadband and CAP health check elements of the plan on the basis that the funding would be distributed using the same distribution key used to divide rural development funding.  Ireland would receive approximately 3%, or €30 million, of the available funding with flexibility on the use of the investment for either broadband or CAP health check.The supplementary funding required for the east west interconnector is being pursued with relevant funding interests to ensure it is funded at the lowest possible rate for EirGrid.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	365	Does the Minister agree that the poor broadband reception in many parts of the country, especially rural Ireland, is one of the critical constraints restricting people from creating successful businesses in small towns and villages and in larger towns and cities?  The Government has failed to address the Eircom issue.  The Fianna Fáil privatisation of Eircom turned into a disaster from an investment point of view.  Does the Government have any proposals in the context of the EU recovery programme to recover the significant amount of ground lost?  We were leaders in connectivity and linkages for telecommunications up to the time of Eircom.  Since then we have continued to go downhill and we are now significantly behind competitor countries.Does the Minister agree with the proposal to reduce the amount of red tape in respect of the European recovery programme?  It is possible to go to any country in Europe and find food markets operating.  In these markets women can bake and make apple tarts for the markets and for local restaurants and so on.  However, in Ireland it is not possible to make an apple tart and sell it in a local market.  One almost risks jail for doing so.  Does the Government have any take on how to reduce red tape in respect of small enterprise initiatives?

In regard to the question of availability of broadband, some of the funds will be committed to rural broadband.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is introducing several initiatives to address broadband deficiencies in rural areas.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	367	It is premature to identify specific projects that may benefit from any additional investment in infrastructure by pension funds.  I note that we are spending a considerable sum on capital this year, some 5% of GNP, one of the highest ratios in the world.  This supports a substantial level of employment, while the reductions in tender prices mean we can do more with less.Nonetheless, the Government is prepared to examine new ways to fund needed capital investment and support activity and employment in the construction sector provided the terms are right and in the taxpayer's favour, the investment makes economic sense, value for money is secured, and the private sector shares the appropriate level of risk such that there is not a disproportionate impact on the public finances.If possible, I wish to see moneys currently invested abroad put to work in Ireland if a sensible, workable proposal emerges.  My officials have actively engaged with representatives of the pensions industry and other interested parties to discuss alternative funding proposals.  These discussions have focused on the possible sources of additional funding and on what steps would be required to access such funding.  Several meetings have taken place and further meetings will be arranged in the near future.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20513	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	368	The Minister indicated in the supplementary budget that this was something he was hoping to develop.  It would seem that some six weeks later little progress has been made because he is still referring to frameworks, he is unable to specify anything and he says everything is premature.  Does the Minister believe this is a genuine starter?  Does he believe this will be off balance sheet such that it will not form part of our borrowing requirement?  Has the Minister identified the nature of the projects under consideration?  Will it include school building, hospital building or roads?  Will there be a requirement for a matching revenue stream?  Will leases be entered into by the State to honour it?  The House requires a little more elaboration because the Minister indicated a commitment to this during the budget speech.  However, a considerable amount of time has passed and meetings have taken place.  We must learn a little more of the detail.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	369	The protection of the taxpayer and our borrowing capacity arises in this case.  The crucial issue in any bond issue is the rate of interest which accrues, a matter of considerable sensitivity having regard to our general borrowing requirements.  The advantages of accessing additional funding for infrastructure investment are clear.  Infrastructure investment helps to create jobs.  Although the employment impact of construction projects varies, research conducted in this area suggests that a range of between eight and 12 direct jobs are created for every €1 million invested in infrastructure.  The directing of additional private sector investment towards infrastructure will boost our public capital stock.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20513	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	370	The Minister is simply repeating the last answer.  He is not even reading the supplementary answer.

My Department and the NDFA, National Development Finance Agency, are working closely together in exploring this area.  A working group has been formed involving not only my Department and the NDFA but also the Central Statistics Office which has provided very useful advice.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	373	I point out to the Deputy that simply achieving an off balance sheet solution or status for projects is not the main driver in our capital investment decisions.  As I am often remind by Deputy Bruton, the priority must be to achieve value for money and protection for the taxpayer.  That is my priority as the Minister for Finance and it is the priority of the Government.  Given the difficult budgetary circumstances we face, we are mindful of the need to minimise the State's exposure to additional Exchequer borrowing.  However, it cannot be at any cost.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	374	Has the Minister read the Labour Party's detailed proposal in respect of the establishment of an investment development bank?  Such banks exist in many countries and provide a mechanism for issuing bonds similar to those to which the Deputy has referred, whether on or off the State balance sheet?  Is the Minister suggesting the price or rate of return investment and pension fund managers have sought in the recent discussions about such bonds is too high?  Many in both the private and public sectors are extremely anxious to find safe places to save at reasonable rates of return.  They are looking not for huge interest rates but for reasonable rates of return.  Many of them end up going overseas.  In the past, many of them invested in Irish banks because they felt, patriotically, that they were a safe place.  How wrong they were, given that the Taoiseach introduced contracts for difference tax free and wrecked the value of Irish banks on the Irish Stock Exchange through gambling.  Is the Minister saying pension funds are looking for excessive rates of return or that he does not want to encourage Irish savers to buy into Government products, perhaps because he wants to leave the money for the Irish banks?  It is difficult to understand what approach he is taking.  Will he explain it?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	375	Deputy Burton asked a few questions.  Of course, money is safe in Irish banks, by virtue of the Government guarantee to them.  It is important to make that point.  Money deposited in Irish banks is very safe and I do not understand why the Deputy would suggest otherwise.On the establishment of a national development bank, the Government is optimistic that the private financing options it is considering will prove helpful.  We prefer to explore approaches that retain as much of a role as possible for the private sector to avoid the setting up of an additional State body.  Within its pension fund arrangement, the NTMA can invest in projects for a return, including projects in the State.  Funds are available for this in the NTMA.

It is a question of identifying suitable investments that will give a rate of return to the fund.  That is crucial in determining whether an investment can be made.The Deputy has asked whether I have any reluctance about investment in Government bonds by Irish citizens.  I certainly do not.

Any rate of return on the issue of these bonds would be a reasonable rate of return having regard to the interests of the State.  The Deputy expressed similar reservations in previous parliamentary questions about the operation of the public private partnership system.

It is clear the school building programme should be a priority.  I note the Minister cut €30 million from the programme in his recent supplementary budget.  On the return, the investment managers of Ireland say they are interested in the scheme, but why is there no urgency?  Infrastructure schemes under public private partnerships could be brought to the fore.  The Minister needs to show leadership.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	384	Progress has been made with the public private partnership system in the school building programme; it has been implemented.  I am open to the use of infrastructure bonds in that context.  One great difficulty in the PPP context in relation to schools is that, in general, PPP finance must be used for new projects.  To attract PPP finance, a project must not involve refurbishment or an extension such as the building of a hall but must be a full, new project.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	385	As the Deputy will be aware, fixed rate mortgages can be regarded as a form of insurance against interest rate changes as they provide certainty and security for borrowers regarding the level of their repayments.  As mentioned in the Deputy's question, in circumstances where many households are faced with significantly increased financial pressures, the current environment of very low interest rates highlights to fixed rate mortgage holders the saving that would be available if they benefited from a variable interest rate.  It is clear, therefore, why many fixed rate mortgage holders are anxious to switch to secure lower repayments.  However, when a borrower signs a fixed rate mortgage contract with a mortgage provider, the lender, in turn, enters an agreement to borrow the money at an agreed rate and it must repay the money at this rate.  There will be a cost to the institution if the fixed rate agreement is terminated before the end of the agreed term.  This gives rise to the redemption fee charged in such cases.In the House on 26 March I undertook to raise the concerns about the level of redemption fees with the consumer director of the Financial Regulator which has a statutory mandate to safeguard customers' interests.  At the beginning of April my Department wrote to the consumer director to request confirmation that redemption fees charged for switching from fixed rate mortgages only covered funding costs and that no other costs were included.  To date, the Financial Regulator has been able to confirm to my Department that all mortgage lenders have responded and provided the formula they use when they calculate the early redemption fee that applies to fixed rate mortgages.  The Financial Regulator is awaiting independent verification by an actuary that the fee charged by a number of lenders recoups only the costs incurred by the lenders when they finance the fixed rate mortgage.  However, the verifications received show that the formulae applied by the relevant lenders seek to recoup the loss to them arising from the early redemption of the fixed rate mortgage and do not seek to apply a penalty charge to the borrower.The Financial Regulator is also examining whether any other costs are being charged such as administrative fees.  Any such charges may be subject to approval by the Financial Regulator under section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 and will be examined further in that light.  To date, the responses indicate that most lenders do not levy additional charges in the case of early redemption of fixed rate mortgages.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The Financial Regulator has advised that further analysis may be necessary once all the information is received and reviewed.  Should the remaining analysis by the Financial Regulator indicate that further consideration of this issue is required, it will be carried out.The Government has put in place a number of important initiatives to assist borrowers who are in difficulties.  These include the Money Advice and Budgeting Service which is developing a joint protocol with the Irish Banking Federation to ensure effective co-operation when dealing with debt problems of personal debtors.  In addition, the mandatory code of conduct for mortgage arrears requires that when a borrower is in difficulty, the lender shall make every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment schedule.  Under the code, consideration should be given case by case to alternatives such as deferral of payments, extending the term of the mortgage, changing the type of mortgage, and capitalising arrears and interest.  In any case, lenders will not commence legal action for repossession until six months after the arrears arise.  As part of the subscription agreement for their recapitalisation, Bank of Ireland and AIB will not commence court proceedings for repossession of a principal private residence until 12 months after the arrears appear when the customer continues to co-operate with the bank.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	386	Does the Minister understand that a number of people are caught in a significant hole because they have been unable to benefit from the European Central Bank's reduction in interest rates?  The Minister said in his budget strategy that, because of the reduction in ECB interest rates, he was significantly reducing mortgage interest relief for homeowners.  Many people who are caught in the fixed rate mortgage trap borrowed five or six years ago and are losing their seven-year mortgage interest relief.  They are losing €900 a year, as well as experiencing high interest rates.We want to know about the breakage fees in coming off fixed rate mortgages.  I have figures from people who have been quoted €10,000, €20,000 or multiples of these figures.  I understand the Minister's point that the banks committed to buy the funding at a particular rate, but the variations in breakage fees are extraordinary.  Some people who lose their employment and income will end up losing their home.  As part of the NAMA negotiations on the funding of the banks, has the Minister asked them specifically to consider the plight of such persons?  Has this been considered in discussing the funding of the rescue or bail-out of the banks through NAMA?

We will not engage in negotiations with the institutions concerned.  We can certainly have discussions, but the idea they will have negotiating rights in the discussions is absurd.The position on breakage fees is as I outlined in my answer.  With the Financial Regulator, I will continue to monitor these matters and endeavour to ascertain what proportion of fixed rate borrowers have long-term mortgages.  The majority of cases that have been drawn to my attention are considerably less than seven years in the degree to which the borrower has locked into the mortgage.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20513	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	392	I would like to see this actuarial assessment because I believe the banks are hoodwinking the consumer director.  Numerous people attending my clinics say they received one charge of a breakage fee of, for example, €25,000, but when they went back to confirm it the next day, it had gone up to €40,000.  That does not suggest there are consistent formulae that are actuarially sound.  I would like to see the evidence.  Will the Minister get the consumer director to lay that evidence before the House so we can have it independently assessed?Has the Minister got evidence, either from the consumer director or the financial institutions, that they have genuinely entered into long-term commitments matching those fixed rate mortgages?  My impression is that it has been very hard for banks to enter into any long-term commitments for money.  If they are not incurring that cost, they should not be charging the breakage fee.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	393	While I have not yet received the actuarial advice, I agree it is important that we survey this matter with great care and that any actuarial assessment produced can be analysed by myself.  I am certainly open to sharing that information with Members of the House.  With regard to the suggestion that the banks do not fund fixed rate mortgages from borrowing at a fixed rate which is related to it, that is a serious suggestion and I will undertake to have it examined by the regulator.

Can he find some sense of fairness, given that taxpayers are paying the income levy and all the other levies and additional taxes as a consequence of the bankers' actions?  Surely some kind of an equilibrium and fairness should be brought to bear to assist those who are suffering, largely at the hands of bankers, as a consequence of this downturn.   Something should be given to these very hard-pressed people.

Like Deputy Morgan, I am well aware of those who are hard pressed by the current difficulties in our economy.  However, the fact is that borrowers entered a contract to repay a particular loan on a fixed basis, the banks funded that on a fixed basis and there is a fee payable for the loss to the institution caused by the decision to end the arrangement.  That is the difficulty.  Were I, for example, to interfere in that arrangement, it would put into doubt the capacity of a banking system to enter into fixed term arrangements in future decades.

The banks are not getting long-term funding so there is clearly an issue with regard to the fixed rate they are paying.  What proposals will the Minister introduce to help people with distressed loans, particularly mortgage holders?  Those with young families are struggling to pay their mortgages.  What proposals will the Government introduce?

I understand the banks' problems stem from short-term borrowing on the international money markets to fund longer-term investments, so the notion the banks are not having to turn over their borrowing, funded by the bailout and guarantee which this Government arranged, is wrong.  I have serious doubts about the explanation given by the Minister.  While I do not know whether it comes from the Department of Finance or the Financial Regulator, I would like to see that report published so we could analyse it and perhaps then advise the Minister.  They borrowed short — that is their problem — so why is Minister saying they are committed long?

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	404	My Department is in ongoing discussions with Anglo Irish Bank on a range of matters, including the bank's capital position.  The Government has stated that support will be provided as necessary to Anglo Irish Bank, consistent with EU state aid requirements.  As the Deputy will be aware, Anglo Irish Bank was taken into public ownership to ensure the stability of the bank and the financial system generally on foot of serious concerns regarding corporate governance and in a context where the funding position of the bank had weakened due to low market confidence in the bank's monoline business model.With the stability provided by full State ownership, and with a new board appointed at Anglo Irish Bank, the bank is now in a position to address the issues it faces, including the development of a revised business model, to restore market confidence.  It is likely that Anglo Irish Bank will need additional capital but the extent and the timing of that need is still being assessed and discussed.  Deputies will recall that prior to the nationalisation the Government had envisaged investing €1.5 billion capital in Anglo Irish Bank.  In this regard, the board of Anglo Irish Bank is currently preparing a new business plan for the bank, which will be required to demonstrate how the board will oversee the operation of Anglo Irish Bank in the best interests of the State and the taxpayer.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20513	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	405	Has a report of stress testing of the impaired loans in Anglo Irish Bank been made to the Minister or has he received, either in oral or written form, a report on the stress testing of its loan book?  Have any loans been written off to date by Anglo Irish Bank?  Given the newspaper reports of €2.5 billion being a recapitalisation requirement, has this figure been reported to the Department of Finance and is it a likely assessment of the scale of recapitalisation that will be required?  When will we see reports in the public domain on these issues?

The matter is still under examination at my Department and the relevant information will be provided as it emerges.In regard to the review of the loan books, Anglo Irish Bank is currently finalising its half-year accounts to be published at the end of May.  As part of the preparation for the publication of these accounts, I understand that Anglo Irish Bank conducted a full internal review of its loan book.  At the request of my Department, the Financial Regulator arranged for PricewaterhouseCoopers to examine Anglo Irish Bank's loan book and to report on the extent of the impairment provisions required in its half-year accounts.  That report has been received and we are in discussion with Anglo Irish Bank about it.

Second, does the Minister have a figure as to what the capital losses sustained by Anglo Irish Bank have been and whether the bank has in effect exhausted its capital?Third, the Government was in effect considering guaranteeing bonds up to 2014 in certain instances — the Minister made reference to this in his Budget Statement but never elaborated on it.  If Anglo Irish Bank has bonds due, does this mean, in effect, that the Minister has extended the guarantee period out to 2013, particularly for international bond holders?  Will the Minister explain the impact of this for Anglo Irish Bank?  Is it true some €30 billion or more of distressed assets are to be transferred from Anglo Irish Bank to be bailed out by NAMA?  What is the story in that regard?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	412	There are so many assumptions in the Deputy's questions that I wonder where to begin.  NAMA is being established under the aegis of the National Treasury Management Agency.  In bailing out Anglo Irish Bank it is bailing out the taxpayer, because the taxpayer now owns Anglo Irish Bank.  Therefore, I do not see the relevance of the use of the word "bailout".  The transactions that will take place between NAMA and the Anglo Irish Bank are transactions in which, in effect, distressed loans will be removed from the balance sheets.  I am not in a position to put a figure on the record of the House this afternoon about the extent of that distress because we have not completed the valuation exercise for NAMA purposes.  We are at the stage of establishing what the valuation procedure will be.I am glad the Deputy asked me about the extension of the guarantee and the bonds.  The reason the guarantee is proposed to be extended to medium term debt is that, as the Deputy is aware, the guarantee terminates at the end of September 2010 and the main banks have difficulties in accessing medium term debt financing beyond that period because of the total character of the cut-off date.  It is not a matter, however, of guaranteeing existing subordinated debt or debt of that character which is an issue, but a question of assuring medium term finance is available to financial institutions.  This course of action has been taken by many other European countries, as have all of the different courses of action we have taken, including giving the guarantee, capitalisation and nationalisation where appropriate.  All these steps have been taken by countries throughout Europe to deal with the major crisis in the financial system, which will do incredible damage to our economies if it is not addressed.On the specific question the Deputy asked about medium term finance, the answer is that the Government is working on proposals that will require approval from the European Commission.  They will assure the various financial institutions in Ireland — in a currently improving money market — that they can access greater funding.  This is very important for sustaining the viability of the banks and for the banks giving credit into the economy.With regard to the suggestion that the Anglo Irish Bank should have been nationalised a few months before it was, it is clear from the discussion we are having today that when a bank is nationalised, the obligation to provide working capital for the bank rests on the taxpayer.  I was determined to do all in my power to stave off that eventuality.  The taxpayer has not had to commit a cent to the Anglo Irish Bank to date.  Whether it would have been preferable to have nationalised the bank last September and immediately commit several billions of euro to it is a matter historians can debate.  The course of ensuring the viability of the whole system as long as possible and using total nationalisation as a last resort was the correct route to follow.

Of course Anglo Irish Bank will be covered by NAMA, because it is owned by the taxpayer.  What I was pointing out clearly, when Deputy Burton used the word "bailout", was that Anglo Irish Bank is now owned by the State — the taxpayers.  The valuation procedure as between NAMA and Anglo Irish Bank carries no risk for the taxpayer whatsoever.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	13307	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	427	In the interest of an overview, I ask the Minister to indicate the effect on buoyancy within the economy of the most recent budget and the subsequent publication of the Finance Bill.  If the Labour Party's estimates are correct, it is proposed that more than €3 billion will be taken out of the economy as a result of the measures proposed in the Bill.  This would have an effect on economic buoyancy through returns into the Exchequer.  We are very concerned that the lack of buoyancy or the effect on buoyancy is extremely negative.  This will have further negative consequences for economic growth in the economy.  I would like a coherent and specific response from the Minister with regard to the measures proposed in the Bill and their effect on economic buoyancy.  It is important that if we find ourselves in a scenario where we seek to stimulate the economy that we have those figures.On the pension levy and its effect on part-time public sector workers, I have had representations from constituents who are employed by County Cork Vocational Education Committee.  They work on a part-time basis, have never subscribed to a pension plan within the VEC, yet they have been hit by the pension levy.  How were these people deemed eligible for the pension levy if they are only part-time employees and have never subscribed to a pension scheme or provisions?  Is it legal to apply the pension levy to this coterie of workers, whether within the VEC or any other public sector body with part-time employees who do not pay into pension schemes?I wish to raise the issue of capital allowances, specifically with regard to the low paid, self-employed and farmers.  Section 2, in dealing with the income levy, outlines technical amendments to clarify that the levy applies on gross income.  Subsection (1), paragraph (a) states:‘aggregate income for the year of assessment', in relation to an individual and a year of assessment, means the aggregate of the individual's relevant emoluments in the year of assessment, including relevant emoluments that are paid in whole or in part for a year of assessment other than the year of assessment during which the payment is made, and relevant income for the year of assessment;In the past year a dairy farmer might have had significant capital outlay to comply with EU legislation through the farm waste management scheme and the nitrates directive and would have been subject to the farm improvement scheme, for which there is no economic return.  He might have invested €100,000 in respect of those schemes and had single tax credits such as a €3,000 pension contribution.  If his gross farm receipts amounted to €150,000 and one factors in costs between variable and fixed of approximately €115,000, his net income would amount to €35,000. Taking into account the income levy of 2%, the health contribution of 4% and the PRSI levy of 3% for the full year the total deductions come to approximately €2,700.  The overall deductions on the income, net of capital allowances could be in the region of 9.4%.  Adding the capital allowances to the pension contribution they could be in the region of10.5%. Could provision be made within the Bill for self-employed people who have significant capital outlays to take those capital allowances into account in the calculation of income?  That should be done particularly where someone is deemed to fall below a certain income threshold.  There is scope to do this for someone who is self-employed when it is necessary to encourage growth, particularly in the rural economy.In rural Ireland dairy farmers have had a significant outlay and their incomes have been dramatically reduced.  It is, therefore, important to have some stimulus to maintain the income status quo.  Not taking into account capital allowances made on Government schemes or obligations under EU legislation would bring some equity into play.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	428	The Minister's Second Stage speech warrants some examination.  In it he told us, "We are continuing to invest in education at all levels in order to ensure we have the skills demanded by our knowledge-intensive economy".  The opposite is the case, the Government has just cut €30 million from the education budget.  That is a poor response.  The Government spends €113 million per annum on prefabricated huts in school grounds.  Many of these huts are damp and leaky, draughty and cold.  The Educate Together school on Mornington Road outside Drogheda, in my constituency, comprises over 20 prefabricated huts.  These cost the taxpayer an average of €12,000 per annum each.  That is some investment.  Will the Minister explain how he can stand over the part of his speech in which he states that the Government continues to invest in education?  Many of these prefabricated huts are also rat infested, and are not a good environment in which to educate children.  In other cases the toilets are not in the main school building and children must scurry through the rain or frost or snow to use a toilet which is sometimes a considerable distance away.The Minister also stated:  "The Government remains committed to providing a pro-enterprise environment and to maintaining our relatively low tax burden on business".  That also warrants a challenge because whatever about low taxes such as the modest 12.5% corporation tax, businesses must endure steep charges well in excess of those affecting businesses in most other European countries.  We know about the waste management charges, the development levies but what about the lack of infrastructure for those businesses?  I have received representations for several weeks from a precision engineering business which has some expert capacity and is engaging in expert activities but there is no broadband in its area.  This company grew from a modest family business into one with significant potential but it is struggling to develop because of the lack of broadband yet the Government says it is pro-enterprise.  The Green Party says that it will ensure broadband is rolled out by 2013.  I will believe that when I see it.  The business community does not have the same patience in respect of these services.The Minister also told us: "Our agility in responding to this most difficult of economic crises has been acknowledged by Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker".  Mr. Juncker said Ireland is "making some very brave efforts and we very much welcome the feeling of national consensus that we detect in Ireland".  The only national consensus we have is that the Government is totally incompetent and has no clue what it is doing.  An official from the Department of Finance must have written that speech for Jean Claude Juncker because everybody here knows it is nonsense.  The Government spent €440 billion of taxpayers' money to underwrite the bail-out of the banks in September, it recently recapitalised some banks and nationalised Anglo Irish Bank, all measures that have required it to re-visit what it has been doing.  The national asset management agency is the latest episode in the saga.  The Minister stated:The purpose of the supplementary budget was to restore order and stability in the public finances so that we can protect existing jobs and generate the essential economic confidence that will lead both to further employment creation and to a return to prosperity.In his dreams.  Where is there a single measure for job retention and job creation in the supplementary budget?  I cannot find it so I would appreciate it if the Minister, in summing up, could point out to me where it is.  It is not there, yet the Minister continually uses bland phrases that mean absolutely nothing or bear no resemblance to reality.The Minister also stated, "We must demonstrate that we have the ability to make the right choices for everyone in this country".  My goodness, that would be some demonstration and I would certainly like to see it.  However, there is no sign of it or of the right choices being made.  I must therefore ask whether the Minister is serious.The Minister stated, "We must never lose sight of the principle that economic and fiscal renewal cannot be achieved at the expense of fairness."  Is it fair to close two wards in a children's hospital in Temple Street?  Is it fair to rob pensioners of their bonuses at Christmas?  All the language in the Minister's statements needs to be challenged specifically line by line because it is all wrong.  The Government is misleading this House and the people of the State, and that is grossly unfair.The Minister also stated tax increases are required although he advocated the complete opposite.  Perhaps the increases are required but he needs to explain that, at the last general election, which was nearly two years ago, the Government parties were advocating the absolute opposite to tax increases.  They were advocating tax cuts.  This is how the Government received its mandate; it was not on the back of tax increases.  There is a very strong argument that a completely fresh mandate is required for exercises of the scale envisaged.The Minister referred to the "redistributive impact of the budgetary measures".  I assume he is referring to the redistribution of wealth.  The National Asset Management Agency is to shift wealth on a scale not seen before in this State and probably never seen before in any European state.  The Government is proposing to move a sum in the order of €90 billion, not from the wealthy to the poor but, rather, the complete opposite.  It proposes to move this sum from the poor to speculators and bankers.  The scale is such that an explanation is warranted.The Minister stated, "The Government will continue to protect the vulnerable in this difficult period but in doing so it must be borne in mind that we all have a responsibility to accept a proportionate share of the burden of adjustment needed in this economy."  A sense of proportion is required.  Is it reasonable and proportionate to underwrite the banks to the tune of €440 billion and to bail out Anglo Irish Bank entirely?  Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland are receiving €3.5 billion each, which we know is not nearly enough.  This is regarded as fair and equitable by the Government.  It is disenfranchising children by removing their opportunity to have a decent education and to sit in a dry and reasonably warm classroom, and it is removing the opportunity of those in receipt of welfare to have some tiny bonus at Christmas with which to deal with the issue of Santa Claus or pay bills they owe.  This was regarded as proportionate by the Government but I do not see it that way, and cannot do so by any stretch of the imagination.The Minister made more very interesting remarks in his speech.  With reference to sections 3 and 4, he referred to the making of supplementary budgetary measures for mortgage interest relief.  The relief is being cut for anybody who has held a mortgage for more than seven years.  We must remember that the people who took out huge mortgages did so to the cheers of the Government and its regulators.  They were happy to cheer on those taking out mortgages for grossly overpriced properties because their doing so enriched the speculators who had been friends of the Government for so long.The Green Party has a great responsibility in respect of what is taking place.  Until now, it has told us that every aspect of the mess we are in is not of its creation and that it has no responsibility therefor.  However, it is on the other side of the House voting for cutbacks, voting against proper education facilities for children and voting against pensioners.  It now has a duty to explain to the people where it stands.  It got into power on the basis of an election manifesto and election promises that represent a position totally the reverse of its present position.  It cannot get away with this any longer and needs to explain its position.

The problems Ireland faces are also faced by practically every other country in the European Union and the developed world and have systemic causes that cross all borders.  Irish exceptionalism is not the cause of the crisis that hit us, although the vulnerabilities in each country that has been affected, including Ireland, differ to some degree.In a debate on the crisis in New York between leading economists and commentators, reported in yesterday's Financial Times, Nobel prize winner Joseph Stiglitz blamed the bubble on the misuse of easy money after mismanagement of risk by financial institutions and lax regulation.  In our own case, despite scattered warnings, society as a whole and the political system, not just the Government, became over-ambitious and over-extended and underestimated the risks.How did we use easy money, much of which I hasten to add was well earned?  The picture is mixed.  On the positive side, we drove down the national debt to pre-1973 levels in real terms.  We put aside more than €20 billion in the national pension reserve fund, which has been our salvation in helping us to deal with the banking crisis.  We invested heavily in infrastructure and a national motorway system, which will be complete next year.  There have been major improvements to public transport, there are new research institutions, schools and hospitals, and there are far better arts and sports facilities and environmental initiatives.  Social welfare payments, particularly pensions and the children's allowance, were increased very substantially.  We cut direct taxes — probably too much with the exception of corporation tax, which was cut to 12.5%.  The latter is one of the foundations of our industrial policy.  I am happy to acknowledge that was announced by Deputy Quinn, as Minister for Finance, in May 1997, but negotiated with the European Union and implemented by Mr. Charlie McCreevy when he was Minister for Finance.In the past 20 years, we put 1 million more people to work, nearly doubling the workforce.  For many years, we were consistently the best performing and most dynamic small economy in Europe, with living standards moving ahead of the EU average although we were coming from well behind.  There is a positive legacy and balance sheet to be seen all around the country in virtually every community.  There was also a downside.  We did not just catch up in the process; we lost an important part of our competitiveness, which can be corrected in a eurozone framework only by a significant fall in prices and incomes, which is now occurring.  Far too much loose money was invested in property developments that were not really needed.  One of the by-products of the introduction of free third level fees by the rainbow coalition was that wealthier parents were able to buy apartments for their sons and daughters who were studying.  Construction activity was further boosted by tax incentives that have been dismantled but, in some cases, perhaps not quite soon enough.  Perhaps we will all now be cured of the belief that an already booming industry needs tax incentives of every kind from which the better off benefit hand over fist and that they need to be bribed and let off taxes in order to invest.  Social partnership was a cornerstone of our prosperity, and we greatly improved pay and conditions, outpacing most other countries as the price of social harmony.  The Opposition and the media backed virtually every spending demand on the grounds that the country was awash with money.  Opinion polls confirmed that people wanted better services provided they did not have to pay for them in higher taxes, relying instead on tax buoyancy.The sudden impact of the crisis we face has been severe.  The public finances were blown completely off course.  Unemployment has soared and the banking system has been under siege.  Never has the intervention of the State been in such demand, not long after it had been declared almost redundant by neo-liberal ideologies.  Cavalier capitalism, with all its success worshippers, has had a mighty fall, and the State, here as elsewhere, has been left to pick up the pieces.  The Government has risen to the challenge.  Firm action to maintain the solvency of the State and of the principal financial institutions has been vital to the welfare and living standards of every citizen of this country.  We hear much criticism of the individual measures taken, but which, if any of them, are the parties opposite pledging to reverse if in government?  It is natural for parties in Opposition to soft-pedal the hard decisions they would have to take in Government and imply there is some easier and fairer way of coping with our problems or that a change of personnel would somehow transform our difficulties.

He points out that nearly all such measures would require additional borrowing from international markets when we are already borrowing to the hilt, and concludes: "At the end of the day, we must bear in mind the lesson of the 1980s and 1990s which is simply that there is no substitute for fiscal common sense as the essential backbone of growth and prosperity."  Recognition of that reality while pursuing the smart economy is the bedrock of what the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Government are trying to achieve.  It was the successful financial retrenchment of the late 1980s that first made the great leap forward of the Celtic tiger possible.The Government is drawing on the best advice available to it.  I welcome the entry into the political arena, on the other side, of a nationally known economic journalist who was beginning to find too onerous the requirements of maintaining objectivity and impartiality on the national broadcasting station.  I would not be inclined to quibble too much over any slight messiness in the transition.  As someone who, in 1981, had to resign — without any prospect of a way back — his position as a permanent civil servant, where political impartiality is equally required, in order to work in the political sphere, I am torn between regarding the right of return, albeit to a less high-profile position——

The ten-point plan published in the Evening Herald last Friday by this candidate, which would be fine as an aspirational wish list, does not even begin to add up.  The full-year cost of one measure, a 3.5% cut in the 13.5% rate of VAT, would cost €1 billion on its own.The fiscal policy of the Government in this crisis is, in the technical meaning of the term, highly progressive.  While those on low incomes or social welfare have been largely protected, a scaled contribution has been demanded from those in a somewhat better position to pay, although I accept that most people at all levels find themselves under pressure.The future pension bill, including the public service pension bill, is not sustainable.  There is little doubt that those of us working in the public sector enjoy more security and better pay and conditions, on average, than those working in the private sector at present.  It is unrealistic to imagine that the public sector could continue in the current circumstances as an island of prosperity cut off and insulated from the harsh economic winds buffeting the rest of society.As a former member of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission until 2007, I am bemused at the reports from Westminster, given how strongly we were advised to adopt its system of vouched expenses.  I particularly like the alleged case of the cleaning of a castle moat being put down to parliamentary expenses.  I admire the decisive and clearcut response of the Leader of the Opposition in Britain to abuses in his party.  Here, the Minister has suggested that the pay of office holders and most senior public servants should be benchmarked against smaller European countries.The Labour Party was critical of the low capital tax rates and thresholds introduced by the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, even though revenue increased significantly as assets were traded more freely.  These are now being adjusted but remain relatively generous.  The changes will have more significance when the economy picks up, but they make the system fairer now.  A concerted attempt is being made to propagate the patently absurd notion that the Government has imposed onerous taxes and levies on ordinary people in order to bail out builders and developers.  The only help being given, on rigorous terms, is to the commercial banks, many of whose board members have had to resign.Nor can it be argued that the Government's measures are in any way tailored to short-term electoral considerations.  They are in fact a courageous effort to measure up responsibly to the needs and gravity of the situation, and that has been acknowledged and respected internationally, if not always at home.  This Government, and any Government elected at a general election, has a mandate to deal with unexpected crises — by definition, most crises are unexpected — that arise from time to time during its term in office.  The ship of state is being steered through extremely stormy waters.  It will be time enough when we have reached shelter to consider who would be the best crew for the next voyage.

I must comment on the contribution of the previous speaker, particularly with regard to the situation in which we find ourselves currently.  To say the economic difficulties we are facing are due entirely to international circumstances is not true.  The Minister of State blamed lax regulation, Irish society, international events and the political mass as a whole.  However, if we look back at the post-budget statements of Deputy Richard Bruton for the last number of years we will see it was pointed out time and again to the Minister and to the Government parties the potential error of their ways.  The chickens have now come home to roost.Last week in an article in The Irish Times, Michael Casey, a former senior official at the Central Bank, pointed out that two thirds of the difficulties in which we find ourselves are due to national policies — that is, of our own making, or of the Government’s making — and one third to the international financial crisis.  That will answer the Minister of State’s comments.He also criticised the introduction of free third level education by the rainbow coalition of 1994-97, implying that all it resulted in was wealthy parents buying apartments for their sons and daughters, a total misrepresentation of the situation.  He clearly has no concept of the value of education and ensuring equal access for all children to third level education.It is particularly cynical that the Government is leaving any announcement about its intentions until after the local and European elections on 5 June.  It smacks of a Government afraid to announce its own intentions.  The Minister has said it will not affect students attending third level in September but those students will face an increase in registration fees from €900 to €1,500, another whack for the families struggling in the current economic crisis.I was very disappointed that there was no mention of job protection or job creation in the Bill, no mention of any measures that would have ensured we could stem the tide of job losses across the State and give some sense of hope to employers struggling to retain employees.  We could have been imaginative with the PRSI system, introducing a measure whereby employers would not have to contribute for new employees.  That simple measure would have given hope and helped companies take on new staff but it was ignored.A reduction in VAT to encourage activity in small jobs and home improvements was ignored.  It would have helped the construction, tourism and hospitality sectors but such measures have not been introduced.  Instead the Bill increases the pressures on middle and lower income families.Consumer confidence is gone.  Retail figures show a further reduction, a sign that consumers are spending less, with a fall of 29% in 2009, much of which is due to the car industry, but with a 7% decrease in consumer spending in February 2009.  Ireland has seen the largest fall in consumer spending in 2009, with a drop of 8.1%, compared to 4.9% in Italy, the closest to us.  Other countries are not experiencing the same lack of consumer confidence.That will only be added to this month when the health and income levy increases kick in, taking a huge amount from the economy that will no longer be available for spending.  The Fine Gael approach to the budget laid an emphasis on stimulus, not taxing people so much, and focused on public service inefficiency and dealing with waste.  We see none of that from the Government, where there is a complete lack of emphasis on tackling those issues that must be tackled to ensure we return to competitiveness.Our competitiveness has been eroded in the last ten years.  In the early 1990s there was a lean, fit economy.  The explosion in public spending caused us to become unfit and has ensured that those producers dependent on the export market are competing in a market overburdened with high charges.  It does not matter if one is exporting financial services or butter, they are all saddled with the same high costs.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	446	In my time in this House, no Finance Bill was ever introduced against a more dismal financial backdrop.  It is chilling that 12.5% of income tax is needed by the Government to pay the Government debt.  Under the Minister's own projections, in 2013, 60% of all income tax will go towards payment of the national debt.  That is before we talk about the €90 billion in toxic assets.  Many economists believe that, if things pan out the way they appear at the moment, 75% of all income tax will go to pay the Government debt.  If that day comes, we will have a massive problem.I was in Argentina ten years ago when it ran into horrendous trouble.  I met teachers, doctors and civil servants who had not been paid for the previous eight months.  People might say this is scaremongering but if that day arrives there will be trouble, given that we had so much trouble finding €2 billion in the first budget and another €2 billion in the second.  Now we are talking about taking on the toxic assets from the banks.  I do not call them toxic assets, I call them smelly assets.  There is €90 billion in toxic assets on paper.  The Taoiseach claims the final figure will be nothing like that, the assets will realise more when the time comes.  Even if we realised €30 billion, writing off €60 billion, that will impose enormous pain on every single taxpayer in the country.  In view of this we believe it is time to call a halt to the method by which this Government proposes to get this country out of the current mess.This proposal for a National Asset Management Agency goes too far, too quickly.  It will be an easy way out for those who got rich very quickly when times were very good.  It is against that background that I heard the Taoiseach talk about an EU scrutiny committee that will somehow evaluate these toxic assets.  I cannot see how it will do it.  I have no idea where this will finish, just as the Government has no idea.  Many Governments in Europe have no idea either.  When we talk about toxic assets, however, it means that throughout the country there are half-finished estates and land purchased through illogical and irresponsible banking.  If we are to put a valuation on those, we must ask if anyone wants to buy them and for how much.  At the moment they could not be given away.  It is only when the demand for such products picks up that the NAMA will get its money back and that could take many years.I wish to raise another point.  I cannot understand why, when the ECB rate is reduced — on the last occasion it was reduced to an historic low of 1% — the many thousands of people who are tied into fixed rate mortgages do not benefit from that reduction.  When those people signed their mortgage contracts they thought they were doing the right thing, but only some eight to 12 months later these people are paying interest rates of 5.9%, 6.1% and 5.6% when tracker and variable mortgages are freely available at rates of 3.3%, 3.5% and 3.6%.  Many people will consider such terminology jargon.I know of a couple where one partner has become unemployed and the other is on social welfare.  A fortnight ago, that couple went to their bank to ask if they could have their mortgage repayments reduced to the current tracker or variable interest rates.  The Minister of State knows what I am talking about because some of his constituents would have raised this issue with him.  That couple told the official in the bank that if the bank could accommodate them, they would be just about able to repay their loan every month.  However, the bank said they would require a breakage cost of €16,000 to make that change.  The couple told the official they would not have had to make the request if they had that sort of money.There are good banking reasons the change requested cannot be done, but there were many good banking reasons during the past five or six years when certain things that should not have been done were done.   I am speaking on behalf of every couple throughout the country who is caught in this mess.  As Deputy Clune rightly pointed out, when people receive their May cheques they will note the huge increase in the levies imposed on them.  These are the people who are being penalised on the double and they are paying interest rates they should not have to pay at this time.  That does not make sense.  I accept that many people will say that mortgage holders signed a contract with the bank and the bank had to borrow extra money, and it was more costly to do it at that time.  However, what was not possible yesterday might become a necessity tomorrow.  If the Government wants to keep people from becoming dependent on social welfare and give them some degree of dignity, this is a measure that should not involve a cost, given that the banks are now in a position to borrow money at a lower rate than ever before.  The Government has been feather-bedding the banks all the time, and what is happening is nothing short of a disgrace.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	447	I am pleased to speak on this important subject.  A debate on any measure concerning our economy is important.  If any good proposal emerges from this debate, it should be Deputy Connaughton's last point about interest rates.  During the past six months interest rates have continued to fall and people have welcomed that.  I cannot reiterate more strongly than Deputy Connaughton the difficulties faced by people tied into fixed rate mortgage interest rates.  Thousands of young people signed fixed rate mortgages in the belief they were doing the right thing.  They were delighted with their new houses, be it a second-hand house or whatever home they purchased.  They are now locked into fixed rate mortgages in what are difficult times when people are trying to cut back on their expenses and have to make choices in that respect.  If the Government wants to send out a signal that it cares or is interested in ordinary taxpayers, something must be done for those people who are paying very high interest rates.  It is unjust and unfair.  Different economic circumstances prevail now and I support fully what Deputies Connaughton and Clune said on this issue.  It is one that should be addressed because the Government is taking over the banks and that is what the Government and many other people believe is the right approach for the economy.  The first time I heard of the setting up of a toxic bank was when Deputy Bruton told our parliamentary party many months ago that this was the way forward.  There is considerable consensus on setting up banks.  We must also have regard for the houseowners who have to pay high interest rates and another tier of people, namely, those in business.A constituent who is indebted to the banks came to see me the other day.  He has a viable business, employs 16 or 18 people in a rural area and has three months' work on his books.  He cannot get a shilling from the Bank of Ireland, AIB or any other bank.  He has sought to get credit from every financial institution.  I will advise the reason he cannot get credit and change is needed to address this issue.  This man owed money to the Revenue Commissioners on foot of which they took a charge against him last year.  He paid them every shilling he owed, including the interest that had accumulated.

He cannot get credit because there is a black mark against him.  That is wrong and unfair.  The Government's claim to want to help businesses is only bluff when it can turn its back on such an individual.  We need risk takers in this economy.  We need people who will invest their money in setting up businesses.  We need people who have paid their way during times of hardship and difficulties.  This is one instance where an individual cannot get access to credit.  There are many more such people, and there will be many more of them.  When these risk takers have cleared their debts, they should be allowed back into the system.  It is wrong that they are not allowed back in.  I do not care they have had such a difficulty because they have tried to be successful.  Nobody tries to fail in this world.  The economic climate in Ireland has caused many good businesses to face financial difficulties.  I urge that changes be made to address those two issues, particularly when the banking system is being re-organised.It is unclear how the asset management agency will seek payment from builders and purchase tracks of land, etc.  A long-term view needs to be taken of the land that will be bought and the value of the assets to be purchased.  In the current market nobody can forecast the value of an asset because of the economic depression.  It cannot be stated that land is worth this or that value.  In 1989, 43 acres of land were for sale for €68,000.  The land was not sold and an offer of €1.2 million was made for that land two years ago.  The man that owned the land was sticky and plucky in difficult economic times and he was able to hold on to his land at that time.  He is now a successful developer and builder.  Nobody can forecast the value of an asset at any one time.  Those are the points I wanted to make concerning the banking sector.I also wish to address the great number of people who have become unemployed.  It is the most crucial issue with which the Government must get to grips.  The figures are stark, people have mentioned the figure of 500,000, but the number could be closer to 600,000.  This is a major issue and it needs to be addressed.  They are the people we need to help.

#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	452	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  It is being introduced in the context of a deep and widespread recession in the international economy that we have not seen in more than 50 years.  Ireland is experiencing a sharp decline in its GNP.  I look on the positive side and hold the view that as the international recovery gains momentum, the impact on our national economy in terms of the residential housing output — construction of which passes through to our economic growth rate — should turn positive in the next few years.  No one is suggesting that the process of recovery will be easy.  This Bill, and the supplementary budget to which it gives effect, will play a major part in securing our future prospects.Deputy Tom Hayes made a good point in regard to not being able to forecast the value of property.  The same principle applies to the economy.  It cannot be forecasted accurately what will happen.  The measures detailed in the Bill are progressive and fair.  The income levy was mentioned.  This is a progressive measure.  Those who are most able to pay will pay the most and the more vulnerable people will be protected with exemptions.  The Bill clarifies the redundancy payments made in the first four months of the year.  These will be subject to the income levy rates in force during that period.Mortgage interest relief for the first seven years for qualifying home loans will focus on those most in need and provide a saving to the Exchequer.  I agree with the point made by many Members that it is very unfair to have people tied to fixed rate mortgages when there are tracker or variable mortgage rates available.  The Minister for Finance has known our views on this and he has been trying to address that issue.  The measures in this Bill reflect the need for us all to be very aware of the need for a fair and proportionate share of the burden of adjustment required.  Our tax base needs to be broadened and measures to achieve this are included in the budget, such as the termination of certain property-related accelerated capital reliefs, the abolition of the special 20% tax rate applicable to trading profits from dealing in or developing residential land and a reduction in the level of tax relief which investors may claim on the interest for mortgages and loans on residential rental properties.One of the concerns raised with me on many occasions is the 12.5% corporate tax regime to which the Government is committed.  It is important to emphasise that our tax system remains competitive and is pro-enterprise in character.  I refer to the enterprise fund which was established in the budget and which is to be welcomed.  The Taoiseach and various Ministers have spoken on the need to develop the smart economy.  Tax reliefs have been announced for the acquisition of intangible assets as a means of maintaining employment in our existing industrial base and to attract sustainable high quality jobs.This country continues to have advantages and these have contributed to our success in the recent past.  I refer to our skilled labour force. Almost 2 million people are in employment and the Government is continuing its investment in education which is very important.  Our economy has flexibility and resilience and there has been investment in infrastructure which will continue.  The Finance Bill is very important to this country as we endeavour to position Ireland to benefit from the global recovery when it emerges.I was very glad that the budget emphasised the area of alternative energy.  I refer to the proposal for energy independence made by Spirit of Ireland.  Many Members have seen these proposals for energy self-sufficiency and for the export of energy which would be a crowning achievement for this country.  Much of our energy requirements are imported and at this time when money is scarce we need to look at the question of investing in wind and water energy in particular and this has been promoted by the Spirit of Ireland group.The cost of energy is referred to as one of the many reasons for our lack of competitiveness.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government today referred to the export of waste and he is examining new markets for our energy products.The budget has been complemented by the announcements made about the insulation grants worth €75 million for housing and the extra €75 million for school buildings and in recent days the announcement that the summer works scheme will be provided with €80 million to insulate school buildings.  The proposals for alternative energy are very important.  I hope the Acts relating to the ESB will be examined to provide definite proposals for alternative sources of energy.The Minister stated he would welcome suggestions and I wish to make a brief suggestion about the work on the insulation of houses and schools.  I refer to radon gas which has been a significant issue for many people in certain parts of the country where readings have been very high.  It was stated that up to 200 people die each year from the effects of radon gas, a gas which has no odour, colour or taste and cannot be detected by humans.  However, the gas can be measured by means of a specialised, easy to use home test kit.I suggest that radon gas readings be taken in social housing and in public buildings such as schools.  Studies have been carried out in Europe, the United States and China.  When I was Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, I pressed the case to have radon gas readings taken in local authority housing where tenants had concerns and that remedial measures should be taken where necessary in those housing estates.A related issue is the question of lung cancer.  Many people are smokers and this is an added risk when radon gas is present in those homes.  It has been found that counties Carlow, Galway, Kilkenny, Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo, Waterford and Wicklow, have seen an increase in amounts of radon gas and these areas should be given priority for the measurement of radon gas.  A simple measurement system is available through the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  I hope that insulation grants will be included in the programme as well as a remediation programme for radon gas.  This is being carried out in primary and post-primary schools, thanks to the summer works scheme and I hope it will be rolled out throughout the country.

I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill which the Minister published last week.  It gives effect to the measures announced in the emergency budget of 7 April.  As the Minister has stated, the Bill strikes a difficult balance between the need to show a credible way forward for dealing with our structural problems and also the need to protect the economy.  Like everything in life, it is about balance and this budget is a very balanced contribution towards getting us back on the right track.The Bill contains measures that, although difficult, are necessary to stabilise the economy.  I welcome the decisive action taken by the Cabinet and the Minister for Finance in dealing with this economic crisis.  The Bill outlines the six essential steps we must undertake for financial renewal, namely: stabilising our public finances; restoring our damaged banking system; regaining competitiveness; protecting the jobs we have and investing in retraining those who have lost jobs; supporting and stimulating economic confidence as much as we can within the resources available; and, crucially, restoring our reputation abroad.

#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	466	By taking these steps now, we can realistically aim to recover by the year 2012 or 2013 and I welcome some very positive measures introduced.  In this Bill, the Government has spread the burden as fairly as possible and has ensured that those who can afford to pay the most will carry most of the pain.  For example, the plan to close a potential capital gains tax legal loophole allowing Irish resident companies disposing of shares in other companies to avail of what is termed a "participation exemption" where the shares derive their value from exploration or exploitation rights is very welcome.The Bill aims to provide support to people who lose their jobs and I am glad to note that redundancy payments made in the first four months of the year will not be subject to the higher income levy rates introduced in the supplementary budget.  This is only fair to people who have found themselves faced with the uncertainty and difficulty of unemployment.  As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise Trade and Employment and the Joint Committee on Finance I very much welcome the move to reduce the rates of interest applied by Revenue to late payments and underpayments of tax by businesses.  These will come down by approximately 20% to annualised rates of between 8% and 10% from 1 July.  This will ease pressure on businesses which are finding things very difficult in the current economic climate.I also very much welcome the introduction of a scheme of tax relief for the acquisition of intangible assets, including intellectual property.  This measure enhances Ireland's competitiveness as a location for the development of intellectual property, and it links in with the aims outlined by the Government in Building Ireland's Smart Economy.  The smart economy plan launched late last year aims, through investment and incentives, to reach a research and development target of 2.5% of GNP by 2013.  We have already trebled our economy-wide research and development spend over the last decade.  Again, this will be dismissed as inconsequential.  This spend is approximately €2.5 billion of which some two thirds comes from the enterprise sector.  This refocusing of our economy will ensure Ireland's long-term future and viability.The Government is doing everything in its power to take the hard decisions that ensure Ireland returns to growth as quickly as possible.  There are four corner-stones to the Government's strategy.

#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	468	The first is concerned with addressing the banking situation to restore credibility nationally and internationally and get credit flowing.  The establishment of the NAMA is necessary and critical to restoring our damaged banking system.  There is a case against the establishment of the NAMA, but the case in favour of it is stronger.  This measure will restore the credit flow to businesses which are in critical need of working capital .  I look forward to the NAMA beginning its work and I am confident that the best interests of the Irish taxpayer will be served.The second pillar is concerned with attacking the gap in our public finances by increasing revenue and cutting spending, in a planned way, over the next five years.  Difficult choices have been and will have to be made, but it is in the best interests of the economy and the country.  The third pillar is concerned with protecting as many jobs as we can, restoring competitiveness to the way we do business and supporting viable businesses which are vulnerable.  There are many businesses that are doing business every day but are finding it difficult.  They are good, solid businesses and they need the support.  They are vulnerable, as I said.

Measures outlined to support people who have lost their jobs include enhancing access to the back to work enterprise allowance scheme, which will facilitate almost 1,400 additional claims and encouraging further education through earlier eligibility for the back to education allowance.Last week we heard news from the US Federal Reserve that the US recession would bottom out over the coming months with the economy beginning to grow again by the end of the year.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	481	It is easy to dismiss this Bill as merely technical but behind the imposition, repeal, remission, alteration and regulation of taxation, stamp duties and duties relating to excise and regulation of customs lies the face of human suffering.  The word "taxation" is calculated to send a shiver down the spine of every citizen in the State.  It will ruin the quality of life of every lower and middle income family in the country and see families forced to endure the heartbreak of losing their homes and children losing their schools, their summer holidays and even their toys at Christmas.  It is the modern equivalent of the thief in the night.The Bill is an exercise in closing any perceived loopholes that may have been created by recent ill-conceived budgets.  It is also the statutory instrument that will give force to NAMA which may prove to be the final nail in the coffin of the country's finances.  As proposed, the measures in the Bill will affect PAYE workers who received a bonus in the first four months of the year.  It is intended to ensure those who are able to frontload their incomes in an effort to avoid higher levies will not be successful in doing so.  Tax specialists have said that in the history of the country levies have never been backdated in the manner now enforced by the Government.If there is a flicker of light at the end of the tunnel it is that the Bill should protect those who took redundancy payments before the new rates were introduced on 1 May.  The plan to cut the interest charge on late tax payments is an appeasement measure by the Government, a move that will ease pressures on businesses.  This concerns interest charged on late tax payments and underpayments and the cut will be in the region of 20%.  The Bill proposes to introduce the new rate from 1 July and will reduce the interest charged in most cases to 8% per annum.  This proposal was not part of the October or April budgets.  One hopes it is a sign of a more cohesive plan by the Government to tackle the fallout of the economic downturn for businesses.  However, it is regarded by the Small Firms Association as too little, too late.I am pleased to see a measure in the Bill that will see an extension of the deadline for tax break applications under a scheme designed to boost tourist facilities in the midlands.  This is the mid-Shannon tourism infrastructure scheme which was introduced last year following EU approval.  I demand that it include County Longford which was omitted at the time.  The current application deadline for projects under the scheme is 31 May which the Bill proposes to extend until the same day next year.  Importantly, it also proposes to extend the period in which the money must be spent to 31 May 2013.  These are important concessions for the midlands which has seen the Government sucking the life blood from its tourism industry.  With County Longford designated as a tourism black spot, too high a price on the future of the midlands as a tourism destination was being sought by the Government.  Tourism figures have been hard hit by such measures as the departure tax, increased stealth taxes, lack of broadband roll-out, substandard sewerage schemes, poor water quality and some of the worst roads in Ireland.  At a time when tourist numbers are dropping alarmingly, with figures from the CSO showing a 19.9% drop in the number of trips to Ireland from North America in February 2009 compared to the same period in 2008, a 5.8% drop in the number of trips from the United Kingdom, and a 5.5% reduction overall, this sector is on its knees.Easy access to the natural amenities and unique heritage of the counties that border the River Shannon and which have so much to offer tourists, anglers, boating and other sports enthusiasts would make a huge difference to local development.  The midlands region is crying out for infrastructural development, having been overlooked for funding on so many occasions.  It received a particularly raw deal in the national spatial strategy and Transport 21.  It urgently needs improved access.  The long promised rail lines between Killucan and Kinnegad and Athlone and Mullingar are still mere figments of the Government's imagination, while the Longford bypass and motorway project have yet to be delivered. The expansion of Abbeyshrule airstrip is essential to create a gateway to the midlands.According to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland, the Bill sets out a legal mechanism to increase the hit on workers' wages.  Workers have yet to feel the full impact of the doubling of the income levy, as it only came into force on 1 May.  Although it is quick to grab anything it can in increased taxes, the Government has failed yet again to get to grips with measures to stimulate economic growth.  The biggest failure of the Bill is that it has not clarified some of the more controversial aspects of the supplementary budget.  Despite publishing further details about proposed changes, it has not come to grips with exactly how some of the changes will be implemented.  This begs the question of whether the Minister for Finance has any coherent idea of what he is doing.  PAYE workers will be particularly lost in the haze of confusion as those without a filing obligation or required to submit a tax return at the end of the year do not know exactly what will be their liability.  The Bill is the stamp on a budget which was designed to make taxpayers pay the price for the Government's drastic and disastrous failures during the past ten years.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	482	I take the opportunity to congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Áine Brady, on her appointment.  I wish her success in her ministry.Yesterday, when the Minister introduced the Finance Bill to the House, he said that in recent weeks there had been some glimmers of hope that there might be an end in sight to the deepest depression we have witnessed for seven years.  I thought he was going to go on to say that the end of the Government's reign might be in sight.  The Government has made four attempts to rectify the finances of the country and to date all have failed.  Without a strategy of any kind, the Government latches on to glimmers of hope at international level — in the United States and some parts of Europe.  It may look for these but at its own back door we see the constant stream of job losses and its failure to rectify the banking system, despite its many efforts to do so, all of which have proved disastrous.  We realise the state the country is in, without hope or credibility, or the trust of the people in the Government and its capacity to lead us out of the depression.  There is no confidence in the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste, three long-standing Ministers.  They should have seen the signs, the darkening clouds over the economy.There is also a clear indication that personnel within the Department of Finance must have seen what was happening with regard to the national finances and the way in which they were deteriorating in recent years.  As recently as the last general election, all Opposition parties were told that we were looking forward to and would achieve a 4% growth rate.  That figure was given to Opposition finance spokespersons by officials in the Department.  As it has turned out, this was clearly and completely unsustainable.  I do not know how they could have made such a crucial mistake at the time.  If it had been identified and the alarms had gone off, surely something might have been done more readily.The Minister said the Finance Bill was giving effect to the supplementary measures addressed in two important requirements, showing a credible way forward on our structural problems and protecting the economy.  I do not know how any Minister could make such a statement, as regards the Government's credible way forward.  It has made three or four attempts and all of them to date have failed.  A Minister who makes a statement such as that in the current crisis must not care for what the people think nor have any concern as to how the country could be directed towards recovery in the future.There is a constant list of job losses.  Every single week we hear, tragically, that additional numbers are losing their jobs.  While, to the Minister and this Government, it might be just numbers, behind them are people with families and mortgages who must live through each day, having lost their jobs — and they are being put to the pin of their collar to sustain their livelihood.When one looks at the lists of cutbacks in this budget and the October one, one sees that the most vulnerable people in our society are affected.  In October medical cards were withdrawn for the over 70s.  In this most recent budget the Minister for Education and Science has reduced the number of special needs teachers throughout the country, with serious effects for many families.  As if that were not sufficient, we have all the other cuts, too, such as increasing class sizes and the impact this will have on opportunities for people.  When we talk about a "smart society" in other situations, how can we justify increasing class sizes, affecting every child in the country?I endorse what my colleague, Deputy Bannon, said earlier about welcoming the Minister's proposal to extend the mid-Shannon scheme for improving tourism in the inland areas throughout the country, particularly in the area around Portumna.  The record will show that throughout the terms in office of the three previous Ministers for Finance I had asked that the pilot scheme that was in place for the upper Shannon region be extended to the mid-Shannon.  It is a worthwhile initiative, although it is being restricted to the area of tourism.  It will give tourism in the mid-Shannon region the impetus it needs.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	483	I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the Finance Bill, while noting that this is just one of a number of occasions we have been discussing Finance Bills over the past 12 months — and it certainly is not a pleasant one.In reality, the only thing that will bring this country back to some type of structure is "jobs, jobs, jobs", and we cannot get away from that.  This budget, however, does absolutely nothing to encourage, safeguard or create jobs.Within the past few days I have been contacted by a number of business people about the pressure they are under as regards taxes and all the rest — yet, they have no access to finance.  That is because the whole financial crisis has been allowed to drift.  Although money is being paid into Allied Irish Banks today, as it was a short time ago to Bank of Ireland — up to €7 billion, at this stage — there has been no quid pro quo for small business people or, in fact, mortgage holders.  They are not being given a leg up.Surely, if a Government is prepared to put €7 billion into two banks — quite apart from what the total cost will be — there should have been agreement to the effect that hard-pressed business people and mortgage holders will be getting some relief.Take the case of a young girl who tied herself to a mortgage, as she was advised, to start on the home ownership ladder.  She was in what she considered to be a good job.  Her mortgage was fixed, yet her income has dropped because of levies and other taxes, so that she cannot meet it.  When she tried to renegotiate her mortgage she was told there was no problem, and that she could be released from the fixed mortgage for a sum of €6,000 — although it only has a year to go.  The relief on the fixed mortgage, had it occurred, would have been of extraordinary benefit to that young person, but nothing has been done to relieve that.The Minister for Transport, on 2 February, announced the allocation for roads.  He made a wonderful speech on that day about the importance of these roads, the employment it would give and the guarantees it would provide for industries such as agriculture etc. in rural areas when the work was carried out.  On 14 February, however, he withdrew €173 million from that sector.  In my constituency, Cavan-Monaghan, that means €10 million has been withdrawn from the regional and county roads programme.That removes jobs, opportunities, everything.  I know we are in a tight situation, but when one sees that being removed and no effort being made to curtail the waste of money at administrative level, it is absolutely sickening.  Not only will jobs be lost in the area, but the roads of Cavan-Monaghan, which were renowned for their potholes in the early 1990s, will revert to that level of deterioration.  It is important to realise that the roads in my constituency carry lorries to and from the pig and poultry units and the intensive farms and this level of activity is comparable to no other part of the country.  That is just an example of not understanding where the problems are, and how to deal with them.Housing schemes in Monaghan have been curtailed.  Work was to be done in Mullaghmatt housing estate, Monaghan town, Bree in Castleblayney, Cloughvalley, Carrickmacross — all to do with homes for the elderly or single parents.  That would have given work to small builders etc., as would jobs in education structures.  I welcome the summer scheme, which has certainly been a big help to schools all over the country.  However, a devolved scheme was available up to two years ago, which allowed small schools to be built or restructured.  I am mindful of Laragh, County Cavan, some of whose inhabitants were in here with the Minister the other day.  They have the site ready and a local builder could go ahead and create jobs straight away, taking people off social welfare, and ultimately providing a proper structure for the children.  The same is true in Rockcorry.  I could go on and on.We need to have some rethinking as regards how we actually create jobs.  If we continue to put people onto social welfare, while not creating any employment or exports, then we are in real trouble.  We must give people some hope, and unfortunately this Finance Bill gives neither the element of hope nor assurance that is needed.  All it does is take these away when it is jobs and more jobs that we want.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	484	I welcome the opportunity of speaking on the Finance Bill 2009.  It is significant enough to be dealing with a supplementary budget which was introduced on 1 April 2009.  I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Áine Brady, on her recent promotion as Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children and wish her every success in that post.In my 12 years in the Dáil, I have never seen a major Finance Bill introduced mid-way through the financial year.  It is right that the Bill is being introduced.  Some people seem to think there is an instant solution to the world's economic difficulties and that the problem can be solved with a single announcement.  The Government is continuously watching the national finances and the country's overall economic and financial situation and, where necessary, bringing forward extra measures.  This is what is being done on this occasion.  We will see another budget before the end of 2009. In a small open economy such as ours, it is right that the Government operate in a flexible manner and be in a position to take corrective action when that is required.It would be negligent of the Government to introduce a single annual budget and let the economy fend for itself for 12 months.  That was all very well when the economy was in a strong position, exports were booming, tax rates were strong and there was strong domestic demand.  In those circumstances people wanted less Government interference in their lives and to be allowed to get on with spending their own money.  When situations change it is essential that the Government react accordingly.  In difficult times, it is important that the Government take a hands-on approach, as it is doing now by introducing a second Finance Bill.Many measures in the Bill are not popular.  We do not like having to introduce them but it is the responsible thing to do.  We accept that some measures are not popular but I believe people will soon respect the Government for taking these decisions.  Not all of the decisions are perfect.  Every Member of the House, and even on this side of the House, would quibble with some aspect of the Bill.  It is not possible to be fully right and there is no single magic solution.  The Government is doing its best, based on the information made available to it on a monthly basis.The establishment of the National Asset Management Agency was announced on the day of the supplementary budget.  Legislation for this will be brought forward.  This is another example of the Government taking a hands-on approach to issues which it would not have had to deal with in previous years.Ireland is not alone in its difficulties.  Many Irish people have Sky television and can watch news programmes from the United States, France, Russia and other countries.  It is clear from watching worldwide television stations that people in every country believe theirs is the only country suffering a recession, that their Government is in the worst possible situation and they cannot understand how they got into their present difficulties.  People think local.  In Ireland, we think about this country and we do not worry about problems in France, Italy, Turkey or anywhere else.  However, all of these countries have problems, just as we have.  We are all having to fight our own corners but we are all suffering the same vagaries of the international economy.We are seeing some signs of a pick-up internationally.  The world recession has hit Ireland harder than other countries because we are one of the most open economies in the world.  The ratio of our exports to total economic production is among the highest among OECD countries.  As we are more reliant on a strong world economy we are more affected by a world downturn.  Despite this, international figures show that Irish exports are performing better than those of most other exporting countries.  Although there is a significant downturn in world trade, the relative downturn in Irish exports is substantially less.  We are holding, and even increasing, our market share while other countries are losing market share in the world economy.  This is partly due to the nature and quality of our exports.  Many of our exports are in the food sector.  Food is an essential daily necessity and not a luxury item. Computer technology and information systems are also significant exports.  They are now essential to every business and in every walk of life.  Ireland also exports medical devices and medicines.  These are also essential to people's daily lives.  These commodities are maintaining their hold on the market.Other countries which have been heavily reliant on export trade are dependent on the sale of cars and high end luxury electronic items such as plasma TV screens and computer games, demand for which has dropped greatly.  Countries which rely on the luxury holiday trade are also suffering.  These items are seen as luxuries and purchase of them can be postponed.  One cannot postpone one's purchase of food.  Because of the make-up of our economy, we will pick up quicker than many of our exporting competitors.However, we have domestic problems.  The Supplementary Budget Statement on 7 April dealt with the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency.  This is very welcome.  The agency is being discussed in every home and television studio in Ireland, and there are significant differences of opinion about it.  There is no single answer to all our difficulties.  The task of the Government is to take account of all available information, make the best possible decision and work through that decision.  This evening, during Private Members' time, we will hear one Opposition party demand the instant nationalisation of the banks while another will oppose that approach.  The Government is somewhere in the middle.  It is taking control of the difficulties without actually nationalising the banks.  That is the correct middle ground.There will be inherent difficulties, no matter what approach one takes.  One of the reasons quoted for the privatisation of Irish Life, which was a state supported commercial organisation, was that it could not do business in certain countries, such as the United States, which did not want state controlled financial companies operating in their jurisdictions.  If we were to nationalise Irish banks, they would immediately be prohibited from carrying on some of their banking activities in certain countries which do not like the concept of state controlled or state monopolised banking institutions operating within their economies.  We should not forget this fact of life, even though some people think it is not an issue.  We are part of a world economy and we must operate on that basis.We have heard of Allied Irish Banks increasing the write down of its property portfolio.  It has gone to €4.3 billion in the last number of days, which is up a significant amount, and it may increase again.  If it requires legislation as part of NAMA or something else, it must be done but I have no wish to see these write-downs being allowed to be carried forward by the banks and financial institutions as losses against a future corporation tax bill.  That would represent a further subsidy to them by the taxpayer.  They have made a mess of it and are being bailed out, more than generously, by the taxpayer.

This is the second time I have referred to Sky Television.  On Sky Television and a good many American television programmes it seems every night that people are being led away in handcuffs, even for a parking offence.  As a result, most people in Ireland work on the basis that if one does anything wrong but is not led away in handcuffs, it is no good.  There is a different way of doing business in Ireland, England and other European countries.

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	494	I understand; it is a human reaction.  However, I am serious about this issue.Let us consider a calculation.  If the banks have a write-down of €8 billion in their property portfolio and the corporation tax rate is 12%, that is the equivalent of €1 billion in tax which need not be paid if the write-downs can be carried forward.  That would make it very attractive to a potential purchaser, perhaps a foreign international institution.  Such an institution might purchase these banks for the €1 billion of income tax that could be written off through double taxation agreements in respect of the various countries in which reside the parent companies of such financial institutions.  Perhaps this issue is being addressed but it would grate on people if such write-downs were to be offset against future tax receipts which should be paid to the Exchequer.  Most would agree with me in this regard.I refer to the chairpersons and chief executives of the six major banks.  Each one of them should be out of office in the immediate future.  The majority already are.  It is only right that the 12 chairmen and chief executives should go.  They should go in an orderly manner rather than have every one of them leave on a given Friday evening or Monday morning, as that would cause further difficulties for the credibility of Irish financial institutions.  Those who sat at the top of these institutions, regardless of how capable or intelligent they believe they are, have caused significant problems for the taxpayer.  They have no role in solving these problems and it is important that we recognise this.I was amazed with the survey from ISME, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, about which I heard on radio this morning.  Some 58% of small and medium sized industries which approached the banks for credit in the past three months were refused.

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	496	Some 100% of the local businesses represented in my office last Monday evening had been refused credit or loan facilitates which they might otherwise have been granted.We can use all the fancy words we wish, but the simple, basic stimulus needed in the economy is cash flow from the banks to businesses.  Businesses seek additional finance by way of loans and overdrafts because they are owed money by debtors.  In addition, they cannot afford to pay their creditors.  The major banks are telling businesses not to pay their suppliers.  If the next supplier in the chain is not paid, he or she cannot pay the next supplier in turn and so on.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	497	That is correct.  It is the domino effect.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	498	There is a vicious circle and the banks are starving companies of funding.  I understand they are nervous and that they do not know where they are going.  However, there are good and viable businesses which are vulnerable.  They should not be but they are because the banks will not provide the normal source of credit to companies.  Any business producing a product has the intellectual ability to do so; it has the marketing ability to sell that product; it has the raw materials to manufacture it and the financial resources to carry on the business while doing so.  Access to credit is a basic material in any business.  It is as fundamental as the raw materials that a given company needs.  When a business is starved of one of the materials it needs to operate, there is a detrimental effect.  I hope when NAMA is up and running and the banks receive a cash injection from bonds they can cash in with the European Central Bank, it will translate into cash flow.  There must be absolute guarantees in this regard.  If that does not take place, the entire exercise is pointless.  I do not believe it is but when the implementation of the measures takes place, we must make that case very strongly.In the past ten years there has been an increase in living standards for many.  In recent weeks I have listened to elderly people such as those we all meet in the course of our daily business.  They may be in their 70s or 80s.  Some have addressed me as "Young lad", for which I am thankful, and stated they really know what tough times are and that current circumstances are not nearly as bad as before.  They are taking it in their stride.  People who have been around for a long time and, perhaps, are a generation older than the rest of us have been through tough times before and know what it means.  Nevertheless, they have survived.  I do not underestimate the difficulties we face.  They are as bad as they have been for more than a generation.  However, previous generations faced greater difficulties which they overcame and I believe the same will happen in this case.One challenge facing the Government is the €21 billion or €22 billion to be spent on social welfare.  A mechanism should be put in place whereby a portion of this sum will be allocated to employment or job supports.  Many who were earning between €500 and €700 a week and have now lost their jobs and are in receipt of jobseeker's benefit or jobseeker's allowance would be happier to be in work.  If social welfare payments could in some way be linked to their employers to keep them in employment, it would be far better for the people concerned and the economy.  Ultimately, we must work our way out of the recession.  We will not be able to tax or spend our way out of it.I refer to specific sections of the Bill.  I realise the income levies are unpopular but because we are in mid-year and because of the way the PAYE system works it is the most practical way of proceeding.  Perhaps at the end of the year such levies could be integrated with the normal taxation system.  However, what is important is that the levies catch a great many who might otherwise escape if the revenue was raised based on taxable income because of the various write-offs available.Certain amendments to mortgage interest relief were introduced on 1 May.  I do not believe Revenue handled this matter well.  Some have difficulties in respect of whether they have been making repayments for more than seven years and so on.  Revenue should have let the scheme roll until it sorted out the problems and if there was something to be recouped, it could have been done during the course of the year.During January and February there were 30,000 job losses each month.  However, that has not been the case since.  We have not reached green pastures yet but the worst months are behind us.  The situation has not fully bottomed out but in terms of job losses, the worst is behind us.  I welcome the change in the corporation tax rate from 22% to 25% and the reduction in the amount of interest one must pay in respect of late payments of taxation as a result of reducing interest rates.I commend the Bill to the House and trust it will move successfully through Committee, Report and Final Stages in the coming weeks.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	499	I have already congratulated the Minister of State and wished her well.I listened with great care to the speeches made by Government speakers.  It is important that we are forthcoming, clear and honest with the public who are evaluating this debate, yet so far there has not been the slightest statement that there will be any departure from a model of the economy that has significantly failed.  I have just heard it said again that it was a feature of the good times that people wanted little State interference, that they wanted their own money and did not want to pay tax.  In fact, that was the seed of the disaster.The seed was sown by one of the worst Ministers for Finance since the State was founded, Mr. McCreevy.  It was suggested there should be light regulation of the banking sector.  Those who supported this, under the influence of the Progressive Democrats, were not anti-State as some on the left have said.  They wanted the State to work for them.  They wanted all the transfers that were necessary to socialise costs, but they wanted the least State interference in the yield.  At a certain stage, we could assess the value of what Mr. McCreevy introduced.  In November 2004 the Revenue Commissioners calculated that the annual cost of tax reliefs was €8.4 billion.  When we looked into how they were disposed of and who participated, we saw something very interesting, particularly in the information on schemes such as those for car parks and hotels.  The figures provided in volumes 1, 2 and 3 of the invaluable work the Department of Finance prepared in 2006 show that 83.3% of those who participated in schemes for car parks and two thirds of those who participated in schemes for holiday camps had an income of more than €200,000.  How many on €50,000 or less participated?  The figure was zero.  In other words, contrary to the notion that we all had it so good until somehow it all fell apart, a small number were doing very well.Let us have some real, honest facts about what happened and why we are where we are.  I have listened for weeks to people saying Anglo Irish Bank was of systemic importance to the Irish banking sector, this bank with few retail outlets, 50 of whose customers had loans of €500 million each.  That is what the Government side described as being of systemic importance.  No one who is serious about economics suggests Anglo Irish Bank was of systemic importance.  That is why the Department of Finance, in preparing the legislation, decided not to include it in the guarantee scheme but to nationalise it directly.  It was disruptive for reasons we will never know.Another reason for our problem is that we had a financial sector with light regulation.  Mr McCreevy did not take this up from the wind.  This is a problem for parties of the right which must tell the public whether they are in favour of reviving light regulation and speculative investment in property rather than investment in a productive economy.  Are they saying everything we do this year, next year and the following year should be to get back to that point again?  The defining characteristic of everything the Labour Party and I say on the economy and the banking sector is that there is no going back to that failed model.  We need a social economy and a form of banking regulation that give us the quickest possible credit flow.  We need the system to be transparent to the public and a method of valuing toxic assets.  That must be done with the least risk to and the best chance for the taxpayer to participate in the upside when the NAMA exercise, if it is to happen, is over.  However, we do not believe the NAMA model can work.  I will return to this issue.I agree with the previous speaker who is at least trying to think his way through the Government's proposals, but we should consider the following horror scenario.  The Minister has spoken about the two sections of the Bill that seek to curtail the possibility of banks registering the losses that will be identified by whatever mechanism is used as concessions against tax.  Unfortunately, however, the Bill does not deal with tax from the previous year.  The taxpayer stands to lose bank losses, building speculators' losses and what might have been future provision for tax to be paid in the next few years.  I am not deliberately painting a black picture.  I am simply saying a responsible Finance Bill would not only have addressed the issue in the way sections 5 and 6 of the Bill do, but would have reached back and also have anticipated future tax benefits, which will now be lost.It is important that the public knows the figures.  In the seven years of the McCreevy era, between 1999 and 2006, the cost of urban renewal in tax forgone was €1,423 million.  Again, two thirds of those who participated had incomes of more than €200,000.  A small group in the economy benefited from the McCreevy tax breaks and drove the property bubble using Anglo Irish Bank as their gambling club.  When everything fell apart, the Government fell back on the laziest and quickest way of receiving income — through levies on people whose incomes can be accessed easily.Was any of this accidental?  I can guarantee it was not.  In a written question I asked the Minister for Finance "the research that has been carried out over the past ten years by his Department on the extent and breakdown of wealth, as opposed to income here; the findings of such research; if he will make these findings available" and "the changes in findings and figures on a year to year basis over this ten year period".  On Thursday, 26 March, he replied: "I have been informed that no general research has been carried out over the past ten years by either the Department of Finance or the Revenue Commissioners regarding the extent and breakdown of wealth as opposed to income".  The ideological mindset that wanted light regulation, invented the property bubble and funded it through this little racket called Anglo Irish Bank never even intended to allow studies of wealth.  The Government could go after its strategy and then, when everything collapsed, cut expenditure, even on vital services such as the homes for people with Alzheimer's disease that will not go ahead and the schools that will lose special needs teachers.  On the income side, it is using levies because, as we heard, it can be done quickly.I turn to other interesting suggestions made.  We need to decide on the best model for dealing with a banking sector that is standing like a ghost and preventing progress on what we regard as the central problem: job protection, job creation and investment.  If that is the case, the issue is how one will get credit flowing again from the banking system.  The notion we have had since that night in September last, namely, that there would be a public interest director sitting there, is useless and insufficient because company law has not been changed and such a director has a responsibility in law to the board.  I suggest in principle that one must minimise the risk to the taxpayer and ensure the taxpayer has the best prospect at the end of the exercise of participating in any gain as we come out of the recession.  Does NAMA do this?   No, it does not.The Government proposal contains the possibility of further capitalisation which may, in turn, lead to higher proportions of equity, and one will end up providing the equity but not having control.  There is no point indulging in childish argument that nationalisation is expropriation; it is not.  The temporary nationalisation that has been suggested by the Labour Party and the majority of academic economists dealing with banking in this country is intended for the short term because it is the fastest way of putting a transparent valuation on assets that are toxic.  It also has the benefit of being able to deal with several different institutions where the collateral has been spread.I am perfectly interested in listening to people's strategies for dealing with issues in regard to banking, to which the Minister referred.  However, I see another downside, namely, the predators who are waiting internationally for asset disposal.  It is funny to have Fianna Fáil decide to begin using Peter Sutherland as a kind of recently discovered saint.  Goldman Sachs, for example, has a Vintage Fund V, which has $5 billion waiting to purchase distressed assets.  Therefore, does one write down the value of the assets to such a point that one leaves oneself open to predators?  Alternatively, if one wants a lesser discount, this will mean the taxpayer must carry a greater burden.  I have no time to go into the detail of this.  I simply state that nationalisation as suggested by the Labour Party is not suggested on any limited ideological ground; it is suggested as the way of giving the most transparent valuation of assets and the fastest possible method of creating credit within the banking system, which gives control through a banking commission in regard to the top level.I heard talk of how they are quietly going away.  They are not going away.  The chairman and chief executive of AIB are in fact standing for election to the board.  This notion that somehow they are all walking away is nonsense.  There is not the slightest suggestion from any of these people in the banking sector that they did anything wrong.I do not suggest the situation with regard to toxicity is similar to the position in the US, where rating agencies, disgracefully conflicted as some of them were in regard to the proportion of shares that were owned by major investors in the United States, gave AAA ratings to absolutely dud instruments that were then sold internationally.  In the Irish case, what is very important is how we will ever get a credit policy from the banking system that will enable the real economy to take off.  I support those on all sides of the House who correctly point to the highly educated population, our experience and the high tech nature of our industry, which we all want to get going again.  In that regard, I support the tax concession in the Finance Bill for the purchase of instruments such as an international technology patents and processes which will enable start-ups.  However, I noted an absence of strategy in the budget speech, which very quickly went away from the Second Stage text and moved on to the sections in summary, which is really a matter for Committee Stage.I know the Minister is in a difficulty.  Having put all of the resources that are available into trying to bail out the banks, there are no resources for a stimulus package similar to what has been announced in more than 40 other countries, which is what we want to see.  People on all sides of this House want to see a graduate placement programme and measures like the Earn and Learn scheme where one can work part-time and be educated.  They want to see FÁS expanded to deal with upskilling and they want local bodies such as community development bodies being turned into employment creation bodies.  I believe we have many rich resources in the creative economy, particularly in the west, where there are highly educated people and possibilities for new jobs in music, the film industry, the arts and so forth.  However, if we are to do this, the real economy's needs should be up-fronted in regard to employment.Every unit of employment we add to the unemployment statistics costs us between €25,000 and €35,000.  Given the half-baked way it is being done, one could end up with cuts in vital areas of expenditure and increases in levies to give yield but with the greater proportion not keeping up with what one is losing on the employment side because of the necessity to pay social welfare while losing tax income.  One has to change this around.  It is interesting to note the European Commission's advice to the Irish Government and other members of the European Union.  The good point about Ireland is the debt to GDP ratio.  However, it makes sense to borrow internationally for a stimulus to the real economy rather than being forced late in the day, after NAMA has faced its legal challenges, after it has been obstructed and even after the delays in bringing the legislation through this House, to use vital resources, even borrowing, to service at an increased rate the day-to-day borrowing requirements which have been largely and massively increased by the strategy for the banks.  What would make sense, therefore, is to consider the requirements of the real economy and the liquidity that is necessary, structure it into a fiscal strategy and then, in turn, we can argue about the banks in regard to the working of NAMA.Some of my former academic colleagues are debating the issue of the difference between nationalisation and NAMA.  One must deal with this question and I have one piece of advice.  There are certain things we know.  For example, Ray Kinsella in his contributions has a good idea in regard to the exposure of the loan book of, say, Allied Irish Banks.  While I have no time to go into it here, I ask whether one would trust the board of a bank that first said it needed no capital injection from Government, then sought a capital injection, then said it was not sufficient and has now said that 24% of its loan book is under scrutiny and, as we have just heard, its bad debt provision is being increased by 250%.  While we know certain things that are factual, there are other things that are matters of opinion.  There is not a jot of evidence to suggest the international lending system would perceive a nationalisation model as different from any other structure.  The European Commission's document is very interesting and specifically states that some member countries may go for a nationalisation model before they move to the other instruments of restoring their banking system.  We should draw a distinction between what are matters of fact and matters of opinion.While I welcome the debate among economists in regard to what is the best strategy, the temporary nationalisation of banks of systemic importance offers us the fastest and most complete option.  It minimises the risk for taxpayers and maximises the up-front yield in regard to the end of the process.  It gives us the best transparency, the best management system across institutions and the best possibility of being able to link real economy possibilities and strategies through the boards on the banks.  I believe it is temporary and will recommend itself.  It is not true to say this is in any way bailing out shareholders or bondholders at the cost of taxpayers.  It is possible to deal with the shareholder issue through the trust we have suggested.Another myth is the suggestion that if we do something such as I suggest, this would discourage international bondholders.  When our banking system has been made clean and profitable, they will be back within hours, not days.  Therefore, the notion of the discouraged bondholder is a myth.

#BeverleyCooperFlynn	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-party	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-dob	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	502	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill.  I recognise that because of the current economic climate in which we find ourselves it has been necessary to broaden the tax base of the economy.  I welcome the fact that we have retained the corporation tax rate at 12.5% and that the exemptions for the income levies have been extended to those with a medical card and that higher thresholds have been introduced for those over 65 years of age.I would like to spend my time dealing with the final point made by the Minister when he said he would give consideration to any constructive suggestions made during the debate.  The first issue I wish to consider relates to sections 3 and 4 of the Bill and deals with mortgage interest relief.  We all know that relief will be restricted to the first seven years for persons with qualifying loans.  From my experience in my constituency and having received texts from many people today, I am aware that many families are experiencing significant pressure with their mortgage repayments as a result of the pension levy and the change to the income levy.  I received an e-mail today from a person in my constituency who has seen a reduction in his weekly income of 40.7% when all of the changes in allowances and mortgage interest relief are taken into consideration.Many are annoyed by the recapitalisation of the banks, at €7.5 billion plus, that will materialise in the coming weeks.  They are annoyed because they do not see any benefit for ordinary citizens.  They are paying for it through their pockets, but they are not receiving any real benefit.  I am not just talking about small businesses, although these are essential, but about ordinary individual citizens of the State, people with one house — their primary residence — and mortgage.  Through no fault of their own, many of them have lost their jobs.  We are in a dreadful situation where so many have become unemployed in recent months and the people concerned find themselves in a very difficult situation with regard to the banks.  Deputy Ardagh referred to this issue and I support his call for real movement on the part of the banks to ease the pressure on those with mortgages who find themselves in this situation and relieve their fears.  The Government has asked for a period of five years to get the public finances in order.  Therefore, it is only fair that we should say to the banks that those who find themselves in a difficult situation because of the economic downturn should be given a period of years to get themselves back on track.  This means giving them the opportunity to pay only interest on their mortgages for a number of years.  Whether they are on a fixed or variable rate, those in crisis must be looked at with sensitivity and flexibility, particularly by the banks which are being funded by the taxpayer.  I ask that the rate of interest to be applied be reduced to the cost of overnight money in the banks which is in the region of 1.75%.  If this suggestion was implemented and breathing space was given to mortgage holders, it would make a huge difference.  It would keep people in their homes and ease their fears.  It would also mean greater acceptance by ordinary citizens of the importance of protecting the banks in order that the economy can be protected and would create an awareness that this also affects Joe Bloggs in his or her pay packet.  I urge the Minister to give consideration to this measure on Committee Stage.I have spoken on many occasions in the House about a sector that does not find favour with many — the construction industry.  I agree with some of the comments made by Commissioner Charlie McCreevy when he addressed the Leinster Society of Chartered Accountants last week.  While we are in this mess because of problems caused by the banking sector and property developers and builders, the people concerned will play a significant part in the recovery of the economy.  They may not be the same people, but we will require developers and builders to play an important part.  This may not be to the same extent as in the past, but they will have an important role to play.There are negatives in the Bill for the construction sector, in particular the abolition of mortgage interest relief which is to be phased out over seven years.  The reduction in interest relief on residential property loans, from 100% to 75%, is also a negative.  Many may have invested in a second home in order to put their children through college.  Rents have reduced and barely meet repayments.  Now, following the reduction in interest relief from 100% to 75% and despite the fact that interest rates have reduced, they are in a situation where it may not be possible for them to retain these properties.  This will result in a flood of additional properties onto the market, which is a further negative for the construction sector.The one positive in the Bill is to be found in section 20 which deals with the exchange of houses scheme.  However, to be honest, this a complete and utter waste of time — in my constituency at least.  I hope the Minister will pardon me for saying this, but this measure does not offer any value.  It has been included as a positive, but it will make no impact in my constituency.

#BeverleyCooperFlynn	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-party	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-dob	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	504	I do not believe any bank in my constituency would accept an exchange of property as part of a deal on the sale of a house.  As this does not appear to be a positive measure, I make a suggestion.  I checked the information on my constituency of Mayo today, where there are 1,704 on the housing list.  We have 40,000 unsold units in the housing market, many of which may be taken over by NAMA and sold in getting rid of toxic debt.  We should buy up some of these houses now so as to reduce the number of unsold housing units.  The Government could borrow €3 billion to purchase 20,000 units which would reduce the unsold housing stock by half.  It could pay the money back over ten years.  If it was repaid at a rate of 5%, it would cost the Government €315 million per annum, but the reduction in rent supplement being paid would help in reducing this.  In addition, the average rent of €100 per week for people in social housing would bring in an additional €104 million in income for local government which sorely needs these funds.  We are all aware of sewerage and water schemes that have not been able to go ahead because of the shortage of funds at local authority level.  I urge the Minister to consider this measure.I have also suggested to the Minister that the amount of VAT tied up in the remainder of the unsold housing units is significant.  It would be better to get in as much of this VAT now and use it at a time it is needed.  If what we received only amounted to 60% to 65% of the VAT payable, it should be used to try to encourage young first-time buyers to buy a house within the next 12 months so as to stimulate growth and the economy.  I say this as someone who comes from a constituency where some 9,000 construction workers are out of work.  County Mayo has one of the largest proportions of construction workers in the country and unemployment is a problem.  I am not talking about high rollers but about carpenters, electricians and blocklayers, people who find themselves in great difficulty.I welcome the fact that the Minister has said discussions are ongoing with the car industry.  It is interesting that in all counties more people work in the car industry than in the banks.  Before the supplementary budget was introduced, SIMI suggested a car scrappage scheme, coupled with VAT proposals relating to the sale of second-hand cars.  I note the point the Minister made with regard to changes in VAT but urge him to re-examine introducing a car scrappage scheme in conjunction with the VAT changes.  Such an approach worked very successfully in Germany.  I know both economies are in recession, but in Germany a €2,500 trade-in price for a car more than nine years old resulted in an increase of 21% in the sale of new cars.  This is something that should be considered.  I am aware that the Minister said previously that in order to be viable such a measure would require the sale of 20,000 new cars, but it should be considered.I would like to touch on section 17 and the exemption from the air travel tax for small airports.  During the debate on the previous Finance Bill I welcomed the fact that the Minister had reduced the air travel tax from €10 to €2 for regional airports such as Knock.  I ask that this charge be done away with.  There should be no travel tax at airports such as Knock.  People assume that the airport at Knock depends on operational subsidies but this is not the case.  Ireland West Airport is a low-cost, profitable, independent airport that receives no operational subsidy and 97% of its traffic is directed to 28 international destinations.  Its success works against it because being in profit it receives no State operational support but the introduction of this travel tax will result in a reduction in tourism numbers and, therefore, the Government needs to revisit this issue.The Minister for Finance should examine the introduction of a Government bond for citizens.  I do not have time to explain the concept now but I will try to do so during Private Member's Business later this evening.  Instead of looking for funding internationally, the Government might look to its own people.  For those who have money, the average amount of savings has gone up from 3.8% to 8% in the past 12 months.  Many people may like to play their part in the recovery of our economy instead of the Government's seeking money on the international markets.

We are experiencing a greater contraction in activity in the economy than was anticipated.  In his past year, as Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach indicated that the Government was aware of the downturn that was coming, especially in respect of the building sector, and he stated the effect that would have on our growth rate.  Nobody, whether politician, economist or banker, foresaw the collapse of the banking system around the world, commencing with Lehmann Brothers and others in the United States, the United Kingdom and elsewhere.  This had a serious impact on our economy because we export 85% to 90% of our goods, which accounts for the same percentage of our GDP.  A total of 18% or 19% of our exports go to Britain.  The 30% devaluation in the British pound against the euro had a significant effect on our exports to that market and similarly to the US which takes 20% of our exports.  Despite this we have held our share of the export market compared with similar trading countries, such as Singapore which has lost up to 30% of its export markets, and Taiwan which has lost 40%.Opposition speakers continue to say the Government has no strategy but this is patently untrue.

#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	507	Since the middle of last year the Government made a decision to secure the banking sector, not for the benefit of individuals in, or directors of, the banks but for the benefit of the people, those who have deposits in the banking system, for the trade and commerce which could not operate without a banking system.  It is not perfect but if the Government had not made that decision the banking system would have collapsed.  In order to make it more successful, it is necessary to clean out the banks, which NAMA will do.  That will enable banks to extend more credit to those who are having difficulty getting it now.The British Central Bank printed billions of pounds and put them into the economy to keep the system alive but that has not worked.  The United States printed trillions of dollars and put them into the system but that has not kickstarted the economy in the way it had been hoped.  As Deputy Fleming said, people watching Sky News can see that the same, if not worse, is happening around the world.The Government has proposed NAMA to make the banks operable again.  An asset purchase scheme has a threefold goal. It can remove the distraction from bank management of trying to recover problem loans, and allow it to refocus on new, sound lending which is essential for the future of the economy; it can help improve loan recovery by separating that task from the team that made the loans; and it can replace assets of uncertain value with safe and marketable assets.  There will be further discussion on this but a similar scheme succeeded in Spain, Sweden and the United States but not in Ghana, Mexico, the Philippines and Senegal which are undeveloped economies.  When we get these systems going the banks should look sympathetically on people who are having trouble repaying their mortgages and reduce the interest charges to 1.75% for the next four or five years while the economy is in recovery mode.Opposition spokespersons have said time and again that nothing is being done to promote enterprise and employment.  This is another lie.

I believe Deputy Michael Ahern's speech was delivered about six or seven years ago.  The Members who have just spoken, Deputy Michael Ahern and Deputy Flynn, have gone home already.  This is crazy and demonstrates how the country is being run.  Members are coming into the House and obviously using scripts that were in mode five, six, seven or ten years ago.  I cannot understand what is happening.What worries me most is that the Government is not only denying the existence of the circumstances into which it has brought the people and the country, it is also promoting more of the same.  It is suggesting that if it had more money, it would have done the same with it and shoved the whole lot down the drain in one fell swoop.  The country needs a general election in a hurry to create some rationale for what is occurring and counteract the madness on the other side of the House.  The country is in an appalling financial mess, brought about by a Government that was delirious, roaming around the countryside as if there were no tomorrow, spending money on every single thing that could be thought of, wasting money left, right and centre and living in dreamland or cloud-cuckoo-land.  All of a sudden the chickens have come home to roost and everything has dried up.Some very interesting remarks have been made.  On the banking system, for instance, it has been suggested Members on this side of the House would be gleeful if bankers were put in prison.  Nobody would be gleeful.  It used to be said around the House that politicians would never be put in prison, but they were.  There are a few sacred cows around yet who obviously have no regard whatsoever for the national good and can walk away grinning about it.  I do not want to see anybody being punished publicly but I do want people to accept their full share of responsibility.  This includes the politicians on the other side of the House who have been promoting this nonsense for the past ten years.We were told until now that the economic fundamentals were sound and that the country, therefore, could not go wrong.  The fundamentals have not been sound for the past ten years and there is no sense in pretending that they were.  The macro-economic sector was being handled badly and the micro-economic sector could not follow it and had nowhere to go.  Therefore, the whole lot went down together.  I cannot understand for the life of me why people make speeches such as those we have just heard and continue to do so, even in the current climate.  Some 90% of the problems we face were created within the country by the Government.  Down in Ballybrit, before the tent was closed, Government members used to rub their hands in glee over what was happening.  They claimed the country was making a fortune and was the second or third richest country in the world.  I cannot be sure whether it was the second or third richest but, irrespective of which, it no longer has that honour.It appals me that we are in the current circumstances.  In the budget first mooted last September there was a prediction of unemployment levels and likely expenditure on social welfare was identified.  The social welfare budget is still far short of what is required in the current year.  This is because the Government could not even plan properly when the recession was close.Individuals have said this is the first time we have seen such a recession but that is not true.  They have said it is the first time the banking system has collapsed in the way it has but that is not true either.  The banking system collapsed throughout the world, particularly in the United States, in the 1930s after a spending spree similar to the one we experienced in the past ten years.  Reality failed to dawn and everybody was living for today and saying, "To hell with tomorrow".In recent months loans of 100% to first-time house buyers were identified as the problem.  They never were.  There was nothing wrong with 100% loans but there was a problem with 180% loans and 200% loans.  I was in the courts a couple of weeks ago giving evidence on behalf of a constituent who had received from a mortgage company a loan of exactly 200% instead of what he should have received on the basis of his income.  There are long lists of repossessions in the courts every day, all pertaining to unfortunate, gullible, innocent first-time buyers who were placed in appalling circumstances.  They are in over their heads to such an extent that they cannot salvage themselves, with the consequence that their houses are now being repossessed.  Their spouses and children are all vulnerable.  The State will have to address this issue.Deputy Flynn has made the realistic point that thousands of houses are locked up and will have to be sold.  Nobody will buy them at the prices at which they were expected to be sold last year or the year before.  They will have to be sold at a knock-down price and there will at last be a bonanza for the first-time buyer.  The existence of first-time buyers will be recognised, I hope before too long.  However, there will be a serious problem of negative equity for those who bought houses in the past seven or eight years.  This can be resolved, although I do not propose to speak about how it can be in the short time available to me tonight.  Until such time as this issue is dealt with, there will be no movement in the economy.  It will be stuck with a huge overhang of debt — a cantilever of debt — which, unfortunately, is beyond the powers of management of ordinary people.At a time of economic crisis such as this, the obvious stimulus is to cut taxes and reduce the burden on the citizen but the Government has done the very opposite.  This is a new form of fiscal rectitude.  The Government has decided to punish the unfortunate people who had nothing to do with the downturn and who are receiving a punishment beating daily.  Sadly, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and everybody else in the House knows, in a few months the Government will be back again with a carrot in one hand and a stick in the other to beat up the people once more.  This will happen because its economic policy is flawed and just does not work.  Tired as the Government may be of hearing this, it is time it got its act together and listened to advice on what is going wrong and what was going wrong for a long time and which needs to be addressed.  If this does not occur, the recovery will be postponed for years.  It will not be possible for it to take place.What has happened in the international banking system has happened before.  There was no magic overnight panacea, nor will there be now.  Deputy Michael D. Higgins compared the Irish, European and US social models.  We have had lots of debates in this House on the issue during the years.  I have no hang-ups regarding the public and private sectors.  There are some areas in which services are delivered better by the public sector.  For example, utility services are delivered at least as well by the public sector.  I do not want to debate Eircom now but it is a case in point that continues to come to mind.  There are also other examples.  In some jurisdictions it has always been recognised that where the public sector concedes to the private sector in areas such as those to which I refer, there should be ongoing investment in infrastructure to ensure the service provider can continue to operate.  Apparently, we do not have such a system here.  The theory is that the primary interest is that of the shareholder but it is not because the customer is also a shareholder.  The interests of customers must be borne in mind at all times.I cannot understand why people say nobody could have foreseen the downturn.  I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle cannot understand this.

They were ignored.It is sad that we have had this financial episode.  I have no doubt the country will recover, but it will require good leadership and foresight.  We have recovered from similar situations in the past.  However, a recognition is first required from those responsible that they did wrong.  They must apologise to the Irish people in the first instance.

If we care to read the spring report of the ESRI, we will see it outlines the serious economic circumstances in which we find ourselves.  The most staggering information in it relates to the growth in unemployment.  The ESRI commentators expect employment to be 1,917,000 in 2009, which is 187,300 lower than in 2008.  That is frightening.  It is now possible that we could have half a million unemployed in a year's time.  That will have major implications for our system and I doubt we are prepared for it.The Government is coming up with few real job creation initiatives.  One such initiative, which I mentioned here recently and which I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister, is the restoration of the community youth training programmes, which were successful across the country in providing community initiative and care centres, dressing rooms for sporting clubs and so on.  These projects were discontinued during the boom.  The Construction Industry Federation was opposed to them on the basis that the trainees may have been replacing some of its contractors on projects.  However, there is now little work for anyone, and apprentices in particular cannot finish their courses because they are unable to find employers with whom to complete their employment modules.  Thus, many apprentices are now being told they will not qualify.I suggest this be considered carefully and seriously.  I mentioned this to the Minister of State's colleague, Deputy Dara Calleary, and he was supportive of such an initiative.  A fair amount of serious employment would be created, and it would allow various apprentices — carpenters, plasterers, blocklayers, plumbers and electricians — to qualify while providing a good boost for communities across the country.  I am aware of a number of projects that could go ahead tomorrow if such labour was available to them, as they have money available locally.  Obviously, in the absence of national lottery funding this year they cannot take on contractors, but they could use this type of system.  I suggest, as a positive contribution to the debate, that this should be considered.As the unemployment figures soar, unfortunately — unlike in the 1980s and early 1990s, when large numbers of people left to go to the USA, the UK and Australia — there are few places where people would now be rewarded sufficiently to encourage them to go.  We know how difficult it is to get into America, but it is also the case for Australia.  I have had inquiries from a number of parents looking for contacts in places such as Sydney, where there was an abundance of jobs some years ago but it is now difficult to get work.  This will become a major challenge for the Government in the next five years, but in the immediate future we need creative ideas and approaches to meet this challenge.  Sitting back and doing nothing will only make the problem worse.The other economic commentary I examined was the report of the Economist Intelligence Unit on Ireland from May 2009.  This is also quite pessimistic.  It reports that correction of the banking system will be a considerable challenge because of the way in which we are exposed.  The EIU is more or less in agreement with the IMF's analysis of Ireland in its financial stability report, indicating that we have major problems and because of our toxic assets it will be quite challenging for us to resolve our banking crisis.As I have mentioned here before, although there have been major changes in the structures and directorships of AIB, in Anglo Irish Bank most of the same people are still there and there has not been major reform.  The Minister will probably know more about this, but Anglo Irish Bank is still issuing loans to some of the people who have received major loans in the past.  This sends out a bad signal.  There has been major scrutiny of Anglo Irish Bank and there shortly will be a report recommending more capital input from Government to keep it going, but it is still approving loans for people who may not be held in the highest regard.  The same people are still there running the business.  The Government did act but the banks themselves have not so far taken any action.  Except in AIB, the same personnel are still mostly in place.NAMA will have major difficulties with many of the assets that are spread around the world, including trophy assets in places such as New York.  I know of people who are involved in property in New York who could not compete with Irish investors because they could get money so easily.The Minister no doubt has been approached by incoming tour operators, especially those involved in golf.  This Finance Bill will introduce the tour operators margins scheme, TOMS, which is VAT on tour operators' profit margins, with an implementation date of 1 January 2010.  I understand the details have not been finalised by the Revenue Commissioners, but this will put the operators at a major disadvantage.  Most incoming tour operators already have business on their books for 2010, and they will be forced to carry the VAT charges themselves.  More importantly, Ireland will be offering prices for 2010 that are at least 2% higher than those for 2009.  This is at a time when suppliers in Ireland and every other destination are maintaining or reducing prices.  At a minimum, there should be a derogation and the implementation date could be pushed back until at least January 2012.  I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to this on Committee Stage.The tour operators margins scheme will add between 2% and 4% to the cost of a tourist package holiday in Ireland, in addition to other increases such as airport charges, and will make Ireland a less attractive destination.  Tourism faces major challenges across the world and every country is responding in various ways but we seem to be heading the wrong way, making our tourism product less competitive.  Golf attracts many high spending tourists to County Kerry.  Golf clubs are reducing green fees in Waterville, the Barrow in Tralee and even in Ballybunion.  This charge, however, will lead to an increase in prices, making us less competitive.  Perhaps the Minister will introduce an amendment on Committee Stage that will postpone it for two years.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	527	I thank Deputies for their many considered and useful contributions to the debate on the Finance Bill 2009.  I look forward to a constructive and informed discussion on Committee Stage.  I will respond as far as possible in the time available to me to the points raised by Deputies.  I note, in particular, the points made by Deputy Deenihan.Before moving on to address some of the points made specifically about the Bill, I would like to reply on some of the more general issues raised, particularly by Deputies Bruton and Burton, on the management of the public finances and the banking system.The supplementary budget struck the appropriate balance between the need to restore order to the public finances and protecting the economy.  It was suggested here yesterday that too much of the adjustment had taken place on the taxation side of the account and not enough on the expenditure side.  It is important to see the full picture.  In making adjustments to the fiscal position for 2009, the supplementary budget was the final step in the process that began last July.  In July 2008 expenditure savings of €1 billion were delivered for 2009.  The savings made focused on reducing the payroll bill, introducing a range of efficiency measures across Departments and agencies and reducing expenditure on consultancy, advertising and PR.  In addition, there was a re-prioritisation of capital projects.  In October 2008 the budget strictly contained planned expenditure for 2009.  Most areas of expenditure saw reductions, with the health, education and welfare budgets being the main areas where the amount of spending was allowed to increase, reflecting demographic and labour market pressures.  The October budget also introduced revenue raising measures of almost €2 billion, a significant element of which was the introduction of an income levy.  These adjustments were followed in February with expenditure savings of almost €1.8 billion in 2009.  The most significant measure in this package was the introduction of the public sector pension levy which will have the effect of reducing the public service pay bill.  The final step taken for 2009 was the April supplementary budget.  This delivered improvements to the Government finances of €3.3 billion in 2009.  Approximately €1.5 billion of this improvement is due to expenditure adjustments, with €1.8 billion in additional taxation being raised.When the adjustments are viewed in their totality, it is clear that more of the impact has fallen on the expenditure side.  This is an appropriate and a more sustainable approach in the long term to improving the public finances.  The cumulative effect of the budgetary measures has been to rein in the deficit from a probable 15% of GDP to 10.75%.  No other country in the eurozone has made such an adjustment.It is important to also point out that the supplementary budget marked a new departure for budget formulation in Ireland.  For the first time, detailed multi-annual plans were contained in the budgetary projections.  Targets have been set for adjustments to taxation and expenditure in 2010 and 2011 and, while the detailed specifics of the measures are still being formulated, the overall policy areas for examination in this context have been announced.  This multi-annual consolidation plan will ensure we restore the public finances to a sure footing by bringing the general government balance to -3% of GDP by the end of 2013.  In this regard, the Commission on Taxation and the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes, both due to complete their deliberations this summer, will have an important role to play in identifying measures that will improve the budgetary situation in the coming years.Deputy Bruton expressed concerns about our budgeting model.  There have been significant reforms in recent years to the entire system of allocating and accounting for resources.  Annual output statements were introduced in 2007 to provide details on public service performance.  These statements are considered alongside the corresponding Estimates allocations.  Dáil select committees now have an unprecedented opportunity to assess performance and budgets in their totality.  In last year's review of the public service the OECD was complimentary about the annual output statements and noted that Ireland was on "a sound trajectory of modernisation" in this regard.  It also made a number of recommendations for improvement which have been acted upon.The Government's commitment to budgetary reform has put the tools of accountability at the disposal of elected representatives.  It is contradictory, on the one hand, to pretend that these tools are not available while, on the other, using them in a facile manner to complain that performance targets are not being met.  Transparency, value for money and accountability have been the hallmarks of the Government's approach to budgetary and Estimates reform up to now.Deputy Sherlock asked about the recent budgets and their effect on economic buoyancy.  Measures have been implemented which will support economic growth.  For instance, the introduction of the pensions levy in the public sector earlier this year will lower the cost of running the public sector and send a positive demonstration effect in terms of private sector wages.  In addition, the Government is helping to support employment and enterprise by redirecting the national development plan, as well as implementing a number of activation initiatives to further encourage individuals into employment.At a more macro-level, maintaining the public finances on a sustainable path is a prerequisite for economic growth.  In this regard, the various expenditure reducing and tax raising measures introduced since October will have a beneficial impact by restoring confidence, as well as improving our competitiveness.  Further measures will be introduced in 2010 and 2011.  Notwithstanding these increases in taxation, I reiterate that our tax system remains competitive and pro-enterprise.Several Deputies, including Deputies Bruton, Burton and O'Donnell, raised concerns about the banking sector.  While the range of measures introduced have gone a long way towards ensuring the stability of the sector, it is clear that Ireland, like many developed countries around the world, will need further measured and appropriate action.  That is why the Government acted to address the asset position of the banking system by establishing the National Asset Management Agency.  The aim behind the establishment of NAMA is to reduce uncertainty and the lack of transparency surrounding the level of bad debts and, consequently, to ensure the flow of credit on a commercial basis to individuals and businesses in the real economy.  I subscribe to the view expressed by Professor Honohan that the need in banking reform is not just to capitalise the institutions but to ensure the deterioration in asset quality is addressed through asset purchase.  The NAMA proposal will provide the certainty that the market needs and recognise the reality of the reductions in property values.  The model proposed is broadly consistent with measures taken in other countries, including Germany, Britain and the United States, to address concerns over certain assets on the balance sheets of banks which restrain them from lending to the real economy.Of course, the State will not take all the risk.  The banks will have to take an appropriate write-down in value of loans transferred to NAMA, taking account of NAMA's objective, which is to operate commercially and optimise the return on such loans over time.  The amount to be paid by NAMA, therefore, will be significantly less than the €80 billion to €90 billion figure to reflect the loss in value of the underlying collateral.  The price will take account of current and expected market value of the relevant assets and what is sustainable for the taxpayer.  In the longer term, if NAMA fails to recoup all of the costs, the Government intends to apply a levy to make good any shortfall incurred.  While the initial write-down of loans may have an effect on the banks' capital, there also will be a reduction in risk weighted assets as a result of the transfer of the loans to NAMA.  The setting up of NAMA and transferring the more difficult asset portfolio to it will leave the banks in a stronger position to lend to the real economy and make profits which will facilitate increases in their capital bases over time.The Government has received expert financial, economic, legal and valuation advice at every step of its structured response to the banking crisis.  The agency will be developed and implemented in close co-operation with the European Commission to obtain prior state aid approval.  The Government is committed to ensuring this very significant initiative will be an example of best practice and meet all the objectives we have set for it.Moving on to measures contained in the Bill, in respect of the income levy, I must take issue with Deputy O'Donnell's comment yesterday that the introduction of the composite rate was some form of mistake.  That is not the case.  It was necessary to devise a composite rate for the year as a whole.  The composite rate is essentially an anti-avoidance measure which prevents individuals who can control their income from front-loading their yearly income to avoid a higher liability to charge.  It was essential in the interests of equity and absolutely the correct course of action to take.  For the vast majority of PAYE workers whose income is evenly distributed the composite rate will have no impact.  However, it will apply directly to those subject to self-assessment and those PAYE workers who make a return to Revenue.  PAYE workers who received bonus payments before 1 May will be liable to the composite rate on their bonus payments on a full year assessment, for example, at a figure of 1.67% rather than 1%.  However, given the unique nature of redundancy payments, I have decided to ensure in the Bill that any taxable element of redundancy payments made before 1 May will only be subject to the income levy rates in force at the time.Deputies Bruton, Burton and O'Donnell expressed concern about the marginal tax rate taking account of income tax rates, PRSI and the levies.  Deputy Bruton asserted that the marginal tax rate was 51% for the average worker.  Taking the average industrial wage as being approximately €34,000, the marginal tax rate for the average worker is now 30%.  However, what taxpayers are interested in is the actual amount they will pay as a percentage of their wages.  The average worker on €34,000, in fact, has an effective tax rate of just 18.5%.  Deputy Burton mentioned that the average tax rate for a single income earner on €80,000 was 36%.  She asserted that these were early 1990s levels of taxation.  The point was well made in response by Deputy Michael McGrath earlier today who pointed out that annexe A of the budget book showed clearly that average tax rates had fallen since 1997 for all taxpayers.  An average tax rate of 36% for single individuals earning €80,000 represents a return to 2004 levels rather than early 1990s levels as Deputy Burton suggested.

It is never easy to raise taxes but when it is necessary to do so, it is important that those who can pay pay the most, while the vulnerable in society are protected as far as possible.Deputies Burton and O'Donnell referred to the changes to mortgage interest relief.  As the Deputies may remember, I indicated in my Budget Statement in October last year that mortgage interest relief was not set in stone and was very much tailored to market conditions.  The European Central Bank has since reduced its lending rates significantly.  This reduction by 2.75 percentage points has resulted in considerable savings for the majority of mortgage holders.  The reality is that with mortgage interest relief being available for non-first time buyers at 15% of the qualifying interest payable, the interest rate reduction is worth far more to mortgage holders than mortgage interest relief.  For example, monthly repayments on a typical tracker mortgage with a margin of 1.75% over the ECB rate to the value of €300,000 taken out in 2002 over 30 years have fallen by approximately €390 since October 2008.  The limiting of mortgage interest relief will, at most, reduce the value of mortgage interest relief to the affected mortgage holders by €38 per month, if single, or €75 per month, if married or widowed.  I appreciate that fixed rate mortgage holders do not benefit from the reduction in interest rates, an issue raised by a number of Deputies.  However, I understand that over 60% of fixed rate mortgages are fixed for between one and three years and this cohort should be able to avail of the current low interest rates once the fixed period has expired.I want to clarify for Deputy Burton the Government's position on child benefit.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, explained, it is not right that better-off individuals can avail of the same child benefit payments as the less well-off.  In times of scarce resources we need to target the resources available at those most in need.  The Commission on Taxation is examining options in relation to the tax treatment of child benefit.  I will be informed by its proposals on the matter.  My Department, together with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners, is also examining the issues surrounding means-testing or taxing child benefit.Deputy Bruton queried the end-2013 termination date for capital expenditure on qualifying private hospitals to qualify for capital allowances. The extended date will only apply where certain criteria relating to a valid application for full planning permission have been met.  The Deputy will understand that I must make reasonable transitional arrangements for hospital projects which are in the pipeline and which, due to the complexity of the various strands of work involved in such projects, from design through planning, construction and fit-out, will take a considerable period of time to complete.  The end-2013 deadline for hospital projects is not unreasonable in the circumstances.Deputy Burton asked whether I proposed to introduce a restriction in the Finance Bill on the ability of property developers to claim loss relief.  Sections 6 and 11 of the Bill, apart from abolishing the concessionary 20% tax rate on income and trading profits from dealing in residential development land, also introduce restrictions on the use of losses incurred in this activity.  I have no proposals for further restrictions on loss relief in this general area at this time but will be keeping the matter under active review.Deputy Burton also raised the issue of restricting the ability of the institutions covered by the bank guarantee scheme to avail of loss relief arrangements under the tax code, given the level of State support for the banking sector.  I am conscious of the Deputy's concerns in this matter and while I do not propose to include a provision in this legislation, I will be examining the issues raised by the Deputy in this regard.I appreciate the support expressed by Deputies Chris Andrews and Bannon for the reduction in interest charged by the Revenue Commissioners for late payments and underpayments of tax.  Likewise, I welcome the comments of Deputies Michael Kitt and Breen on the provision for intellectual property relief and our efforts to develop the smart economy.Turning to some of the other points raised by Deputies, Deputy Burton stated that no action had been taken against what were known as tax exiles.  In my previous Finance Bill I made it more difficult for people who are effectively based in Ireland to become non-resident for tax purposes by abolishing the Cinderella rule which provided that an individual would not be treated as being present in the State on a day unless he or she was present at midnight on that day.  As Members are aware, the report from the Commission on Taxation is due to be completed in July.  Given the imminence of that report and because the changes I introduced have only been in place since 1 January, I do not intend to make further changes in this area at this time.Deputies Bruton, Burton and O'Donnell questioned the increase in the standard VAT rate in budget 2009.  As I have previously stated, it appears that the timing of Ireland's VAT increase in budget 2009, given the subsequent temporary reduction in the UK rate, may have sent the wrong signal to consumers.  However, given the current Exchequer deficit position, the decision to increase the standard VAT rate continues to be necessary to support the public finances.  We are borrowing to fund day-to-day public services, which is unsustainable as future generations will be required to pay higher taxes unless we correct the public finances.  It is an inevitable feature that where there are two jurisdictions, with two currencies and two tax regimes, there will be distortions at different times in the marketplace. The balance in trade has switched at various times to different sides of the Border, giving rise to swings and roundabouts for both sides in terms of who benefits or loses in the local economies.  The increase in cross-Border trade in recent months was to be expected, given the size of recent exchange rate movements.  Although the United Kingdom cut its standard rate of VAT to 15% on a temporary basis from 1 December 2008 to the end of 2009, at the same time it increased excise duty on alcohol, cigarettes, petrol and diesel in order to offset the 2.5% reduction in VAT on these items.  For Ireland to reduce the standard VAT rate to the UK level of 15% would mean a reduction in the standard VAT rate of 6.5 percentage points and cost in the order of €2.5 billion in one year.The VAT rate is only one factor in the price differential between North and South.  The report on the implications of cross-Border shopping for the Exchequer prepared by Revenue and the CSO at my request and published on my Department's website noted that the main causes of price differentials between goods in Northern Ireland and the Republic were operating costs, profit mark-up, taxes and the rapid depreciation of sterling against the euro of about 30% between January and December 2008.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20513	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	534	I welcome the opportunity to debate this issue.  It is unfortunate that on a matter of such enormous importance as the establishment of an asset management agency which will manage €90 billion of taxpayers' money, the Government has sponsored no debate.  It has required the Labour Party to table a motion in the House to have any sensible debate on these issues.  That is unfortunate because this is an extraordinary decision by Government to establish a national asset management agency on the basis of the thinnest and flimsiest assessment of its merits.Fine Gael has a very different view from the Government's approach.  We believe now is the time to establish a new, State-run national recovery bank whose task would be to fund investment for job creation and activity in the Irish economy.  It would be based on providing liquidity to good lending in our economy to bring money straight into the vein of small business and get good lending going again.Nothing like sufficient thought has been put into the Government's proposal of an asset management agency.  At a time of serious uncertainty when governments across the world are groping cautiously to find solutions, it is not the time for a small country with a deep problem in its public finances to attempt to plunge into a project on a scale never before attempted in any other country.  That is the reality.  The French Government undertook a similar, although much smaller, attempt of this nature in 1995 and it ended in tears with taxpayers losing very significant amounts of money, €18 billion, on a much smaller operation.Serious concerns have been raised, not just by spokespersons in this House who might be regarded as Opposition, but by people who are entirely independent in their assessment of NAMA.  None of these has been answered.  We have the difficulty of pricing the loans, of which the Government seems to be aware, and the risk that taxpayers will be left shouldering the losses.  We have the risk of unending court battles with developers and others who seek to challenge the agency's approach to dealing with impaired loans.  We have the moral hazard of bailing out professional investors who put their money into the banks.  They were grown up, knew what they were doing and invested in this banking bubble.  We are saying the taxpayer should shoulder that, which is the logical implication of what NAMA will do.We are establishing an agency that will manage a book value of €90 billion in development land.  This is on Napoleonic scale.  We have not seen the management approach that can deal with this.  All the records of evidence in other countries show that the management of this proves to be highly unworkable and that it proves to be unable to recover money on the scale of other approaches that would be preferable.  NAMA opens up the possibility of the politicisation of the write-off of loans and the management of these issues.These are very serious hazards and none of them has been addressed.  No evaluation of this proposal has been published, other than a flimsy document by an economist whose credentials are clearly open to question and who came from the stable of development.  While one can assess his paper on its merits, we need an independent stress test.  We are talking about stress testing the loan books in banks.  Surely we should stress test the Government's proposal to take €90 billion of impaired loans onto the shoulders of the taxpayer.  Where is the stress testing of it?  Instead we hear the Government is rushing headlong with this proposal.  Without a single endorsement from this House on the proposal it has already appointed an acting chief executive, is about to appoint a board, is plunging ahead with the legislation and refuses point blank to use powers available to Government to discuss the heads of the Bill in this House so those who represent taxpayers can have some say about what taxpayers are being asked to shoulder.  The Government will not agree to any of that.I can well understand why some people, and the Labour Party is doing it tonight, favour nationalisation over this extraordinary animal the Government is creating.  However, we must tread carefully with regard to nationalisation.  Although it would not require an immediate investment of cash by Government it involves many of the difficulties thrown up by the Government's approach.  If we decide the taxpayer is going to nationalise the institutions the taxpayer is then forced to shoulder all the potential losses.  This system risks the taxpayer having to pay too much for the shares and creates a situation in which professional investors are bailed out by the taxpayer.  Once again,  lending decisions are politicised.  There are significant problems with the operation of nationalised banks and therefore nationalisation should not be seen as a panacea.  It resembles the Government's proposal in that it is one major throw of the dice to which the Government would commit us without our having adequate sight of the territory that lies ahead.Fine Gael proposes a different approach, one that is much more gradual in its action on this problem.  The first action is to establish a national recovery bank that would provide liquidity to the banking sector.  This can be done under the asset-covered security legislation which is well established.  The vehicle is there and it could be done within weeks, using taxpayers' money, perhaps €2 billion.  On the back of that sum we could leverage as much as €40 billion in credit activity, whether purchased from the banks or as a new loan.The advantages of this approach are several.  It gets credit flowing straightaway and allows the banks to strengthen their balance sheet by swapping part of their loan book for cash.  It creates a solid spine for long-term banking in this country so that there is a strong wholesale bank underpinning present and future banking here.  It allows the existing relationship between businesses and their banks to continue because that is still the vehicle for selling loans.  It leaves the toxic property loans in the hands of the private banks that created them and which have better incentives and skills to manage them than we have.  Vitally, it leaves it to the banks to refocus on structuring their operations, working out the losses, not expecting the taxpayer to step into the breach as the first to take and shoulder them.  It allows those who were involved to carry the risks and costs and share the burden.  It does not claim that the taxpayers should be first up to take that burden.  Of course, the problem of unwinding those impaired loans remains but it will be unwound with responsibility for the problem lying in the first instance on those who created it.  It will not find the taxpayer stepping in as the first lender.This approach also allows us the time to look at what other countries are doing.  I believe other countries will see in their wisdom that the taxpayer cannot save everyone and cannot be asked to rescue the professional investors who knew what they were doing when they entered into their lending commitments to banks.  These were not innocent depositors with small amounts of money that would otherwise have been in their mattresses but were grown up investors who knew what they were doing.  I do not believe the taxpayer should have to step up to the plate to bail them out, which is what both nationalisation and the NAMA approach would involve.In this very difficult circumstance we face, with our public finances in serious difficulty, the taxpayer cannot simply shoulder the burden of dealing with those professional investors, allowing them to recover their money at 100%.  We must look at other and better ways to resolve this problem.  The virtue of the Fine Gael approach is that it allows time to do the negotiation and find ways of making those others who were professional investors share their load in the losses.  That is vitally important.It is notable that France, which got its fingers burnt in a NAMA-type approach in 1995, is now adopting an approach very similar to the one we are advocating the Government should consider.  It is a type of asset management agency that does not purchase toxic loans but instead buys the good loans.  It provides the flow of credit into the banking system that can fuel the small business lending and mortgage lending the country needs but under rules that are decided by the State.  With that approach we would no longer have 100% mortgages or bad decisions in putting together loans.  Such a wholesale bank would be in a position to dictate the terms on which banks would operate.I do not wish to overrun.

Very many mistruths have been put about that have increased that fear.  There is, for example, the mistruth that there has been no consideration or analysis behind our proposal.  Detailed and lengthy analysis has gone into it, not only in the Department of Finance and within the political system but the approach was supported and suggested by the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the National Treasury Management Agency.  The latter has real everyday knowledge of what it is like to be out in the bond markets trying to raise money amid what is happening in the international markets concerning Ireland's reputation.I have had lengthy meetings with individuals in these bodies and elsewhere, teasing through the consequences and details of how this approach would work and what are its downsides and difficulties.  These exist because the process is not without risk.  However, to portray it as being created without analysis is doing a disservice to the people because it is creating and stoking fear.  This will not help but will hinder us in getting out of the difficulty we have.  We need to move beyond the politics of stirring up and creating fear——

The UK is not adopting the gradual approach proposed by Fine Gael in the belief that over time and slowly this business will wash itself out.  The United States Administration does not believe such an approach is the right one.  All the best banking and economic advice declares that we cannot ignore the situation, put our head in the sand and hope it will go away.  It is better to address it and the first principle of this approach is to recognise the losses that are real.We created a property bubble in this country that has done real damage.  No political party can stand up in this House and say it did not see this happening or that it did not have a role in keeping it going.  In 2005-06 when the property bubble was losing the run of itself parties on every side of this House were calling for cuts in stamp duty, keeping the rise in prices going because we thought it was a measure of success.  It was a trap that we got ourselves into and now we must get ourselves out of it, honestly, collectively, collaboratively and with consensus.  That is what the head of the European Central Bank said.  That is what worked in Sweden before when that country followed the very same process.I recognise there are different approaches and one might argue for various different ways.  I find it difficult to see how the Fine Gael approach would work because I believe that in that fundamental deferral of recognising losses we would see a continuation of the present situation, namely, a shutdown on lending and investment, in development and construction and in key areas of our economy.  That would only continue to do damage and would not get us out of the problem.  It would keep it going and make it worse.As I understand it, and it is hard to understand the exact details, it is possible to create a supposedly good bank and declare that it will provide liquidity.  However, with the Fine Gael proposal, what would happen to the major serious Irish clearing banks is that at some point they would have to recognise the losses that exist.  I presume then they would have to default with regard to their position.  What would happen to those banks then?  These loans do not disappear.  The property bubble existed and will not merely deflate in its own controlled manner.  We must recognise this and get over it by managing the various assets.  In that way, by doing it quickly rather than gradually, as Deputy Bruton suggests, I believe we will turn the economy round, start recovery and begin to get people back to work.The Labour Party's proposal for the nationalising of banks is very different, as the Fine Gael spokesperson noted.  There are real risks in adopting such a clearly considered approach.  However, the fundamental problem is that the property bubble was funded by international finance.  Our banks got short-term money from Germany and elsewhere.  In banking terms they were making a fundamental mistake.  They were borrowing short to lend long, and now they have a real difficulty n covering that position.However, we continue to need international funding in Ireland.  It is difficult to be scientific on this and to be precise, but the analysis from expert advice, the NTMA  and elsewhere, is that if we nationalise all our banks, as has not been done in any other liberal democracy at the present time, we would have real difficulty in raising funds to keep our banking system going.The liquidity issue has been the most difficult problem, and it has been difficult in Government——

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	542	It is an assumption, but in Government one is called to make judgments on such assumptions.  It is not easy but one has to take the expert advice one gets into account.  It is hard in many instances for the public.  People are complaining that they had been assured the liquidity position was fine, when it was not.  One has to be careful and must present a certain picture to actually help the country get through these difficulties.  It is not in our interest to talk ourselves down and see money running out of the country, which makes the problem only worse.  We have acknowledged the problem and the scale of the difficulties we face, but we should not let it run away from us.  I have a real fear that in nationalising the banks we would create a situation whereby all our faith would be in the Department of Finance in Merrion Street.  As good as the Department of Finance is, I do not believe the people in it have the skills and ability to run six banks.I agree with Deputy Bruton.  The NAMA allows us to do what he is suggesting regarding the use of some of the resources within the existing banks, as we manage them back to recovery by taking out the bad assets, to raise funds internationally and manage the credit.  They can do much of the work, co-ordinated by the NAMA, in terms of the management of these assets.  We are not getting rid of tens of thousands of bank officials.  That is not in our interest.  We need to keep the good people that are in the baking system working — and we can do that under the NAMA proposal.  Collapsing everything into the Department of Finance and expecting it to have the ability to do it, is not on, and I do not have faith that such an approach would work.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	552	I believe the State can take a shareholding in the banks, as has been done in the UK, but under that method, rather than under nationalisation, market scrutiny is kept on what is happening and a stock market price is kept going which gives an index on the progress being made in terms of getting the banks back working and, crucially, the taxpayer has a chance to sell back the shares and get a return for the investment.  That is one of the reasons why I believe the NAMA  approach rather than the nationalisation one is the right way forward.I will not denigrate the approaches, or dispute the right of Deputies to propose alternatives, but let us not scare people to death by lines to the effect that the NAMA is a bailout for the banks or developers.  It is not that but rather an attempt to address a fundamental problem.  I believe we can do it.  We can get recovery into the economy by following this approach.  It is right to do it quickly rather than the Fine Gael approach of doing it gradually.  It is right to use and follow the advice of the NTMA, the European Commission, the European Central Bank and just about every other country.  The US and UK Administrations are following similar approaches.  This is not without precedent.  Other countries have done it successfully and I believe we can do it if we work collectively and cleverly.  That can happen within the National Asset Management Agency.
#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	553	Nothing could be more important than the stabilisation of the banks.  This is so vital for our economy, our retail and business world and we have got to get it right.  We have an opportunity now to do just that.I believe that the approach the Government is taking to treat the significant level of toxic debt in the banks is more sensible than nationalisation, as proposed in the Labour Party motion.  The NAMA will have effective control of the banks in terms of the tidying up of the bad debt and in that regard what is being proposed serves the same purpose as nationalisation.  The safeguards proposed for the legislation will ensure that the banks will have to comply with the NAMA in terms of what the agency will be doing.The NTMA has a proven track record and much experience in dealing with debt and I believe can be trusted, if the preparatory work is done well.  The Labour Party says that part of the case for nationalising the banks is the danger of the State having to value bad loans, but the agency which will act on behalf of the State will have the competence to do this.  By allowing the NAMA to take over the land and development books of the main banks, the management of these debts will be undertaken in a controlled environment, which will ultimately allow the banks to attain a sound footing quicker than by internal management of the debt through State ownership.  Furthermore, I am confident the safeguards the Government has put in place in relation to banking measures over the last nine months ensure that the taxpayer gets best value for money from these stabilisation measures.With the NAMA in the picture, market value will be brought to bear on the value of the toxic loans as well as the provision for a levy to be imposed should the agency incur losses on the debt.  With the State guarantee a fee income of approximately €1 billion will be generated, and with the recapitalisation there is the annual dividend of approximately 8% return on the preference shares, with a return of 125% of par value if preference shares are not redeemed within five years.It is important at such a sensitive time to say that no blank cheque has been written for the banks, no touchy-feely deals have been going on and no-one is playing footsie under the table to give the banks more leeway.  In no way can the banks skip the light fandango out of town.  There are real measures here to improve the economy.Two related issues concerning the stabilisation of the banks should be noted.  The significant amount of development land at issue regarding the NAMA will have to be considered as planning policy is developed in the coming years.  We are talking about major tracts of land.  Central and local government will have to ensure rezoning and other planning matters take account of the scale of land now available, and learn lessons from the irresponsible policies which encouraged the overvalued purchasing of it.  I am confident that the Green Party reform of planning and local government will address some of these measures.  We never took the developers' cheques or donations, so our hands are clean on this.The stabilisation of banks must come in tandem with the release of urgent credit to struggling small and medium-sized enterprises across the country.  That is why we are doing it, to get the money flowing and put the economy on the right track.  Debt evaluation must be decoupled from personal debt, mortgages and businesses.  The latter must be given the bridging loans, overdraft facilities and capital they need to survive.  This is the crux of the matter.  Businesses are hurting in the market place.  The sooner the NAMA becomes operational and banks can lend to businesses, the sooner those longed for green shoots for economic recovery will begin to sprout.
#BeverleyCooperFlynn	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-party	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-dob	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	554	I, too, welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion and I agree with much of what the Minister, Deputy Ryan, has stated.The reality is that the banking system in Ireland today is frozen.  No business is being done.  Companies are going out of business every day, time is of the essence and unfortunately we cannot afford to wait.  I note Deputy Bruton's point that the Government should take care and not rush.  The reality, however, is that many businesses have been experiencing an enormous starvation of credit for more than six months and cannot, unfortunately, afford to wait any longer.Nationalising the banks will not solve our problems, and neither will limited recapitalisation.  We have already nationalised Anglo Irish Bank and that has not changed anything as regards the capital or the funding requirements within that bank.  One result of that nationalisation is that the State will be taking full responsibility for the funding requirements of Anglo Irish Bank for the future.  The Government has stated that in terms of recapitalisation it may well be that the €7.5 billion promised is not sufficient.  It has also stated that if further moneys are required then we will be taking equity stakes in the various banks, which may well result in a majority shareholding for the State in these banks.There is plenty of international evidence to the effect that nationalising banks has proven to be very poorly regarded.  International evidence shows that government owned banking systems serve their economies very poorly, resulting in higher interest rates and less private credit, with what credit is available going to larger firms.  Even Deputy Bruton stated that state owned banks can come under political influence.  The Opposition are not united in their approach to bank nationalisation.Greater state ownership has been associated in many countries with greater crisis in financial sectors.  In Ireland, we are trying to achieve a commercially focused independent banking sector.  State ownership is the last resort and always should be viewed as such.The National Asset Management Agency is not the friend of the banks because it will require banks to crystalise their losses on their balance sheets.  Neither is it the friend of property developers.  However, NAMA can be very good news for the Irish taxpayer.  Given the effort the Government is putting into the running of the agency, over time it can be a profitable operation for the Irish taxpayer.We want to see Irish banks getting back to doing day to day business for small business people and mortgage holders.  At present, that is not happening.  We want to see better regulation in the banking sector.

#BeverleyCooperFlynn	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-party	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-dob	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	556	That regulation is currently being improved by the Government.  The key message must be protection of the taxpayer.  Since the introduction of the bank guarantee last September, protection of the taxpayer has been of paramount importance to the Government.  The fee for the guarantee will amount to €1 billion over two years.  The dividend on the preference shares will be €560 million in a full year to the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  If these preference shares have to be redeemed eventually, they will be redeemed at 125% of their value.In addition, the Government's recapitalisation proposals impose additional requirements on the banks as to how they deal with their customers.  When I spoke on Second Stage of the Finance Bill earlier today, I highlighted the importance of protecting mortgage holders.  I want to see banks making this an absolute priority.  People with one residence and one mortgage must not lose their homes.  When NAMA is operational, I expect that banks will be required to make that a priority.We must free up credit to get business moving and make sure taxpayers get a good deal and a good return on their investment.  The measures introduced by the Government can achieve this.  I ask the Opposition to support those measures.  The objectives of Government and Opposition are the same.  We are all trying to reach the same end, which is to free up money.  We may have different ideas as to how that might be best achieved, but working together in the national interest we can arrive at a proposal which will work for the Irish people.  We live in extraordinary times and terrible economic circumstances.The banking crisis has led to a reduction in our overseas development aid.  Could the banks not make up the shortfall in our overseas aid budget?  In that way the recapitalisation of the banks might become more acceptable to the Irish people.  That would be very important.

#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	558	The stark reality is that the banking system is not providing credit for small to medium sized businesses or anyone else.  Some people say we should take a long-term view and caution "steady as she goes".  However, serious decisions must be taken quickly to ensure that businesses have access to credit and we get the system moving.  If businesses do not get the credit which is so badly needed they will fail and add further to the current chaos.The banking system almost collapsed some months ago.  There was reckless lending by financial institutions, particularly in the past four to five years.  When the office of the Financial Regulator was established, power was taken from the Central Bank.  The new proposals place the Central Bank at the centre of financial supervision as well as having a regulatory body.  That is fundamental to our economic wellbeing and to our banking system.People say Irish banks never loaned money so recklessly.  They forget that this happened in the late 1970s and early 1980s, particularly among the agricultural community.  Many farmers borrowed heavily on the advice of banks when land prices were at their peak and some lost their businesses and family holdings.  Banks were giving money to neighbours to outbid each other on land and it was all based on false economy.  Huge efforts were made by the Government in the 1980s to rescue the farming community.  However, we did not establish draconian regulations to prevent the banking system from behaving in that way again.  As public representatives, we must now introduce draconian regulation to ensure that what happened in the recent and more distant past will not happen again.  It behoves us to ensure such regulation is put in place.I now turn to the National Asset Management Agency and the difference of opinion as to how best to approach the current banking difficulty.  Banks are not lending and businesses are going to the wall because of lack of finance.  We must do something immediately and face up to these serious and real difficulties.  The structure of the National Asset Management Agency is well thought out.  The National Treasury Management Agency, which has done excellent work in managing the country's finances since it was established 20 years ago, has the necessary expertise.  The system can work, despite experts on all sides saying otherwise.We do not have time to wait.  We must get the financial institutions working again.  It is a cheap political shot to speak about bailing out banks.  That is not what the Government is doing.  It is bailing out small businesses, mortgage holders and ordinary punters, who are in serious difficulty and looking for credit, and thereby bailing out the entire economy.The banking system has been ridiculed.  A person who came to tell me about the difficulty he was having with his bank remarked that banks are your friend until you need them.  Many people now need a friend in a financial institution but cannot find one.  It is time we got the real economy working and credit flowing.  I commend the Government's amendment to the House.

While Deputy Gilmore's assertion, based on an article in The Irish Times, that this is the most important debate in the history of the State is a gross exaggeration, this is one of the most important issues faced in the history of the State.  Describing the National Asset Management Agency as a builder or banker bailout does a disservice to the country and to the future of the economy.  It might elect a few more councillors or even MEPs but it will do no more than that.A couple of weeks ago, the Labour Party said it had received legal advice that the agency could not be operated without legislation.  According to the Sunday newspapers the builders are getting together to sue the Government and to put down NAMA in the same way as the Opposition.  The builders and the Opposition seem to be on the same side in this case.

#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	576	We are in a serious situation.  We have taken the lead in several areas.  The State bank guarantee certainly saved the banking system.  The recapitalisation is necessary but we should remind people that it is a loan which must be repaid at a relatively high rate of interest.  That point is always forgotten and ignored.  It is almost as if one's Christmas bonus is paying for the bank recapitalisation although nothing could be further from the truth.  I urge everyone in the House to consider this point because we all have the same objective.  Our motives are questioned but we have the same objective of ensuring that the banks are able to perform and work and that the economy gets back on its feet.  There are some signs of hope and of a slowdown in the slowdown.  We would be very pleased if this were the start of a turnaround.  That is what gives confidence and confidence has been crucially absent.I agree with Deputy Beverly Flynn on the issue of mortgages.  I have done a good deal of work in that area.  Issues such as negative equity result in a substantial sap on people's confidence but solutions exist.  Apparently some of the covered institutions are seeking a slightly higher variable rate.  If this is the case then why not cut off a certain lump of the mortgage?  Some people who are working and in a position to pay might rather pay a slightly higher rate of interest if they thought their negative equity was being addressed and if there were forgiveness of some of the loan.  That is one possible solution to the matter of negative equity.  The issue of negative equity must be examined also in cases where people must move house.  Let us consider the case of a family in a one bedroom dwelling which cannot move but with a child or children on the way since property values declined.  Such people should perhaps be able to take a negative equity mortgage to move to a larger property.Perhaps Deputy Bruton's solutions are more properly thought out than what has been offered by the Labour Party, as one might expect.  However the debate serves to remind the people that two weeks ago there was a debate on Fine Gael's main job creation plan which was to have been the answer to all our prayers.  Nevertheless, the Labour Party did not vote for it in the Dáil.  Tonight the Labour Party has proposed what it has described as the most historic debate in the history of the Chamber, which is an exaggeration.  It proposes nationalising the banks but Fine Gael does not agree.  The people will ask who has the coherent solutions, who is providing real answers and who is upping the ante politically.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	581	I propose to share the 30 minutes allocated with Deputies Jan O'Sullivan, Joe Costello, Joanna Tuffy and Kathleen Lynch.  The Labour Party motion is not about ideology but methodology.  The Labour Party does not wish to own the banks, we wish to fix them.  The banks cannot fix themselves, as we have seen in the past nine months.  We saw what took place today at the Allied Irish Banks annual general meeting.  Bankers have been in constant denial.  Anyone who knows banks, and there is one such Deputy in the House, realises that the people who have caused the problems cannot fix them any more than the rest of us could do so in such circumstances.Initially, the concept of NAMA had some attractions.  I supported it because we must get the toxic debt out of the way and return to normal banking operations.  However, upon examination of the small detail, it seems the difficulty is that NAMA is supposed to take the book value of toxic debt, which is of the order of €90 billion, off the books of the banks such that the credit of the banks can be restored in the international markets, which is critical.  What discount will NAMA give on the real value of the assets and how does one measure the real value?  All the property expertise is in the banks.  Developers, with whom I have worked in the past, are not ordinary domestic borrowers with a mortgage, a car loan, an extension loan and so on.  They are involved in highly leveraged, sophisticated, back-to-back arrangements with interest deals rolled up and piled up which are utterly different from the loans people usually arrange.  The expertise to deal with these arrangements is not in the National Treasury Management Agency.  The Minister who spoke on behalf of the Green Party referred to the NTMA's experience in managing debt.  It has no experience in managing this type of debt.  That is a misnomer and it is misleading.We know that if one were to transfer the debts and loans of a given developer, irrespective of who that developer is, from a bank to a new agency and if that agency informed the developer what is owed to it, the matter would go to the courts.  In some cases the money owed by the developer may have been sourced in three or four different banks.  We know from the tribunal involving Mr. Goodman and others that there will be five years of litigation in the courts because most developers will simply ask their legal advisers to buy time.

I know a little about this territory but none of us knows enough.  That is why we must work together.  We are not about ideology, but about trying to fix the system.  We wish to return the banks to private ownership in due course.  The Labour Party has made this proposal elsewhere and I will speak on the matter very briefly.The country's international reputation has been shattered on all sides by the antics of our bankers.  We are the most exposed and open trading economy and community affected.  We must restore that and a banking commission headed up by an Irish person of international reputation such as Mr. Niall Fitzgerald or Mr. Peter Sutherland should be established.  Alongside such a person we must hire a former German, French or American central banker to give reassurance to the international markets.  We must put credibility back into the system.  We must sack the entire board of the Central Bank.  Henceforth, the post of the Governor of the Central Bank must no longer be the sinecure for the retiring Secretary General of the Department of Finance, but a post of international importance open to international competition.We must examine the reality.  If the Government's NAMA proposal is to remove the toxic debt, with a book value of €90 billion, such that the banks can get on with the real business of everyday banking, what discount should the agency give?  Let us suppose it is 66% or a two thirds discount.  It would then be left holding something of the order of €30 billion without the necessary expertise in the NTMA.  However, another method would be to get the banks with no legal complications for between €2 billion and €3 billion if we converted the recapitalisation moneys already given.  In that way we could get them for no more than we have already given.

One could then argue there is no legal problem because the developers who had loans with banks X, Y and Z still have the loans with those banks.  The legal relationship between the borrower and the lender would not be changed in any way and could not be challenged.  There is good property expertise in the banking system and it could evaluate the real and potential value of such loans.  It could address the questions of which loans to form and the capacity to repay.  Certain loans could then be isolated and put to one side.The problem the Labour Party has with the NAMA proposal is in the detail rather than the concept.  We all recognise there must be a transfer of the toxic debt out of the way to provide for the resumption of normal, healthy banking.  On that matter the House, including Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Labour, is agreed.How much will this cost?  The NAMA proposal is not costed.  If one paid one third of the book value of loans one would assume or would be obliged to transfer in some shape or form €30 billion.  However one could get the entire shooting gallery for between €2 billion and €3 billion.

However, we would propose a clear out of the boards of management.  They would not be run by the Department of Finance, as the Minister, Deputy Ryan, attempted to suggest, in the way that Irish Life was in its heyday as a successful commercial bank, 98% of which was State owned.  There was no interference from Merrion Street in the way that financial house operated.  We would tell the new staff and management there were flat rate salaries and no bonuses, and when they bring it back to the market in seven to ten years' time, 5% or 10% of the realised value will be their shared bonus pool.  We would turn to the shareholders and say we are sorry they lost their shirts.  Those of us who saw the "Six-one" news today saw the tragedy that has become the reality for so many of them.  We would tell those people, many of whom are elderly, they have been taken to the cleaners.  They invested for the dividend as much as for the value of the shares.  We would tell them the Government does not want to make a killing from the nationalisation and refloatation and that when the bank's value can be maximised and it is refloated, once the State and the taxpayer have realised what they put into it, the balance will stay in a pot, and 30%, 40%, 50% or whatever it is will be divvied out to the existing shareholders.  We can say to the granny or grandfather whom we saw on TV that they might not see the money but their children and grandchildren will get it.That practical, operational system would work within the existing legal framework and no legal challenge could interfere with the process.  As Deputy Flynn said, we have nationalised Anglo Irish Bank and there has been no change.  The sky has not fallen in.  It has to do its business.  The real problem is that Anglo Irish Bank was not a high street bank but predominantly a property bank and additionally a small business loan bank.  It did not deal with pubs in Kildare or businesses in County Mayo.  Essentially, it was AIB and Bank of Ireland that dealt with them, and north of the Twenty-six Counties, perhaps Ulster Bank.  They are the banks that are not lending, and businesses are suffering because those banks traditionally evened out the cycle of cashflow and all the other problems that are common to businesses.  We have to get the banks working again, and the best people to do that are the vast majority of the staff, who were not on the crazy roundabout of bonuses for property gambling.  Bank of Ireland and AIB reluctantly followed Anglo Irish down the path, Bank of Ireland most reluctantly of all, because of what happened to the share value of Anglo Irish.  Anybody in the banking industry would tell us that.The Labour Party's point is that we need a practical methodology to fix the problems soon.  The Government has been at this since last September.  Deputies know from what they hear from their families, constituents and others that the banks are not lending.  To use parliamentary language about it, they have been telling us "untruths".  We heard that from Mark Fielding on the radio today.  A bi-monthly survey showed the refusal rate for working capital of €15,000 to €20,000 for ordinary corner shops and small businesses has increased from 48% to 58%.  Two years ago, the rate was about 28%.  Mark Fielding is not a card-carrying member of the Labour Party or a rabid socialist who wants to control the commanding heights of the Irish economy.  We are quoting facts from the marketplace.NAMA will not work because we do not yet have a single iota of detail on it.  We heard that down in the Treasury Building there is a group of people who have expertise in evaluating very complex loan books.  Deputy Flynn, perhaps more than anybody in this House, knows just how complex such loan books are compared with, for example, my mortgage, my personal account and my second account.  They are from a different planet or a different world and nobody except the people in the area can evaluate them.  For that reason, the solution is to take temporary ownership of the banks, sort out the bad debts, refloat the banks, give money back to those who deserve it and the shareholders who own it, and get the country moving again.  It is not moving at present.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	588	As Deputy Quinn and other speakers from the Labour Party said, the issue is not about ideology but methodology.  However, it must be seen against a background of the failed ideology of the right, which suggested unrestrained market capitalism with light regulation was the answer to all our problems in the world and would provide money for everybody.  That ideology has clearly failed in the rest of the world, but it has particularly failed in Ireland because of the property bubble.  We debate the matter with that failed ideology in the background.  It proposed that, somehow, greed would keep the market flowing and keep money in countries such as Ireland, but is has clearly not worked.  We are described as having an ideological motivation, but the opposite is true.  It is the people who criticise our ideas who have an ideological motivation.  It is also interesting that many of the commentators who support us do not share the Labour Party's ideology.People's confidence in the banking system must be restored, but they will not be confident unless the culture of banking is changed, and I see no evidence that the NAMA model will change the culture.  There is no guarantee that, in five years' time, when the banks have got rid of the toxic loans, they will not be doing the same things again, lending to speculative developers and starving small businesses of funds.  The first thing we must do is root out the ideology that ran the banks in recent times.  We must change the culture and restore people's confidence.I, too, listened to the gentleman from ISME this morning talking about the fact that 58% of small businesses cannot get loans, which is pretty much double the percentage two years ago.  There is no evidence that the Government's proposals will change that.  For one thing, it seems unlikely that NAMA will be a speedy resolution because it will get tied up in the courts.  In the meantime, small businesses will remain starved of funds and unable to get the money they need to keep going.The public can help with the recovery only if they have confidence in the system.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions suggested that a national recovery bond as part of a social solidarity pact would be an innovative way for the Government to raise money, but people would buy into a new plan only if they felt it was fair.  If we accept the model the Labour Party proposes, we will have public scrutiny of what goes on in the banks and the transparency we need.  People will have confidence, the pension funds will have confidence, and the ordinary individual who still has money but does not want to put it in the banks will have the confidence to invest it in a national recovery bond.In the area of health, a report has suggested that all the maternity hospitals in Dublin need to be rebuilt in the grounds of acute hospitals.  Indeed, the one in my city of Limerick is in a similar situation.  That is an example of how we could provide real hope for the future, because we could use national recovery bonds to build the maternity hospitals.  There are models for that.  Ken Livingstone was on the radio this morning talking about using a bond for the transport system in London, and the people of Texas used a bond to build the Parkland Memorial Hospital there.  I raise the issue because we need to ensure that people have confidence in the system.  We only have to see the news or listen to people on the doorsteps to know they do not have confidence at present.  People are asking why the developers who made millions do not have to pay back these huge loans.  It might have been only their last bit of speculation that got caught in the toxic loans.  People are asking whether there is any way of going after them and how we know what is happening in the banks.We cannot restore confidence if we go down the route the Government is proposing.  The Labour Party's model makes sense.  Deputy Quinn explained very well how it would operate in practice.  If we take that route, the Irish people will regain their confidence in the banks, and so will the international markets.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	589	I thank Deputy Burton for tabling this Private Members' motion.  I am delighted to have an opportunity to say a few words on it.  The Government's approach to the economic crisis has a fatal flaw.  It is obsessed by the need to bail out the banks without due consideration for the real economy, which comprises investment, business and employment.  The Government has neglected those areas.  The private banking system is a major cause of the crisis and it is still mired in undefined and virtually undefinable debt.  The €450 million unconditional guarantee in September 2008 was followed by the €7 billion recapitalisation of AIB and Bank of Ireland.  The last tranche of recapitalisation of AIB took place today after a hectic, egg-throwing AGM of angry shareholders who have already pretty much lost their shirts.  AIB already has the begging bowl out for more and it is now clear that its bad debts are far greater than it had informed the Government.  The latest generous offer of taxpayers' money by the Government to the private banking system is a massive buyout of the banks' bad debts at an estimated cost of €90 billion.  We are still awaiting the legislation establishing NAMA to see the full extent of the liability on the State and the burden on this and future generations of Irish people.The effect of this eight-month long banking bailout is that the Government has lurched from crisis to crisis, committing the taxpayer to virtually unlimited financial exposure without providing any benefits to the hard-pressed business and employment sector.  The banks have one major function in the economy, namely, to lend money to citizens and to businesses.  After eight months of shoring up by the Government, the banks are not doing the one thing the country needs them to do — they have simply stopped lending.  The Government policy has failed, which it should recognise.  It is in the process of saving the banks — that goes without question — but instead of the banks then trying to save the economy, they are now holding the country and the economy to ransom.There has to be another way, which there is.  First, we must consider the situation of the business community.  The survey conducted by the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, which has been referred to by a number of speakers and which was published today, is a stark verdict on the banks' failure to engage with the Irish economy and business.  Some 83% of the 400 established businesses surveyed by ISME stated that it was now harder to access credit from Irish banks than it had been less than three months ago.  The previous survey was conducted in February and, incredibly, more than half the businesses surveyed had been more than ten years with the same bank.  They had a proven track record and were clearly not fly-by-night businesses.  This is the backbone of the Irish economy.  Some 58% of those businesses had applied for loan facilities and were refused by the banks.  This is a substantial increase of 10% over the past two to three months.Not only has the credit crunch worsened but the banks are effectively not open for business.  The credit tap to business has been turned off by the banks.  The banks' actions are even more perverse.  On 3 October, the European Union saw the difficulties that national banks would have in providing the same level of credit to businesses in the 27 member states as before.  The EU recognised that SMEs were the lifeblood of the 27 economies and, thus, it decided eight months ago to put together a fund of €30 billion through the European Investment Bank to be drawn down by the national banks of the 27 member states and distributed specifically to small and medium businesses.  This was to ensure a steady flow of credit and the banks would not have to rely exclusively on their own reserves.To date, the Irish banks have only drawn down €350 million — €50 million by the Bank of Scotland and €100 million each by AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank.  I do not believe a single penny of that money has actually been distributed.  ISME believes that none of the money that was specifically made available by the EU to allow a credit flow to small and medium enterprises is being made available by the various banks because they are not getting it on the lucrative terms they received during the boom.In conclusion, the manner in which the Government has addressed the economic crisis by bailing out the banks is wrong.  It is time for the Government to see the virtue in the Labour Party's proposals.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	590	The Government's policies of the past 12 years brought us to the economic and banking crisis of last September, which is much worse than is being experienced in other countries.  Alternative approaches were available during that 12-year period, many of which were voiced by the Labour Party.  For example, in regard to the property bubble, as far back as 1999 the Labour Party was proposing an alternative approach to the price of housing.  Deputy Eamon Gilmore, who was then our spokesperson on the environment, initiated a Labour Party housing commission which in 1999 published the report, Housing: A New Approach, containing many proposals dealing with affordable housing, land speculation, people's rights to housing and so forth.The Labour Party's voice was not the only one.  There were other alternative voices and many warnings to the Government.  It was commonly said in recent years that we needed to build 50,000 houses a year yet for some years the Government allowed for 90,000 houses, which was totally unsustainable.  The All-Party Committee on the Constitution, on which I served, recommended, for example, the implementation of the Kenny report and stated there was no legal or constitutional obstruction to the Government doing this.  However, the Government let land speculation and the housing bubble continue despite the warnings.When the Government took its decision last September, it compounded the economic crisis by guaranteeing all bank loans, including the most reckless, although there were alternatives to that decision.  The Labour Party voiced alternative points of view and media commentators and economists gave an alternative approach but all of this was ignored by the Government.  The Government decision, which was very significant, has led us to where we are now.  The taxpayers, those we represent, are now burdened with all of the debts of the banks, including the most reckless.  While we have no alternative but to deal with this situation, and the Government has proposed the setting up of NAMA, all of the control is still in the hands of the banks.Deputy Mary White said earlier that we need to do this right but the Government has got it wrong to date and is still not listening to the alternative point of view.  Perhaps it is time it began to listen to the proposals of the Labour Party and some economists.  It should not listen to those who were saying everything was fine when the property bubble was growing in an unsustainable way or those who spoke about a soft landing and equilibrium, none of which has happened.  The Government needs to take different advice and stop listening to the vested interests and the voices of the few who just want their interests protected.As proposed by the Labour Party, nationalisation at this late stage will give the State control over the banks on behalf of the stakeholders, who are the taxpayers — the people we represent.  Through the Government, they have taken on the burden of all the debts of the banks.  We have proposed a banking commission to ensure that whatever happens to the banks when they are nationalised will be done in the common interest, and that the best people will be put in place to do the job.The Government's reluctance to do this can only mean it is still in the same mindset it has been in for the past 12 years and which it was in back in September when it recklessly guaranteed all of the bad debts of the banks.  It is as if the banks know better and the Government will do what they want because it does not want to intervene in the private arena.  Deputy Beverley Flynn, a former banker, said that State ownership is a last resort but surely we are at the stage of last resort.  Deputy Michael Moynihan said the banks are not lending but surely that is an argument for the State to take control.  Deputy Flynn said the Government was protecting the taxpayer when it took the decision to guarantee all the debts back in September but that is patently not the case because guaranteeing all of the toxic debts could mean that this economy will not get out of recession for many years to come.This is part of the same Government mindset that created all of the mistakes in the budget.  The Government will not learn from what is being done in other countries and what the Labour Party is proposing in terms of stimulating the economy to get it moving again and creating and saving jobs.  Most of all, if we want to get the banks right, we need to do what the Labour Party proposes and nationalise the banks at this stage.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	591	I suppose the fact that a woman was jailed for two years today made national headlines because it was such an unusual occurrence.  What was also unusual about this case was that she got this sentence for robbing an old age pensioner.  The Minister of State probably saw this news because it happened in our county of Cork.  Most people will agree that if people carry out despicable acts on the elderly, they deserve to be punished.The amazing thing about this is that an entire roomful of elderly old age pensioners were robbed today, not by way of a car smash, but with a fountain pen in AIB headquarters, but nobody was trotted out in handcuffs or jailed as a result.  Thousands of people were robbed, elderly people who trusted what was a blue chip institution and put their money into the bank.  They did what the Government advised to provide for themselves in their old age and ensure they would have a pension.  However, they have been told one after the other that there is no money for them and their pensions are gone.  The woman in Cork got two years, but the bankers are going home, having barely escaped being hit by an egg.  Where is the justice in that?Sometimes the question is asked why people are so angry.  They are angry for many reasons.  They are angry that no one has been held to account, no one has been brought out in handcuffs and no one has been brought before the courts.  They are angry that those who robbed them did as Bob Dylan said, robbed them with a fountain pen.  None of them has been brought before the courts.  Saying sorry is not good enough.People are equally angry that the Government has the opportunity to put in place a system that will serve the people, but it is refusing to take that opportunity.  We have the opportunity to put in place an entirely new system, but we are refusing to do it.  Young and not so young couples who have traded up their houses are worried that they could lose their homes in the coming months because they cannot pay their mortgages.  These are the people who have lost their jobs.  People who have retained their jobs are worried because they are locked into fixed interest rate mortgages which they cannot afford because the Government has decided to take money from them as it can no longer afford to pay the country's debts.If we are to bail out the banks, why do we not tell them they must not take houses from people but must allow them to change to a variable mortgage without threatening to impose a colossal penalty on them?  Why do we not insist on this?  Why do we not demand of the banks what we would like for our citizens?  Why do we not insist bankers behave like human beings and treat people properly?  After all, it is the citizens who are bailing out the bankers.  Why do we not demand they treat people properly?  Why do we not encourage people to go to what is now the people's bank to look for loans?  We are not doing that because the Government, as Deputy Beverley Flynn has just said — who would know better — said that is a last resort.We have reached the last resort and we are bailing out the banks.  The people are very angry that bankers are not getting two years in jail for robbing them with a fountain pen, like the woman in Cork deservedly got today.  Why are we not demanding that people are brought to justice?

Earlier today some speakers said they had not had an opportunity to speak on the banking issue, despite the fact that we have had several debates on the broader economy and a number of Finance Bills in the context of the budget in October 2009 and the recent supplementary budget, and again now.  Some of the commentary on the issue is welcome, but some of it is just soundbite politics.When we are dealing with such a serious issue as the banking crisis, it is important to acknowledge that not every part of the difficulty is a result of the internal dynamics of this economy.  I agree we were over-reliant on the construction sector.  Everybody acknowledges that, but nobody on any side of the House would have foreseen the drastic change in circumstances in the world economy that has transpired.  I mentioned last night that before the 2007 general election all the manifestoes of the various political parties indicated growth rates of 4% for the years 2008, 2009 and beyond.  Nobody indicated in those manifestoes there would be a major downturn.  All the forecasts were that there would be buoyancy in tax receipts.  Nobody can dispute that.It is even more important to point out what transpired as a result of a confluence or combination of factors.  We had the problems of the sub-prime market and the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the United States.  This had a ripple effect across Europe.  With all due respects to Members, we cannot blame the Government's policies over the past 12 years for the financial meltdown of institutions throughout the world, as has been indicated here.  It has been suggested that all the ills of the world were caused by policies pursued by this Government over the past 12 years.

If we do not have banking systems that are capable of working, going to the wholesale markets and borrowing and lending money, our economy will stagnate further and will suffer and we will have further haemorrhaging of jobs. That is what we are about in this House.  The nationalisation of the banks is the last resort and if we can do anything to avoid that, we should.

We are not alone in having impaired assets in our banks.  The Germans have had that difficulty, as have the French and the Spanish.  NAMA is a proposal that is gaining favour not only in Ireland but outside it.The commentary on NAMA is favourable.  It is acknowledged that the Government is doing everything possible to ensure we have a stable financial banking system that can go to the wholesale markets, access credit and allow credit to flow into the broader economy and to home mortgage applicants.  I urge Members to support the Government's proposals and not use populist soundbite politics.  I understand why this happens, but in a time of crisis, we should have serious debate on the issues rather than flippant throwaway remarks such as "an bord bailout" or saying we are taxing people to give to the bankers and developers.  There are charges on the banks for capitalisation and charges on them for the guarantee.  NAMA will take the impaired assets from the banks and allow them to trade in a manner that will assist the broader economy.I note that those proposing nationalisation are standing on both sides of the fence and are relying on shareholders being reimbursed at a later stage of nationalisation.  They are trying to play all sides by proposing setting up a trust so that shareholders can come back in a few years' time.  That is the each way bet.I make this comment in the broader context of flippant political points.  Commentary in this House is picked up on international markets.  I was in London two weeks ago where it was remarked by many people there that debates here are watched ——

How can policy remain dominated by one purpose to the exclusion of all else, that is, that no bank should be allowed to fail and yet none should be properly nationalised?  That question was answered by this Government last September in its ill-advised blanket guarantee.  Unfortunately, neither Fine Gael nor Sinn Féin gave that guarantee the kind of scrutiny or objection that would perhaps have made Fianna Fáil think twice.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	607	Within hours it was followed by the actions of vested financial interests who saw this as a signal to carry on with business as usual, with a Government licence to back them up.  There was Mr. Fingleton junior's notorious e-mail to UK depositors drumming up extra business on foot of the State guarantee.  Then there was the extraordinary set of deals to manage the year-end balance sheet of Anglo Irish Bank with huge overnight transfers from another institution, Irish Nationwide, in the face of manifest failure and support from another institution.  No bank can fail, was the mantra of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan but he let down his guard and failed to insist on new practices, new management and a new bank culture.Only nationalisation could have achieved that but he ran away from that option and he is still running away in denial from it.  The Fianna Fáil–Green Party Government's velvet glove approach with the banks is deeply flawed and has not worked, and will not work, now or ever.  Banks have become too used to getting their own way over the past decade.  This can be changed only by a strong arm approach that will absolutely insist on both regime change at the top and behaviour change in their approach to corporate governance and lending policies.The banks covered by the guarantee have teetered on the edge of bankruptcy for some time now.  As institutions they have failed utterly.  They have failed the businesses, the homeowners, and their own workers who have given them loyal service.  There is no escaping that plain if rather inconvenient truth.  Their predicament is evident from the sorry state of AIB and the continuing but reluctant admissions from it of the calamitous state of that bank's balance sheet.  Sooner or later these colossal sums must be written off, the banking system must be restructured entirely and revert to its core job of accepting deposits and lending against houses and business plans, particularly for small and medium sized enterprises which rely on our banks.  The Americans call this style of banking — taking deposits, lending for houses and ordinary businesses — vanilla banking, just like vanilla ice cream without any exotic flavours added.Last September, the entire house of cards collapsed and confidence evaporated  Every bank's long-term security was called into question.  From that moment banks ceased to be the pillars of the economy.  They became bankrupt businesses and like all other bankrupt businesses their primary interest was in hustling for money to pay their debts.  Their sole claim on public aid was that they held deposits and mortgages, and were still in a position to lend, if the Government would look after them.  The Government gave them a disastrous guarantee because it naïvely took at face value their assurance that they could still offer lines of credit.It was a lie then and it is still a lie.  Had the Government nationalised them on day one, on 30 September, it could have secured those deposits and ring-fenced lending to businesses and individuals, as well as protecting the shareholders' interests and those of the small savers who patriotically put their money into those shares.  It would draw tears from a stone to look at the small shareholders tonight who thought that they were doing the patriotic thing and saving for their retirements.  How they were fooled.At the same time the Government could have isolated toxic debt into a managed "administration" or quarantine.  Above all that would have given it control over the massive sums it was about to spend.  Instead, we have heard Minister after Minister uttering pious hopes that bank directors would use their giant subsidies to lend to businesses and thus kick-start recovery, as opposed to merely underpinning their balance sheets.  With nationalisation the Government would have had power to implement its declared policy.The €7 billion of public money for AIB and Bank of Ireland was supposedly for lending.  That is what the Government told us but AIB received €3.5 billion and has just announced that its debt write-off this year is €4.3 billion so it is actually a further €800 million short after the Government claimed that recapitalisation would fix it.  How naïve can Ministers be and how reckless with taxpayers' money?  Is there no end to their fecklessness?  If one gives money to a chronic gambler he will not use it to change his ways.  He will head straight to the nearest Paddy Power betting shop or poker school.The Government has borne all of the costs of nationalisation and gained none of the advantages.  That is the Labour Party's point.  What was the point of giving all that money to the banks when they were never going to lend it to business?  The economy needs raw spending power.  Money must flow through the economic bloodstream again.  That is the way to re-open shops, re-establish cash-flow, employ staff, make it worthwhile to borrow from banks and for the banks to lend.The Government is planning to pour tens of thousands of euro for every man, woman and child in Ireland into a failed banking system, not just to pay Fingers Fingleton's obscene pension but to pay the gambling debts that he incurred in his recent banking adventures as well.  The Minister claims that the days of crony capitalism are over but the public has a right to be sceptical of this claim.  We have experienced for years the corrosive effects of planning corruption and the Government is largely responsible for the tax incentives that facilitated the property bubble.  That corruption was so overt that public opinion is right to be wary of expensive quick-fix solutions coming from the source that created the problems.Political influence over decisions comes in many forms.  Crony capitalism may not be as overt as before but it has not gone away, it is still very much with us.  Its influence can be seen in the set of attitudes that run through the National Asset Management Agency plan.  What is good for the failed banks and the failed developers is deemed to be good for Ireland or so, at least, the Government appears to believe.  The Minister said it bluntly himself when he described the NAMA as a bailout of the Irish economy.  In other words he identifies the interests of the bankers and the developers with those of the State.That set of attitudes and the light touch — "It will be alright on the night" — approach to regulation has failed the country at a crucial time.  Why should the public put its trust now in a new system designed to suit the same people?  Public trust is a fragile thing and has been sorely tested in recent months.  The September guarantee was supposed to be the silver bullet and was sold to the public at the time as such.  It failed in its express purpose.  Now this new silver bullet is on offer but the public is more cautious.  The Minister for Finance faces a brutal public backlash if he proceeds with the NAMA in the manner he and Dr. Bacon have proposed.  There is a huge loathing at the prospect of yet another bailout for the golden circle of Fianna Fáil's developers and the bankers.The Labour Party has three problems with the Bacon proposal.  How are the troubled assets to be priced in a transparent manner that commands public confidence?

What are they?  The third issue is the absence of any commitment to public accountability and oversight such as the procedures put in place in the USA's troubled assets relief programme, TARP, or in the programmes of Sweden and other countries which did nationalise their banks.The first of these is the most important by far.  The greater the write-down in the value of the banks' troubled assets, the lower the price paid by NAMA on behalf of taxpayers.  However, in that case, the losses that the bank will have to absorb will be greater.  Obviously the banks will want the write-down of their loan books to be as limited as possible because a more substantial write-down will expose them to the risk of insolvency.  As I stated, €3.5 billion would vanish on foot of the €4.3 billion bad debt write-down by AIB.  More money will be wasted unless we proceed properly.Some Dublin stockbrokers have suggested a haircut of approximately 15% to 20%.  That would imply a bill of over €50 billion for the taxpayer and would involve an immediate doubling of the national debt by that amount.  If the scope of the write-down is limited to the sole purpose of preserving the cosmetic health of the banks' balance sheets, the decision will have been motivated by political rather than commercial reasons.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	611	This is a truly appalling vista.  A 15% haircut is a joke and so are all the dodgy notions about fair value and intrinsic value that we hear about from the vested interests who want to get the State to pay over the odds for their reckless purchases of development lands.  Some of the fields outside towns around the country are again being considered as agricultural land because they are no longer worth more than their agricultural value.  Perhaps they are worth 10% of their value on the banks' balance sheets.Consider Ballsbridge in Dublin 4, the prime centre of inflated land prices during the boom.  Last week the national newspapers carried advertisements for two buildings on sale in the AIB Bank Centre.  They were discounted by a minimum of 44%.  I refer to the best property area in Ireland, which has a bank as a tenant.  Many less favourable sites are now worth less than 20% of their earlier sale prices.  If NAMA entertains any idea of buying such properties at a discount of a mere 15% to 20%, it will cause taxpayer outrage and rightly so.The main financial institutions must become credibly solvent.  That is why the Labour Party is emphasising the nationalisation process and, ultimately, the return of the banks to solvency.  The party's view is that the only realistic way to get to grips with this is to nationalise the banks.  That still involves a State takeover of the toxic debts and the property assets so that a specialist agency with a professional approach to the liquidation of toxic debts could ultimately manage or sell these assets.  However, it avoids any immediate requirement to place a value on them because the transfer would simply be from one State agency to another.  Furthermore, no legal problem would arise in this regard.The act of nationalisation does not in itself dispose of the issue of how to handle the losses, nor does it diminish the scale of capital that the State will have to find to restore the nationalised institutions to a state of commercial health that will allow them to be sold off as the means of recovering the cost that the taxpayer will have to meet for years.  Mr. Alan Ahearne correctly described that as the upside for taxpayers and businesses in the economy.  It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the primary motivation of the current NAMA proposal is to avoid the nationalisation route at all costs.  That is flawed logic based on political calculations and an excessive wish to return to business as usual in as short a time as possible.That great observer of Irish politics, John Healy, who is alas no longer with us, made a famous comment about the economic failures of his day.  He said, "Nobody shouted stop".  It is time to shout "Stop".  The time is now, the place is here and I ask the House to vote for this motion.  The nationalisation proposal is a response to the failure of Irish capitalism and, as the Minister said, the concomitant failure of global capitalism, globalisation and deregulation.  That there is no alternative demonstrates the failure of TINA, the Washington consensus, Mrs. Thatcher and Mr. Reagan, and the failure of Fianna Fáil economics and "Cowenomics".  As Deputy Seán Ardagh stated today, "Cowenomics" is very close to Fianna Fáil "Enronomics".  This is what we want to say goodbye to.  We wish we could say goodbye to all the Members on the other side of the House also but the voters will have their chance on 5 June.  Please vote for this motion.

I am sharing time with Deputy Terence Flanagan whom I thank and commend for his support on this urgent matter.I call on the Minister for Health and Children to examine the critical needs of the individuals and their carers helped at Prosper Fingal.  This debate is about protecting the vulnerable, assisting those with a disability and getting our priorities right.  We can go on about finance, resources and the economy but this debate is important if we are to protect the most vulnerable and their families.  We must do the right thing and, if needs be, the strong and the wealthy must take the hit and provide resources for groups such as Prosper Fingal.I have received many letters from parents on this urgent matter.  One such letter sums it up.  It reads:Dear Finian,As a parent of a young man of 23 who has Down's syndrome, I am extremely worried as to what the future holds for him.  He has just completed a three year independent skills training programme with Prosper Fingal services but we are now hearing that no funding will be provided for a continued day service come 2009.I cannot bear to think what this will mean for him having built up his self esteem and independence over the years.  However, this independence is only a basic human right and does not extend itself to him being in a position to put himself on the open market for employment or making the decision to move to another country to seek employment.  Therefore remaining in the service of Prosper Fingal is of the utmost importance to him.How can we tell him come September that there is no place for him because of a lack of funding?  He has built up a wonderful relationship with all members of staff and has developed a lovely network of friends.  It would be heartbreaking for him and for us if this service were to be withdrawn.I am appealing to you to plead on his behalf for adequate funding to make sure this does not happen.The bottom line is that Prosper Fingal provides a service for 233 individuals and their carers.  It is a not-for-profit organisation, a registered charity and funded by the HSE.  In total, there are 35 people seeking long-term day services from Prosper Fingal in 2009.  There are also eight individuals receiving residential crisis services.  There has been a 3% cut in the overall budget and the group will work with the HSE in any way possible to manage demand.  I urge the Minister and the HSE to fund and support Prosper Fingal.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	614	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue and thank Deputy Finian McGrath for stating the facts about Prosper Fingal.  It is a not-for-profit organisation which is funded by the HSE and provides an extensive range of services for 233 adults with intellectual disabilities in north County Dublin, as well as respite, day, residential, clinical, advisory and transport services which are delivered at eight locations in Fingal — Malahide, Rush, Skerries, Piercetown, Portmarnock, Balbriggan and Swords.The Minister has reduced the budget for the organisation by 3%, which is scandalous.  Indications show that no funding will be provided for service development this year.  If the service development funding is withdrawn, 24 adults who depend on the services of Proper Fingal will be devastated.  They will also lose their long-term service placements and will be sentenced to spending their lives at homes with their family supports.  In addition, 11 other individuals who require a long-term place will be denied a place.The 24 people affected are young adults who have benefited enormously from the help they have received to date from Proper Fingal.  They have learned new skills and have gained independence.  For these young adults to progress, they need and rely on their place in Prosper Fingal.  They need to continue receiving the great benefits they have received to date.  Prosper Fingal not only provides essential skills but a social element for these young people.  It gives them a sense of purpose, a sense of responsibility and a quality of life.Like Deputy Finian McGrath, I have received numerous items of correspondence concerning this matter in recent weeks.  Many parents are angry and extremely concerned about these cutbacks.  The Minister needs to seriously reconsider this matter, having regard to all the money that was squandered here during the last ten to 15 years.  The money spent on the electronic voting machines is one such example.  All we are seeking is for the Minister to continue to fund Prosper Fingal.  It is not expensive to do so.  The average cost in respect of each person is €20,000 per annum.  If funding is cut, the long-term costs of providing full-time residential places will a much more costly.I want the Minister of State to give us positive news that he will continue to properly fund Prosper Fingal and that he will look after these people and not give up on them.  Such people are forgotten about in some instances.  Not enough funding is being allocated to help people with intellectual disabilities.  I hope that the Minister of State will look after these people and give us a positive response.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	615	I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  I am pleased also to have this opportunity to address the issues raised by Deputies Finian McGrath and Terence Flanagan.
I want to re-affirm the Government's steadfast commitment to people with disabilities in Ireland and to the national disability strategy and its long-term goals and objectives, which we will continue to pursue in the coming years in partnership with all the key stakeholders.  The co-ordination and planning of services to meet the needs of people with disabilities form a central tenet of the national disability strategy.  A critical element of such co-ordination and planning is the requirement to provide financial support for the developments and implementation of services.Since 2005, the Government has provided significant additional resources for services and supports for effecting real change in the development of services for people with disabilities.  The multi-annual investment programme, which was a key component of the Government's disability strategy, had, by the end of 2008, provided for the intellectual disability services 804 new residential places, 307 new respite places and 1,863 new day places.  In terms of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, 307 new residential places and 911,626 extra home care personal assistance hours have been provided.  A total of 406 places in the intellectual disability residential service have been enhanced, 61 respite places have been enhanced while 43 residential places in the physical and sensory disability services have been enhanced.  In addition, almost 195 day places have had their services enhanced with the provision of additional supports to allow the organisations to deal with school leavers or other adults with significant disabilities.The HSE and voluntary disability service providers are working together to ensure that all the existing resources available for specialist disability services are used in the most effective manner possible.  In the current challenging economic environment there is a responsibility on all publicly funded services to review the way in which services are delivered and to ensure resources are used to maximum effect.  This also applies to disability service providers in the statutory and the non-statutory sector, including Prosper Fingal.The overall allocation to voluntary disability service providers in the health Vote was reduced in 2009 by 1% — similar to the 1% reduction in 2008 — as part of an overall efficiency measure within the health services.  In addition, in the context of the general economic situation and the financial pressure on HSE budgets, the HSE has been required to implement a further 1% budget reduction to all voluntary agencies since the start of the year.As Deputies are aware, Prosper Fingal has developed a wide range of service options that are both centre and community-based, including day services, training, employment placement, residential and non-residential respite, residential support, clinical, community outreach and transport services.  Prosper Fingal is currently supporting 220 clients with an intellectual disability and their families.All service providers, including Prosper Fingal, have been asked by the HSE to review all non-frontline expenditure, in particular, staff travel, expenditure on conferences and seminars, and advertising to ensure maximum value from the procurement of goods and services.  There is also a requirement on all providers to review the way in which services are delivered, for example, to examine opportunities for amalgamating services or back office supports and reduction or elimination of expenditure on overtime or agency staffing or both.I further understand that the HSE has put in place a partnership process with the umbrella groups representing the voluntary sector in the context of the difficulties presenting in delivering disability services in 2009.  The purpose of the group includes ensuring that the required budget reductions are implemented in a manner designed to minimise the impact on service users.  The HSE has also confirmed that while there is no specific funding in 2009 for the development of new services, there will be a requirement for all stakeholders to plan to meet the needs of individuals who require services on an emergency basis.The HSE and non-statutory providers are working together to identify how the needs of these individuals, who require services on an emergency basis in 2009, can be responded to within available resources.  The aim is to agree how service providers — statutory and non-statutory — and HSE management can plan and provide for emergency requirements at local and regional level.  This will involve a collaborative approach at local health office and area level in dealing with emergency situations, development of criteria for identifying emergency needs in a consistent manner across all service providers, identification of capacity to increase provision within existing resources, reviewing existing service arrangements in the context of appropriate response and service efficiency and delivering responses to meet requirements.I take this opportunity to emphasise the Government's commitment to people with disabilities and to the strategy and its long-term goals and objectives, which we will continue to pursue in the coming years in partnership with all the key stakeholders.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	616	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter.  I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, for his presence in the Chamber.I very much welcome the news that the World Health Organisation has invited Taiwan to take part as an observer in the upcoming World Health Assembly this month.  I also ask that the Government acknowledge that this decision is significant on many levels and, in particular, that it is a decision of practical relevance to the international efforts to fight any threatened global pandemic.With the new flu strain posing the biggest risk of a large-scale pandemic since avian flu surfaced in 1997, I am confident that the Minister and her Department will take all necessary measures to protect our citizens.  That we live in a global village is a well-worn phrase.  Never has that phrase been more true than when we look to the dangers posed by this new virus.The speed and the scope of the world's response to this new virus prove the value of preparations made because of the avian flu and SARS scares.  The World Health Organisation has played an active and valuable leadership role in developing emergency response measures and in ensuring that the necessary procedures are rigorously implemented across the world.As the WHO is the most influential multilateral forum that handles health care issues confronting the international community and as it is dedicated to the goal of good for everyone, it must have the full support of every country in the world to fight any threatened pandemic.We should welcome Taiwan's full participation in the World Health Assembly.  Admitting Taiwan will serve to improve the effectiveness of the WHO by removing a significant gap in the worldwide disease prevention system. Bringing Taiwan into the WHO will serve to remove that vulnerability and will help strengthen the worldwide disease prevention system.Taiwan's role as a key sea and air transport hub in the Asia-Pacific region makes it vulnerable to pandemics.  In 2003, an outbreak of SARS spread rapidly to over 27 countries within a few months, taking the lives of more than 800 people.  According to WHO research, ease of transportation between countries was the main factor facilitating the spread.Taiwan's inclusion as an observer in the WHA is especially important in co-ordinating global responses to pandemics.  Diseases do not stop at national borders and Taiwan's absence from the WHA meant that a co-ordinated global response to a pandemic outbreak was not as effective as it will now be with Taiwan's inclusion.Taiwan is in a position to contribute powerfully to WHO activities.  It is prominent in a wide range of medical and pharmaceutical fields, and has demonstrated willingness to volunteer aid and assistance to other needy countries in the recent past.  Taiwan's inclusion as an observer in the WHA is also a welcome endorsement of the health rights of the citizens of Taiwan.  Their welfare has been directly threatened by its inability to establish direct access to and communication with, the WHO in the past.  Neither has it been able to either acquire the latest medical updates, nor receive timely assistance when epidemics occur, such as was the case with SARS when Taiwan was left vulnerable.  Taiwan's inclusion as an observer in the WHA also demonstrates the improvement of the relationship between Taiwan and China.  There is now significant goodwill on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.  The reopening of negotiations in 2008 marked a steep change in their relationship and it is heartening to see that progress is being achieved.  Just recently, the two sides concluded a third round of talks, consolidating the real progress and achievements made to date.  This is encouraging not only for the cross-strait relationship but also for regional stability and bodes well for a more enduring world peace.I acknowledge the sterling role played by Deputy Noel O'Flynn who has been actively involved in all issues relating to Taiwan and equally with regard to the imminent announcement by the Minister on the visa waiver which will be very important for the Irish economy.  Taiwan has a contribution to make to the Irish economy from the points of view of tourism, culture and education.  The granting by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of the visa waiver in the not too distant future, complemented by Taiwan's right of admission as an observer at the World Health Assembly, is a very important development for the world and will help recognise the significant role played by Taiwan globally.  I am confident the Minister of State will duly recognise the role of the World Health Assembly and I await his comments on this important decision which is very good for Ireland.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	617	The Government is very pleased that the World Health Organisation has invited Taiwan to take part as an observer in the upcoming World Health Assembly.  We agree with Deputy Perry that this as a positive development in a worldwide disease prevention system and a welcome development in international co-operation.In common with most member states of the UN and all EU partners, Ireland adheres to a One China policy, recognising the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legitimate government of China.  We therefore do not support Taiwanese membership of organisations where statehood is a prerequisite for membership.  We take the view that any status granted to Taiwan by the WHO must be compatible with the One China policy.However, against the above background, and with our EU partners, Ireland for many years has been active in seeking to ensure Taiwan's meaningful participation in the activities of the WHO to the fullest extent possible, so as to ensure that there is no geographical gap in the important work of that organisation.  In this context, Ireland supported the Taiwanese application for observer status at the meeting of the WHA from 18 to 27 May.  We are very pleased that the Government of China also accepted the case for Taiwan's participation as an observer in the WHA, which paved the way for the director general of the WHO, who is Chinese, to issue the invitation to Taiwan.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	618	As the House will be aware, with increasing unemployment figures, people who now sign on for social welfare are facing quite lengthy periods before the social welfare payments are processed and paid.  In my constituency of Cork South-Central people are now waiting anything from nine to 12 weeks for a social welfare payment to come through.  During that period individuals are directed to the community welfare service and the community welfare officer provides recently unemployed people with a supplementary welfare payment to tide them over the application period.In the Ballyphehane-Togher area, the community welfare officer has gone on maternity leave and the HSE has not filled the post.  As a result, people in Ballyphehane-Togher cannot therefore avail of a supplementary welfare payment because the post is vacant.Earlier today I met with Professor Drumm and his team to talk about the reconfiguration of hospital services in the Cork and Kerry region.  This is a very ambitious plan which will involve significant changes for the region.  However, one would question the HSE's ability to project manage such a big project, given that it is unable to manage substitute cover for a community welfare officer in the Ballyphehane and Togher area.  How, in the name of God will the HSE be able to reconfigure a whole hospital service for an area one quarter the size of Ireland?The existing system is questionable in itself.  It takes nine weeks for a person to receive a social welfare payment yet the community welfare officer can effect a payment within one week.  This beggars belief because it must be the same system.I am concerned that people who cannot get a supplementary welfare payment while waiting for a social welfare payment to come through, have no other option but to borrow that money.  The banks will not lend them this money, they may be a member of a credit union and may receive bridging finance but this situation is driving people into the hands of moneylenders because the State is not fulfilling a function.  I hope in his response that the Minister of State will provide a solution whereby a community welfare officer will be in place tomorrow morning or if he fails to achieve that goal, that some priority is given to social welfare applications in this area, given that people cannot be provided with a supplementary welfare allowance in that time.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	619	I am replying on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and for giving me this opportunity to outline what provision is being made in the Ballyphehane-Togher area of Cork.  I would also like to take this opportunity to speak about the community welfare service in general.With regard to the sudden absence of a community welfare officer in the Ballyphehane-Togher area of Cork, I am informed by the HSE that this relates to the fact that there was no clinic held in that area on Monday last, 4 May 2009.  As the Deputy highlighted, this absence could not have been anticipated as the member of staff responsible for this area was suddenly taken ill.  The situation was compounded by the fact that a large number of possible replacement staff were also unavailable.  Obviously this was an unfortunate set of circumstances but not one that could have been foreseen.  As a result, I am informed it was decided by local management that it would not be possible to hold the clinic on that day.  While this unfortunately has caused inconvenience to clients who were hoping to meet with the community welfare officer, the cancellation of the clinic was unavoidable in the circumstances.In order to address the pressures on the community welfare service in Cork, a process is under way with the staff and their trade unions to implement a revised arrangement to meet the current service need.  This process has been undertaken in a partnership process and will be finalised over the coming week to ten days.

#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	621	The Deputy must allow the Minister of State to continue his reply.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	622	The purpose of the process is to ensure a resolution is found and I am trying to deliver on that.  In the meantime, in relation to the Ballyphehane-Togher area, arrangements have been made for the assignment of a dedicated member of the relief panel of community welfare officers to take up this position immediately.  The matter will be kept under ongoing review.The Government decided in March 2006 to transfer the administration of the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme to the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  The community welfare service is funded by the Department of Social and Family Affairs but the delivery of the day-to-day service is the responsibility of the HSE.  I do not believe this is the best, most efficient way of delivering this service.  The division of responsibility between the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the HSE is also making it more difficult to address the pressures on both the community welfare service and the Department of Social and Family Affairs in a unified, comprehensive manner.Reform of the public service remains a priority for the Government.  Citizens need and demand integrated services across public service.  Public service reform also means resources must be deployed to the best effect and this requires a flexible and open attitude of staff to change and doing things differently.  The transfer of the SWA is a good example of the kind of reforms which are needed.  The decision to transfer the SWA was taken over three years ago.  There have been lengthy discussions with the unions since then to bring it about.Virtually all the preparatory work that can usefully be done has been completed.  The Government remains firmly committed to this transfer of functions and has recently reiterated its support for accomplishing the transfer.  The delays to date do not reflect well on the public service and I hope this matter can now be progressed quickly, preferably through negotiation between all the parties involved.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	623	On 1 February 2007, Ballinagare Bridge, Lixnaw, Co. Kerry, collapsed when a truck transporting pigs weighing 43 tonnes attempted to cross over it.  The bridge had a carrying capacity of just 12 tonnes, which was clearly indicated on the approach roads.  This resulted in a court conviction for the driver and an acceptance of liability by the insurance company.  The quantum of liability is being decided between the insurance company and Kerry County Council.  It is expected to be a substantial figure, which will reduce the overall cost of replacing the bridge for the Department.A grant of €100,000 was allocated to Kerry County Council in 2008 for Ballinagare Bridge under the specific improvement grant scheme.  This enabled Kerry County Council to design a new bridge, complete a short listing process of suitable contractors and draw up tender documents.  In the 2009 regional and local roads specific improvement grants announced last February, a figure of €600,000 was allocated by the Minister for Transport for Ballinagare Bridge.  The announcement was enthusiastically received and welcomed locally.  However, in the revised figures for the 2009 specific improvement grants published on 14 April, the allocation for the bridge was reduced from €600,000 to €25,000, for no apparent reason.  This announcement came as a major bombshell for the local community and was greeted with much dismay and anger.The bridge was used extensively by local commuters between Lixnaw and Ballyduff and during the summer by numerous tourists visiting Ratoo round tower and Ratoo Abbey on the Ballyduff side of the River Brick and the seaside resort of Ballybunion.  A number of farmers with land on both sides of the River Brick have been seriously inconvenienced since the bridge collapsed.  They have to make a ten mile round trip to access their lands.  In addition, a large number of people from Ballyduff who cut turf on the Lixnaw side of the River Brick in Ballinagare Bog, have to travel over ten miles to access their bogs.On 27 April, Kerry County Council was informed by the regional and local road division of the Department of Transport that, "Unfortunately following the supplementary budget in April the Department is not in a position to fund the construction of Ballinagare Bridge at this time and the request for approval to proceed to tender is denied".  I appeal to the Minister to reverse this decision and allow Kerry County Council to proceed to tender for this project.  Given the downturn in the construction industry, the likelihood is that the tenders will be very competitive, as was the case with Castleisland bypass recently where the estimated cost was €16 million and the successful tender was €12 million, a €4 million reduction.I understand a suggestion was made last Monday night at a public meeting in Ballyduff that a replacement Bailey bridge would be acceptable, similar to the original one.  However, it would seem that there is just a small differential between the cost of a Bailey bridge and the one designed by Kerry County Council.  The approach roads will have to be raised and realigned because of flooding and the abutments will have to be rebuilt, whether it is a Bailey bridge or the Kerry County Council design, so it seems that the latter approach is better and the officials of the council want to take it.As most of the financial cost for this bridge will be incurred in 2010, with part funding for the scheme from the insurance settlement being available in the near future, going to tender now would seem to be a practical approach.  There are moneys within the allocation by the Minister that could be used for this road, so half the funding is there.  In view of the strategic importance of Ballinagar Bridge to Lixnaw-Ballyduff and the greater north Kerry community, I strongly urge the Minister to instruct the regional and local roads division in his Department to grant approval to Kerry County Council to proceed to tender immediately.  If a bridge of this importance collapsed two and a half years ago in any other part of Ireland, for example in County Meath, it would have been long since replaced.  I look forward to the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney's reply on behalf of the Minister and I hope it will contain a change of approach by the Department of Transport and hope for the people of Ballyduff and Lixnaw.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	624	Again, I am taking this Adjournment matter, in this instance on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey.  County councils and other major local authorities are responsible for managing and maintaining all roads and bridges on the regional and local road network in their area.  Each year, the Department of Transport assesses the regional and local roads programmes of local authorities and makes substantial grant allocations towards them.  Local authorities are also expected to commit an appropriate share of their own resources for this purpose, and the grants that the Department of Transport provide supplement these.The bridge at Ballinagare was damaged in February 2007.  That bridge was a temporary structure and had a weight restriction imposed.  Subsequent to the collapse of the bridge, Kerry County Council developed proposals to provide a new replacement bridge at the location and the council sought grant aid from the Department of Transport.  In 2008, a road grant of €100,000 was allocated to the council under the specific improvement grants scheme to facilitate design work for a new bridge.  Kerry County Council included the bridge at Ballinagare in its application for grant aid in 2009 and, in February last, initial road grant allocations were made.  At that time, a grant of €600,000 was proposed to facilitate construction work on the bridge.The current economic climate and the difficult position of the Exchequer has, unfortunately, had an impact on the Government's ambitious plans for the development of our road network.  In reviewing NDP expenditure for the rest of 2009 it was found necessary to reduce the overall level of Exchequer funds available for improvement works to regional and local roads.  This impacted on all local authorities.  The grants originally allocated in February 2009 were reviewed and revised road grants issued to all local authorities on 14 April 2009.The revised road grants allocated to Kerry County Council in April amount to €17.985 million.  This is a significant supplement to the expenditure proposed by Kerry County Council from its own resources at a time when public finances are under serious pressure.  This grant aid was allocated under a number of grant categories and included a total of €3.1 million for ten specific improvement projects.  These included the proposed new bridge at Ballinagare which was allocated €25,000.In deciding on the revised grant allocations, the approach taken was to fund legal contractual commitments and prioritise work necessary to complete projects already under construction.  Local authorities were, however, also advised that there would be flexibility as to how the grant aid may be used.  It is open to Kerry County Council, if it wishes, to reprioritise the expenditure of the €3.1 million which is available for specific improvement works in 2009 and to submit an alternative programme to the Department of Transport which could allow construction work to start on the bridge.  This is a matter for the council to decide in the first instance and Department of Transport officials are available to assist the council in reviewing its road programme if the council requests.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	627	Tax revenues are forecast by my Department on a disaggregated individual tax-head basis using relevant macroeconomic drivers and, where appropriate, certain elasticity factors. Last year the Department of Finance published a report produced by a group specifically established to examine the tax forecasting methodologies used by the Department.  The Tax Forecasting Methodology Review Group comprised of experts from the Department of Finance, the ESRI, the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Bank and had input from the EU Commission.In terms of the findings, while the Group suggested that the Department of Finance displays a prudent bias in tax forecasting, it did not suggest any major structural recommendations to the way my Department forecasts tax revenue. However, it did suggest a number of adjustments which the Department is currently implementing.  Furthermore, the Group's report also indicated that the Department's methods were not out of line internationally.  A copy of the Group's report is available on the Department of Finance website (www.finance.gov.ie).Notwithstanding the strengths and weaknesses of the methodologies used to produce the technical forecast, judgement and prudence plays an important role in deciding on any forecast.  To this end, my Department liaises closely with the Revenue Commissioners to ensure any emerging trends are identified and all relevant data is taken on board.Furthermore, it must be acknowledged that forecasting is not an exact science and there is always a risk of variance. This has been especially true during recent times, when the global economy has experienced a period of unprecedented uncertainty while our own economy undergoes a significant domestic adjustment.  In these circumstances, it has proven to be extremely difficult for all forecasters to accurately predict short-term economic and fiscal trends.In terms of tax revenue performance so far this year, tax receipts at end-April, at €10.1 billion, are down 24 per cent on the same period last year.  This represents 29 per cent of the Supplementary Budget's forecast of €34.4 billion and is generally in line with the average percentage of the end-year outturn received after 4 months over recent years.When looking at the tax revenue figures to end-April it must be borne in mind that the revenue-raising measures announced in the Supplementary Budget will improve revenues as the year progresses.  In addition, there will be a positive base effect upon year-on-year comparisons as 2009 progresses due to the fact that tax revenues worsened during the course of 2008.  In overall terms at this stage, based on the current assessment for the economy, my Department still expects that tax revenues will amount to about €34½ billion, which would represent a 15½ per cent decline on last year's outturn.That said, it is still early in the year and, as such, my Department will continue to monitor the situation on an ongoing basis and will report in detail at the mid-year stage in the context of the end-June Exchequer Returns press conference.

The establishment of NAMA and interim preparations will also be overseen by the NAMA Steering Group recently established by me and including representatives of my Department, the NTMA and the Office of the Attorney General.I will be working closely with the interim NAMA Management to ensure that there is sufficient information available to them to undertake the initial valuation work required for the efficient establishment of NAMA.  Valuations will build on the significant amount of work carried out on behalf of the Financial Regulator by PwC and Jones Lang LaSalle.  The legal basis for preparatory work and the exchange of information is under the NTMA Act 1990 and the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008.  I will be seeking information from the covered institutions in relation to their current loan books to assist the NAMA project.The establishment of NAMA on an interim basis will allow preparatory work to begin immediately with regard to developing valuation methodologies, developing initial contacts with the banks and identifying loans to be transferred.  Specialist expertise, including valuation expertise, will be procured by the NTMA to ensure that the work to be done by NAMA when it is established is accomplished in the most efficient manner so as to safeguard taxpayers' interests.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	629	The institution to which the Deputy refers is an independent financial institution operating on a commercial basis and it would not be appropriate for me as Minister for Finance to comment in specific terms on its financial performance.  However, as the Deputy will be aware, the institution in question is suffering from its exposure to property prices and the general economic downturn, in common with other credit institutions.Regarding the practice of interest roll-up, this is a feature of land and development financing which has been practised as standard across institutions with land and development books.  My understanding is that it operates within defined time limits in the relevant institutions.  In considering the ramifications of interest roll-up arrangements, institutions must take a case by case approach in determining whether a borrower has the ability to repay in light of the value and saleability of the underlying asset.  This information will inform a bank's assessment of the quality of a loan and whether provision is necessary.  In this context, I am informed by the Financial Regulator that Irish credit institutions, as part of case management, are reviewing interest roll-up arrangements, assessing future potential to repay and making provision accordingly.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	630	As the Deputy will be aware, fixed rate mortgages can be regarded as a form of insurance against interest rate changes as fixed rate mortgages provide certainty and security to borrowers regarding the level of their repayments.As referred to in the Deputy's question in circumstances that many households are faced with significantly increased financial pressures, the current environment of very low interest rates clearly highlights to fixed rate mortgage holders the saving that would be available if they benefited from a variable interest rate.  It is clear, therefore, why many fixed rate mortgage holders seek to switch to secure lower repayments.However, when a borrower signs a fixed-rate mortgage contract with a mortgage provider, the lender in turn enters into an agreement where they borrow the money at an agreed rate.  The mortgage lender must repay the money at this agreed rate, so there is a cost to the institution if the fixed rate agreement is terminated before the agreed term which gives rise to the redemption fee charged in these cases.On 26 March 2009, I undertook, in this House, to raise concerns regarding the level of redemption fees with the Consumer Director of the Financial Regulator who has a statutory mandate to safeguard the interests of consumers.  At the beginning of April my Department wrote to the Consumer Director to request confirmation that redemption fees charged for switching from a fixed rate mortgage cover funding costs only and that there are no other costs included.To date, the Financial Regulator has been able to confirm to my Department, that all mortgage lenders have responded and that all have provided the formula used by that lender when calculating the early redemption fee applying to fixed rate mortgages.The Financial Regulator is awaiting independent verification, by an actuary, from a number of lenders that the fee being charged recoups only those costs incurred by the lender when financing the fixed rate mortgage.  However, the verifications received indicate that the formulae applied by lenders seek to recoup the loss to the lender arising from the early redemption of the fixed rate mortgage and do not seek to apply a penalty charge on the borrower.The Financial Regulator is also examining whether any other costs are being charged such as administrative fees, etc.  Any such charges may be subject to approval by the Regulator under Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 and will be examined further in that light.  To date the responses indicate that most lenders do not levy additional charges in the case of early redemption of fixed rate mortgages.The Financial Regulator has advised that further analysis may be necessary once all of the information is received and reviewed.  Should the remaining analysis by the Financial Regulator indicate that further consideration of this issue is required, it will be carried out.It is important to note that a number of important initiatives have been put in place by Government to assist borrowers in difficulties.  These include:The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) which is developing a joint protocol with the Irish Banking Federation to ensure effective co-operation when dealing with debt problems of personal debtors.The mandatory Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears requires that when a borrower is in difficulty the lender shall make every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment schedule.  Under the Code consideration should be given on a case-by-case basis to alternatives such as deferral of payments, extending the term of the mortgage, changing type of mortgage, or capitalising arrears and interest.  In any case, lenders will not commence legal action for repossession until after six months from the time arrears first arise.Finally, as part of the subscription agreement for their recapitalisation Bank of Ireland and AIB will not commence court proceedings for repossession of a principal private residence until after 12 months of arrears appearing where the customer continues to co-operate with the banks.

The announcement of these changes, which had been flagged by the Obama Administration, represents the beginning of a process that will involve detailed discussion and debate in both Houses of Congress.The US Administration has signalled clearly that they are very conscious of the need to maintain the competitiveness of US companies operating globally and in that context the Government will continue to engage with both the US Administration and with Congress as the debate develops.The Government and I attach the highest importance to strengthening the economic partnership between our two countries, a partnership that has contributed enormously to the very significant trade and investment between the two countries.  We have a common interest with the US Administration in keeping strong that partnership that has served us well up to now.  My Department in conjunction with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the IDA will be working in close collaboration with the Embassy in seeking to address the various policy proposals. In that respect I want to assure the Deputy that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, through the Embassy in Washington, has been monitoring and responding to all proposals for policy initiatives which could potentially impact on the Irish economy.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	632	I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 and 112 together.The Government has recently announced a range of initiatives which are intended to lead to savings in the public service pay bill.The first of these initiatives is the Government decision that, with effect from 27 March 2009, no public service post, however arising, may be filled by recruitment, promotion or payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade, and any limited exceptions to this principle would require my prior sanction.  This decision also applies to temporary appointments on a fixed-term basis and to the renewal of such contracts.  Vacancies may be filled by redeployment of staff from other Departments or public bodies with my sanction. There is some limited flexibility in how this decision is to be implemented in the Health and Education Sectors to reflect the particular service needs in these areas.In the April 2009 Supplementary Budget, I announced three further initiatives that will contribute to payroll savings.  The Government has decided to offer an Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement in the public service to reduce the public service pay bill and facilitate a permanent, structural reduction in the numbers of staff serving in the civil service, local authorities, the health sector, non-commercial state bodies and certain other areas of the public service.  On 30 April 2009, my Department issued a circular regarding the operation of this Scheme in the civil service.  The civil service circular will be used as a model for the operation of the scheme in other appropriate areas of the public service, although there may have to be modifications to accommodate the particular needs of those areas.In essence, the Scheme is open to applications from 1 May 2009 until 1 September 2009.  Employees 50 years of age or over by 1 September 2009 who have already accrued entitlement to preserved superannuation benefits under a public service scheme, and who have not yet reached normal preserved pension age, are eligible to apply for early retirement under the Scheme.  In general, Departments are expected to facilitate the early release of staff, with priority being given to the officers with the longest service, other things being equal.  In general, the Scheme will be subject to local management arrangements and controls to ensure that its operation does not undermine the effective delivery of services to the public.  The Scheme provides that applications can be deferred for up to one year, or in exceptional cases refused, for stated business reasons.The Government has also decided to implement two new work-life balance initiatives, the Special Civil Service Incentive Career Break Scheme to facilitate civil servants in taking a career break for 3 years, and the Shorter Working Year Scheme which replaces the existing Term Time Scheme.  Circulars have also issued from my Department in regard to the operation of these schemes in the Civil Service; these measures or their equivalent will also be extended to other appropriate areas of the public service in due course.While the Exchequer savings arising in respect of each of the above schemes cannot be projected with certainty, as they are dependent on take-up in each case and other factors, taken together it is estimated that the above package of measures could yield payroll savings of the order of €150 million in 2009 and €300 million in a full year.  It all depends on take up.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	633	Among the measures announced in my Budget Statement to this House on the 7th April was the decision of the Government to make additional changes to the remuneration of members of the Oireachtas.One of the changes to be made was in relation to the payment of long service increments to members. Following advice received from the Attorney General regarding the legislative changes required to effect the changes announced, I can confirm that legislation is required to cease the payment of Long Service Increments to members of the Oireachtas.In line with the legal advice received, the Government has decided that no further long service increments will be awarded to Members of the Oireachtas but existing members who are currently in receipt of Long Service Increments will retain them for the duration of the current Dáil — or Seanad as appropriate — only. Long Service Increments will not be paid to any members of the Oireachtas in the next Dáil and Seanad. I have recently written to those Deputies who are immediately affected advising them of these measures.The legislation necessary to effect these changes will be published in the current Dáil session.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	634	The Deputy may wish to note that number of important initiatives are in place to assist consumers who have fallen into debt or are in danger of falling into debt.For example my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs provides a non-profit public service counselling service through the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) at his Department.  This is a national, free, confidential and independent service for people in debt or in danger of getting into debt.  In 2009, almost €18 million has been provided to assist MABS with its workload. I understand that MABS are working together with the Irish Bankers Federation (IBF) to agree a joint protocol to enable MABS and the IBF continue to work together effectively when dealing with debt problems of personal debtors who approach the MABS Service for assistance.The Financial Regulator's Consumer Protection Code (CPC), was a major step in promoting the interests of consumers.  It obliges the regulated entities that it covers to act in the customer's best interests, to seek appropriate information about the customer, to ensure that the products and services provided are suitable for the consumer, to treat their customers fairly and have adequate procedures in place to handle complaints. The CPC also sets out requirements that a regulated entity must contact the consumer as soon as it becomes aware that a mortgage account is in arrears and that it must have in place a procedure for handling accounts in arrears. It is best practice for lenders to agree a remedial action plan with a borrower where it detects arrears starting to emerge and to try and assist the borrower to manage his or her financial commitments and not allow the situation to worsen. These obligations are additional to the statutory prior information and warnings required under the Consumer Credit Act 1995.In addition, the Recapitalisation Programme announced on 11 February 2009 includes a new Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears, which has been issued by the Financial Regulator and came into force on the 27 February 2009. The new Code applies to mortgage lending activities to consumers in respect of their principal private residence in the State and is mandatory for all mortgage lenders registered with the Financial Regulator including so-called "sub-prime lenders". Under the mortgage arrears code where a borrower is in difficulty the lender shall make every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment schedule. Under the Code consideration should be given on a case-by-case basis to alternatives such as deferral of payments, extending the term of the mortgage, changing type of mortgage, or capitalising arrears and interest. In any case, lenders will not commence legal action for repossession until after six months from the time arrears first arise.In addition as part of their recapitalisation scheme, A.I.B. and Bank of Ireland, will not commence court proceedings for repossession of a principal private residence until after 12 months of arrears appearing where the customer continues to co-operate with the banks.The Financial Regulator has prioritised the provision of information for consumers about the potential risk of excessive debt and has also drawn attention to the need for consumers to choose the right type of loan for their needs. It has also developed a number of specific initiatives to help consumers make informed choices in terms of the financial products they choose, the amount of risk they take on and the cost of financial products.I believe that the above initiatives provide substantial safeguards and assistance to consumers who experience difficulty in meeting their loan commitments.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	635	When I announced the Government's proposal to establish a National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) in early April, I indicated that the potential maximum book value of loans to be transferred to NAMA was estimated to be in the region of €80 to €90 billion. This remains the case. Of course, the amount to be paid by NAMA will be significantly less than this to reflect the loss in value of the underlying collateral.Pending the establishment of NAMA on a statutory basis an interim Managing Director has been appointed and I will announce an Advisory Committee in the coming days This Committee which will include experts in valuation, legal affairs, corporate finance and public administration will provide valuable expert advice to both the interim Managing Director and to me as Minister. The establishment of NAMA and interim preparations will also be overseen by the NAMA Steering Group recently established by me and including representatives of my Department, the NTMA and the Office of the Attorney General.The valuation of the loans, as suggested by the Deputy, will be a very important variable. Preparatory work for the establishment of NAMA which has commenced will include an extensive due diligence on the loans books of the banks to ensure that the appropriate categories or portfolios of loans are transferred to NAMA and that the banks are cleared of their identified riskiest loan portfolios. Loans will be transferred from the banks to NAMA at an appropriate written down value. The development of a valuation methodology by the interim NAMA will take account of the advice of the Advisory Committee and will be consistent with European Commission guidance and subject to EU State aid approval. This will take into account the risk being transferred to the State and an appropriate adjustment for the value of the State support being provided.The Government has received expert financial, economic, legal and valuation advice at every step of its measured response to the turbulence in the banking sector. Likewise, specialist expertise, including valuation expertise, will be procured by the NTMA to ensure that the work to be done by NAMA when it is established is accomplished in the most efficient manner so as to safeguard taxpayers' interests.

On foot of Ireland's deficit figures for 2008 the Ecofin Council made a recommendation to Ireland.   This is part of the normal operation of the Pact whenever the General Government Deficit of a Member State exceeds the reference value of 3% of GDP as did that of Ireland and of a number of other Member States in 2008.The Council recommendation invites Ireland to reduce the deficit below the 3% of GDP reference limit by end 2013.   This is in line with the Government's budgetary strategy.  As is normal in these circumstances, I have been in regular contact with the Commission and I have briefed my European colleagues with regard to the position of the public finances in Ireland.Council recommendations are intended to support and encourage the Member State concerned in its pursuit of necessary, if difficult, budgetary measures to reduce the deficit below 3% of GDP in an agreed timeframe while taking account of economic circumstances.The European Commission has welcomed Ireland's consolidation strategy including the recent supplementary Budget of the 7th April.    It has also been welcomed by Eurogroup.We are continuing to work with the Commission and our European colleagues on this and other matters and as such the question of penalty clauses does not arise.

Within these urban areas, regard will be had to factors such as:the availability of public transport,the level of congestion in the relevant parts of those cities, andthe relative value of the car parking spaces.Each employee who has an entitlement to use a parking space provided directly or indirectly by his or her employer is liable to pay the levy, there is no distinction in this regard between private sector and public sector employees. Certain official cars owned or provided by the State, the Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces and certain other services such as the fire and ambulance service and the Customs service are excluded.

Insurance costs reflect a broad range of factors, including for example, the level of cover, the number of claims, legal and administration costs, the cost of fraud as well as the overall cost level in the economy.My Department has been advised by the Financial Regulator that while the non-life insurance market performed well up to the end of 2006, market sources indicate that much non-life business was written at a loss in 2007. This trend continued in 2008, but the companies were still willing to write business at a loss in order to maintain their market share. They were able to do this as a result of the reserves they had built up during profitable years. However, the situation could not go on indefinitely and indications are that firms are now taking action on pricing to underpin their financial positions.In the current difficult trading climate, there is a delicate balance to be struck between ensuring the long-term sustainability of the insurance industry and at the same time making sure that the consumer obtains good value for money.  I am particularly conscious of the impact of a significant increase in premiums for both the consumer and business and it must be a priority for  insurance companies to ensure that insurance cover is provided as competitively as possible consistent with long term commercial sustainability and viability.The Deputy will be aware that like all financial service providers, the insurance industry is also affected by the continuing stress in the financial markets and the recessionary pressures in the economy. This is likely to be one of the reasons for increases in areas such as motor insurance.In conclusion, the recent upward trend in insurance prices reflects a range of factors outside the control of the industry.   It would not, therefore be appropriate from a policy perspective to seek to intervene in the commercial conduct or decision making of insurance firms in the absence of clear evidence of market failure in respect of which there is scope to address from a national perspective.

This decision will reflect a range of different factors including funding costs, market conditions,  profitability and business strategy as well as the competitive environment overall.  The Deputy will appreciate it is a core function of the Board and senior management of each institution to assess where the appropriate balance lies between these competing objectives particularly in ensuring the financial health and commercial viability of the relevant institution.  It is not an appropriate role for the Minister for Finance to seek to determine this decision making by financial institutions operating under competitive market conditions.In view of its statutory consumer protection mandate, the Financial Regulator will continue to monitor interest rates charged by financial institutions.

The IMF itself says that forecasts of these costs are subject to significant uncertainty and will depend on the evolution of the financial sector.  The estimates do not represent the outcome of a specific examination of Irish banks' assets.The principal reason the IMF approach gives a relatively high figure for Ireland is that our formal legal bank guarantee arrangement is broader-ranging than that in other countries — though other countries have made political commitments that are just as wide ranging — and our financial sector is larger relative to the economy.Obviously we are open at all times to discussion with international institutions about technical assumptions they apply to the Irish case, but in the current case we are far from convinced that there is significant new or additional informational value in the figures presented, from a national point of view.

In this regard legislation will be introduced shortly to give effect to this decision.  I would add that it is also the view of the Government that it would be appropriate to make a proportionate reduction in the Ministerial pensions payable to serving members in the current Dail and Seanad.  I have consulted the members who would be directly affected by this decision before the Government takes a final decision on the matter.

Under its Terms of Reference, the Group is to report to me by the end of June and this is on course.  The question of whether to publish the Report will be considered by the Government in due course.The Special Group's analysis and recommendations will be taken into account as appropriate by the Government in framing budgetary policy and preparing the Estimates of Expenditure for 2010 and later years, and the question of new institutional arrangements to implement proposals of the Special Group does not arise.

The terms of reference of the Commission on Taxation are broadly defined, far reaching and allow for consideration of all aspects of the Irish taxation system. The work of the Commission will help establish the framework within which tax policy will be set for the next decade at least.  As the Commission has not yet finalised their report, it would be inappropriate at this stage to disclose any institutional arrangements for the implementation of any proposals put forward in the Commission's report.

Under the Scheme, covered institutions have committed to submitting reports requested by the Regulatory Authority at my behest, including reports which monitor the flow of credit to the real economy.  The reports will be submitted with such frequency and in such form as the Regulatory Authority determines.With regard to credit commitments arising out of the recapitalisation, the banks have agreed to make quarterly reports to the Financial Regulator.  The first reports to end March 2009 have been submitted to the Financial Regulator in accordance with the timeframe of end-April 2009.Each covered institution must pay the charge quarterly, in advance, to the Minister, payable no later than five working days after the beginning of each quarter, during the period the covered institution avails itself of a guarantee.  This charge is based on the monthly average of total covered liabilities.  Arising from this, the covered institutions must submit monthly covered liabilities reports to the Financial Regulator.  These returns have had to be submitted to the Financial Regulator no later than the 6th working days following month end.  However, I understand that the future returns will be incorporated into the Monthly Summary Financial Report which is received by the Regulator no later than the 20th working day following month end.Finally in relation to the payment of the coupon under the recapitalisation, the fixed dividend of 8% is payable annually. Dividends are payable in cash at the discretion of the bank. If a cash dividend is not paid, then ordinary shares are issued in lieu at a time no later than the date on which the bank subsequently pays a cash dividend on other Core Tier 1 capital.

Arising from the statutory position election expenses are charged against the Central Fund under in 3 main headings—Expenses of running the elections which comprises of necessary costs including poll/counting staff costs, storage of equipment, preparation and provision of polling stations, clerical and travel expenses and various fees;Charges by An Post for delivery of various material including election communications from parties/candidates, ballot papers for postal voters and polling cards; andCandidates' expenses subject to statutory limits.The cost of the 2007 General Election was €31.6m and the cost of the 2008 Referendum was €16.3m. While it is difficult to estimate accurately the cost of the upcoming elections, it is estimated that they will cost in the region of €25-€30m with postal charges estimated at €12m and the remainder the running expenses of the election and the candidates' expenses.

This has led to increased scrutiny and oversight of the operations of the institutions and to increased engagement with its management including with regard to each of the institution's capital positions.As the Deputy will be aware, the Government announced on 7 April 2009 its intention to establish a National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). Assets will be transferred from participating institutions to NAMA with the purpose of ensuring that relevant institutions have a clean bill of health, their balance sheets are strengthened and uncertainty over bad debts is reduced.The Government will consider the position of relevant institutions on an individual basis in the light of the proposed establishment of NAMA, the capital requirements of the institutions concerned and the requirement to protect the position of the taxpayer.  In bringing forward the necessary legislation to establish NAMA and the details that will govern its operation, further discussions will be undertaken with the relevant institutions including the institutions referred to by the Deputy where their participation in NAMA and their future capital positions will be discussed on an individual basis.

Together, these structural changes and substantial increase in regulatory capacity will support a more effective and efficient financial services regulatory system aligned with best international standards. A priority for Government is that the new independent Commission will be highly authoritative, expert and experienced in the key areas required for it to effectively discharge its responsibilities.I intend to implement this major reform of the institutional structure for financial regulation and the preparation of legislation along the principles I have outlined over the coming months.

NAMA will be an independent commercial entity run on an arms-length basis. It will be staffed by professionals whose objectives will be to maximise returns. Like any commercial entity it will want loan agreements honoured in full and will take all necessary steps to extract value from its acquired loan book.I intend to introduce the necessary legislation before the summer. Matters such as the appointments of the Board, the Chairperson and the Managing Director as well as governance issues and staff recruitment will be addressed in the legislation. Preparatory work by my Department, the Office of the Attorney General, the NTMA and our legal and financial advisors for the establishment and operation of NAMA on a statutory basis is underway. This includes work on the assessment of the staffing needs of the Agency.I recently announced the appointment of Mr Brendan McDonagh as interim Managing Director of NAMA. By appointing an interim Managing Director, the Government is ensuring the implementation process will be driven forward in the interim period pending legislation. Mr McDonagh will be assisted by a high level advisory committee that I expect to name shortly. I have also directed the NTMA to provide the necessary staffing and other facilities through its existing resourcing arrangements to support the interim operation of NAMA, pending its establishment on a statutory basis.

Consistent to these principles, contracting authorities have discretion to specify where appropriate, that certain social and environmental criteria be met where these are related to the subject of the contracts.  In transposing the Public Procurement Directives into Irish law we have allowed (i) that contracting authorities may prescribe that certain environmental and social conditions be observed in the performance of a contract; (ii) that, as agreed under Towards 2016, public contracts must comply with Irish employment law generally including the national minimum wage and Registered Employment Agreements in force; and (iii) that contracting authorities may reserve contracts for sheltered workshops or participants in sheltered employment programmes.Guidance for contracting authorities on how these considerations may be taken into account in a manner consistent with obligations under public procurement rules is published on the national public procurement website www.etenders.gov.ie.

I am advised that the following is the current position.Prior to the commencement of the investigation into these Single Premium Insurance Policies, Revenue launched a voluntary disclosure initiative for policyholders who had tax issues associated with the policies to come forward to declare their liabilities. Persons taking up this disclosure opportunity, for which the closing date was 22 July 2005, could avail of a reduced penalty and avoid publication. Some €460 million has been collected through this initiative.Following the final disclosure date, Revenue commenced the follow-up phase of applying for High Court Orders and this continued into early 2007. In its initial applications it sought information from insurance companies on policies where the sum invested was equal to or exceeded €50,000. The ensuing investigation into those policies has to date secured €29million.Revenue is now seeking further Orders to obtain details on policies falling within the range of €20,000 to €50,000 and, as with the earlier phase, will be using this information to identify cases where policies have been used to evade tax.

Also arrangements will be put in place to monitor closely the commitments made by the banks in relation to the recapitalisation and to monitor the State's interests as a stakeholder.I will appoint 25% of the members of the Boards of these banks. Initially this will involve two extra Directors as there are already two Directors appointed from panels nominated by myself to each of the banks to be recapitalised. In addition, I have other avenues of influence in relation to the banks, for example under the Government Guarantee Scheme and the associated legislation and deeds.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	652	As I outlined in the recent Budget, with effect from 1st May 2009, mortgage interest relief is being limited so that the interest payable on a qualifying home loan qualifies for tax relief for the first seven years only of the life of that loan.  A qualifying home loan is a loan used for the purchase, repair, development or improvement of an individual's principal private residence.The seven-year restriction applies to the interest payable on existing and on new qualifying home loans by both first-time buyers and non first-time buyers.Where a person sells one qualifying residence and buys another, the interest payable on the loan used to acquire the new residence qualifies for mortgage interest relief for the first seven tax years of the life of that loan subject to the normal conditions under which the relief is granted.I would like to illustrate this by way of example.  Take for instance a couple that bought their first family home in 1995 and sold it in 2006 and immediately purchased their present family home financed partly by the proceeds of the sale of the first home and partly by way of a loan.  The interest payable on the loan obtained in 2006 qualifies for tax relief for each of the 7 tax years 2006 to 2012 notwithstanding that the couple may have received tax relief in the tax years 1995/96 to 2006 on the interest paid on the loan used to purchase their first family home.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	653	As the Deputy will be aware, the Government took steps in October 2007 via an amendment to the Central Bank Act, 1997, to provide for an appropriate system of authorisation and supervision of retail credit firms by the Financial Regulator engaged in specialist or so-called sub-prime lending. Such lenders were not previously subject to financial regulation in respect of lending activities. The primary purpose of this amendment was to extend to customers of these firms the benefit of the consumer protections provided for in the Financial Regulator's Consumer Protection Code.  This regulatory regime has been in place since 1 February 2008 and is being implemented by the Financial Regulator. Consumer credit, including sub-prime lending, is also regulated in Ireland under the Consumer Credit Act 1995. The Act makes detailed provision for the form and content of loan agreements and for advertising of consumer credit.The Consumer Protection Code requires all mortgage lenders to undertake suitability assessments before offering a product or service to consumers.  In addition, the Consumer Protection Code sets out the requirements that a regulated entity must contact the consumer as soon as it becomes aware that a mortgage account is in arrears and that it must have in place a procedure for handling accounts in arrears.The finalised recapitalisation scheme announced on 11th February 2009 includes a new code of conduct for Mortgage Arrears, which has been issued by the Financial Regulator and came into force on the 27 February 2009. The new Code applies to mortgage lending activities to consumers in respect of their principal private residence in the State and is mandatory for all mortgage lenders registered with the Financial Regulator including so-called "sub-prime lenders".  Under the mortgage arrears code where a borrower is in difficulty the lender will make every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment schedule and will not commence legal action for repossession until after six months from the time arrears first arise.The Financial Regulator wrote to all regulated mortgage lenders on 16 December 2008 with feedback following a 2008 examination of procedures in place within financial institutions to deal with arrears and repossessions. Their letter sets out best practices identified during the examination for dealing with arrears. The Financial Regulator is currently carrying out a further examination of mortgage lenders to ensure that they are in compliance with the specific provisions of the Consumer Protection Code and the Consumer Credit Act 1995. The examination will also review the application of the residential mortgage arrears and repossession procedures and practices in place in mortgage lenders, as advised to the Financial Regulator in 2008, to ensure that consumers are being treated fairly, and will seek an update on the implementation of the "best practices" outlined in the Financial Regulator's letter of 16 December 2008.In terms of support for payment of mortgages, the Mortgage Interest Supplement, administered by the Community Welfare Service of the Health Service Executive on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, provides assistance where the mortgage relates to a person's sole place of residence.If a consumer has a complaint about his/her mortgage a complaint must first be made directly to the lender.  If the consumer is dissatisfied with the outcome of his/her complaint he/she can then refer the matter for further investigation to the Financial Services Ombudsman.I am satisfied that the measures I have outlined ensure that the interests of such borrowers are safeguarded, consistent with the statutory consumer protection mandate of the Financial Regulator.

These estimates allow for the revisions introduced in the April 2009 Supplementary Budget.The arrangements for the pension-related deduction have been in place since March 1, and were subsequently revised from May 1. As such, detailed data is not yet available. However, the overall yield for 2009 is anticipated to be in line with the latest published estimates.

The Government does not believe that it is fair to pay the same level of benefit irrespective of the level of income of the recipient. In times of scarce resources the Government believes support should be targeted at those most in need. My Department, together with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners are considering how best to achieve this policy objective, which includes consideration of any legal issues that may exist. The tax treatment of child benefit is also being considered by the Commission on Taxation. I will be informed by its proposals on this matter.The saving expected from taxing or means testing child benefit would depend on the scheme selected.  However, preliminary analysis would indicate that savings in the region of €400 million in a full year could be achieved.

An amendment to the Credit Institutions Financial Support Act, 2008 will be required which it is intended to introduce in the course of the current Oireachtas session.As I stated on 7 April last, access to longer-term funding in line with the mainstream approach in the EU will contribute significantly to supporting the funding needs of the banks and to securing their continued stability.Alongside the proposed restructuring of the guarantee, the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) is a very significant important measure to continue to safeguard the stability the banking system and ensure the supply of credit to the real economy. As I highlighted in my recent Budget Statement cleansing and repairing the banks' balance sheets is considered fundamental to achieving a sustained recovery of the banking system in Ireland.  The NAMA initiative is integral to addressing the issue of asset quality in the banking system in Ireland.  It, therefore has a very important role to play complementing that of the guarantee.

It is not included among the OECD list of tax havens; was not included in a recent G20 summit list of tax havens and in fact during the recent Saint Patrick Day celebrations, President Obama assured the Taoiseach that the US did not regard Ireland as a tax haven.On 4th May last the US Administration announced proposed changes to the so called system of tax deferral. The announcement of these changes, which had been flagged by the Obama Administration, represents the beginning of a process that will involve detailed discussion and debate in both Houses of Congress.The US Administration has signalled very clearly that they are very conscious of the need to maintain the competitiveness of US companies operating globally and in that context the Government will continue to engage with both the US Administration and with Congress as the debate develops.The Government and I attach the highest importance to strengthening the economic partnership between our two countries, a partnership that has contributed enormously to the very significant trade and investment between the two countries. We have a common interest with the US Administration in keeping strong that partnership that has served us well up to now.

I intend to bring proposals to Government shortly on an extension of the application of the Freedom of Information Acts. In considering this matter, the Government will take into account the views of the Information Commissioner as well as other important considerations such as the confidential and commercially sensitive nature of many of the records and information held by the above bodies, their role in maintaining the financial stability of the State and the management of the economy and the obligations imposed by the international dimension of their operations.

The forecast by the Commission of a General Government Balance (GGB) deficit of 15.6% of GDP in 2010 was made on the assumption of no-policy-change. However, the Supplementary Budget of April 7th contained provisions for additional tax and expenditure measures which it is estimated will yield €4 billion in 2010. Additionally, the Commission forecast for nominal GDP in 2010 is also lower than my Department's forecast and is thus also a contributory factor in the higher GGB to GDP ratio forecast by the Commission for 2010.The forecast for a General Government deficit of -10% of GDP for 2010, published in the Supplementary Budget, and taking account of additional policy measures, still stands. Finally, the measures set out in the Supplementary Budget which are designed to bring the deficit below 3% of GDP by  end 2013  have been welcomed by the European Commission and by the Finance Ministers of our fellow euro area Member States.

The Scheme states that at such a review, the Minister shall consider, inter alia, the continued requirement for the provision of financial support under the Scheme with regard to its objectives and section 2(1) of the Act.  This review is currently being finalised with a view to formal submission to the EU Commission as required under the Scheme.The next review of the Scheme for State aid purposes is due by October 2009 at the latest.Paragraph 22 of the Scheme relates to the Minister's role in reviewing on a six month basis the application of the guarantee charging model to ensure that it supports the achievement of the purposes of the 2008 Act and the recovery of the aggregate cost to be borne by the State as a consequence of the provision of the guarantee.  This review of the basis of the application of the charging model is expected to be completed shortly to ensure that the guarantee charge yields the full expected amount.

To date, no significant direct cost has arisen to the Exchequer in respect of the nationalisation of Anglo.As the Deputy may be aware, the main exposures at Anglo relate to lending for Land and Development and connected exposures. As for all banks, the treatment of such assets held by Anglo is currently being examined in the context of the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency. The Government has stated that support will be provided as necessary to Anglo, consistent with EU State aid requirements.

The margin is the difference between the price the dealer purchased and resold the second-hand car for.  In conjunction with the introduction of the Margin Scheme, special transitional arrangements were being put in place regarding second-hand cars in stock on the introduction of the Scheme.The Margin Scheme would replace the existing Special Scheme for second-hand cars under which dealers/garages are entitled to immediate input credit for the residual VAT included in the price of a second-hand car acquired either through purchase or trade-in.  Under the Special Scheme dealers, when they resell the car, are required to repay this VAT input credit or VAT based on the resale price of the car, whichever is the greater.Since the Supplementary Budget further discussions have taken place with the motor industry concerning the proposed introduction of a VAT Margin Scheme for second-hand cars. While SIMI expressed appreciation at the efforts made by the Government to try to assist the industry, they considered, in view especially of the difficult financing situation facing the industry, that on balance it would not be in its overall best interest for the Margin Scheme to be introduced at this time.  Consequently, the proposed Margin Scheme and transitional arrangements regarding existing stock of second-hand cars is not now being introduced.It has, however, been agreed that there will be ongoing dialogue over the coming months with SIMI as to what other measures might be introduced to assist the motor industry, especially in regard to removing the current stock of second-hand cars held by dealers.

This year, we will be spending 5% of GNP from the Exchequer on public infrastructure, one of the highest ratios in the EU15.  Over the next four years, Exchequer capital investment will amount to an annual average of over 4% of GNP.This is already a strong support to employment and the reductions in tender prices means that we can do more with less.The Government is prepared to look at new ways to fund needed capital investment and support more jobs provided:the terms are right and in the taxpayers favour;the investment makes economic sense;value for money is secured; andthe private sector shares the appropriate level of risk so as not to have a disproportionate impact on the public finances.I would like to see monies now invested abroad or other private capital put to work here if a sensible workable proposal emerges.Department of Finance officials have actively engaged with several parties to discuss alternative funding proposals; both the likely sources of funding and what would be needed to access such funding.A number of meetings have taken place and further meetings will take place in the near future as needed.Any proposal to establish a national investment bank or similar entity to support and underwrite strategically important infrastructure projects would need to be considered in the context of the significant measures already taken by the Government in response to the financial crisis to support the banking system as well as the planned establishment of a National Asset Management Agency. The purpose of this Agency is to ensure that banks have a clean bill of health, their balance sheets are strengthened and uncertainty over bad debts is reduced. This will ensure a sustained flow of credit on a commercial basis to individuals, households and businesses in the real economy. Existing banks will, as a result, continue to have an important role in funding strategically important infrastructure projects in conjunction with existing state bodies such as the National Development Finance Agency.In this context, the Government does not think it necessary to consider setting up a dedicated bank for infrastructure.

In such cases the debt management service receives, say, a fixed monthly sum from the individual and in return pays off various debts of the individual on a scheduled basis. For its service, the firm receives a commission, usually a percentage of the fixed sum from the individual. The firm may also benefit from rebates from the creditors.  Alternatively, individuals in arrears may avail of a debt consolidation loan to pay off all of his or her existing debt and replace it with a single loan and single payment.The Deputy may wish to note that the provision of debt handling and debt recovery services are not activities which require an authorisation or licence from the Financial Regulator.  I do not have plans to introduce new regulations for debt handing and debt recovery services as there are important safeguards already in place for consumers in the financial sector where a loan was provided by a regulated financial services provider subject to the Consumer Credit Act 1995 and the Financial Regulator's Consumer Protection Code.  In circumstances that the creditor is outside the regulated financial sector and is not subject to the requirements applying in the financial sector it is important to highlight that as far as the debt recovery process is concerned under Section 11 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 it is an offence to demand payment of a debt in a way designed to alarm, distress or humiliate.As far as availability and independent advice and assistance for consumers in debt or in danger of falling into debt, the Deputy will be aware that the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) provided under the aegis of my colleague the Minister for Social and Family Affairs provides a national, free, confidential and expert service.  The location of its offices throughout Ireland and other details may be obtained through its website www.mabs.ie. Its services may also be availed of via its helpline 1890 283 438.  I understand that MABS and the Irish Banking Federation are advancing a joint Protocol on Debt Management which is designed to further improve the operational effectiveness of the IBF Creditor / MABS Adviser engagement.In addition, the Deputy may wish to note Financial Regulator's Consumer Protection Code provides that where a mortgage is offered to a consumer for the purpose of consolidating other loans or credit facilities, the regulated entity must provide the consumer with a written indicative comparison of the total cost of continuing with the existing facilities and the total cost of the consolidated facility on offer.  In the context of providing any consolidated loan the intermediary is of course also subject to the general principles of the Code.

A general rate of €10 per passenger would apply, with a lower rate of €2 for shorter journeys.The Finance (No.2) Act 2008 confirms the introduction of an air travel tax from 30 March 2009. However, I took account of concerns raised by the regional airports particularly those on the western seaboard.  The lower rate of €2 will apply to departures from any Irish airport where the destination is 300kms or less from Dublin airport. This means that all Irish departures to locations such as Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow will be subject to the €2 rate.We currently face significant financial challenges and the air travel tax is an important revenue raising measure.Ireland is not unique in regard to applying a tax on air travel. Other countries within the EU apply similar taxes including, the UK and France, as do Australia and New Zealand. The proposed rates for the Irish air travel tax are not unreasonable both for shorter and longer journeys, when compared to rates in other countries.It should be recognised that tourists will only be subject to the tax on their return journey.  The additional €10 or €2 in the context of a much larger purchasing decision involving travel, hotel expenditures etc. shouldn't have much of an effect on tourist numbers.  I appreciate the airline industry continues to go through a difficult period.  However, this difficult trading period has, in addition to weak world economic activity, been largely driven by a massive spike in oil prices. Oil prices have now halved from the all-time high prices experienced last year.I tried to be as fair as possible in looking at areas for additional tax revenues.  It is also worth noting that fuel used by commercial airlines is completely exempt from tax, so it's a sector that already has considerable preferential treatment. I have no plans to review the air travel tax.

As previously indicated in response to PQ 14171/09 on 7 April, the Revenue Commissioners have advised me that the monthly apportionment between payments of PAYE tax and Income Levy for the 2009 tax year is determined by applying a breakdown formula derived from a tax-forecasting model maintained by the Revenue Commissioners. The precise breakdown between PAYE tax and the Income Levy will be available in the first quarter of 2010 on receipt of the forms P35 from employers. On this basis, Revenue inform me that net receipts from the Income Levy at the end of April have been estimated at approximately €173 million.The estimated amount up to end-April relates to the first three months of this year as the levy is paid by employers one month in arrears.The Public Service pension-related deduction is not included in the Income Tax heading as it is in general collected by Departments as an Appropriation-in-Aid. As such, it has the effect of reducing net voted expenditure. The Public Service pension-related deduction came into effect on 1 March so net expenditure for March and April shows the impact of the pension-related deduction. The revised rates, as outlined in the Supplementary Budget are applicable from 1 May.

The reduced VAT rate for labour intensive services is available on the basis that Ireland applied a reduced rate to those services on 1 January 1991.Prior to the recent adoption by the Council of Finance Ministers (ECOFIN) of a proposal on labour intensive services on 5 May 2009, the majority of other Member States were dependent on an experimental scheme for reduced rates for labour intensive services introduced in 1999 under the EU VAT Directive. In this regard, the ECOFIN Council agreed that reduced rates for certain labour intensive services, including restaurant services, would now be a permanent option for Member States under the VAT Directive.In the context of this change, it would be possible to further reduce the VAT rate applicable to labour intensive services either through a general reduction in the 13.5% reduced VAT rate or through the introduction of a second lower reduced VAT rate that would apply specifically to such services.  However, introducing a second lower reduced rate would further complicate the existing VAT structure in Ireland and lead to demands for the lower reduced rate to be applied to all goods and services currently subject to the 13.5% reduced rate.  This would result in a significant cost to the Exchequer; a one percent reduction in the reduced VAT rate would cost €300m in a full year.  Given the current Exchequer deficit position, reducing VAT rates would not help support the public finances.  In that context we are borrowing to fund day to day public services which is unsustainable as future generations will be required to pay higher taxes unless we correct our public finances.

Assets will be transferred from participating institutions to NAMA with the purpose of ensuring that relevant institutions have a clean bill of health, their balance sheets are strengthened and uncertainty over bad debts is reduced.The Government will consider the position of relevant institutions on an individual basis in the light of the proposed establishment of NAMA, the capital requirements of the institutions concerned and the requirement to protect the position of the taxpayer.  In bringing forward the necessary legislation to establish NAMA and the details that will govern its operation, further discussions will be undertaken with the relevant institutions including the institutions referred to by the Deputy where their participation in NAMA and their future capital positions will be discussed on an individual basis.

In addition to these EU mimima, the Financial Regulator requires that firms maintain solvency of 150% of the Required Minimum Solvency Requirement (200% in the case of newly authorised firms).My Department has been advised by the Financial Regulator that firms often choose to maintain solvency well in excess of the requirements.  In summary therefore, Irish authorised insurers maintain their solvency at safe levels and this is borne out in international comparison.  The Financial Regulator has acknowledged that solvency has shown some decline in the last year.  However, this is to be expected in the face of the ongoing economic and financial turbulence.  Nevertheless, the Regulator is satisfied that the Irish insurance industry continues to maintain a strong solvency position.Finally, it should be noted that the Financial Regulator has been monitoring insurance firms very closely and continues to do so.  The recent introduction of a new quarterly, electronic reporting system for insurance firms has greatly assisted in this regard.

To fully realise the value of such sites or developments NAMA will need the power to ensure that they can be fully developed prior to disposal.  There are a number of ways that this can be achieved including through joint ventures or partnerships, special purpose companies or the direct provision of working capital.  The powers of NAMA to deal with the workout of incomplete developments will be set out in the NAMA legislation which I propose to introduce before the summer.

Good progress has already been achieved with a number of these and work is ongoing with others.  Therefore, at this stage, approximately 70 services are fully available online, and forms can be downloaded electronically for hundreds more.The Government's aim is to have a rolling eGovernment Programme in place.  With that in mind, my Department issued Circular 6/09 on Arrangements for eGovernment in March of this year.  It requires all Departments, offices, agencies, and all non-commercial public bodies and authorities to develop detailed eGovernment plans by the end of June 2009.  These plans must set out additional projects they intend to undertake from hereon in.  These plans will be subjected to regular monitoring by my Department and reporting to Government.To support this work, my Department has established a website on eGovernment specifically for civil and public service bodies.  This website provides them with a range of resources to aid and guide them in developing and progressing eGovernment projects.  In this regard, my Department has produced a working definition of eGovernment projects that should be included in individual plans.  It includes projects that are organisation-specific, cross-organisational, sector-specific or cross-sectoral, and it highlights eight categories of project types such as those providing online information, online transactions, automated transactions, triage facilities, and full business transformation opportunities.  This definition may be changed over time as opportunities and priorities develop.  Additionally, my Department has produced an eGovernment Planning Advisory Note which provides public bodies with assistance on how to develop a project plan and helps to ensure that such plans contain full details on ownership; timelines; facilities being offered; costs; benefits and impacts; capacity of the organisation to deliver; monitoring arrangements; and progress to date.Progress has also been made with a number of central eGovernment operations.  A central ePayments facility, operated by the Local Government Computer Services Board, is now being used by approximately 60 different public bodies for over 30 different service types worth about €20 million per annum.  Since assuming responsibility for the Public Services Broker, my Department has simplified its operation, and integrated its portal with other Government websites such as gov.ie, citizensinformation.ie, and ros.ie.  My Department has also implemented a simplified technology solution for the electronic publication of death events to civil and public service.  This solution provides a way for authorised public service staff to access records of all recently-registered deaths in a simple and secure way.  It is now being used by six Civil Service Departments and Offices, 20 Local Authorities, and a number of HSE functions.  Plans are in place to extend this solution to also facilitate the electronic publication of birth and marriage events subject to business needs being identified and the necessary regulatory changes being implemented.  My Department has also commenced work on the integration of customer identity data from seven sources around the civil and public service, using the "Public Service Identity dataset".  Once completed, this will allow public bodies to better establish the identity of persons in order to maximise re-use of such data and to aid the process of administrative simplification.My Department is providing the Cabinet Committee on Transforming Public Services with regular updates on developments and progress.  Additionally, it is providing the Government with comprehensive progress reports every six months.  The first such report was submitted in March 2009.Finally, my Department is working on developing brochures to explain to people what services are available online, how they can use them, and how they will benefit them.  It is intended to publish these in the latter half of the year.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	677	As the Deputy may be aware, the Revenue Commissioners and the CSO prepared a report, at my request, on the Implications of cross-Border shopping for the Irish Exchequer.  The report was published on my Department's website on 20 March 2009.  The report estimated the likely value of cross-Border shopping in 2009 to be in the range of €450 million to €700 million, with a potential loss in Exchequer revenues arising from reduced VAT and excise yields of between €72 million and €112 million.  In addition, a possible corporation tax loss in the range of €20 million to €31 million is tentatively estimated.  It should, however, be noted that any estimate for corporation tax is provisional and should only be considered as indicative of the potential loss.The report noted that there is rather limited availability of quantifiable data on cross-Border shopping, and with a view to improving the data available, Revenue and the CSO have worked on questions to be included in the Quarterly National Household Survey that should facilitate a more detailed assessment of cross-Border shopping in the future.In addition, the report noted that the main causes of price differentials between goods in Northern Ireland and the Republic, are operating costs, profit margin (mark-up), taxes and the rapid depreciation of Sterling against the Euro.  While changes in the standard VAT rates have widened some price differentials, their impact remains small compared to the size of the change in the exchange rate.The standard VAT rate was increased from 21% to 21.5% in budget 2009 as part of a general package of revenue-raising measures to fund key public services.  The UK Government, as part of a fiscal stimulus package, then reduced its standard VAT rate from 17.5% to 15% on a temporary basis with effect from 1 December 2008 to 31 December 2009.  As I have previously stated, it would appear that the timing of Ireland's VAT increase, given the subsequent temporary reduction in the UK rate, may have sent the wrong signal to consumers.  However, given the current Exchequer deficit position, the budget 2009 policy decision of increasing the standard VAT rate continues to be necessary in order to support the public finances.  We are borrowing to fund day to day public services which is unsustainable as future generations will be required to pay higher taxes unless we correct our public finances.

As I announced in early April, the potential book value of loans that will be transferred to NAMA is in the region of €80 billion to €90 billion, although the amount paid by the Agency will be considerably less than this.Pending the establishment of NAMA on a statutory basis an interim managing director has been appointed and I will announce an Advisory Committee in the coming days.  The establishment of NAMA and interim preparations will also be overseen by the NAMA Steering Group recently established by me and including representatives of my Department, the NTMA and the Office of the Attorney General.The valuation of the loans, as suggested by the Deputy, will be a very important variable.  Preparatory work for the establishment of NAMA which has commenced will include an extensive due diligence on the loans books of the banks to ensure that the appropriate categories or portfolios of loans are transferred to NAMA and that the banks are cleared of their identified riskiest loan portfolios.  Loans will be transferred from the banks to NAMA at an appropriate written down value.  The development of a valuation methodology by the interim NAMA will take account of the advice of the Advisory Committee and will be consistent with European Commission guidance and subject to EU State aid approval.  This will take into account the risk being transferred to the State and an appropriate adjustment for the value of the State support being provided.The Government has received expert financial, economic, legal and valuation advice at every step of its measured response to the turbulence in the banking sector.  Likewise, specialist expertise, including valuation expertise, will be procured by the NTMA to ensure that the work to be done by NAMA when it is established is accomplished in the most efficient manner so as to safeguard taxpayers' interests.

NAMA will be an independent commercial entity run on an arms-length basis.  It will be staffed by professionals whose objectives will be to maximise returns.  Like any commercial entity it will want loan agreements honoured in full and will take all necessary steps to extract value from its acquired loan book.I intend to introduce the necessary legislation before the summer.  Matters such as the appointments and terms and conditions of the board, the chairperson and the managing director as well as governance issues and staff recruitment will be addressed in the legislation.  Preparatory work by my Department, the Office of the Attorney General, the NTMA and our legal and financial advisers for the establishment and operation of NAMA on a statutory basis is under way.  As is the case with all legislation, the Dáil will have the opportunity to debate the Bill when it is brought before the House.I recently announced the appointment of Mr. Brendan McDonagh as interim Managing Director of NAMA. By appointing an interim Managing Director, the Government is ensuring the implementation process will be driven forward in the interim period pending legislation.  Mr McDonagh will be assisted by a high level advisory committee that I expect to name shortly.  I have also directed the NTMA to provide the necessary staffing and other facilities through its existing resourcing arrangements to support the interim operation of NAMA, pending its establishment on a statutory basis.

This figure includes a reduction of €6.3 billion in the deposits held by Irish residents, most of which is accounted for by a reduction of €4.9 billion in January 2009.  A reduction of €7.9 billion held by non-euro area residents was recorded between December and March.  This last figure predominantly relates to international banks.I am informed by the Central Bank that the discrepancy between the €12 billion in the Deputy's question and the €14.7 billion in the latest published statistics is due to a revision upwards in the level of non-euro area resident deposits in December.  This revision took place between the time the January Monthly Statistics were published and the date the last Quarterly Bulletin was published.The Deputy will appreciate that in general, the total value of deposits held in credit institutions included in the Quarterly Bulletin statistics has been quite volatile since September 2008 reflecting uncertainty arising from the global economic and financial turmoil.  It is also important to note that credit institutions located in the State can avail of liquidity funding from the European Central Bank.

This represents 29% of the supplementary budget's forecast of €34.4 billion and is generally in line with the average percentage of the end-year outturn received after four months over recent years.When looking at the tax revenue figures to end-April it must be borne in mind that the revenue-raising measures announced in the supplementary budget will improve revenues as the year progresses.  In addition, there will be a positive base effect upon year-on-year comparisons as 2009 progresses due to the fact that tax revenues worsened during the course of 2008.  In overall terms at this stage, based on the current assessment for the economy, my Department still expects that tax revenues will amount to about €34.5 billion, which would represent a 15.5% decline on last year's outturn.That said, it is still early in the year and, as such, my Department will continue to monitor the situation on an ongoing basis and will report in detail at the mid-year stage in the context of the end-June Exchequer returns press conference.

The Deputy will appreciate that the terms of the scheme relate in this regard only to directors and senior executives and would not apply to the front office staff to whom he refers.However, I am aware that the institution in question has previously announced that due to the business performance of the group this year, it would not be awarding any performance bonuses to executives and managers.  Furthermore, it also announced that it would not be awarding any performance bonuses to staff.  Both of these announcements apply to executives, managers and staff working in the relevant division.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	683	I have noted the write downs on commercial property and the development loan book in the institution referred to by the Deputy for the first quarter 2009.  These write-downs led to loan loss impairments of €198m.  This figure is specific to the institution concerned and it would be inappropriate for me to comment.With regard to the institutions covered by the Government guarantee, it is widely known that the value of their commercial property and development loan books has declined.  The institutions themselves have acknowledged this through the setting aside of impairment provisions. While the degree of exposure to commercial and development property varies greatly amongst the covered institutions, it is a matter for the Board of each institution to evaluate its loan book and make appropriate provisions.The Deputy will be aware that banks will have to take an appropriate write-down in value of loans transferred to NAMA taking account of NAMA's objective, which is to operate commercially and optimise the return on such loans over time. While the initial write down of loans may have an effect on the banks' capital, there also will be a reduction in risk weighted assets as a result of the transfer of the loans to NAMA.  The setting up of NAMA and transferring the more difficult asset portfolio to it will leave the banks in a stronger position to lend to the real economy and to make profits which will facilitate increases in the banks' capital bases over time.

In the context of the bank guarantee scheme and recapitalisation the banks have made important commitments to support business lending.A Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises was published by the Financial Regulator on 13 February and took effect on 13 March.  This code applies to all regulated banks and building societies and will facilitate access to credit, promote fairness and transparency and ensure that banks will assist borrowers in meeting their obligations, or otherwise deal with an arrears situation in an orderly and appropriate manner.  The business lending code includes a requirement for banks to offer their business customers annual review meetings, to inform customers of the basis for decisions made and to have written procedures for the proper handling of complaints.  Where a customer gets into difficulty the banks will give the customer reasonable time and seek to agree an approach to resolve problems and to provide appropriate advice.  This is a statutory code and banks will be required to demonstrate compliance.In addition, as part of the recapitalisation package announced on 11 February, Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland reconfirmed their December commitment to increase lending capacity to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) by 10% and to provide an additional 30% capacity for lending to first time buyers in 2009.  If the mortgage lending is not taken up, then the extra capacity will be available to SMEs.  AIB and Bank of Ireland have also committed to public campaigns to actively promote small business lending at competitive rates with increased transparency on the criteria to be met.  Compliance with this commitment will be monitored by the Financial Regulator.  The banks make quarterly reports, with the first reports to end-March 2009 to hand.  Officials from my Department are also in regular contact with the banks concerned in relation to their progress on implementing these measures.Furthermore, the banks have agreed to engage in a ‘clearing group' chaired by a Government representative and including representation from business interests and State agencies.  The purpose of this group will be to identify specific patterns of events or cases where the flow of credit to viable businesses appears to be blocked and to seek to identify credit supply solutions.  Any questions on the clearing group should be directed to my colleague the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.An independent review of credit availability, funded by the banks but managed jointly by the banks, Government and business representatives is also under way and will be completed shortly.  Among the issues covered by this review will be changes in bank lending, repayment terms and a comparison with customer experiences prior to the onset of the financial crisis.  I am satisfied that this review, along with the quarterly reports from the recapitalised institutions, will give a clear picture regarding the flow of credit in the Irish economy which will inform future policy.

It is, however, difficult to quantify the impact of these measures.For instance, the introduction of the pensions levy in the public sector earlier this year will lower the cost of running the public sector and send a positive demonstration effect in terms of private sector wages.In addition, the Government is helping to support employment and enterprise by redirecting the NDP, as well as implementing a number of activation initiatives to further encourage individuals into employment.  The Government is also implementing measures to support the ‘smart economy', through investment and incentives in order to reach an R&D target of 2.5% of GNP by 2013.  This will help us re-orient the economy towards the export-led growth which we must achieve.At a more macro-level, maintaining our public finances on a sustainable path is a pre-requisite for economic growth.  In this regard, the various expenditure-reducing and tax-raising measures introduced since October, will have a beneficial impact by restoring confidence as well as improving our competitiveness.  As outlined in the recent budget, further measures will be introduced in 2010 and 2011.  Notwithstanding these increases in taxation, our tax system remains competitive and pro-enterprise.

The outcome of this process is one determinant of the cost to the Exchequer, if any, for nationalising Anglo Irish Bank.  To date, no significant direct cost has arisen to the Exchequer in respect of the nationalisation of Anglo.  The Government has stated that support will be provided as necessary to maintain Anglo, consistent with EU State Aid requirements.As the Deputy may be aware, the main exposures at Anglo relate to lending for Land and Development and connected exposures.  As for all banks, the treatment of such assets held by Anglo is currently being examined in the context of the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency.

As a result unemployment on this basis was forecast to rise to 12.6 % this year and to 15.5 % next year.While not designed to measure unemployment, trends in the live register provide an indication as to the more recent labour market trends.  The latest figures refer to April and show a seasonally adjusted 389,000 on the live register and a standardised unemployment rate of 11.4 %.The fiscal projections in the recent budget are based on the assumption that the number on the live register averages 440,000 this year.  Implied in this projection is the assumption that the number on the live register exceeds 500,000 by end year.  In terms of 2010, the current working assumption is that given the weak economic outlook, unemployment will continue to rise and an average unemployment rate of 15.5% has been factored into my Department's recently published forecasts and provided for in the macroeconomic and fiscal framework released with the supplementary budget documentation.I am aware of the recent forecasts made by the ESRI.  For unemployment next year the ESRI figure is at the upper end of the range of forecasts; the current consensus among economic forecasters is that unemployment at the end of 2010 will be 15.4 %.

Accordingly, normal commercial decisions, which include determining the retail and commercial deposit rates, are matters for the board of Anglo.Notwithstanding this, I have been made aware that Anglo Irish Bank has been reducing its rates since the start of the year in line with falling money markets rates.  Most recently on Wednesday 6 May 2009 the Bank notified the Financial Regulator that it was again reducing the rates on its Personal Savings accounts.  These changes came into effect on 12 May 2009.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	689	As the Deputy will be aware, fixed rate mortgages can be regarded as a form of insurance against interest rate changes as fixed rate mortgages provide certainty and security to borrowers regarding the level of their repayments.As referred to in the Deputy's question in circumstances where many households are faced with significantly increased financial pressures, the current environment of very low interest rates clearly highlights to fixed rate mortgage holders the saving that would be available if they benefited from a variable interest rate.  It is clear, therefore, why many fixed rate mortgage holders seek to switch to secure lower repayments.However, when a borrower signs a fixed-rate mortgage contract with a mortgage provider, the lender in turn enters into an agreement where they borrow the money at an agreed rate.  The mortgage lender must repay the money at this agreed rate, so there is a cost to the institution if the fixed rate agreement is terminated before the agreed term which gives rise to the redemption fee charged in these cases.On 26 March 2009, I undertook, in this House, to raise concerns regarding the level of redemption fees with the Consumer Director of the Financial Regulator who has a statutory mandate to safeguard the interests of consumers.  At the beginning of April my Department wrote to the Consumer Director to request confirmation that redemption fees charged for switching from a fixed rate mortgage cover funding costs only and that there are no other costs included.To date, the Financial Regulator has been able to confirm to my Department, that all mortgage lenders have responded and that all have provided the formula used by that lender when calculating the early redemption fee applying to fixed rate mortgages.The Financial Regulator is awaiting independent verification, by an actuary, from a number of lenders that the fee being charged recoups only those costs incurred by the lender when financing the fixed rate mortgage.  However, the verifications received indicate that the formulae applied by lenders seek to recoup the loss to the lender arising from the early redemption of the fixed rate mortgage and do not seek to apply a penalty charge on the borrower.The Financial Regulator is also examining whether any other costs are being charged such as administrative fees, etc.  Any such charges may be subject to approval by the Regulator under section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 and will be examined further in that light.  To date the responses indicate that most lenders do not levy additional charges in the case of early redemption of fixed rate mortgages.The Financial Regulator has advised that further analysis may be necessary once all of the information is received and reviewed.  Should the remaining analysis by the Financial Regulator indicate that further consideration of this issue is required, it will be carried out.

CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.The aim of CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.  FÁS makes every effort to ensure that differing levels of demand between neighbouring schemes are equalised.  FÁS also operates the programme flexibly as far as possible to ensure the continuation of community projects.In April's budget I provided €6.6 million for 400 additional CE places bringing the total number of CE places to 22,700.This Government will continue to support the positive role of CE in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities.  I am keeping the operation of the scheme under constant review in the context of the current difficult unemployment situation.

Naturally, all companies must act within the laws governing employment of workers and the State's industrial relations machinery is available to those who wish to resolve disputes arising in an orderly way.However, responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes is a matter for the parties themselves.  The State provides the industrial relations dispute settlement machinery free of charge to assist this process, which, in line with the general principles of industrial relations in Ireland, is voluntarist in nature.  The system of industrial relations in Ireland is designed to help and support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences, rather than imposing an extensive set of legislative conditions on parties to an industrial dispute.The experience and expertise of those providing the State's dispute resolution services offer the best avenue for resolving the differences between disputing parties.  Where the parties make full use of these procedures, the evidence shows that a very high percentage of disputes are resolved through the conciliation process.

Where the income levy has been applied to a particular pay period or periods during the year and an employee presents to their employer/pension provider evidence of being in valid possession of a full medical card, the employer/pension provider should make an adjustment at the earliest possible time to refund the income levy deducted.  If it is not possible to make an immediate refund, the employer should refund the income levy at the end of the year at the latest.Where the employee has not been in continuous employment with an employer/pension provider throughout the year in question, the Revenue Commissioners, rather than the employer/pension provider, will deal with any refund of income levy due at the end of the year.  The exemption does not apply to those who hold a GP only medical card.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	697	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that each spouse is treated individually throughout the year by their employer/pension provider when the income levy is applied.  According to Revenue records, the person in question is aged over 65; therefore the €20,000 per annum (€385 per week) exemption is applied to each pay period. However, no refund can be made during the year.After the end of the tax year the person can claim a refund of the income levy from the Revenue Commissioners.  He will be due a full refund of the levy provided the combined income of the couple (excluding any social welfare payments) is less than €40,000, double the single threshold.In the case of the exemption for those aged over 65 who are married, the legislation provides for a refund after the end of the year because it would not be possible for the Revenue Commissioners, an employer or pension provider to know during the course of the year whether or not all of the requirements necessary for the exemption to apply have been met.  This would include knowing, for example, if the person or their spouse had turned 65 in the tax year, if they had other income sources and the aggregate income from these sources, if there had been a change in employment circumstances or if there had been a change in marital status during the year.

The exemption extends to the amount of the income of the approved body as has been, or will be, applied to the sole purpose mentioned.  This approval may be withdrawn by Revenue.The exemption from Capital Gains Tax for sporting bodies is contained in sections 610 and Schedule 15, Paragraph 37, TCA 1997.  Section 54 of the Finance Act 2007 is an anti-avoidance measure and amends Schedule 15 of the TCA.  This ensures that, in order for bodies to qualify for the exemption from Capital Gains Tax, the consideration for the disposal for the purposes of the Capital Gains Tax Acts must be applied for the purposes of the bodies concerned if it is greater than the actual proceeds of the disposal giving rise to the gain.  In some cases under the CGT code, market value may be imposed as the consideration, which could be higher than the actual proceeds.Section 105 of the Finance Act 2007 provides for an exemption from Stamp Duty for the acquisition of land by sporting bodies approved under section 235 of the TCA 1997 where the land acquired will be used for the sole purpose of promoting athletic or amateur games or sports.  The exemptions discussed above only extend to the amount of the proceeds arising from the disposal of assets, or the interest on the investment of a capital sum, which has been, or will be, used for the sole purpose of promoting athletic or amateur games or sports.The administration of the exemptions is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  I am advised by Revenue Commissioners that the detailed application of funds would have to be considered specifically, and in context, in each individual case, to see if the application of funds has any implications for the tax exemption, or the body's approval status in the context of the body being established, and existing, for the sole purpose of promoting athletic or amateur games or sports.Revenue has also confirmed that bodies that are granted sporting tax exemption are subject to periodic risk-focused review towards ensuring that the terms of the exemption continue to be fulfilled.  All relevant matters, including adherence to any income and property clauses attached to the exemption, are considered in the context of such reviews.

A motor vehicle is detained or seized by authorised Officers of the Revenue Commissioners where there is evidence that it is being retained permanently in the State, is liable to registration and payment of Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT), and its owner has failed to declare the vehicle and pay the VRT due within the period prescribed by law.  A Notice of Detention or Seizure is normally issued by the Officer concerned.In routine cases the seizing officer normally offers terms for local release of a seized vehicle.  However, where aggravating circumstances, such as commerciality, fraud or obstruction exist the decision regarding release or otherwise is made by the VRT Prosecution Unit in Bridgend, County Donegal, to whom the officer will report the seizure.  Unless the offender is offered an export option, the normal release terms are payment of the VRT due together with a fine or penalty which is calculated by reference to the Category of the vehicle, the amount of VRT evaded and the length of the time the vehicle has been in the State.  However, where an individual is not in a position to immediately pay the fine and VRT amounts together, the vehicle can be released on payment of the fine alone on condition of their signing an undertaking to pay the VRT within seven days.  A vehicle is normally released once the VRT and the penalty have been paid.While there is no legal obligation to do so, where a vehicle has been seized, it is normal practice for the seizing officer to ensure that the owner can make arrangements to get to his/her home or place of work.  Depending on the circumstances, this may mean driving the person to his home or to the nearest bus stop or train station if the person is unable to make alternative arrangements to be picked up.  This is normal practice except where a vehicle has been seized in circumstances of a hostile or aggravated nature.The decision of whether or not to offer release of the vehicle for removal from the State on payment of an appropriate fine is made by the Seizing Officer.  The factors taken into account in arriving at a decision include:the amount of VRT due;whether circumstances such as fraud or obstruction exist;the indications or otherwise of a commercial connotation;the extent to which the vehicle has been used in the State that may indicate that it was intended to be retained permanently in the State.If a decision has been made by the Revenue Commissioners to release a vehicle for retention in the State on payment of the VRT and a penalty, then it is not open to the owner of the vehicle to alter the terms of that decision except with the consent of the Revenue Commissioners.

The administration of this scheme is the responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners.Under the terms of the scheme, tax relief applies to donations which:Are €250 or greater in one year;Are in the form of money or quoted securities, or a combination of money and quoted securities;Are not repayable;Do not confer a benefit on the donor or any person connected with the donor; andAre not conditional on, or associated with, any arrangement involving the acquisition of property by the charity or approved body.In order to be eligible to participate in the donations scheme, a body must have specific approval.  In the case of charities, this approval is issued by Revenue and in order to be eligible to apply for such approval, a charity must have had a charitable tax exemption under section 207 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 for a minimum period of 2 years.  Other bodies, such as schools, colleges, universities, bodies approved for education in the arts as well as a number of other specified organisations are eligible on foot of their definition as approved bodies by virtue of schedule 26A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  The full details in relation to the terms and conditions of the scheme are outlined in Leaflet CHY 2 which is available on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie.In order for a private hospital to avail of the donations scheme it would have to satisfy Revenue in the first instance that it was entitled to a charitable tax exemption.  In order to do so it would have to prove that it is not run for the profit of individuals and meets the criteria for charitable tax exemption in all other respects.  Full details in relation to the application process (including the application form) are contained in information booklet CHY1 "Applying for Relief from Tax on the Income and Property of Charities" and can be obtained online from Revenue at www.revenue.ie or by ringing Lo call 1890 666 333.

The purpose of this group will be to identify specific patterns of events or cases where the flow of credit to viable businesses appears to be blocked and to seek to identify credit supply solutions.  Any questions on the clearing group should be directed to my colleague the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.An independent review of credit availability, funded by the banks but managed jointly by the banks, Government and business representatives is also underway and will be completed shortly.  Amongst the issues covered by this review will be changes in bank lending, repayment terms and a comparison with customer experiences prior to the onset of the financial crisis.  I am satisfied that this review, along with the quarterly reports from the recapitalised institutions, will give a clear picture regarding the flow of credit in the Irish economy which will inform future policy.

This decision will reflect a range of different factors including funding costs, market conditions,  profitability and business strategy as well as the competitive environment overall.The Deputy will appreciate it is a core function of the Board and senior management of each institution to assess where the appropriate balance lies between these competing objectives particularly in ensuring the financial health and commercial viability of the relevant institution.  It is not an appropriate role for the Minister for Finance to seek to determine this decision making by financial institutions operating under competitive market conditions.   In view of its statutory consumer protection mandate, the Financial Regulator will continue to monitor interest rates charged by financial institutions.

Under the scheme, biofuel produced under projects approved by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources are exempt from excise duty.  This serves to reduce the additional costs associated with the production of biofuels and consequently allows them to compete with conventional fossil fuels.  This fiscal incentive was designed to kickstart the domestic biofuels industry.  Long-term general excise reliefs are not anticipated.In addition, as a complementary measure, the Finance Act 2008 provided for the VAT rate applicable on the supply of miscanthus rhizomes, seeds, bulbs, roots and similar goods used for the agricultural production of bio-fuels to be reduced from 21% to 13.5%.  Furthermore, Budget 2007 provided funding for a national top-up of the EU energy crop payment from €45 per hectare to €80 per hectare.  This payment is operated by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and provides farmers with a further incentive to grow energy crops.The Deputy might wish to note that there are additional non-fiscal measures that can be used to promote biofuels.  To provide further market certainty and encourage projects of scale, the Government signalled its intention to move to a Biofuels Obligation.  I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources that the introduction of the Biofuels Obligation will require all fuel suppliers to ensure that biofuels represent a certain percentage of their annual fuel sales.  The biofuels obligation is designed to provide a long-term market based framework for the development of a biofuels sector and delivery of biofuels targets to 2020.  Under the Biofuels Obligation Scheme, suppliers will be compelled to use biofuel in the fuel mix providing a valuable boost to the biofuels industry generally.The public consultation process in relation to the Biofuels Obligation Scheme was completed at the end of November last and there were 40 submissions received as part of the consultation process.  Specific details for a final Biofuels Obligation Scheme are now being prepared which are cognisant of the views expressed by stakeholders following the consultation process.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources will be bringing a proposal to Government shortly and introduce the necessary legislation required in order that the Biofuels Obligation Scheme can be introduced in January 2010.

This is comprised of the cost of site/property acquisitions, fit-out works and rent of approximately €290m expended by the OPW together with some €4m in costs incurred by other organisations.My reply of 10th December 2008 also set out these other Agency costs.  The up to date position in relation to these costs is as follows:a total of €3.2m expended by FÁS;a total of €2.65m expended in respect of the HSA (of which €1.80m is included in the OPW figure above)a total of €0.305m expended by Pobal The costs to date have been offset by property disposals in Dublin.The total projected income from property disposals in Dublin over the period of the programme amounts to over €570m.  This is made up of €373m already received together with property valued at €75 million transferred to the Affordable Homes Partnership.In addition, the OPW has agreed joint venture redevelopment schemes with an approximate value of circa €125m (subject to current market fluctuations).  As expected, non-property costs have been increasing as more posts are located outside of Dublin.  At end September 2008, the total non-property costs incurred amount to approximately €12m.

The disability criteria for these concessions are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.  To get a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of these Regulations.Some 13,000 people benefited under the scheme in 2008 at an overall estimated cost of €76 million.  Any changes would have to be considered in the context of the annual Budget.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	708	The Irish economy's competitive position deteriorated since the early part of this decade.  Reasons for our decline in competitiveness include an appreciation of the euro as well as wage costs increasing at a rate faster than productivity improvements.  In addition, inflation in Ireland was above the euro area average from 1999 to 2007.  As a result, consumer price levels in Ireland are now about a quarter greater than the euro area.  All of these factors increased the relative cost of doing business here.In terms of prospects, we expect the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices in Ireland to fall by about 1½  per cent this year, a larger fall than the euro area average.  A short period of price falls which will assist price convergence towards euro area levels is welcome.  Nevertheless, the factors causing this decline are temporary and we expect inflation to return to low, but positive territory next year in Ireland.  It would also appear that labour costs have also begun to fall.  While up-to-date official statistics are not yet available, there are indicators of pay cuts here in Ireland.  In addition, the public service pension-related deduction recently instituted in the light of the pressures on the public finances should have a positive demonstration effect in the private sector which will have a beneficial knock-on effect for competitiveness.Ireland continues to perform very well in terms of attracting investment from abroad.  Despite global economic difficulties, 2008 was a very good year for inward investment with a total of 130 FDI projects won, 8,800 new jobs created and a projected investment of circa €420m in IDA-supported companies.  There was an increase of 16% in the number of new companies setting up in Ireland for the first time, as well as a 22% increase in research, development and innovation projects, which totalled 56 projects.  It is important to recognise that even in turbulent economic times there is still FDI to be won.

This equates to a General Government Debt ratio at end 2009 of 59% of GDP.  The General Government Debt measure does not allow for the offsetting of cash balances or other assets such as the National Pensions Reserve Fund which stand at about 20% of GDP.Although the debt level will rise over the coming years, it is rising from a low base and it should be borne in mind that Ireland's General Government Debt ratio at end 2009 will still be below the euro area average, which the EU Commission has forecast will be 77.7% in 2009.

This was supplemented by bi-monthly Expenditure Management Reports from the Departments of Social & Family Affairs, Health & Children, Justice, Equality & Law Reform and Education & Science from 2003.  Departments with capital expenditure in excess of €250 million were required to report on their capital expenditure on a bi-monthly basis from 2005.  Following a streamlining exercise, the Departments of Transport and Environment, Heritage & Local Government will give detailed reports on capital expenditure from 2009.Total expenditure in 2009, as published in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2009 on 23 April 2009, is estimated to be €63.9 billion in gross terms, or €47.4 billion in net terms.

This was activated on receipt of a public health alert from the WHO on Friday, 24th April 2009 indicating that human cases of influenza type A (H1N1) virus infection had been identified.  As part of this response, the HSE has put in place arrangements to distribute antivirals through public health departments for the treatment of initial cases of Influenza A(H1N1) and their close contacts.  Detailed guidance has also issued to Public Health Doctors and G.P.'s for the management of persons who may have influenza A(H1N1) by the HSE.Since the outbreak there has been good cooperation from public health doctors in dealing with the influenza outbreak and it is anticipated that this will continue.  The Labour Relations Commission has now brokered an agreement between the HSE and the IMO on a structured out-of-hours public health service.  I am advised that the Irish Medical Organisation will ballot its senior public health doctor membership this week on the agreement, and a favourable outcome should result in the service being implemented from the beginning of June.I have requested that the HSE reply directly to you on operational matters.

#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	716	I propose to take Questions Nos. 164 and 165 together.The Deputy will be aware that the Irish Thalidomide Association (ITA) has met with my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children and Department officials, to discuss a review of the lump sum compensation and monthly allowance provided by the State.  The Association has been informed that, having examined the issues outlined in the ITA submission, the Minister has decided to ask the State Claims Agency to assess the Association's requests in the context of Irish and International provisions for victims of thalidomide and in the context of Irish case law and precedent; and to advise the Minister accordingly.  Any proposal which comes out of this process will need to be considered by Government in view of the State's current financial circumstances and the possible consequences for other State compensation payments.  The Association will be kept informed of progress on the matter.With regard to the Deputy's specific question regarding the monthly allowance paid to individual victims of thalidomide, this monthly allowance for life was granted by the Irish Government in 1975 and is administered by the Department of Health and Children.  In 1975 the monthly allowance was up to €95; in 2009 the monthly amount is up to €1,100.  It is tax-free; it is not reckonable for State benefits and each individual recipient has a medical card.In relation to the claim that the payments have not been increased, the Deputy might wish to note that the payments have increased each year.  On average, payments are ahead of the 1975 payments at a rate of 2.5% per annum above the Consumer Price Index.  At a total level, the current value of past payments, including the lump sum and monthly allowance, range from €186,000 for recipients of the minimum payment to €568,000 for recipients of the maximum payment.  Since the early 1990's, the annual increases in the allowance are in line with general social welfare increases applied to payments administered by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are no plans to discontinue this link or to abolish the allowance.Payment of a Christmas Bonus to certain social welfare payment recipients and certain schemes operated by the Department of Health and Children, including the monthly allowance to thalidomide sufferers, has been granted by way of an annual Government decision, approval for which is sought by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  I have been advised by that Department that the decision to discontinue funding for the Christmas Bonus is in line with the Government objective of restoring order and stability in the public finances.

The Report recommends the closure of all psychiatric hospitals and the reinvestment of the resources released by these closures in mental health services.  It emphasises that this process should take place on a phased basis with wards closing sequentially; hospitals can only close when the clinical needs of the remaining patients have been addressed in more appropriate settings such as community residences, day hospitals and day centres.The HSE has developed a strategy for the phased closure of the remaining hospitals and the relocation of patients to community based accommodation in line with the recommendations of ‘A Vision for Change'.  In these circumstances the question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.

A significant number of capital grant applications, including that of the applicant in question, were due to be considered for approval in the latter part of 2008.As the Deputy will be aware it became necessary at that point to review Government expenditure, particularly in regard to new expenditure commitments.  This process was finalised last month and all capital grant applicants under the NCIP were advised that funding could not be approved at this point under the programme.  The capital allocation available to the NCIP is sufficient to meet existing capital grant commitments but is not expected to allow for the approval of any additional grant applications in 2009 or 2010.

It recommended that the hospital should be in Dublin and should, ideally, be co-located with a leading adult academic hospital.  Following detailed consideration, it was decided that the most appropriate location for the new National Paediatric Hospital is at the Mater Hospital.The hospital will also include an associated Ambulatory and Urgent Care Centre at Tallaght which is to open in advance of the new hospital.  This Centre will offer a wide range of services including urgent care consultations, outpatient services and day surgery.  This will ensure that many children who do not require admission can continue to access care locally.There are no plans to review the decision regarding the location of the hospital. The decision was reached after an objective, transparent analysis, and the Government is committed to proceeding with the project as a priority.

This funding included monies to provide new and enhanced services for people with disabilities, to implement Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005, which came into effect on June 1st 2007 for the under fives and also for the continuation of the implementation of the transfer of persons with intellectual disability from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements.The Government also honoured its promise in relation to the multi-annual investment programme for people with disabilities, with a further €50 million investment in the 2008 budget.  The Government emphasised its commitment to people with disabilities by allocating an additional €10 million in budget 2009 to enable the services provided to children with special educational needs to be enhanced and strengthened.The additional €10 million allocated to the HSE will provide for 125 additional therapy posts in the disability and mental health services, targeted at children of school-going age.  Of this, an additional 90 posts will be provided in the disability services area, to include speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists for children's disability services.  There will be 35 additional posts for the child and adolescent mental health services, including clinical psychologists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and social workers for new and existing multi-disciplinary teams.In relation to the figures for expenditure, I have referred the Deputy's question to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.

A list of RTP groups is available on the Pobal website at www.pobal.ie.Funding of €11 million is being provided by my Department for the RTP in 2009, an increase of €1 million on the provision for 2008.  My Department has no role in relation to the day to day management of the Programme, including the allocation of specific funds to particular groups or for services.The bottom-up approach which was developed during the pilot Rural Transport Initiative demonstrated that local communities know best where the transport needs are in their rural areas and how best to address those needs. In line with that approach, RTP groups are, therefore, responsible for deciding on the specific services to be provided and the methods of provision.

In general, the timescales for the various elements of the Plan are expected to be completed by 2015.Significant resources for public transport accessibility are being provided under Transport 21, the Government's public transport capital investment framework for the period 2006 — 2015. Accessibility is being built into new public transport infrastructure projects and funding is also being provided to continue the phased retrofit of existing infrastructure.Transport Access for All promotes the principle of mainstreaming by requiring accessibility to be an integral element of the public transport services. Arising from this, accessibility features are now incorporated into rail rolling stock and buses funded by the Exchequer and into rail stations and bus depots from the design stage and cannot be readily identified and costed. In addition there is expenditure on the retrofitting of public transport projects.  The allocation for this year is €20 million.

Specific areas identified as places where young drivers congregate are targeted. As a result, uniform members of An Garda Síochána, supported by Divisional Traffic Corps personnel, establish checkpoints and enforce in a highly visible manner the provisions of the Road Traffic Acts.These initiatives have resulted in detections being made for a wide range of road traffic offences, including offences relating to dangerous driving, careless driving, no silencer fitted, L plates not displayed, identification plates not conforming with legislation, road tax offences, insurance and driving licence offences, speeding offences, dangerously defective vehicles and modified vehicles. Offences detected are dealt with by way  of prosecution, fixed charge notice or, where appropriate, through the Juvenile Diversion Programme.All uniform members of An Garda Síochána are tasked with enforcing the relevant legislative provisions. Regular mobile patrols take place and roving checkpoints are established throughout the Garda Divisions.In addition websites are monitored so as to establish where such anti-social activities are taking place with a view to providing an appropriate response.

The intention is to publish the Bill in this Session.The principal focus of the new Bill will be on ensuring good governance of property management companies and similar bodies which comprise the owners of units within multi-unit developments and which exercise management functions in relation to such developments. It will also include provisions for the resolution of disputes arising in relation to such matters. The range of services to be provided, and the extent of such provision, are matters to be decided by the property management company based on the agreement of the unit owners who make up the company.

Following his release the person concerned made a request to re-enter the State. This request was refused by my Department. However, it would appear that, on an unknown date, the person concerned re-entered the State illegally. The status of the applicant in the State is currently being assessed and he will be contacted directly and notified of any decision made in this regard.

The Citizenship Division is currently commencing further processing of applications received in late 2007. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average while an element of straight forward cases are now being dealt with in less than that time scale.There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that the status of citizenship is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	772	The position is that under the terms of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990 the Defence Force Representative Associations are prohibited from being associated with or affiliated to any trade unions or any other body without the consent of the Minister.  Accordingly, the Representative Associations, RACO and PDFORRA cannot be affiliated to ICTU at present.  A similar arrangement applies to the Garda Síochána Representative Associations.The basis for the prohibition is that it would be inappropriate to apply the provision of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 to members of the Defence Forces.  The taking of any form of industrial action is felt to be irreconcilable with military service.  As has been done in the past, the Defence Forces may be called on to contribute to maintaining vital services in times of industrial action.  The potential for serious difficulties could arise in these circumstances if the Associations were affiliated to ICTU.A number of mechanisms have been put in place through the Defence Forces Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme to compensate for the prohibition on affiliation to ICTU.  These provide the Representative Associations with structures and processes, which enable them to make representations and negotiate on behalf of their members.  In addition a framework exists which facilitates the Associations engaging with the official side in talks parallel to those taking place between the Social Partners at National level.  This parallel process was operated in respect of the discussions at National level on the Framework for a Pact for Stabilisation, Social Solidarity and Economic Renewal over the recent past.

However, given that the correlation between ECB rates and interbank rates (i.e. the rates at which the Agency itself borrows) is atypical and volatile at present, the Agency, in responding to movements in ECB rates, must give careful consideration, on each occasion, to the fluctuating relationship between its lending rates and the cost of funds.As with previous rate reductions, it will be necessary closely to monitor the impact of the cut on interbank rates before a decision can be made in respect of the most recent ECB decision.  I anticipate that, in common with the situation following the previous cuts which were passed on in full to local authority borrowers, the position in relation to possible movement in the HFA's lending rates should be clear within a number of weeks.The HFA notified local authorities last month of its decision to pass on, in full, the 0.25% decrease announced by the ECB on 2 April.  The effective rate for local authority borrowers from 1 June 2009 is 2.25% — a cumulative rate decrease since October 2008 of 3%.

It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register.Authorities were required to publish the Final Register for 2009/10 by 1 February 2009 and this is now available for checking.  Applications for entry in the Final Register which were made in the course of its compilation did not require attendance at a Garda station.Individuals not on the Register can avail of the supplement to the Register up until 15 days before the next polling day (i.e. applications must be with the authority not later than Monday 18 May in the case of the Local and European elections and Dáil Bye-Elections being held on 5 June 2009).  Electoral law provides that each application for entry to the supplement to the Register must be signed in the applicant's local Garda station in the presence of a member of the Garda Síochána, who must first be satisfied as to the person's identity before signing, dating and stamping the form.  The Garda may request photographic identification.  Where the applicant is unable to go to the local Garda station, and sets out the reason in writing, the form can be signed in the presence of an official of their registration authority.  Again, photographic identification may be required.If neither option is viable due to physical illness or physical disability, the application form must be accompanied by a medical certificate.I consider that the current arrangements strike a reasonable balance between having a flexible supplement facility and, at the same time, ensuring that there are adequate measures in place to counteract any possible abuse.

The Department supports the authorities through the setting of general policy and the provision of capital funding including the recoupment (within the overall funding available) of costs incurred by the authorities in relation to the purchase of fire appliances.Proposals are currently under consideration for inclusion in the 2009 capital programme (€20 million) having regard to each fire authority's priorities, the existing facilities available, the level of activity and the totality of demands from fire authorities in relation to the resources available.  There is no application in my Department from Dublin City Council for funding for the fire appliances referred to in the question.  I understand, however, that the fire authority will shortly be taking delivery of a hydraulic platform and has recently taken delivery of two fire appliances.

On 23 April 2009, I announced that the Government have decided not to proceed with the implementation of electronic voting in Ireland.  A process will now be put in place, including discussions with the supplier, to address the disposal of the electronic voting and counting equipment and termination of storage arrangements.My Department engaged consultants with valuation expertise in May 2007, following a competitive tendering process, to examine individual lease arrangements and to make recommendations as to termination of the leases where appropriate.  In May 2008, I accepted the recommendations made by the consultants and these recommendations are in the process of being implemented.  It is expected that, in certain instances, the termination of lease arrangements will give rise to buy-out costs and these will be dependent upon the outcome of negotiations. Work on the termination of local lease arrangements will now continue in the context of the decision taken to conclude the electronic voting and counting project.Based on information provided to my Department by Returning Officers, the total annual costs for storage of the electronic voting equipment for the various locations are set out in the following table.In 2007, over 60% of the machines (4,762 in total) were moved from 12 local storage locations to a central storage facility located at Gormanston Army Camp.  Costs incurred to date in respect of the movement and storage of this equipment are some €328,000.  These were largely one-off expenses, and there are no ongoing rental costs.County/CityAnnual Storage Costs (incl. VAT)Annual Storage Costs (incl. VAT)Annual Storage Costs (incl.

However, a Road Safety programme for Transition Year has been developed by the Road Safety Authority in collaboration with my Department, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and the Second level Support Service and has been offered nationally as an option since September 2008, following a successful pilot in 2007/8.  The programme is available in twenty hour and forty-five hour units. It features inputs from agencies such as the ambulance service, fire service and An Garda Síochána, as well as providing for visiting speakers, trips out of school, projects and case studies.The programme provides for an introduction to road safety for pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists and motorists, and covers such issues as seatbelts and airbags, driver fatigue, drink/drug driving, enforcement, basic first aid at road crashes, emergency services and rehabilitation. The programme is also supported by digital resources, including DVD support and access to international websites on road safety issues. Relevant Driver Theory Test learning is included at the end of each module.  The programme does not include driving lessons.In addition, the Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) programme, which is mandatory in primary schools and at junior cycle level, provides a framework under which the generic values and skills which underpin responsible decision-making, and respect for the rights and safety of others, can be developed and promoted among students. SPHE has a specific personal safety strand within the programme, and this provides a mechanism through which road safety issues for all can be best dealt with in an age appropriate way.  Road safety programmes have been developed by the Road Safety Authority at primary and junior cycle level for this purpose.

I have consistently said that the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared. The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements. My Department has also followed with guidance to schools in the form of new circulars in the areas such as the allocation of language support teachers and also the new interim arrangements for substitution cover.  These circulars are available on my Department's website.  Even with the Budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.I fully accept that these decisions are not of themselves desirable and that they can only be justified by the imperative of securing the future economic stability of the country. I have called for co-operation from all the education partners in meeting the challenges facing us both as an education community and as a country.

Having considered these factors decisions will be taken on the means by which emerging needs will be met within an area.  Post-primary accommodation requirements for the Derrinturn area will be considered in this regard.

The further consideration of the proposed site acquisition and any subsequent building project for the school will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	805	I wish to point out that, despite the escalating costs of the service from €109.8 million in 2004 to €192 million in 2009 or 75%, charges for school transport had not been increased from 1998 until the third school term in the 2007/08 school year.  A further increase was put in place at the start of the 2008/09 school year and the new charges come into effect from September 2009.In the overall context and in order to minimise the overall effects, these charge increases have been confined to the 55,000 eligible post-primary and children availing of concessionary transport. Charges continue to be waived in the case of eligible post-primary children (or over 22,300 children) where the family is in possession of a valid medical card. Eligible children attending primary schools and children with special needs (or 54,500 children) will still travel free. A maximum family rate of €650 will also be applied.Parents are also being given the option of spreading the amount due over two payments payable in July and December 2009. Those who pay the full annual charge, in advance, will benefit from a ticket being issued for the school year and this includes pupils on concessionary travel.The total contribution of charges from parents in 2009 will still only represent about 8.6% of the overall expenditure for school transport.  Taking into all the factors outlined, it is not envisaged that there will be a reduction in the annual charge system, the estimated expenditure or a change in the payment arrangements. My Department has also commenced a Value for Money Review of the School Transport Scheme which is due to be completed before the end of the year.

Its elements include — the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, 2004, the Disability Act, 2005 and its associated Sectoral Plans published in 2006 by six Government Departments, the Citizens Information Act, 2007 and a commitment to a multi-annual investment programme for disability support services.The Deputy will be aware that although my Department does not have a Sectoral Plan under the Disability Act, appropriate education services are supported as a central element in the Government commitment to supporting those with special educational needs/disability.This support is provided across a wide spectrum of initiatives within the education sector. At school level, in addition to the teachers provided in the classroom, significant additional supports are also provided to enable schools to cater for the needs of students with special educational needs. Such supports include additional resource teaching support, special needs assistant support, special transport arrangements, enhanced capitation and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment.When the overall annual spend in 2009 to support persons with special educational needs is considered, my Department will spend an estimated €1bn in total by the end of this year. The equivalent spends for 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 and 2008 are €468m, €605m, €706m and €838m and over €900m respectively. With these levels of investment, it is clear that significant progress has been made in educational provision for people with special needs in recent years. This progress has been achieved through the additional investments made by successive Ministers for Education. Advances in the level of dedicated provision to support children with special educational needs include:Schools are now allocated extra resource teachers and special needs assistants to enable them meet the special educational needs of students. In the region of 19,000 staff in our schools work solely with children with special needs.Special Needs Assistant posts have increased from under 300 in 1997 to over 10,000 in 2009.Primary schools are staffed up-front with additional teachers to cater for the most prevalent special educational needs — removing the need for assessments and delays in recruitment.The level of training available to teachers has improved significantly. The establishment of the Special Education Support Service to provide expert support, professional development and training opportunities in special education for school staff has been very significant. In 2008, the service was in contact with over 23,000 teachers. The range of post-graduate professional training programmes available to professionals in the special needs area has also significantly expanded.The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) aims to support the personal, social and educational development of all children through the application of psychological theory and practice in education, having particular regard for children with special educational needs.The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) was established to co-ordinate the delivery of services for children with special needs. The NCSE is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers, for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support children with special needs.Assistive technology, specialist equipment, building adaptations and special school transport arrangements continue to be provided as necessary.  As announced on Budget day, in the current financial circumstances it is not possible to proceed with full implementation of the EPSEN Act in 2010 as originally envisaged. Government will keep the matter under review and is committed to the full implementation of EPSEN at the earliest possible date.I am particularly pleased that, in order to strengthen and enhance services, and continue the preparation for the full implementation of the Act at a later date, the Government provided €20m in 2009 — €10m for education services and €10m for health services.In my Department this additional funding will provide for an expansion of the NEPS service so that all schools in the country will be covered by the service as well as enhancing the capacity of the NCSE to co-ordinate the provision of services to children with special educational needs. In addition teachers and special needs assistants will continue to be deployed to schools to meet children's needs and there will be further investment in teacher training in this area.
