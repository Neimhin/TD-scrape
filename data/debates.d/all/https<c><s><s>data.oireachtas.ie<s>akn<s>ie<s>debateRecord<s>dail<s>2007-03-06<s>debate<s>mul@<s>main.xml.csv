#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.The procedures I outlined to the House previously in respect of the use of the ministerial air transport service, most recently on 26 January 2005, have not changed.  The position is that my approval is required prior to the service being used.  Procedurally, requests for the use of the service are made to my office by Ministers' private secretaries and dealt with, in the first instance, by the staff of that office.  Requests are examined by my staff with regard to the need for and purpose of travel, the destination and other logistical details.  Any necessary clarification or further information is sought at this point.  All screened requests are then submitted to me for my consideration and approval, if deemed appropriate.  Once approved, all operational matters are settled directly between the office of the Minister in question and the Department of Defence or the Air Corps.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I thank the Taoiseach for outlining the procedures involved.  Where are the Government jets normally housed?  Are they in a hangar at Baldonnel or Dublin Airport?  Will the Taoiseach tell the House the number of occasions in 2006 on which the jets travelled from Baldonnel to Dublin Airport?  These are short hop trips which add to their wear and tear.  There is a perception that the Taoiseach and the line-up of exalted Ministers do not need to travel on the M50 and put up with the traffic jams, unlike the rest of us.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	3	Why is it not normal procedure for Ministers, exalted and absent, to travel to Baldonnel to make use of the facilities of the ministerial air transport service from there, as distinct from having the jets fly from Baldonnel to Dublin Airport in order that Ministers can be whisked away to exotic places to do business for Ireland?  That is the perception.  I am not saying the Taoiseach would not love to be stuck in traffic in the middle of the M50.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	7	The Minister, Deputy O'Dea, has other ways of going.  It might be no harm if some of the people concerned had to contend with the reality of everyday travel on the ground, so to speak.Where are the jets housed?  How many times do they have to travel from Baldonnel to Dublin Airport for the purpose of picking up Ministers flying away to change the world?  Will the Taoiseach make it part of the procedures that Ministers should be encouraged or instructed by him to be driven to Baldonnel before flying away to do business for Ireland?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	8	The MATS aircraft are housed at Baldonnel.  I suggest the Deputy direct a question to the Minister for Defence.  Practically all flights arrive at or depart from Baldonnel.  A high proportion take off from Baldonnel and a smaller number from Dublin Airport.  Those that take off from Dublin Airport do so for a variety of logistical, operational or safety reasons, including the needs of the travelling party but it is rare occurrence.  My colleagues use Baldonnel in practically every case.  They usually leave so early in the morning when travelling to Brussels that they do not encounter problems with traffic.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	9	The Taoiseach has never been on the M50 at 6 a.m.  Regarding the use of the Government jet and the example of the British Government, does the Taoiseach have a protocol in place for engaging in carbon offsetting?  Will he provide statistics regarding his use of the Government jet?  How often is it flown from Baldonnel and Dublin Airport?  I understand one of the operational reasons for flying from Dublin Airport is that the runway at Baldonnel is not long enough to take long-haul aircraft.  I invite the Taoiseach to clarify whether this is a reason.  Is the Government considering implementing a protocol regarding the use of the Government jet for journeys within the State and other more appropriate forms of transport where they are available?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	10	Most long-haul flights such as those to the United States usually leave from Dublin Airport, while shorter journeys such as those to Britain commence from Baldonnel.  I fly from both Baldonnel and Dublin Airport.  If I am returning late at night, I prefer to land at Dublin Airport, as it is located five minutes from my home but otherwise I do not really care.  Most flights usually leave from Baldonnel.  There are not as many flights within the State.  We used to use the helicopter service a lot in earlier years but I do not do so, for personal reasons.  I do not use the landing pad because I do not like it.  I have never used the landing pad in Government Buildings, and I do not use the——

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I am.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	16	It is a good job Ireland won against England because they lost against France and Munster lost in Thomond when the Taoiseach was there.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	17	Others were, so I declined my use of helicopters and have not resumed it, except on rare occasions.With regard to the British example, it is not a fair comparison.  When the British go to the European Council on Thursday, they will bring two full jets with 500 staff.  We will bring one jet with a dozen staff.  With regard to our energy efficiency plans, we are not doing anything other than being helpful to the environment in so far as aviation is concerned.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	20	——including when it comes to the environment.  Is it the case, as is reported, that the jet takes off from Baldonnel and lands again at Dublin Airport to collect the Taoiseach because that is more convenient?  Has the Taoiseach concerns about his carbon footprint?  I noticed he was in Galway recently to talk about climate change.  Is it the most efficient use of Government transport that, rather than shoot over the West Link bridge and out to Baldonnel, like the rest of us, the jet leaves Baldonnel and calls at Dublin Airport to collect the Taoiseach, and has him back for canvassing in no time at all?  Would it not be better to go to Baldonnel in the first instance?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	21	If I did so, the Deputy would probably accuse me of being in his constituency again.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	22	The Taoiseach is always welcome to my constituency.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I do come into Dublin Airport — there is no doubt about that.  I am not a great user of the Government jet.  As the Deputy knows, some of my colleagues have far more reason to do so.  Most of my use is in regard to the European Council meetings.The wear and tear issue came up a number of years ago.  The Air Corps advised me that the wear and tear on the aircraft as a consequence of operating in an out of Dublin is impossible to quantify — it is just wear and tear, and does not make a lot of difference.I rather arrive back into Dublin Airport for a number of reasons, but sometimes I do not do this.  I flew out of Baldonnel last week when I travelled to the UK and I sometimes fly back into Baldonnel.  Frankly, I am more interested in where I land at my destination.  When I go to the UK, I try to land at the military airport because it is far nearer to London and far more convenient.  There is a not a great difference.  If it is late at night, I rather come into Dublin Airport.If I am going to Northern Ireland, as I have over the years, I would nearly drive there in the time it takes to get to and from Baldonnel.  I often do drive to Northern Ireland, but I then have to go through the rigmarole of changing, which we all have to do, which creates its own bureaucracy.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	24	The train is the job for Belfast.  It is a great service.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	25	Yes.  When I was in Galway recently, I drove back, so I did not have any effect on the carbon footprint.It does not create any great difficulty for the Air Corps to fly across to Dublin Airport.

Does the Taoiseach agree it would be far cheaper for the Minister, and the Government in general, to use Aer Arann or take other direct flights rather than using the Government jet?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	32	The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, extensively uses Aer Arann, as do a number of my colleagues.

He would not request nor, under the procedures, be allowed the use of the jet, or the Lear jet, for going to Farranfore.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	37	I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 11, inclusive, together.Mr. Patrick MacEntee SC, QC, was appointed as sole member of a commission of investigation to examine specific matters relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974, including aspects of the Garda investigation and missing documentation.  On 12 February last Mr. MacEntee wrote to my Department to inform me that he required further additional time to complete his work.As Members will be aware, Mr. MacEntee has now sought eight extensions to his original timeframe.  On each occasion, Mr. MacEntee informed me that additional time was required for him to deal properly and thoroughly with the issues under investigation by him.  It seems clear from his interim reports that he has uncovered important information relating to his terms of reference.  For that reason, it is important that he be allowed sufficient time to complete his work.On this particular occasion, Mr. MacEntee has informed me that the commission has completed its investigative work and is in the final statutory stages of the investigation.  The extension is required by the commission due to the need to take proper account of the statutory position and interests of persons and entities who assisted the commission during the investigation.  This is essential work which Mr. MacEntee must carry out in order to comply with the Commissions of Investigation Act.  The Act sets out a number of steps to be completed prior to the submission of the final report and the winding up of the commission.  These include sending drafts of relevant sections of the report to people who are identified in it, and hearing their observations.As required under the Commissions of Investigation Act, Mr. MacEntee furnished me with an interim report along with his most recent request for an extension.  I brought this eighth interim report to the attention of the Government and, as with previous such reports, I have published it.  I have also laid a copy in the Oireachtas Library.I now expect to receive his final report on 13 March 2007.  It is my intention to publish the report as soon as possible after it is received.  However, I am required by law to consider certain issues prior to publication.  This is likely to involve requesting legal advice from the Attorney General.  I will also submit it to the Cabinet prior to publication.  The timescale involved between receipt of the report and publication is impossible to estimate in advance but I certainly wish to publish the report as quickly as possible.  If at all possible, I will do so while the House is sitting, before the Easter break.The report of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland is deeply disturbing.  Its findings are of the utmost gravity.  I raised the serious issues in the report with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, when I met with him in London on 30 January.  Over many years, successive Irish Governments, and many others, have raised serious concerns about collusion in Northern Ireland.  Mrs. O'Loan's report demonstrates that these concerns were well founded.  It presents clear evidence that members of the RUC colluded with loyalist murderers and failed in their duty to prevent many horrific crimes. Behind this report lie many personal stories of lives lost and lives shattered.  I wish to express my sympathy to the families of the victims at this distressing time.  I met Raymond McCord Snr. in recent months.  I applaud his single-minded determination and courage, which helped to ensure that the truth would be told and that these grievous failures were brought to light in a comprehensive and detailed way.  It is essential that justice be done, and be seen to be done, in these cases.  In the face of such a damning report, follow-up action and reassurance is essential.The report shows why police reform was so essential in Northern Ireland.  All fair-minded people will acknowledge the reforms that have taken place in recent years and that have made a real and visible difference to policing in Northern Ireland.  I commend the Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman for her tenacity and determination.  Her report shows that the Patten accountability and oversight mechanisms are robust and do work.  This must remain a vital part of the reformed policing arrangements in Northern Ireland.  Inclusive support by all for reformed policing in Northern Ireland must be the way of the future.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	38	The Taoiseach is aware that the MacEntee inquiry was established to investigate why Garda investigations were wound down in 1974 following the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and why certain leads were not followed up, including information relating to a person who stayed at the Four Courts Hotel between 15 and 17 May of that year and his contacts with the UVF and information relating to a British Army corporal who was allegedly sighted in Dublin at the time of the bombings.  Mr. MacEntee is a very eminent person.  Will the Taoiseach clarify the nature of the statutory requirements that must be complied with as a result of the request for an eighth extension?  Surely Mr. MacEntee, the sole person involved in directing the inquiry, and the Government are aware of the need for compliance with statutory requirements in the context of time.  Was the most recent extension requested to facilitate the interviewing of certain other persons who it was not thought necessary to interview when previous requests for extensions were made and would the latter have necessitated compliance with further statutory requirements?  Is the Taoiseach satisfied that this will be the final request for an extension and that the final report will be made available to him in or around 13 March?  Have the Taoiseach and the Government contacted the families of the victims to prepare them for the publication of the report?  How will the report's publication be dealt with and what will be the extent of that publication?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	39	Some of the earlier extensions related to the fact that Mr. MacEntee sought additional information which, in many cases, he obtained.  The position relating to the most recent interim report is different because he stated that the commission of investigation has completed its investigative task and that the further period is required to deal with the final mandatory statutory stages of the investigation.  Mr. MacEntee also indicated that the commission is bringing its investigation to an end in accordance with the provisions of Part 5 of the Commissions of Investigation Act.  The latter sets out a number of steps to be completed prior to the submission of the final report — which will lead to the commission being wound up — and these include sending drafts of the relevant sections of the report to people who are identified in the report and hearing their observations, administrative arguments relating to the winding up of the commission and the transfer of its archive to the specified Minister.  I have accepted Mr. MacEntee's view that he needs time to comply with the steps to which I refer.As the House is aware, Mr. MacEntee sought eight extensions to the original timeframe.  On each occasion he informed me that additional time was required for him to deal properly and thoroughly with the issues under investigation by him.  It seems clear from his interim report that he has uncovered important information relating to his terms of reference.  I do not know how voluminous that information is but it is correct that we should grant him the time required to conclude his work.We have granted an extension to 13 March.  I expect to receive the final report at that time, if not exactly on that day.  It is my intention to publish that report as soon as possible but, as I stated in the reply, I must consider certain issues prior to publication which arose in the other reports as well where we would have to get legal advice.  I must submit it to the Cabinet as well.  On the timescale, I hope it will not take too long but I cannot make a judgment on that until we see what is in his report.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	40	I welcome the news that the MacEntee investigation has been completed.  I presume the Taoiseach would acknowledge that the more quickly the report is published, the better.  It was this period that led to the recent controversy on the Dean Lyons report, while it was presumably circulating among people who featured in it or on whom it reflected adversely.  Does the Taoiseach have a modus operandi in mind?  Will he publish it through the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women’s Rights or how is it likely to be put into the public domain?In respect of the Nuala O'Loan report into the murder of Raymond McCord junior and exposing the collusion that went on between the RUC special branch and certain loyalist paramilitaries, does the Taoiseach acknowledge that this case is the worst of all the cases we have experienced over 30 years?  As he stated, we owe a great debt of gratitude to Raymond McCord senior who selflessly, and sometimes under physical threat, maintained his campaign to have these matters inquired into.The Taoiseach stated that justice must be done and be seen to be done, and I ask him to state what he means by that.  Given he recorded that he met the British Prime Minister and raised these matters with him, what was the character of the response he got from the British Prime Minister?  Is the Taoiseach stating that he is satisfied that those responsible for these atrocities, and for collusion in the knowledge and permitting of them, are likely to be prosecuted?  Would he agree that in the event that they are not prosecuted, most law abiding citizens on both parts of this island would be shocked?  What are the real prospects of prosecutions?  Has he any reason to believe, from his interaction with the British authorities, that there will be prosecutions for these atrocities?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	41	On the report of Mr. MacEntee SC, I agree with Deputy Rabbitte.  The quicker we can clear the report for publication, the better.  However, I must go through those statutory procedures.  With the report of a committee of investigation, I need not go through the select committee.  On the Barron reports, I had to go through the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights.  The Government can clear the report of a committee of investigation for publication.On the O'Loan report on the McCord case, and for that matter a number of the other cases although Deputy Rabbitte's question was mainly on Raymond McCord senior, I agree with Deputy Rabbitte and I applaud Mr. McCord's single-minded determination and courage which helped ensure that the truth would be told about the grievous failures brought to light in a comprehensive and detailed way.  As Deputy Rabbitte correctly noted, I stated justice should be done and seen to be done in these cases.  It is a damning report and follow-up action is required on the part of the British Government.  We have highlighted in our meeting of 30 January the areas in which we believe follow-up action is required.The difference between the Raymond McCord case, with which the Deputy is very familiar from his involvement in it, and the others is that it is recent.  In many of the others we were dealing with past events, although, as I have said to relatives time out of number, I do not say that is an excuse for not following up issues.  The historical enquiries team is doing this.  The difference is that the McCord case is much more recent and the people concerned are still in the system.  The O'Loan report highlights the cases in question and the specific issues and people involved.  Some of those concerned have since retired but many remain in the Police Service of Northern Ireland.  Like Nuala O'Loan, we have urged that follow up action be taken in respect of these individuals.  I know this is happening both within the Northern Ireland Office and the British system.  We will have to wait and see whether there will be prosecutions but the report demonstrates there is clear evidence that the RUC colluded with loyalist murderers and failed in its duty to prevent horrific crimes.  Obviously, the position of the Government and everybody who has looked at this matter is that the British Government has to follow up the issues involved.  It has a clear report which resulted from an investigation of its records and files and the issues raised with Nuala O'Loan.  We now have and see what action it will take.The taking of prosecutions is one part of the matter.  The other is that, while there have been huge reforms in the system under the Patten report, as I acknowledged in my earlier reply, Nuala O'Loan has also highlighted many areas where appropriate action on accountability measures remains to be taken in order to prevent any of these events recurring.  I have spoken directly to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Peter Hain, about these issues, as has the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and when I met him a few weeks ago, we went through them again.I have raised with the Prime Minister what many of the families have asked for.  The views of the families vary.  Some want to legally pursue these issues but many others do not want to embark on a legal process.  They want a clear apology from the British Government and are not interested in continuing forever.  They know what happened and are not surprised because they always believed there was collusion.  We have pursued this issue with the Prime Minister and have gone through a number of ways by which we think the interests and wishes of the families can be met.  I hope he will deal with some of the issues raised in the coming weeks.  He is mindful of the need to deal with them and has been devoting a degree of effort to them.  The difficulty is that an apology of this nature will not satisfy all of the families; some will not accept it, while others want to follow their own route.  However, it would satisfy many of them.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	42	The Taoiseach might agree that it would be appropriate for the House to pay tribute to the quality of work done by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland who has demonstrated remarkable integrity, tenacity and assiduousness in pursuing difficult and complex matters.  We ought to acknowledge this and express the hope that when our own version, the Ombudsman Commission, is eventually up and running, it will operate with the credibility Ms O'Loan has brought to her role in Northern Ireland, although I do not wish to imply it will have to investigate similar cases.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	43	Is the Taoiseach confident this is the final postponement Mr. MacEntee will seek in making his report?  Does he have an indicative date for the publication of the report?With regard to the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland's report on Raymond McCord and the probable findings of the MacEntee commission, might there be grounds for a British-Irish summit dedicated to the issue of collusion between paramilitaries and the security forces?  That might be the best mechanism so that families who have been victims of such collusion can avoid going through a lengthy legal process or commission process and, instead, receive direct statements of regret from the British Government regarding this practice.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	44	We have had many meetings about the reports on collusion, particularly those conducted by Mr. Justice Barron into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, the murder of Seamus Ludlow, the Dundalk bombings and others.  Many of the summits have dealt with the issue of collusion and a large part of all our meetings is about the public inquiry we are still seeking into the Finucane case so that Judge Cory's report and the agreement at Weston Park are followed up.  The British Government has been reluctant to do this, despite the support of this House, which voted through a resolution a year ago.  The issue is ongoing and the British Government has still not granted a public inquiry on the terms supported by this House and many other parliamentary assemblies, including the US Congress, and legal and other forums.I hope to receive the final MacEntee report next week and its publication will be based on the legal checks that have to be made but we are anxious not to delay it.  It is advisable that we try to publish it as quickly as possible.

That call received widespread support.  Will the Taoiseach reconsider his position on such a summit and seek a dedicated meeting on this issue with Prime Minister Blair before he stands down in the next number of months?When Mr. MacEntee's report is published, will the Taoiseach agree to a debate, or longer if required, in the House, as opposed to a short truncated hour or two hour debate, so that all Members can contribute on an issue that was tantamount to a declaration of war on this State?  Nuala O'Loan's report revealed how, in one small area of her investigation, members of the Mount Vernon UVF unit were used as auxiliaries by the RUC special branch to carry out numerous killings with its knowledge and consent.  Is the Taoiseach aware of the latest revelation by a former RUC detective who stated the RUC ran a senior UVF member, Colin Craig, as an agent in the Shankill Road UVF unit and that he told him in advance of the planned murder of taxi driver, Tommy Hughes, in July 1991, which was allowed to go ahead?In his meetings with the British Prime Minister and the DUP, has the Taoiseach asked if all the tonnes of weaponry imported from South Africa through a British agent, Brian Nelson, and others have been put beyond use?  These weapons, used to kill numerous people, were supplied to the Ulster Resistance, the paramilitary body that the DUP helped to set up and in which its members were prominent, particularly Ian Paisley and Peter Robinson.  What information has Tony Blair or Ian Paisley given the Taoiseach about these arms?  Does he accept republicans have taken huge risks in putting arms beyond use while there is no evidence that any of these Ulster Resistance weapons have been put beyond use?What follow up has there been to the Taoiseach's recent meeting with the family of Councillor Eddie Fullerton who was assassinated in County Donegal by British agents?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	46	On a separate summit and collusion, in the past year or two, a large part of all the summits has been on collusion.  Practically all the meeting on 30 January was on collusion.  There were a few other items but most of it was on Nuala O'Loan's report, the Finucane case and other cases.  We have continued to be very active on these issues as well as setting up the independent commission initially under the late Mr. Justice Hamilton and then under Mr. Justice Barron.  We have referred all Mr. Justice Barron's reports to the Oireachtas sub-committee which, in turn, has done a commendable job in hearing the evidence, not least of the bereaved, and it is reporting promptly with very clear recommendations.  We have acted on the recommendations of the Oireachtas sub-committee to date.On matters entirely within the remit of the Government or public bodies within this State, we have established the commission of investigation into the 1974 bombings under Mr. Paddy MacEntee.  When that work is complete, there are other issues relating to 1972 and 1973, the Ludlow murder and the bombings at Kay's Tavern, on which we will have to follow up.  Where appropriate, action has been taken by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda to recognise and address the shortcomings identified in these reports.In regard to some very important issues the co-operation of the British authorities is essential to the follow through.  This is true in the case of a suggestion for a public inquiry.  The Oireachtas sub-committee has recognised that as has the Government inquiry.  We have been using all the appropriate means and efforts to ensure co-operation.  We have raised the matter with the Prime Minister Mr. Blair on a number of occasions — back in early December and at the meeting at the end of January.  To a certain extent, our continuing pressure on the British would seem to have borne fruit in terms of the co-operation with Mr. MacEntee's investigation.  Clearly, we will have to wait for his final report.On the Nuala O'Loan report, we have followed all aspects of that through because it is a more recent report.  It is not the only one and we have highlighted all the issues and reports.  The Deputy mentioned some later information which I do not have.  However, I am sure it is being looked at by the Northern Ireland Office if it is in the public domain in Belfast.I met the family of Eddie Fullerton.  My office and officials have been following it through with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Garda because Councillor Fullerton was shot in this jurisdiction.  There is the allegation that people crossed back over the Border.  All those matters are being followed through for the family.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	47	The high level group on manufacturing has been established.  The terms of reference for the group, as set out in section 7 of part 1 of Towards 2016, are to review the challenges facing the manufacturing sector and having regard to initiatives currently under way, identify any further measures that would help to meet those challenges.  The group, membership of which is in accordance with the standard tripartite model for social partnership, comprises four representatives for each of the three main partners, namely, IBEC, ICTU and the Government.  The group is chaired by a senior industry representative who was appointed by me.  A full list of the members of the group will be furnished to the Deputy by my office.The first meeting of the group took place on 9 February and the next meeting is scheduled for 16 March.  While my Department is providing the secretariat for the group, it has been established under the auspices of the partnership process and is mandated to report on its deliberations to that forum.   In this context, it is a matter for the group to determine its schedule of meetings and timescale for reporting.Overall, manufacturing continues to be an important and integral part of the economy.  It provides inputs to other sectors of the economy and satisfies a broad range of final and intermediate demands.  In particular, high value manufacturing is a key driver of innovation and technological advance.  It increases opportunities for attracting and embedding research and development activities, collaboration with the higher education sector and stimulating networks.Many components of the more traditional manufacturing sectors such as engineering have also seen employment growth in recent years, indicating that the manufacturing sector throughout Ireland remains healthy.  While employment in some traditional sectors has declined, these jobs have been replaced with employment in higher value activities.  For example, the medical devices and pharmaceuticals sectors are thriving with high growth in employment and high levels of productivity.In the five years from 2000 to the end of 2005, slightly more than 31,000 jobs have been lost in manufacturing.  To put the decline in manufacturing employment in context, more than half a million new jobs have been created in Ireland since 1997.  The losses in manufacturing have been more than offset by job creation in services.  It should also be noted that the latest Central Statistics Office release on industrial employment of 28 December 2006 indicated an increase of 4,000 in the numbers employed in manufacturing in the quarter ending September 2006 relative to the same period in 2005.

Does he agree with the recent statements by the Central Bank and the Department of Finance to the effect that at present, no increase in export growth is taking place in our economy?  Moreover, does he agree with Mr. Joe Macri, managing director of Microsoft Ireland, who recently stated the only reason Microsoft was in Ireland was because of its low tax regime?

This was achieved despite adverse conditions in many markets, including currency rate changes.  It follows a long-standing trend of many years that was disrupted in the aftermath of the attacks on 11 September, as well as the bubble difficulties associated with the technology sector.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	61	As a percentage of world share exports have fallen from 1.5% to 1.4%.  However, there also have been changes in terms of the volume of world share.  Obviously, growth in the past decade has been extremely rapid and the National Competitiveness Council compares Ireland with a number of benchmarked countries.  This is important when preparing for the future and in ensuring that we provide the key ingredients to ensure our future competitiveness.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	62	I asked the Minister whether he agreed with those who advise him, namely, the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and Mr. Macri, who chairs the Small Business Forum.  He does not agree with them and considers everything to be great.In recent hours, there have been some rumours in respect of the Proctor and Gamble plant in Nenagh, County Tipperary.  If the Minister has any information in this regard, will he take this opportunity to indicate to Members whether there will be changes in the numbers employed there?  The workers at least expect clarification on this matter.  If the Minister has information available I am sure the House would be grateful.Regarding these matters generally, is the early warning system operated by the IDA still in place?  If so, is there any information we should know about this or rumours circulating about other facilities?  How soon will we be able to engage with those companies?  Is the Department or the IDA engaging with them to ensure the minimal amount of restructuring takes place in these plants in the context of employment?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	63	Mr. Hogan is correct to state the employees should be the first to be told by the company.  The company indicated it will make an announcement to the workers tomorrow morning.  We have been aware of the situation.  A study on the optimal solution for Procter and Gamble as a company with regard to its future production of cosmetics in the Nenagh region has been ongoing for approximately nine months.Engagement between the IDA and Procter and Gamble has been ongoing during that period.  The Deputy can take it that the input of the IDA is to support the retention of jobs at Nenagh.  We do not have specific details on the announcement to be made by the company tomorrow morning.  Today, the company indicated to the IDA its first priority is to communicate directly to the workers tomorrow morning.  In this situation, several scenarios are possible.  It would be unwise to pre-empt the announcement.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	64	What about the early warning system?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	65	The early warning system is in operation.  We continue to receive alerts.  In some instances they come through and in others they are averted.  The IDA has an ongoing programme of interacting with its client companies, particularly where it identifies areas that might be at risk, to see whether it can bring added and increased activities from other areas of a company's operations to Ireland.  We had very good success stories in this regard throughout the country.  Any decision is made by corporate headquarters at the company concerned.  We engage in dialogue with the company where possible and the early warning system alerts us to any potential difficulties.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	66	Section 2 of the Industrial Relations Act 2001 as amended provides that the Labour Court may, at the request of a trade union or excepted body, investigate a trade dispute where it is satisfied that,  inter alia, it is not the practice of the employer to engage in collective bargaining negotiations in respect of the group of workers party to the dispute and the internal dispute resolution procedures, if any, normally used by the parties concerned failed to resolve the dispute.The Supreme Court judgment in the case referred to by the Deputy arises from judicial review proceedings brought by Ryanair against a decision of the Labour Court in January 2005 to investigate, at the request of the IMPACT trade union, a dispute between the union and Ryanair concerning Dublin-based pilots.  Ryanair brought judicial review proceedings seeking to quash the Labour Court's decision on the grounds that the Labour Court did not have jurisdiction in the matter, in essence that the conditions for the investigation of a dispute in the section of the Act I quoted had not been met, and that the Labour Court had adopted unfair procedures in arriving at its decision.The High Court found in favour of the Labour Court in the matter.  However, on appeal the Supreme Court found in favour of Ryanair.  It ordered the Labour Court to again hear the case and apply the procedures and law as indicated in its judgment.  It is a matter for the Labour Court to proceed as indicated by the Supreme Court, however, I understand the court considered the Supreme Court judgment and arrangements are being made to hear the case again.  In the circumstances, it is prudent to exercise caution when commenting on this issue.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	67	Does the Minister regard the Chairman of the Labour Court as one of the most competent persons to hold the office?  He has legal qualifications in his own right as well as industrial relations experience.  When the Supreme Court judgment emanated, what was the reaction in the Department?  Will it in effect render the 2001 and 2004 legislation defunct if the Supreme Court's interpretation of that legislation is to prevail?The Minister of State indicated through the House that the Labour Court will try the case again.  However, it will do so with its hands behind its back based on the judgment of Mr. Justice Geoghegan.  He described the Labour Court decision as an impressive document in its structure and the manner in which it identified the issues.  He found the document betrayed "an understandable mind set in favour of the way particular expressions are used and particular activities are carried out by trade unions".  If that is not right-wing bias what is?  Does this ring alarm bells in the Department?  What contingency plans does the Minister of State have, if any, if this judgment prevails irrespective of what the Labour Court does outside the Supreme Court?We now have an interpretation of 2001 and 2004 legislation which completely changes the nature of the meaning of the Acts as passed in this House by the Government and as understood by the Labour Party.  The Supreme Court judgment stands independent of any outcome from the Labour Court regarding the specific case.  The law has been altered in its interpretation.  Whatever the Labour Court may adjudicate on the specific case, it will not change the standing of the judgment of the Supreme Court in interpreting legislation.  What are the legislative implications for workers, society and social partnership if the Supreme Court can tear up legislation as we understand it?
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	68	I agree with Deputy Quinn that the Chairman of the Labour Court is entirely competent, committed to his work and doing wonderful work on behalf of the State.  However, I understand in this instance the Supreme Court did not decide on the substantive issue.  It decided on a matter of procedure which I understand related to the manner of hearing evidence, which in essence is an internal matter for the Labour Court.  It is not the substantive issue as outlined by Deputy Quinn.  Pending the resolution at Labour Court level, which can only happen when the hearing is completed, it would be premature to draw any conclusions particularly those which Deputy Quinn fears may be the upshot of all of this.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	69	Under the Industrial Development Acts I am specifically precluded from giving directives to the industrial development agencies regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over another.IDA Ireland's strategy for achieving a better regional distribution of overseas mobile investment is to work in partnership with other stakeholders to present companies with credible alternatives which go as far as possible towards meeting their demands for critical mass in terms of population, skills and infrastructure.  In line with this strategy, and in agreement with South Tipperary County Development Board, IDA Ireland strategy for south Tipperary is to concentrate future economic development in Clonmel and develop the town as a first-class location for overseas investment.  Therefore, while no site visits by prospective overseas investors to Carrick-on-Suir were specifically hosted by IDA Ireland in 2006, the agency believes the town is very well located to capitalise on its position between Clonmel and the gateway city of Waterford, which are both approximately a 20 minute drive away.At present, south Tipperary has 12 IDA Ireland supported companies, employing approximately 2,027 people with a further 1,000 jobs to come on-stream over the next two to three years.  The key industry sector in the county is life sciences, which accounts for almost 60% of employment.  The presence of foreign direct investment companies within the region has knock-on benefits in sectors such as supply, distribution and transport, thus creating employment opportunities for local people.During the past three years Enterprise Ireland approved funding of more than €4.46 million and made payments of more than €2.2 million to client companies in south Tipperary.   The agency is actively engaged with 96 client companies in south Tipperary which employ a total of 2,717 people.The development of community based enterprise centres is a crucial part of the drive to create new regional enterprise.  Enterprise Ireland provided support of approximately €54,000 in 1998 to set up the enterprise centre in Carrick-on-Suir.  The management team of the Carrick-on-Suir community enterprise centre played a very active role in securing the establishment of Blarney Woollen Mills in the Tipperary Crystal facility.  This project is a major success and resulted in creating 30 new jobs in the area.  Further expansion of this project is now under way, and will result in additional new jobs for the area.The live register provides data on a county and local office of registration basis but it is not designed to measure unemployment.  It includes part-time workers as well as seasonal and casual workers entitled to job seekers allowance or benefit.  In the 12 month period to February 2007, the live register decreased by 4.7% in Carrick-on-Suir compared to a decrease of 0.1% in the south-east region and a similar decrease of 0.1% in the nation as a whole.  FÁS also provides a range of services for unemployed persons in Carrick-on-Suir and the surrounding areas.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The practice of establishing task forces has changed since the establishment of the county development boards.  Rather than creating a further layer by establishing task forces, the relevant CDB is now seen as the body best placed to oversee any additional response that is required over and above the work of the industrial development agencies under the auspices of my Department.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	70	Is the Minister for real?  Is he not aware that 890 persons in Carrick-on-Suir are signing on the live register, and this has probably been a consistent figure over the past ten years?  The figure reached a maximum of approximately 950 but has hovered around the 900 mark for about ten years.  This represents approximately 25% unemployment in the town.Would the Minister accept that his comments have condemned Carrick-on-Suir to that level of unemployment into the future?  That is the meaning of what the Minister has stated.  He has traipsed all over south Tipperary and all over the south east but he has effectively said nothing about positive action for job creation in Carrick-on-Suir.  If the town was Passage West, in the Minister's constituency, would I have got that sort of reply?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	71	Yes.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	72	I asked if the Minister would accept there is a long-term and unacceptably high level of unemployment in Carrick-on-Suir, and whether a jobs task force consisting of high-profile heavy hitters is necessary to do something for employment in the town.I plead with the Minister to set up such a jobs task force because the town has done its part over the last number of years.  It has become involved in a series of local community endeavours.  It is a fine town, well located in a good area and with a good tourism and road infrastructure.  It is near ports in Waterford and Rosslare.  Yet it is unfortunately an unemployment blackspot in the south east and south Tipperary.It is very fine to state there are jobs in Clonmel, Waterford, Dungarvan, Limerick and elsewhere, but there are still levels of unemployment in Carrick-on-Suir that are absolutely unacceptable.  The figure has remained effectively the same for ten or more years.  Will the Minister establish a high-profile jobs task force for the town?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	73	The Deputy asked if I was for real but the Deputy should get somewhat real as well.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	75	I did not interrupt, Deputy.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	77	The idea that the creation of thousands of jobs 20 minutes from a town does not provide employment opportunities for people in the town is not realistic or valid.  In terms of attracting inward investment to the regions, we must move towards gateways and hubs.Identifying Clonmel and ensuring it becomes a very attractive location for inward investment is a good idea that would provide opportunities for people living within a significant radius of Clonmel.  It is likewise for Waterford.  That is the overall point.The year 2006 was very good for south Tipperary in terms of high-quality jobs coming in.  Merck, Sharp & Dohme created 120 jobs, Cordis Communications could potentially create 500 jobs in Cashel and Abbott Vascular is looking at 500 life-science jobs in Clonmel.  These are high-quality jobs by any standard.On the other side of the equation there are structural issues which must be addressed, and we have met with representatives from the town regarding a stronger FÁS input to enable those unemployed in Carrick-on-Suir to perhaps access a range of training and skills programmes to access employment in the area.  Enterprise Ireland is also anxious to work with people in the town to advance the agenda there.  As the Deputy knows, the county manager has set up a number of working groups involving local interests and agencies.  Enterprise Ireland will be supporting the county manager in that regard and representatives will attend those meetings.  The county development board is also relevant.In my frank opinion, the last thing we need is another layer of bureaucracy, or a new board, to somehow go over all the existing layers.  The key issue is that the agencies, including FÁS, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, work together with the county manager, the county development board and the enterprise board to try to create an environment for the growth of micro-enterprises in Carrick-on-Suir and locally developed companies.  Then they should ensure people can be upskilled to enable them to access employment being created within 20 minutes of Carrick-on-Suir.The Deputy asked if I would give the same answer if he asked about Passage West in Cork and the answer is "yes."  I would, as people are willing to travel 20 odd minutes.  Unfortunately, some people around the country are travelling for an hour and a half or two hours to employment, such as those around Dublin.

In its discussions with companies, the IDA endeavours to get them to regional and rural locations.  The idea of identifying a place like Clonmel as the magnet to bring significant industry into that particular area is good.  It offers the best chance to people who are unemployed in Carrick-on-Suir.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	80	Is it not true that the Minister's comments have condemned Carrick-on-Suir to becoming a dormitory town with high levels of unemployment into the future?  Is it not true that the working groups referred to by the Minister have been unsuccessful over the past number of years?  Unemployment is unacceptably and stubbornly high in Carrick-on-Suir, so does this mean this Government, in office for 18 of the last 20 years, has effectively abandoned the town?  Is it not time for a high-profile and heavy-hitting task force to be put together for the town?

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	89	Employment in the region has increased by 7.5%, equating to approximately 15,000 jobs in the region.  That is the context in which we should view the case of Carrick-on-Suir.  The challenge is then to figure out how to ensure people can access the increased number of jobs being created in the general region.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	90	The Government's primary responsibility on enterprise policy is to ensure the broad environment and essential framework conditions continue to underpin and support the development of a sustainable enterprise sector.In line with the recommendations of the enterprise strategy group and small business forum, over the period of the next national development plan, 2007-13, financial incentives totalling €1.7 billion, and other supports, will be provided through Enterprise Ireland and the city and county enterprise boards to create more knowledge-based, technologically innovative, sustainable and competitive indigenous enterprises.This will include specific initiatives to stimulate the establishment and development of high potential start-up companies across a range of high value sectors, including manufacturing; productivity improvement initiatives to support manufacturing companies to improve competitiveness through technology and training; a range of initiatives to develop management and international sales capabilities; supports in accessing early stage and development capital and financial planning and advice and mentoring; and supports for entrepreneurship and micro-enterprises, including the provision of local enterprise infrastructure.The nurturing of a positive culture of entrepreneurship and promotion of the formation of new, particularly innovative, enterprises with growth potential will remain a key objective over the timeframe of the plan.  Based on the development of their existing suite of interventions, the county enterprise boards will promote entrepreneurship throughout society through initiatives such as their Start Your Own Business training courses, schools enterprise programmes, awards schemes and networks, including the Women in Business networks, etc.As part of the Government's overall policy to develop science, technology and innovation, as set out in its strategy on STI published last June, Enterprise Ireland will also continue to promote industry-relevant research and development and the commercialisation of publicly-funded research.  The agency has brought together a range of supports under a commercialisation fund which seeks to support academic researchers in developing their ideas and bringing them closer to commercial realisation.  Funding of €25 million was provided to over 150 projects during 2006.By 2013, the strategy aims to double the number of companies with minimum-scale research and development activity, treble the number of enterprises engaging in significant research and development activity, increase business expenditure on research and development, increase gross expenditure on research and development and double the proportion of sales in indigenous firms of innovative products and processes.  The number of new doctorates in science, engineering and technology will almost double from 543 in 2005 to 997 in 2013.  The number of new doctorates in the humanities and social sciences will also double.To compete successfully in the international marketplace Irish companies will need to develop world class management teams.  The key focus areas for Enterprise Ireland will include human resource development, management development and mentoring.  To encourage and develop international sales capabilities in client companies Enterprise Ireland will provide services and assistance, including market intelligence, in-market technical, legal and financial expertise, targeting potential buyers, buyer introductions and facilitating Irish companies to establish overseas.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	96	In a previous reply on manufacturing we noted declining productivity levels and higher costs, most of which are directly attributable to the Minister's policy.  He disagreed with the Central Bank and the Department of Finance about export growth and the fact that many companies would not be based in Ireland were it not for our tax policy.  Future job creation will be based on exploiting the talent of the Irish.I agree with the Minister in that there has been much investment in research and development in the third level sector, but 16% of all funds, whether private or public, is being invested in property.  Does he have initiatives in mind to redirect some of the incentives away from property to manufacturing and employment generation proposals?  A figure of some 5% is the European average for investment of private and public funds in property.  Notwithstanding the fact that the Minister referred to the Ahead of the Curve report and other initiatives and fora, has he studied specific financial incentives in the context of the Finance Bill or other measures to direct incentives to manufacturing and the commercialisation of research and development activities?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	97	I mentioned the commercialisation fund allocated by Enterprise Ireland to universities.  It is substantial and will dramatically increase the capacity of universities and institutes of technology to commercialise their research.The Deputy is aware that the budget was significant in terms of incentives to invest capital in new companies and businesses.  In line with the recommendations of the Small Business Forum which I established and through which I was anxious to set a blueprint for small businesses, we enhanced the business expansion scheme significantly by raising investor limits and the amount of money that could be raised by companies.  We did likewise with the seed capital investment scheme.  We lightened the regulatory burden in respect of VAT returns for small to medium-sized companies.  By developing an innovation voucher scheme for micro-enterprises and knowledge acquisition grant schemes for small to medium-sized companies we are also in line with the forum's recommendations.Last year we launched the most significant venture capital fund in the history of the State.  The Government provided up to €175 million through Enterprise Ireland for a new capital venture round which we hope will leverage a sum of approximately €1 billion in investment in new and start-up companies.  In the budget we provided for an enhanced research and development tax credit to provide incentives for more investment, not just by multinational companies, but also by Irish-owned businesses.  We want to see a greater participation rate in research and development in the manufacturing and services sectors, in particular.  We have tried to switch investment from construction to production.  The budget which received a warm welcome among the small to medium-sized business community delivered almost 100% on the forum's recommendations.  Married with the venture capital fund and the research and development tax credit, we expect to see higher levels of investment.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	98	In the interests of saving time, I suggest we move to the next question.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	99	The economy is a remarkable success story.  During the past decade we have achieved consistently higher economic growth rates than most developed countries.  This is among the better-off countries in the European Union and the developed world.  We also score well in international rankings of quality of life.  The 2006 UN human development index ranks us in fourth position ahead of countries we have long admired such as Sweden, Canada, Switzerland, Finland and Japan.  Our position in this index has increased by 14 places since 2004 based on Ireland's improving levels of wealth, health, life expectancy and education.For each of the past three years Ireland's merchandise exports have recorded year-on-year increases of approximately 3% per annum.  This has been achieved despite adverse conditions in many markets, including currency rate changes, and it follows a long-standing trend, albeit one that was interrupted briefly following the economic shock after 11 September 2001 and the dotcom bubble difficulties in the technology sector.Ireland continues to have a healthy trade surplus.  In 2005 this stood at €29 billion on merchandise trade.  Statistics for services exports released recently show a healthy trend in the years 2003 to 2005, with a 14% increase between 2003 and 2004 and a 9% increase between 2004 and 2005.  While final data on services exports for 2006 are not yet available, the indications are that the positive trend continued.In recent years domestic demand, particularly for houses, has been an increasing driver of economic expansion and employment growth.  While it is good news that we have the resources to address deficits in our housing, transport and broader social infrastructure, our economic prosperity depends on our ability to sell goods and services abroad.  Ireland must offer a high quality, cost-competitive business environment.  This is still a strong trading nation and the challenge facing us is to stimulate productivity and export growth and increase international market share as key policy objectives.These are the issues that the National Competitiveness Council addresses in its latest report, Ireland's Competitiveness Challenge, which outlined policy recommendations across a range of areas.  The Government is committed to acting on the recommendations of the council's report which are designed to stimulate productivity growth and improve our ability to sell goods and services abroad.  For example, the national development plan proposes a wide range of investments that will improve productivity by removing infrastructural bottlenecks that increase costs.  It will enhance the skills of graduates and people already in the labour market and create a more supportive environment for enterprises in developing new products and services.  The strategy for science technology and innovation will drive research and development performance and underpin long-term competitiveness.The Government recognises the need to stimulate productivity growth and improve our ability to sell goods and services abroad.  A range of strategies are in place to assist in this regard.  I am confident that we can build on our past achievements, while laying the pathways for growth and higher productivity.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	100	I note a similarity in the questions asked.  It has become increasingly clear that while no one doubts the economy's success in the past ten to 20 years, there is increasing concern that we have gone through two phases of a boom, the first of which involved genuine growth in productivity, exports and manufacturing, which has been followed in the past five years during the Government's term in office by a phase based on growth in construction and consumption at home which crowds out our ability to develop an economy based on enterprise and exports.  While no one doubts that certain sectors such as financial services have continued to grow in recent years, there is a concern that the decrease of 32,000 in the number of manufacturing jobs and the balance of trade deficit, projected to be €6.9 billion this year, paint a picture of an economy heading towards more difficult times and a Government which is not delivering solutions that will have a real impact on the ground.  The Minister set out the various ways by which he hopes to address these issues, but we are not seeing any signs of success.I examined the commercialisation research and development fund and its outcomes in some detail.  There may, indeed, be a good deal of money being put into the area of research and development, but it is clear that the outcome in terms of new indigenous Irish exporting companies is not being delivered.  One can just count the number of patents and start-ups and look at the detail as regards what is happening in the economy.  One could say the Minister for Finance has taken up many of the suggestions of the Small Business Forum and others.  However, he is still acting as a Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance in that there are still tax breaks and major incentives in the area of property development, which is crowding out the likelihood of an alternative enterprise economy here.Has there been discussion in Cabinet about the need to slow down the construction sector in order to free up capacity within the rest of the economy?  Has the Minister made the case to the Department of Finance for scaling back some of those other developments?  What success has he had with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, for example, in terms of trying to reduce some of the costs facing new entrepreneurs by taking on what the National Competitiveness Council shows as the dominance of utilities in Ireland in areas such as telecommunications and electricity supply?  The main cost factors affecting companies are way out of line.  What has the Minister done to change Government policy in that regard to try to help an indigenous enterprise economy?No one disagrees with the analysis that we need to change and to put the emphasis on research and development.  What is becoming increasingly clear on this side of the  House, however, is that the Minister is not being effective in delivering change.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	101	I must reject that.  We created in the region of 500,000 jobs.  The Deputy mentioned the 30,000 jobs lost in manufacturing.  Like all developed economies the services sector accounts for a growing proportion of the jobs created.  I do not accept the Deputy's view that Ireland is not getting a bang for its buck in terms of research and development.  It is early days yet in terms of that evaluation.  However, in terms of the numbers of research and development investment projects we are winning from overseas compared to our performance five or six years ago, the picture has dramatically improved.  This is because of the emphasis we put in our policy and in our investment on research and development and companies are beginning to see that.  We are marketing Ireland strongly and proactively as a country in which to locate research and development activity.  Enterprise Ireland has been very successful in terms of its three-year strategic plan, which is now almost two years in operation.  Under its transforming agenda, this has helped to orientate indigenous companies in the direction of markets that will open up new export opportunities for them.  Enterprise Ireland clients have significantly increased their exports.  In any trade missions I have been on all of the successful companies have a research and development or innovation or design house within them, which is a critical factor in their success.  Enterprise Ireland client companies' exports in Asia, for example, rose by 14.6% and their figures for the US came in at around 13.6% for 2005; the outlook is looking good for 2006 in that regard also.In terms of the energy issue, of course we work closely with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  He is preparing a White Paper for publication shortly and we anticipate Green Party support as regards the recommendations and policy proposals that will emanate from it.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, has already initiated tax reform in terms of the property sector.  He is correct to phase out gradually, to ensure stability and continued employment in the sector, as opposed to a sudden sharp change, which is not good.  People in any sector of the economy deserve to have a degree of predictability and to know there is an overarching framework and timeframe within which they can operate.  The Minister has implemented and followed the spirit of the substantial analysis of our tax reliefs system which all parties in this House supported over the last 22 years in different guises, with the exception, perhaps, of the Green Party, which did not have the opportunity to be in power for most of that period.  Nonetheless, other parties, who are not in power now, introduced property tax relief schemes in a different era and for justifiable reasons as well.On the foreign direct investment side, we continue to attract high end activities into the country, not just in the area of financial services, but in pharmaceuticals, bio-pharmaceuticals, medical devices and some engineering companies as well.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	102	The Green Party, if it had been in Government, would not have voted for tax breaks for multi-storey carparks, holiday homes or hotels, which have skewed enterprise policy in this country.  Having worked in the tourism industry for years, I found it remarkable that the Government knew better than I did, as an operator, what should be built.  Unfortunately, the Government got it badly wrong.  Productivity growth at the moment has not been lower since the early 1980s.  What will turn that around?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	103	It is not a fair comparison to compare the 1980s with the present by any standard.  It is not to compare like with like.  Obviously, in a developing economy the productivity gains we have seen over the past ten to 15 years will, by definition, be more significant than those we can expect in the remaining period.  Three issues account for this — investment in research and development I am absolutely convinced is essential for our competitiveness and increased productivity; greater investment in technology and innovation; and in terms of the skills agenda, the upskilling of the workforce.  Today we launched the national skills strategy, which aims to upskill half a million workers between now and 2020.  These are particularly important factors in ensuring a continued competitive performance by Ireland and, indeed, increased productivity.  Another key factor is greater competition within the domestic economy.  The Green Party opposed this in terms of the abolition of the groceries order, to cite one example.  People keep talking about the need for competition within the domestic economy, but when it comes to taking on vested interests everybody runs away and finds excuses to oppose whatever liberalisation initiatives are being put forward at a particular time.  Most of the reports that Deputy Eamon Ryan and indeed, Deputy Hogan, quote, keep pointing to the need for more competition in the domestic market and economy as a way of developing stronger productivity and growth.  The FDI side is enjoying greater levels of productivity growth than the domestic side of the economy.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	104	I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 and 121 together.Every economy of the developed world experiences flows of capital as firms make adjustments to their operations and decide where to locate different aspects of their value chain.The National Competitiveness Council in its most recent report, Ireland's Competitiveness Challenge, has made a number of recommendations aimed at improving our overall competitiveness.  It outlines policy recommendations across the following areas: labour force; social capital; public income and expenditure; regulatory environment; infrastructure; productivity of Irish-based enterprise; Ireland's education system; innovation, research and development; costs of doing business in Ireland; and energy.The Government is committed to acting on the recommendations of the National Competitiveness Council, which are designed to stimulate productivity growth and improve our ability to sell goods and services abroad.  For example, the National Development Plan 2007-13 proposes a wide range of investments which will improve productivity by removing infrastructural bottlenecks that increase costs.  It will enhance the skills of graduates and people already in the labour market, and will create a more supportive environment for enterprises in developing new products and services.  The strategy for science technology and innovation will drive research and development performance and underpin long term competitiveness.In summary, the Government recognizes the need to stimulate productivity growth and improve our ability to sell goods and services abroad.  A range of strategies is now in place to assist and I am confident that we can build on our past achievement while laying the pathways for growth and higher productivity in the future.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	105	I wonder whether the Minister read the article at the weekend by the Irish chief executive of Intel on his concerns about our competitiveness.   Intel is accustomed to making adjustments.  It is at the cutting edge of technology and research and development is a major aspect of its activity.  It is involved in all aspects of manufacturing from research and development and innovation right through to production, and from that viewpoint, it is a very impressive operation.  Is the Minister concerned about some of the adjustments being made by Intel which has reduced seriously its number of contractors who were a permanent feature on the Intel site for some time?  Perhaps the job losses in this sector have gone under the radar.  They might not have been noticed because they have been spread among a number of contractors.  Will the Minister engage with firms such as Intel in respect of the concerns they are expressing?  As Intel is based in my home town, as well as the constituency I represent, I tend to be realistic when I comment on the adjustments it has to make.  However, I am concerned about the loss of jobs at contractor level.  Intel has expressed concern about Ireland's economic competitiveness.  Does the Minister engage with companies such as Intel, or is he removed from the process, whereby the various agencies discuss matters of this nature with such companies?  Does he hear from the agencies rather than directly from companies?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	106	Since my appointment as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I have met the managements of such companies, including the manager of Intel's Irish operation, on a regular basis.  The employment offered by Intel is robust.  Many towns would love to have an employer such as Intel which continues and will continue to make a significant contribution to the economy.  Intel is investing significantly in research and development initiatives.  As part of its ongoing contact with the company, IDA Ireland is anxious to broaden the range of activities in which Intel engages in Ireland.  IDA Ireland and Intel are hoping to work together over the next ten years to engage in research which will produce new products and solutions for the market.  That is the best way of underpinning Intel's contribution to the Irish and global economies, which has been to produce quality products.The number of jobs in many major companies varies as demand peaks and falls over the course of the year.  Seasonal employment is distinct from the core employment offered by such operations.  It is obvious that more temporary contracts are offered by many companies in the run-up to Christmas, before the level of such employment decreases again.  The volume of activity sustained by a company the size of Intel and those who engage with it will always ebb and flow.  The Government has been articulating the need to safeguard in a vigilant manner the cost base of the economy as it has developed.  We have to be conscious of the competition we face in areas such as energy and labour costs.  We are taking on board the concerns outlined to us by many companies.  When I met representatives of a number of companies, not including Intel, in the United States last week, they spoke positively about the degree to which their Irish facilities contributed to their global successes.  They made no bones about the high level of skill of the Irish workforce and the continuing contribution of Irish workers to the successes of global companies.  Such comments have been repeated by representatives of many companies which operate in Ireland.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	107	State support for enterprise and job creation is channelled through the industrial development agencies.  While I can issue general policy directives to the agencies under the Industrial Development Acts, I am precluded from issuing directives about individual undertakings or giving preference to one area over others.  I have been assured by the agencies under the remit of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment that they are endeavouring to attract new investment, encourage the establishment of new businesses, expand existing businesses and develop the labour market in County Mayo.  Ballina and Castlebar will benefit from the ongoing investment in transport, energy and utilities outlined in the new national development plan.  It is vital that national investment is partnered with local vision and leadership.  Private investment must also play a role.  County development boards are best placed to oversee any additional responses required, in addition to the work of the industrial development agencies under the auspices of the Department.IDA Ireland which recognises the need to secure high value investment that will provide sustainable long-term jobs is developing world-class business parks in Ballina, Castlebar and Westport as part of its marketing strategy for County Mayo.  I was pleased to learn recently that significant progress had been made by Mayo County Council in securing unburdened title to a site of 10.29 hectares on the Sligo Road in Ballina.  Employment in companies in County Mayo supported by IDA Ireland increased by almost 10%, from 2,711 to 2,973, between January 1998 and December 2006.  The county's employment performance has been good when considered within the current global economic climate.  There is a diverse range of foreign direct investment companies in the county in sectors such as medical technologies, pharmaceuticals, international services, engineering and information and communications technology.Enterprise Ireland is focusing on the creation of new jobs by supporting entrepreneurs establishing new high potential start-up companies.  It is concentrating on the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and the enhancement of Ireland's innovation capability at a national and regional level.  It is supporting research in companies and third level institutions.  The overall aim of Enterprise Ireland's strategy is to transform Irish companies into businesses which are focused on the market and driven by innovation.  It is working to increase the exports, sales and employment of such companies.  Some 3,145 people were employed in Enterprise Ireland's client companies in County Mayo at the end of 2006.  Since January 2006, Enterprise Ireland has approved funding support of almost €2 million, of which €1.45 million has already been paid to companies in the county which are supported by the agency.  The Mayo County Enterprise Board supports small businesses throughout the county which have not more than ten employees.  The board approved the allocation of €620,000 to 30 projects in 2006.  It paid approximately €440,000 in grant assistance to 29 projects which resulted in the creation of 110 net jobs in companies throughout the county which are assisted by the board.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	108	I welcome the progress made with the industrial site in Ballina which has been discussed for donkey's years since the last time I raised the matter in the House.  Perhaps we can make further progress, as IDA Ireland has not delivered.  The Minister has mentioned that he does not have anything to do with IDA Ireland, but he cannot deny that the buck stops with him.  Perhaps he is not aware of certain developments.  For example, the former Henniges plant on the Crossmolina road has been converted into a 12-unit retail warehouse and garden centre.  When the plant closed in 2001 with the loss of 170 jobs, the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, said her "immediate priority" was to find "an alternative industry for Ballina".  She pointed out that the Government aimed "to ensure that 50% of all new jobs are located in the Border, midlands and west region".  She said she would "ensure that Ballina figures prominently" in further job creation efforts.  She mentioned that she had asked IDA Ireland and other State agencies "to actively promote Ballina", but new investment was not forthcoming.  Some 230 staff at the Volex plant in Castlebar which employed 950 people at one time were laid off in January 2002.  In August 2004 the plant was sold for over €5 million to a local auctioneer who was operating on behalf of a consortium.  It later became a car showroom and a furniture sales operation.  Many IDA Ireland factories have been sold and are now being used for purposes for which they were not originally intended.  That sends the wrong message to those who hope to be able to stay in the west and work in their own areas.When I met officials from IDA Ireland, they told me they could not do much for County Mayo because of the poor state of its infrastructure, including roads such as the N5 to Westport, the N26 to Ballina and the R312 to Belmullet.  Similar problems are encountered in the county's telecommunications infrastructure, for example, as a result of the Government's failure to spend €3.75 billion in the BMW region.  We all hope the western rail corridor will be developed, but as matters stand we cannot even get an early train to Dublin.IDA Ireland claims to have arranged nine visits by potential investors over a number of years.  I do not know where they were brought in Ballina because there was nothing to show them.  I hope this will change.  I ask the Minister to advise me of the significant changes made since October when I last raised this issue which I have been raising consistently.  Millions of euro are being spent on the rental of vacant IDA Ireland premises in County Mayo.  Does IDA Ireland have a policy of selling its premises to private enterprise to turn them into car showrooms?  I am sure these private enterprise people are very happy.  I question the potential for jobs and the reason for these factories being vacant.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	109	The industrial policy in County Mayo encompasses more than just IDA Ireland.  There are approximately 19 IDA-supported companies in County Mayo, employing approximately 3,000 people in permanent jobs and a further 450 in temporary and contract employment.  Employment numbers are strong relative to the 1990s and almost 10% higher than in January 1997.  Some of the key companies include Baxter, Allergan and Coca-Cola, which are significant reference sites to enable us to market the county for other types of investment.Enterprise Ireland has been very active in County Mayo and working with the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology is providing a significant source of graduates to the area.  It is also providing additional supports for locally-based companies and incubation space for entrepreneurs and new companies.  IDA Ireland is investing significantly with more than €6 million devoted to property solutions.  I refer to the Castlebar flagship business and technology park which is built on a site of 11.78 hectares.  The Deputy is correct that with regard to Ballina, significant legal difficulties arose which were beyond the control of IDA Ireland and of the Department but these are nearing resolution.  A site of 25.31 hectares contains a world-class business and technology park in Westport.  I refer the Deputy to the developing road infrastructure and significant progress has been made in that regard.  I refer also to the development of the sites along with the 12.5% corporation tax and the strong education infrastructure.  County Mayo is positioned for foreign direct investment but indigenous space should not be forgotten nor the need to develop and support locally-based companies.  I have met with a number of such companies in County Mayo which have been particularly successful.  If the infrastructure can be developed further, then we will do even better.

Will he explain why €2 million is being paid by the IDA for empty buildings in County Mayo?  Why does the Minister not try to fill these factories when the unemployment rate is twice the national average in the Ballina area, in particular, and considering that 1,000 jobs have been lost in the past nine years?

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	113	In 2006 there were 50 recorded fatalities in Ireland as a result of work-related accidents, compared to 74 work-related deaths in 2005, 50 in 2004 and 68 in 2003.  There were 12 construction-related fatalities in 2006 compared to 23 in 2005, 16 in 2004 and 20 in 2003.In the period 1 January to 5 March 2007, 19 workplace fatalities were reported to the Health and Safety Authority.  These comprised one in agriculture, seven in fishing, two in mining and quarrying, six in construction, one in real estate renting and business activity and two in public administration and defence.To date, a total of 7,935 non-fatal accidents, resulting in absence of more than three days from normal work, were reported to the authority across all sectors in 2006.  Of these 1,685 were related to the construction sector.  This compares with in 8,240 in 2005, of which 1,644 were in construction, with 8,461 in 2004, of which 1,501 were in construction, and with 7,177 in 2003, of which 1,108 were in construction.  The level of accidents reported to the Health and Safety Authority, however, only shows part of the picture in regard to non-fatal accidents.  For example, the most recent figures available from the Central Statistics Office quarterly national household surveys for 2003 and 2004 show non-fatal occupational accident numbers of 21,900, of which construction accounted for 5,300 in 2003 and 21,840, of which construction accounted for 5,820, in 2004.  In the period 1 January to 1 March 2007, 723 non-fatal accidents were reported to the Health and Safety Authority, including 191 in construction.There are more than 200,000 workplaces in Ireland and a total workforce of more than 2 million.  In 2007, in order to make best use of its resources, the Health and Safety Authority is once again prioritising a number of sectors for attention.  These include the high-risk sectors of construction, agriculture and mines and quarries, as well as the health services, local authorities and process industries.  The focus in these sectors will include the publication of a code of practice relating to safety statements tailored to those employing three or fewer in the construction sector; the management of a promotion and training support programme following the distribution in late 2006 of the code of practice for the agriculture sector; the publication of a similar code of practice for the fishing sector; an extensive inspection programme targeting key risks; and an inspection and information programme which targets the public sector.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.To improve health and safety standards on construction sites and to ensure maximum benefit from the improved legislative basis provided in new Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations which I introduced in 2006, as well as building on the successful seminars organised by the authority for the construction industry, the authority is committed in 2007 to carrying out a focused programme of 7,000 construction site inspections covering appointment of competent designers, project supervisors and contractors, safety and health plans and safety statements, work at heights, traffic management and reversing vehicle safety, welfare arrangements, and slips, trips and falls on a level; carrying out 100 inspections of designers concentrating on design risk assessments for work at a height and the provision of slip resistant floor surfaces; assisting designer professional bodies in the development of competence for their members; contributing to the implementation of the construction safety partnership plan; contributing to the implementation by FÁS of the Claritas recommendations on the Safe Pass and construction skills certification schemes; enforcing and providing information on the construction and work at height regulations; publishing and promoting a code of practice on safety statements for employers of three or fewer in construction; commencing research on the safety and health implications for non-English speaking workers in the sector; preparing draft guidance on construction-specific aspects of work at a height and progressing draft codes of practice on pre-cast construction, concrete anchors, scaffolding, underground services and roof work, and developing guidance on client best practice; developing safe system of work plans, SSWP, for local authorities, implementing a development plan for the SSWP, a new initiative aimed at simplifying the safety message for both English and non-English speakers; running a hard-hitting campaign to change attitudes to construction safety.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	115	Later today the House will debate emergency legislation to prevent predators using the Internet to meet children for sexual relations and to reinstate the offence of soliciting a child for sex.  It is clear that the Government's frantic rush to bring in this legislation has only come about because of initiatives taken on this side of the House.  Last week the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Rabbitte, exposed a deficit in the legislation consequent on the legislation introduced last year arising from the Supreme Court decision in the CC case.  The proposals in the Bill to be debated by the House this evening are to do with grooming and are lifted word for word from the Bill introduced here three years ago by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.Given that the Government has been aware of these difficulties for some time, if the Labour Party last week had not raised the issue of the deficit in the legislation and if Deputy O'Keeffe did not move his Bill this week, how much longer would it have tolerated Irish children being unprotected from evil people who use the Internet to groom them for sexual exploitation?  If the issue of the deficit in the legislation had not been raised last weekend, how much longer would Irish children have remained unprotected from the crime of solicitation for sex?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	116	Both issues will be addressed later this evening in the House.  In response to the Supreme Court decision in the CC case in May of last year, the Government passed emergency legislation in early June, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006.  On 1 March, Deputy Rabbitte properly identified the deficiency in that legislation in that the new Act did not apply the offence of soliciting or importuning a child for the purpose of the commission of a sexual offence provided for in section 6 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to the new offence created in the 2006 Act.  We have moved to rectify that omission.  The House will debate the legislation later.Section 6 of the 1993 Act is a little-used provision.  The Garda Commissioner's annual reports for the past five years do not disclose any convictions for the offence at section 6.  However, the Government is not satisfied to leave a gap in our laws governing sexual offences and the protection of children when it has been pointed out, as Deputy Rabbitte has done, lest the absence might in any way hinder or prevent the gardaí, if they wanted to use the legislation, investigating or successfully prosecuting persons for activity that leads to the sexual abuse of children.A section 6 offence is a summary offence to which the power of detention for questioning does not apply and while, from a purely legal perspective, it is not a matter of urgency to legislate on the issue, it is important to allay public fears by enacting the proposed Bill immediately.  That is what we will do.In the context of its Private Members' Bill, Fine Gael raised the issue of the sexual grooming of children.  As I said yesterday, we have examined that issue.  It seemed to us, and our legal advice is, that the Fine Gael amendment is fine, so we have included it in the Bill we will pass later today.  The Fine Gael Bill is based on section 15 of the UK Sexual Offences Act 2003, under which it is an offence to meet a child following sexual grooming.  We are preparing a more comprehensive Bill which will cover a number of these issues — the criminal law (trafficking of persons and sexual offences) Bill, about which Deputy Kenny asked a number of times.  The problem is that the Bill is not likely to be ready until Easter so, as it is best to enact this measure, we have taken the Fine Gael proposal and included it in the Bill which will be passed later today.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	117	I welcome the publication of the Bill, about which there has been no contact with the Fine Gael Party.Last year, the Taoiseach went to the United Nations on official business while the Tánaiste conducted business here.  Following the release of the child rapist before rearrest, the people of the country were convulsed with horror at what was happening, and they took to the streets in huge numbers because of their concern.  The people expect Government, with all its resources and legal potential, to be able to deal with these matters, but this is not what happened with this Government.  But for the fact that Deputy Rabbitte and his party exposed this gaping hole last week, the matter would continue to drift.The Private Members' Bill put forward by Deputy O'Keeffe on behalf of the Fine Gael Party deals conclusively with predatory Internet grooming.  I accept the Government has come forward with the two sections of the Bill, which is to be welcomed.

How in heaven's name could anybody see that as other than a Minister being completely out of touch when what is at stake is the destruction of innocence and the permanent desecration of childhood?  He called it a minor offence.

Does the Taoiseach consider it a minor offence?  Is the Taoiseach prepared to say, on behalf of the Government, which, after all, is supposed to make collective decisions, that this was a wrong and inappropriate comment by the Tánaiste?  Is he prepared to say, on behalf of the Government, that he is sorry for any offence caused to the Irish people by such a remark?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	122	If he thought it was a minor offence, the Tánaiste would not be introducing the legislation.  Although it is not a section that has been used, it is clearly not a minor matter and that is not the impression the Tánaiste gave in the discussions I had with him.  The Government is not satisfied to leave any gap in our laws governing sexual offences and the protection of children because, although the Garda has not used this, it could hinder a successful investigation or the prosecution of persons for activity that leads to the sexual abuse of children.  Therefore, it is right that we close it off immediately, on the first Dáil day since the matter was raised by Deputy Rabbitte last week.As I said, a section 6 offence is a summary offence to which the power of detention for questioning does not apply and while, from a purely legal perspective, it is not a matter of urgency to legislate on the issue, it is important to allay public fears by enacting the proposed Bill immediately.  This is what the Tánaiste had stated.  The legislation being brought before the House today will amend section 6 of the 1993 Act, which was the main Act, by applying the provision to the offences at sections 2 and 3 of the 2006 Act, which was the Act of last June.  The opportunity is also being taken to make the section 6 offence an indictable offence, conviction of which would ensure that the offender was placed on the sex offenders register.The new Bill will mean it will be possible to convict a perpetrator on indictment and the maximum prison sentence ensures it will be an arrestable offence, giving the Garda power to detain suspects for questioning, and will also ensure that certain provisions of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act 1981 will apply to the section 6 offence.  These include exclusion of the public from proceedings, anonymity of complainants and the accused, and preliminary examination matters.  It also adds the offence to the definition of sexual offences in the Criminal Evidence Act 1992, under which special provisions apply to children giving evidence in sexual cases, and the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Act 1996, under which it will be possible to charge a person resident in the country with a comparable offence committed abroad — that comes under the Bail Act 1997, under which bail can be refused on certain grounds for serious offences.  It adds the offence to the provisions of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, under which a complainant can receive legal advice.The point was correctly raised by Deputy Rabbitte.  The Government has acted on it.  We have strengthened it and taken the opportunity to introduce the Bill.  That was the correct thing to do and it was correct for the Tánaiste to move on it immediately.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	124	I welcome the emergency Bill, which is designed, as the Taoiseach stated, to deal with the loophole identified last week.  With regard to the reference to "minor", there were 55 prosecutions and 34 convictions under that section in 2000.  I am not sure why there have only been a couple each year since then but that was the situation until 2000.I have a question for the Taoiseach, which it would be helpful for him to clarify before the debate begins.  The controversy, as Deputy Kenny correctly noted, arises from the Supreme Court judgment last year in which the court struck down as unconstitutional an offence under the 1935 legislation prohibiting unlawful carnal knowledge of a child.  The offence was struck down because it was one of absolute liability.  In other words, the offence did not allow a defendant to plead a defence of honest mistake.  On last year's legislation — the escapade to which Deputy Kenny referred — reinstating the offence of unlawful carnal knowledge was enacted so as to comply with constitutional requirements as decreed by the Supreme Court.  In other words, it recreates the offence but it allows a defence of honest mistake or reasonable mistake to be pleaded. In the meantime a referendum has been proposed which would, if passed by the people, enable the Oireachtas to include a defence of honest mistake.  The Oireachtas could then legislate to create a zone of absolute protection for children.  Until the referendum is passed, however, any legislation introduced in this area must satisfy the current rules, particularly if it concerns a serious offence.  It is now proposed to make the activity an indictable offence so the defence of reasonable mistake must be provided for.  One response, suggested in a letter I sent to the Taoiseach this morning, would be to proceed with that part of the referendum concerning the protection of children.The other response is the Bill we are being asked to enact in the House this evening.  That Bill reinstates the offence of soliciting and importuning a child for sexual purposes but, given that the Supreme Court has held there must be a defence of honest mistake, is the Taoiseach satisfied such a defence is provided for in the Bill?  If he is, can he suggest the section which so provides?  As far as I can see the Bill does not make such provision and there is no reference to any defence to the offence in question.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	129	I have not been involved with the Bill in detail so the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will deal with the Deputy's last point during the course of the debate.  I assume the matter has been well covered but I will raise it with the Minister with a view to clearing it up before the Bill is taken.I received the Deputy's letter concerning the referendum today and his point about the defence of honest mistake is correct.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has received letters from other parties and is meeting with them today.  Hopefully we can come to an all-party agreement on the matter this week.  I will not reveal the contents of the Deputy's letter, as that is for him to do if he so wishes.  However, I note his suggestion and we are examining it.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	130	Can the Taoiseach say if the Attorney General will meet with the spokespersons in advance of the debate?  The point I raise needs to be clarified before we start.  If a person is charged with soliciting or importuning a child to engage in an act which would constitute an offence under last year's legislation he or she would not be guilty in the event of an honest mistake being made as to the child's age at the time of the offence.  That person should not be guilty of an offence under this Bill either.  l refer the Taoiseach to section 3(5) of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006 which states: "It shall be a defence to proceedings for an offence under this section for the defendant to prove that he or she honestly believed that, at the time of the alleged commission of the offence, the child against whom the offence is alleged to have been committed had attained the age of 17 years".  This year's Bill is concerned with activities which take place prior to any sexual activity and a defence of honest mistake would have to be concerned with the defendant's state of mind when the offence is committed but that is not clear.  I ask the Taoiseach or, if the Taoiseach is unable to deal with it, the Tánaiste, if he is satisfied and has received legal advice that it is not necessary for a subsection allowing a defence to proceedings under this Bill of a genuine belief that the other person was of age at the time of the alleged offence.Can the Taoiseach tell the House whether there have been consultations with the Ombudsman for Children?  Have there been consultations with that extraordinary creation of last summer's tumult, the two special rapporteurs we were told would ride shotgun on the issue?  Have they been asked whether any infirmity exists in the Bill to be brought before the House this evening?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	131	The Bill is being taken in the House in one and a half hours' time.  The contents of the Bill before the House, including the precise legal points to which the Deputy refers, can be discussed during the debate.  Deputy Rabbitte asked for clarification on section 3(5) in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006 before the debate and I will ask the Tánaiste to clarify that to the Labour Party spokesperson.  We have consulted on the defence of honest mistake with all bodies in the field on the review of the Constitution which we have undertaken since last autumn.  There has been wide consultation not only with the Ombudsman for Children but with the rapporteurs and other NGOs in the area.  The Tánaiste can deal with the issue of consultation in the last few days.  I will ask the Chief Whip to ask the Tánaiste's office or the Attorney General to clarify his points raised.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	132	Many people will have seen the very dignified appearance by Mrs. Christine O'Toole on RTE last night.  Mrs. O'Toole is the mother of the young man, 24 year old Derek O'Toole, who was tragically killed on Sunday morning in Lucan in a road accident.  She complained validly about the spin created in a number of media outlets yesterday to the effect that her son was "known to the gardaí".  That is a code for having a criminal record or for being a person of ill-repute, neither of which is true.  I make no judgment on what happened, subject to a full investigation, but members of the Garda Síochána were involved in the tragedy.  There is a suspicion that when members of the Garda Síochána are involved in such incidents a spin is put to the media, anonymously and from unattributed sources, to secure a prejudgment on issues that arise in the case with a view to minimalising the responsibility of the gardaí involved.  I previously raised the question in the context of the tragic killing of John Carthy in Abbeylara, who was the subject of disgraceful leaks from inside the Garda Síochána.What is the view of the Government on the systematic and unattributable briefings by members of the Garda Síochána, sometimes by very senior officers, in respect of issues concerning citizens' good names?  Are such briefings acceptable or should they not be allowed to continue?  Does the Taoiseach agree that there must be a full and independent investigation on foot of the circumstances in which Derek O'Toole died?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I sympathise with the parents and family of the late Derek O'Toole on his untimely and tragic death.  I completely agree with Deputy Higgins's point that it is regrettable that initial reports from an unnamed source attempted to put Derek's character at issue.  A full Garda investigation, headed by a superintendent, is under way.  When it is completed, a file will be forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions who is an independent officer.  It will be he who will make a decision on any further action required.  It is important, both for the relatives of the victim and the persons in the car involved, that the investigation is allowed to take its course.  It does no one any service to jump to conclusions in respect of matters of this nature.I am advised that, as part of the Garda investigation, the scene of the collision has been examined and that the car involved has been technically and forensically examined.  The driver of the car was an off-duty garda.  He underwent a breath test which showed him to be below the legal limit.  I am also advised that, following a post mortem, there is no evidence to suggest Derek had been assaulted or that another vehicle was involved.  We hope the investigation will bring clarity for everyone involved.I welcome the appointment by the Garda Síochána of a nominated officer to act as liaison between the force and the family.  More than anything else, however, I sympathise with the parents and family of Derek O'Toole on his death.  I condemn any attempt to place his character at issue in any way.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	134	All Members will join the Taoiseach in extending their sincere sympathy to Mr. and Mrs. O'Toole and the family on what was an appalling tragedy.  I cast no reflection on anyone involved in the investigation but in cases of this nature provision should be made for an independent investigation to be carried out by competent persons outside the Garda Síochána.The Taoiseach did not comment on one of the central points I made, namely, the tendency for sources within the Garda to be in regular contact with certain journalists and put a spin on stories from their point of view, which can often reflect on the character of citizens who may have been involved in particular incidents.  There were examples of this recently which gave rise to the danger of people rushing to judgment and impugning the good name of innocent individuals before investigations were completed and judgments arrived at.  Gross exaggerations also appeared in the media regarding the nature of incidents that occurred and these later proved to be without basis.  The Garda should not be involved in such leaks and the Taoiseach should state this.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	135	I inquired as to whether the leak came from officers on duty in the Garda press office on duty at the time of the tragedy or from any of the officers who attended at the scene and I received assurances that it did not.  It came from what were referred to as "anonymous sources".  If Deputy Higgins is asking me to condemn such sources, I would be obliged to do so every minute of my life.  In this instance, the anonymous sources involved were extremely unhelpful to the O'Toole family and I condemn them.  I reiterate that, as I understand it, the leak came from neither those who investigated at the scene of the accident nor from those on duty in the Garda press office when it occurred.

Is the proposal for dealing with the late sitting agreed to?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 12 and 13 without debate agreed to?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. a4, Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2007 — Order for Second Stage and Second and Subsequent Stages, agreed?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	144	In respect of No. a4, while I welcome the fact that this Bill is being brought in, may I ask the Taoiseach was this approved by the Cabinet on Tuesday last?  The reason I ask is there was no contact at all with at least the Fine Gael Party about this matter and one would have thought there would have been such contact out of normal courtesy on a Bill, especially a Bill as sensitive as this, particularly when it was known to the Government that Fine Gael intended to move a private Members’ Bill on Internet grooming.  As the Taoiseach will be aware, in May 1980 a similar situation arose on the Ombudsman (No. 2) Bill.  One does not want to hold up the House from doing its business and one does not want endless repetition on the same issue.  The Government has had to change its tune here.  The Taoiseach would have been aware of the private Members' motion having been submitted, yet the original order circulated stated that the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2007 would be taken at 9 o'clock.  Now the Bill is being taken at 6 o'clock, which has obviously necessitated the Fine Gael Party returning to the Ceann Comhairle seeking authorisation under exceptional circumstances to change the party's private Members' motion at very short notice.  I do not know who is responsible, but it is not the way to do business.  I am quite sure the Taoiseach accepts that this could have been handled far more competently and efficiently.  If the Government had the courtesy to inform Deputies Howlin and Jim O'Keeffe of this matter, perhaps the Taoiseach would not have had to refer to a precedent of 1980 to look for the Ceann Comhairle's authorisation to change private Members' business at short notice.  The Taoiseach might like to clear that up.

Has the Taoiseach considered the wider implications here?  It is welcome that we are closing the loophole, but if we are approaching this sensitive subject in a piecemeal fashion, would it not make sense to sit down in Cabinet and look at the wider implications of Internet use for children?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	147	That does not arise out of this proposal, which is merely on how we deal with the legislation.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	151	The criminal justice (trafficking in persons and sexual offences) Bill, which is a wider Bill covering several of these issues, is being prepared.  The problem is it will not be ready for some weeks, and that would mean that the loophole would not have been closed and perhaps some of the other issues would not have been dealt with either.The request for more time came from the Labour Party Whip and that is why the time was changed.  We are anxious to deal with it tonight.  I will raise with the Tánaiste Deputy Kenny's point, that the Fine Gael Party's spokesperson had not been contacted.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	153	Will the Aviation Regulation Bill, which is due some time in 2007, cover the Government's failure to act on its own promise to see that the airports at Cork and Shannon will be debt free once Aer Rianta is restructured?  The then Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, may not have meant this when he wrote his letter.  It seems there is something radically wrong on the other side of the House——

However, we did not request the time, to gazump private Members' business but so that there would be more time to debate the Bill.  Sometimes the Taoiseach can be too smart.

I speak of the subject matter that was slotted for tonight.  It is considered, I am sure, a matter of great risibility in certain quarters that it was gazumped.  Sometimes if you go through life like that, you will get a long fall off your white steed.Will the Taoiseach clarify the status of the promised legislation for the regulation and control of management companies?  Is that likely to be enacted in the present session?

Recently the Cabinet received a report from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche.  To the best of my knowledge, the legislation is in preparation.  I do not know when it will be available, but they certainly are working on it.  In the autumn we gave it priority.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	216	I move amendment No. 3:
In page 11, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:PART 1TAXPAYERS' ADVOCATE OFFICE1.—The Ombudsman shall include in her annual report a special report on the overpayment of tax by PAYE taxpayers, and on the take up of credits by such taxpayers, and the branch of her office dedicated to ensuring that the take up of credits is readily available to all taxpayers, and refunds made as rapidly as possible where this arises, shall be known as the taxpayers' advocate office.This Labour Party amendment provides for the establishment of a taxpayers' advocate.  The reason for such a role is the well-documented situation which has arisen over the past number of years whereby many taxpayers, and PAYE taxpayers in particular, fail to claim the reliefs and allowances available to them.  I refer in particular to the failure to claim tax relief on medical expenses, refuse charges and several other payments.  People who have professional expertise in preparing tax returns or who can take advantage of professional advice on availing of reliefs tend to claim the maximum to which they are entitled under law.  With regard to pension relief, for example, we know from the debate we held on Committee Stage that the Revenue Commissioners are well-equipped to deliver tax reliefs rapidly to people who have elaborate private pension funds worth several tens of millions of euro once they produce the appropriate documentation.  Even though the Minister for Finance last year curtailed pension reliefs to €5 million, Revenue was able to quickly issue significant numbers of exemption certificates to private pension schemes which exceeded the limits set by the Minister.  However, ordinary PAYE taxpayers who do not have the advantage of expert advice are restricted to a four-year period when claiming reliefs to which they may have been entitled in the past.While the Minister has denied that the structure of claiming is excessively burdensome, certain of his Report Stage amendments are proof of the validity of the argument put forward by the Labour Party.  For the past several years, we have argued that the most notorious example of this issue was medical expenses.  With a threshold in operation, people have to keep all their medical receipts.  A young family may have visited the doctor at the beginning of the tax year and then incurred further medical bills in November or December.  I will not speak for other areas, but the routine GP fee on the north side of Dublin is €50 per person.  Many doctors have discontinued the former practice of charging a single fee when they saw a parent and child together.  Everybody is now charged a separate fee and many GPs also charge a full fee for return visits, so the expenses add up quickly for families.I am glad the Minister has proposed an amendment to section 9 which would further simplify payment procedures by removing both thresholds to relief for medical expenses.  This reform is long overdue and has been brought on the eve of the general election but it is none the less welcome.  The amendment has been brought because the attention of the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners has been drawn to the significant amounts of relief which have gone unclaimed, particularly in respect of PAYE taxpayers.  Estimates of the amount have varied between €200 million and €400 million. The cumulative value of the unclaimed relief could easily be more than €500 million.  We are seeking a change in the playing pitch in favour of the honest, compliant taxpayer who is unable to employ a battery of accountants and tax advisers to create elaborate schemes so that the Revenue can return money to them rapidly and efficiently but who must keep a shoe box full of receipts to qualify for tax relief or retain a record on his or her computer of his or her various expenses.The Minister has repeatedly claimed it is easy for people to claim relief.  However, when Committee Stage concluded the Minister must have done a little research because he swore on Committee Stage that an abolition of thresholds was entirely unnecessary and not something the Revenue would do.  He even hinted the Revenue would find it very difficult to deal with all the claims that would result as a consequence of abandoning the thresholds.  However, on the eve of an election he has accepted the Labour Party's argument and he has tabled an amendment to simplify the repayment procedures for relief on medical expenses by abandoning the threshold.  Anybody who has medical expenses should make sure his or her doctor or practice has a computerised record of such expenses so that a summary can be provided of all the fees paid by an individual, similar to that provided by a chemist.  Once computerised systems are installed in all doctors' surgeries, it will not be long before taxpayers will be able to claim this relief at source through an arrangement similar to that provided for mortgage interest relief.I am glad the Minister has finally accepted the Opposition's argument.  Why, therefore, will he not go the whole hog and provide for a taxpayer's advocate so that somebody independent of the Revenue can examine what it does and point out how to improve the scenario for the ordinary, compliant taxpayer by taking various initiatives and creating a structure that would recognise the excellent work done by the Revenue in recent years to modernise and upgrade its operations?  Text calling is very good and the Revenue's on-line service has been a boon particularly to businesspeople.  It will ultimately be a boon to PAYE taxpayers.  Why not accept the need for an advocate for taxpayers who would have an oversight role?  The Minister replied on Committee Stage that he examined the role of similar offices in other countries such as the US.  However, the issue is the empowerment of taxpayers and citizens.  While the Revenue has awesome legal powers to encourage and, ultimately, force people to pay their taxes, somebody must be in place to champion taxpayers, particularly PAYE workers, so that they receive their just desserts.The Minister could make a mark in his legislative swan song.  While he has ambitions to hold a higher office, I hope that will not happen in the next Dáil and that Opposition Members will be on the opposite side of the fence this time next year.  It would be good if the Minister acknowledged the strength of the Labour Party's case.  A positive development in modern democracies is to allow State offices such as the Revenue, which, properly, has awesome powers, to be overseen by officers who are determined to give individual compliant taxpayers their dues.When we raised this issue first three years ago, the Minister was not even prepared to acknowledge the extent to which people failed to claim their full entitlements.  The Revenue has been sitting on a tidy sum for the past ten years because individuals failed to avail of the relief and allowances to which they were entitled.  The relatively low cost that would arise out of the advocate's function would be easily met by the funds not claimed by taxpayers.  The other reason for the failure to claim relief is the changes in the economy.  People are employed on atypical contracts and work atypical hours.  Some people work two or three jobs on contract and otherwise while others are self-employed, although they could be considered to be employees in traditional terms, particularly those working in the construction, forestry and meat industries.  Hundreds of thousands of people are employed in various circumstances and their tax affairs are complicated.  Because they do not have easy access to an advocacy service, they sometimes ignore their tax affairs and end up with a business disaster or they are put on emergency tax, in which case the Revenue and the main contractor or employer are fine.  Young workers in the construction industry do not pay into a pension fund and they have no savings but they pay plenty of tax.A taxpayer's advocate would address this new feature of business life in Ireland and a better resolution to this problem would be achieved, which would serve these taxpayers well.  The case for such an advocate is very strong.  The Minister has acknowledged the issue in his amendment to section 9 by abolishing the threshold on medical expenses, which will make it much easier for taxpayers.  I hope they will become aware that if they retain their medical bills they will be able to claim tax relief even after one visit to their doctor.  The ordinary taxpayer will be in the same position as those involved in small pension funds who claim significant amounts from the Revenue.  I hope by removing the thresholds, more people will claim what is due to them.  However, there is an absolute case for the creation of an advocate's office.  Hopefully, if the Labour Party is in Government next year, it will be in a position to proceed with that.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19714	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	217	The strongest argument in favour of the establishment of an advocate system is the persistent refusal of the Revenue Commissioners to conduct an appraisal of the overpayment of tax by PAYE workers.  The reality is the Revenue Commissioners have all the information at their finger tips.  They know the amount of activity which occurs in doctors' surgeries, nursing homes and in these other areas and the amount of rent returned by landlords.  They have the data that would allow them to make a well-informed judgment as the extent to which PAYE workers overpay, not some broad-based or speculative estimate, as the Minister indicated from the notes he received.The Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance have never taken this seriously.  It is a bit like the Central Bank beginning to cotton on to the needs of consumers as well as the needs of banks.  The Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance are belatedly cottoning on to the fact that we need to be conscious of the people who compliantly pay their taxes all the time as well as those who deliberately seek to evade paying their taxes.  The Revenue Commissioners need to recognise that their mandate is not only to pursue those miscreants who will not pay but to ensure that people who are entitled to refunds and who genuinely incur tax allowable expenses get them.I cannot understand this argument coming repeatedly from the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance that the numbers would be large, that they would be speculative in nature and that we should not do this.  That is just sticking one's head in the sand and saying to ordinary compliant taxpayers that we are not particularly worried about their situation.  If this money was outstanding from people who had some overseas scam, the Revenue Commissioners would rightly pursue the matter through the High Court to try to establish the scale of entitlement and the scale of tax which might be being concealed from them.There is an imbalance here.  However, the Minister has begun to recognise that because some of the changes he has made in trying to give more tax reliefs at source are clearly conscious of the fact that the way it had been done for generations was not delivering to ordinary compliant taxpayers.Those on the Minister's side of the House and those in official circles who advise him need to recognise they cannot have it both ways.  They cannot say we will not have a tax advocate, do any of the advocacy, dig out what might be overpayment tax, have accurate estimates or create effective vehicles through which people can get their money back.As I said before, I calculated on the back of an envelope that over a four year period of entitlement, €1.5 billion is due to PAYE taxpayers.  If Revenue said that was an accurate estimate, people would move mountains to ensure money got back to those who rightfully own it.  We need to see that change in mindset.  The more I hear people resist the notion of carrying out an accurate estimate, the more convinced I become that advocacy is the only route down which to go.  It looks as if someone with the powers of the Ombudsman is required to take the initiative in this area.Some 91,000 people claim the home carer's allowance.  Are we to seriously believe there are only 91,000 stay-at-home spouses looking after children up to the end of full-time education, the time up to which they are entitled to claim the home carer's allowance?  I do not believe that is the actual figure.  Some people are not claiming that allowance.  The number of people claiming rent relief is far lower than the number of rented properties, as the Central Statistics Office will indicate.  Much rent relief remains unclaimed.  DIRT is another area.  The number of refunds of DIRT is derisory and it is clear people are not claiming it.  Not everyone claims relief on trade union subscriptions.  The Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service did a sum on the back of an envelope which showed that €45 million remains unclaimed in respect of relief on trade union subscriptions.  That would not be major expenditure in comparison with some of the other areas.  We need to make some high profile changes.I warmly welcome the Minister's decision to accept the medical relief change which we debated at length on Committee Stage.  Not only does it mean people will know that every time they spend money on medication or doctor appointments they can claim relief but it also means the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners can set up simplified schemes at source to ensure the deductions are made.  This is significant not only because of what it will do as of today and for the rest of this year but it means the Minister can now work on developing schemes which will be much more effective.  I know from replies to parliamentary questions that the Minister is moving in that direction.  That concession the Minister has made is a good day's work and shows the hours we spend on Committee Stage are sometimes worthwhile.I would like the Minister to ask the Revenue Commissioners to do a serious study on the extent of overpayment by PAYE workers.  Let us work off the best objective information and then see if we can devise better policies.  If that was done, perhaps it would remove the need for this tax advocate.  However, for the time being, this amendment is very much needed.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	218	As was said, we discussed the question of advocacy on the various Stages of Finance Bills.  I outlined the fact the Ombudsman has been able to deal with systemic and policy issues.  The advocates mentioned internationally deal only with administrative matters for individual taxpayers.  That does not address systemic or policy issues, many of which are within the remit of the Ombudsman's office and are not independent of it.  The proliferation of more ombudsmen for every specific problem which people perceive is not the way to go, particularly as the Ombudsman has shown efficacy in this area already in view of previous reports done and changes brought about as a result of those investigations into policy areas.I am not satisfied adding a further layer in regard to the granting of reliefs and repayment of tax would add to the efficiency of the current system.  We have not heard how duplicating the existing role and responsibility of the Ombudsman in this particular respect would result in benefits to anyone involved.There has been much proactive work in this area which, for the purposes of Report Stage, I should put on the record.  The Revenue Commissioners are active in advising taxpayers of their entitlements through various media.  They have recently undertaken an extensive advertising campaign in regard to various reliefs to alert taxpayers to entitlements they may have overlooked claiming.  As a result of that, there has been a big improvement.Every year the tax credit certificate issued to each PAYE customer includes an insert setting out the main allowances and reliefs available.  Apart from that insert, there is an easy to access and comprehensive range of material on allowances and reliefs available on the Revenue website, from Revenue offices and by telephone together with a range of claim forms obtainable by telephone or download for completion.  New on-line and text messaging self-service channels have been rolled out which make it as easy as possible for PAYE customers to establish whether they are getting the reliefs to which they are entitled and to make any additional claims relevant to their circumstances.For those who prefer person to person communication, it is important to point out that there are over 780 PAYE customer service staff available in the regional offices to deal with taxpayers' queries, amend tax credits, process repayments, etc.  That is a considerable commitment of staff on a permanent basis.  Additional staff are used at peak periods when required.  Where Revenue is aware of circumstances which apply beyond one year, the necessary reliefs are carried forward automatically from one year to the next.As announced in my Budget Statement, Revenue developments this year and next year will see the introduction of DIRT-free accounts for the over 65s and incapacitated persons.  That deals with one of the areas cited by Deputy Bruton.  All age-related credits and credits for trade union subscriptions will be given automatically as far as possible.  There will be automatic repayments in respect of certain health expenses, such as drugs and hospital charges, and in respect of tuition fees.It is also important to point out it is not a simple exercise to try to set about estimating what unclaimed amounts there might be.  The Irish Taxation Institute tried to calculate some costings for unclaimed medical expenses during its session with the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  However, it failed to take account of the 800,000 exempt PAYE cases, the fact that one third of the population is covered by medical cards, the overlap between the aforementioned categories, the degree of full reimbursement by medical insurers and the fact that some people are healthy and only have small or no medical expenses.  A purely statistical basis for steering through such difficulties to a valid conclusion is not readily apparent.  Instead, the only sound approach appears to be to undertake detailed sample surveys of a large number of taxpayers.  This would probably involve lengthy face to face interviews in the kind of process followed by the ESRI in its sociological research.  Even with such research, which is extremely time consuming and expensive, the results would not help to direct a single cent to the right person in the form of additional tax refunds.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19714	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	219	Can the Minister ask the Central Statistics Office to include a single question into the household budget survey?  As it collects medical expense data, such a question would shed much light on this issue.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	220	If so doing would be of assistance in trying to assess the position, I can make inquiries into the matter.However, it is not a simple matter to change to a system that operates at source.  One requires a limited number of service providers to be able to so do.  The fact there are thousands of GPs means it would not be as simple as, for example, doing so with the limited number of trade unions in respect of trade union subscriptions.It is important to note that the relief is available at the marginal rate for the taxpayer and to consider giving relief at source would constitute a significant complication.  Existing schemes of relief at source, such as mortgage interest relief and medical insurance relief, are given at the standard rate to all comers.  Consequently, suggesting that relief at source for medical expenses would be a straightforward matter is not comparing like with like.  The marginal rate of relief in respect of medical expenses is not available in respect of some of the other, larger, reliefs that are at the standard rate.  The latter can be developed as tax relief at source because of the limited number of service providers relative to the total number of beneficiaries.  However, there is a far greater number of service providers in respect of medical expenses.Members can discuss the further amendment in respect of getting rid of the de minimis rule.  I listened to Members’ points in this regard and while it will provide for a greater workload etc., I am prepared to accept that we should move to a nil position rather than a €125 de minimis position, subject to the approval of the House.In that case, one should not then suggest that moving to a tax relief at source is a simple, obvious or uncomplicated step.  I have outlined the reasons this is not correct.  Nevertheless, as Deputy Bruton noted, I regard it to be my job to listen to Members' opinions and when I can accommodate a point of view that, on balance, might be the right way to go, I have no problem in so doing.

In a manner that is typical of the modicum of arrogance that creeps in when one has been in Government for ten years, the Minister was somewhat tetchy when he stated, if I heard him correctly, that there is an increasing proliferation of ombudsmen.  I am unaware of such a proliferation.  I am only aware of the State Ombudsman, the Ombudsman for Children and of some attempts to introduce a form of inspectorate to the Garda.  I am unsure whether the inspectors also can be called ombudsmen.  Are there many more?

There is far more than one ombudsman.  Moreover, the Ombudsman has a view on the wholesale division of the role, particularly when she already has a well-established competency in this regard.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	229	There is no proliferation of ombudsmen.  After ten years of debate, Members dragged out from the Government and its predecessor what I hope will be improved arrangements in respect of the Garda.  The tragic case in Lucan over the weekend will demonstrate whether this proves to be the case.  The Ombudsman for Children was established approximately two years ago and is quite active.  It is interesting to compare the Ombudsman for Children with the office of the advocate because my understanding is that in a general sense, she is making attempts to be proactive on children's behalf.  However, given the manner in which it is interpreted at present, as well as the significant capacity restrictions placed on it, the Office of the Ombudsman is obliged to wait until individual cases arise before examining them.  Incidentally, to a great extent this office was established and was a concept developed by the Labour Party as a contribution to governmental practice in Ireland.The Minister referred to systemic problems with the taxation system, which is exactly what is under discussion.  I have provided him with new examples from the new economy, never mind issues such as rent allowances.  In that regard, it may come as a surprise to the Minister that many tenants are highly nervous about claiming tax relief in respect of a landlord who lets a premises to them for personal accommodation, for fear that the landlord does not wish to be known to the Revenue Commissioners.While this may not happen in the constituency the Minister represents, it is a common occurrence in Dublin.  Tenants may consider themselves to be lucky to have accommodation and if the landlord is accommodating and does not wish to be known to the Minister's friends in the Revenue Commissioners, such tenants are actively dissuaded from seeking the tax relief.  An advocate would change that power relationship, in that individuals would receive a higher level of empowerment from the State to get their just entitlements.  This pertains to positive advocacy.As I noted, no one decries the efforts made by the Revenue Commissioners.  Some of the innovations they are road-testing at present will turn out to be excellent.  However, they do not tell the entire story, particularly with regard to those who are working atypical hours, in atypical contracts, or who have multiple jobs.  In addition, people in the construction industry who traditionally would have been employed are now treated as being self-employed and the main contractor has no interest in ensuring they receive all their entitlements.  Why should the contractors do so?Moreover, the Revenue Commissioners have no interest in so doing either.  Such people have tax deducted at source at the standard rate and pay a great deal of tax.  Why should the Revenue Commissioners be concerned if the affairs of such people are never regularised?  Revenue has their money.  However, it is most unlikely that those individuals who end up outside a regular tax position will, for instance, save for a pension or take other options available to them that would offer some tax relief and tax allowances.  As far as many people are concerned, the Minister is not looking at how the economy operates at present.  I hope when there is a change of Government and we are honoured by the people to occupy the place the Minister now occupies, a new Government will address this issue.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19714	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	232	I move amendment No. 8:
In page 11, to delete lines 16 and 17 and substitute the following:1.—In this Part—"Principal Act" means the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997;"special educational needs" has the meaning assigned to it by section 1 of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.".To some degree, we have discussed amendments Nos. 10 to 12, inclusive, already in that those are the amendments which deal with the removal of the €125 threshold in medical expenses claims.  As I stated previously, I welcome the Minister's decision in this respect, as it can make a significant difference to families who incur regular but perhaps small expenses and claim tax relief, the relief which the Oireachtas always intended them to claim.I will address my remarks to the other section of the amendment, namely, the section on special educational needs which is a combination of amendments Nos. 8 and 11.  Amendment No. 8 would provide a definition of special educational needs, while amendment No. 11 would provide that expenses incurred in seeking special education assistance should be tax allowable.  We had a good debate on this issue on Committee Stage when it was recognised by all sides of the House that it was not ideal to provide education resources to meet special educational needs on the basis of tax relief.  It is a mainstream responsibility of the Department of Education and Science and we ought to deliver this service.  It was also recognised to some degree by both sides of the House that we were not anywhere close to this yet.In many areas of special education provision parents must take the initiative.  Examples include establishing schools run with small home tuition grants from the Department of Education and Science but with the bulk of the cost of the school borne directly by parents.  I know of such primary schools for children on the autistic spectrum whose parents believe, rightly, that the applied behavioural analysis, ABA, approach is the best one to advance the needs of such children.  While I do not have personal experience, people in my family involved in education recognise that the ABA approach makes a significant difference to some children.  The Department of Education and Science has not got around to recognising it.  As a result, many parents incur substantial costs in providing for what they believe is the best way for their children, in which they do not receive recognition or support from the State.Many others who need intervention must meet the cost of special tuition through the fees they pay.  In the case of many of the supports available, there are long waiting lists.  The original approach of the Department of Education and Science was to provide psychological assessments.  On the basis of these assessments a schedule of interventions for each child would be agreed.  This proved impossible for the Department to deliver and it moved away from this individualised approach.  Instead, each school must provide for certain special educational needs.  This leaves many parents feeling that they do not receive the attention they require.  That is the reality.  The Department is slowly catching up in dealing with a need which was ignored for years.  It hid behind legal interpretations.  It was only following a series of legal cases that one broke through and gained recognition.In advocating this measure I do not seek it to be a permanent or long-term feature of the tax code.  However, I recognise that in other areas such as dyslexia where many associations have been established and parents come together in groups within the community to try to develop programmes which will have special resonance for children with their particular needs, these schemes must be funded entirely without recognition.  We have scope to be somewhat creative in this respect.  The Minister's predecessor recognised that speech and language therapy should be covered by tax relief.  This has scope as an interim measure while the Department of Education and Science catches up in dealing with a major gap in the provision of special education.It might have been getting close to closing time on the night we discussed this amendment on Committee Stage.  We might have been exhausted when the Minister agreed to consider it and come back to us on Report Stage.  I hope he had a chance to reflect on it and sees merit in it.  If not this year, perhaps he could consider a temporary measure in conjunction with the Department of Education and Science to deal with the many parents who must incur substantial personal expense in delivering what they believe is the most appropriate educational support for their children.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	233	I thank the Minister for introducing amendment No. 10.  Will he now ask the Revenue Commissioners to arrange an information campaign to tell families, in particular, that it will be possible to claim tax relief on all medical expenses and that there is no threshold?  Young families and single individuals who go to the doctor irregularly, perhaps only during the winter flu season, need to know this.  They also need to know that they only have four years in which to claim.  Those who pay €200 to €400 in medical GP bills for themselves and their children could receive €80, depending on their marginal rates of tax.  I hope the Revenue Commissioners will make the information known.Will the Minister agree to have the relief provided at source on a pilot basis by some medical practitioners?  Quite a number of group medical practices are being established, particularly in developing areas such as Dublin West, and are computerised from day one.  I know this is not the case with all general practitioners.  However, a pilot scheme would facilitate the maximum level of claiming medical expenses by those entitled to claim.  We must bear in mind that most chemists have well established systems having been part of the GMS payment schemes for medical expenses.It would be worthwhile to take this measure a step further.  Ultimately, the ideal would be to have tax relief provided at source in order that if one paid €50 to the doctor, one would have the value of the tax relief deducted from the payment and only pay the net amount to the doctor.  It would certainly reduce the cost to families.The Minister may be aware that his colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, was apparently very surprised at the low take-up of the doctor only medical card.  Part of the reason is that the forms and conditions attached are extremely complicated.  As a consequence, few medical cards were issued.  Although the Minister stated previously relatively few families would benefit, the position is different.  A number of families will be in a position to benefit.  It is important that as many of them as possible are able to do so.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	234	I support the amendments before us and the Minister's amendment No. 10, which would seek to remove the €125 threshold.  It remains to be seen under the current system whether this will increase take-up.  I support Deputy Burton's calls for examining mechanisms as regards how this tax relief can be deducted at source.  As the Deputy has stated, the technology and databases exist for this to be done, if not on the widest possible level, then certainly on a pilot basis.I worry about conflicting standards the removal of the €125 threshold might encourage, particularly with regard to the purchase of medicines.  People pay up front and receive a small exemption for the money they pay initially on medicines.  There should be a complete examination of how charges are levied in the health system, both through tax relief and direct charges, to bring about a degree of consistency.The Minister probably was not thinking of that when he agreed to this amendment, but there are conflicting standards within the health system itself affecting people on low incomes, in particular, and those who do not qualify for the medical card.  The threshold for medical cards has not been altered for four years and there is a growing sector of the population without medical cards or medical insurance who are being asked to meet a large portion of their medical expenses from their own resources despite their having very low incomes.The time is now right for a more systematic review of tax relief and charges in this area.  This might spring from the Minister's agreement to allow this concession on Report Stage.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	235	I will speak to amendments Nos. 8 and 10 to 12, inclusive.Two amendments are being proposed, the effect of which would be to remove the de minimis rule so that taxpayers could benefit from a full deduction in respect to their health expenses in the tax year and broaden out significantly the relief on health expenses to include expenses incurred in the provision of assistance to children with a wide range of special educational needs.With regard to the de minimis amount, the amendment in my name achieves the same effect as that proposed by the Deputy.  I presume he will not object to deferring to that amendment.With the relief for special educational needs, the Deputy's proposal to provide tax relief for expenses incurred with regard to children with special educational needs was discussed in some detail in committee.  As with that time, unfortunately I am not in a position to accept the amendments for the reasons I have given.The Government has in recent years significantly increased support available to the direct expenditure system for children with disabilities.  In 2005, approval was given for the Department of Education and Science to move from the individual allocation of resources for children with special needs on foot of a psychological assessment to an approach whereby all schools are allocated resources based on a general allocation model, without the need for individual psychological assessments for the high-incidence categories of needs.  These would include dyslexia and mild or borderline mild general learning disability.My understanding, from information received from the Department of Education and Science, is the new allocation system is working well and has been favourably received by schools.  In all, it is projected that some €820 million of the 2007 Estimates allocation for the Department of Education and Science will be related to disability and special needs at primary and secondary schools.The bulk of this expenditure is related to resource teaching posts and special needs assistance in schools.  The current provision to support children with special educational needs in schools includes more than 1,000 teachers in special schools and more than 5,500 teachers at primary level dealing directly with children with special educational needs.  This compares with fewer than 1,500 ten years ago.At second level, more than 2,300 whole-time equivalent teachers are working with pupils with special educational needs compared to just 200 in place in 1998 for such pupils.  There are more than 8,200 special needs assistants supporting pupils in primary and post-primary schools.  There has been a very significant and needed improvement in the resources allocated with regard to teaching requirements for children with special needs.As with many areas where State support may be required, the question arises as to whether such support may be more effectively provided through the direct expenditure route rather than the tax system.  One advantage of the direct expenditure route is that the support may be better targeted at those in need, irrespective of family income.  Support through the tax system can only benefit those whose incomes are high enough to benefit from tax relief.It may be argued there is no reason, in principle, health expenses relief could not accommodate expenses of the type proposed by the Deputy, having regard to the fact that since 2001, the relief covers the expenses involved in obtaining educational and psychological assessments and speech and language therapy carried out by a speech and language therapist.  However, further widening of the relief as proposed would broaden health expense relief considerably beyond its original intended focus.  It would duplicate the provision through the current direct expenditure route.Having regard to the existing support provided through the public expenditure system and the fact that such support is more equitable than support provided through the tax system, as well as the views of the Department of Education and Science that the new system of resource allocation in schools for children with special needs is working well and bedding down, the case for a change in legislation is not one I can accept.With regard to the other contributions from Deputy Boyle, there has been a significant improvement in the drugs payment scheme, which came in during my time as Minister responsible for health.  Before that, people had to wait three months, apply to the health board and wait for the administrative delays involved in that for any expenses over £90.  That has now been turned around, with people paying up to a certain amount, after which they receive medicines free.  That has been very helpful to working families, who did not then have to dispose of their income for three months before being able to get a refund.  The situation has turned around for those who would require medicines beyond the existing threshold.It would be very unusual to make tax relief available to some taxpayers but not others based on GPs being in a pilot scheme.  Two factors go against the tax relief at source for GP fees.  First, there would be a multiplicity of GP payees involved and second, the relief would be at a marginal rate, unlike the universal application of standard-rate relief for existing examples of tax relief at source.  I made that point in an earlier contribution.

He does not need relief for medical expenses, or I hope not anyhow.I take the Minister's point that the ideal would be to deliver education provision in the education setting.  In his comments, the Minister recognised that we have already broadened the concessions to include people who need to fund psychological assessments.  We already recognise the need to fund speech and language therapy.There is a certain logic in supporting parents, particularly those who group together, such as in the Dyslexia Association of Ireland, to put on programmes at their own expense.  There is a case for giving a concession in that field.  I acknowledge that will not get through this year, but I hope the Minister or his successor, whomever that might be, will keep this issue under consideration.I support the suggestion by Deputy Boyle that we should consider the totality of relief with regard to health expenses and activities.  For a number of years the Government has funded through tax reliefs the development of private nursing homes, hospitals and——

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	243	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."The primary purpose of this short Bill is to remedy an error in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006.  The particular point with which we are dealing was brought to my attention last week by Deputy Rabbitte, for which I thank him.  It was a drafting error for which I am politically accountable and regretful.  While the error is not as significant as has been claimed in some quarters, I have decided to act quickly and decisively to ensure the legislation on the Statute Book is as the Oireachtas intended because the error is a material anomaly in our law.What gave rise to the Bill was the fact that section 6 of the 1993 Act was not updated when some of the sexual offences for which it would be an offence to solicit or importune another person for the purpose of the commission of a sexual act were repealed.  To understand the reason for the offence at section 6 in the 1993 Act one must examine section 7 which deals with soliciting or importuning for the purposes of prostitution.  Before the 1993 Act, there had been no provision similar to section 6.  When the 1993 Bill was being drafted, it was considered that some types of soliciting might not be caught by section 7 and that it was advisable to bridge a potential gap by protecting children and mentally impaired persons from being solicited for sex in circumstances that might not amount to prostitution.  While the fact that section 6 was enacted is evidence of changing times and greater awareness of the dangers of child sexual abuse, it was still enacted as a summary offence that to some extent paralleled the section 7 provision which made it an offence to solicit or importune for the purposes of prostitution.Around 2000 there was concern about the low penalty for soliciting for the purposes of prostitution where the person solicited was a child.  It was always the case in Ireland that there was no distinction in law between soliciting a child or adult for prostitution.  Where soliciting a child led to actual sexual abuse, the penalties were and still are severe.  It was decided to amend section 6 in the Children Act by stating it did not matter whether the soliciting was for the purposes of prostitution.  This meant that soliciting a child for the purposes of prostitution attracted the higher penalty set out in section 6.  Advantage was taken to increase the fine to the maximum then allowed in the District Court and add the offence at section 2 of the 1935 Act to the offences comprehended by the section.  Nonetheless, the offence remained a summary offence triable only in the District Court.  Consequently, it could not be tried on indictment and all offences needed to be dealt with within six months of the date of commission.While the original offence at section 6 was a summary offence for which there was no power of detention for questioning, we must recognise that with modern technology, new impersonal ways of soliciting children have emerged.  I have decided to take the opportunity to provide for conviction on indictment with a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment.  The offence will be an arrestable offence, which means the Garda will have the power to detain suspects for questioning.I have also made a closer examination of the offences for which it will be an offence to solicit or importune another for the purposes of the commission of a sexual offence.  Currently, under last year's Act, they are the most serious of offences of child sexual abuse such as sexual intercourse and buggery.  It is also an offence to solicit or importune a mentally impaired person for the purposes of having sexual intercourse or to attempt to commit buggery.  A person soliciting a child or mentally impaired person to commit a sexual act that does not fall into the most serious category but that is still objectively serious was not criminalised under section 6.  Therefore, I have added sexual assault to the list of offences in that section.  This is reflected in section 2 of the Bill.  In this respect, the Bill differs from the Bill the Labour Party circulated helpfully on Friday.  It has been necessary to split the section into two subsections.  In the case of sexual assault, we are only concerned with protecting children, but we are protecting adults as well as children in the case of mentally impaired persons.Section 3 mirrors section 6 of the 2006 Act.  As the offence of soliciting or importuning in section 6 of the 1993 Act is not an offence included in the 2006 Act, it is necessary in this Bill to make separate provision for it.  This will ensure provisions in the Criminal Law (Rape) Act 1981 concerning matters such as the exclusion of the public from the court, preliminary examination, restriction of evidence and anonymity will apply in cases where a person is tried for soliciting or importuning a child or mentally impaired person for the purposes of the commission of a sexual offence.  It also provides for separate legal representation and legal aid in the circumstances provided in the insertion into the 1981 Act by the Sex Offenders Act 2001.  As the offence was previously a minor offence, it was not seen as appropriate until now to make such provision.  At subsection (4) provision is made for free legal advice for complainants in the prosecution of offences of soliciting and importuning under section 6 of the 1993 Act.  This is done by way of amendment to the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995.Section 4 provides for the amendment of certain enactments.  It mirrors section 7 of the 2006 Act and is required for the same reason for which section 3 is required.  Four Acts are being amended, the first of which is the Criminal Evidence Act 1992.  The offence at section 6 of the 1993 Act is being included in the definition of "sexual offence" in the Criminal Evidence Act.  This means that the provisions in the 1992 Act under which, for example, children can give evidence in court through a television link or an intermediary in trials for sexual or violent offences will apply where a person is charged under section 6 of the 1993 Act.  This was not the case previously.The second Act amended by the section is the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Act 1996 which made it possible to charge in the State persons who were Irish citizens or persons ordinarily resident here alleged to have committed sexual offences against a child in another country.  An offence must be an offence both in this country and the country in which it is alleged to have taken place.  The offences are listed in the Schedule to the 1996 Act but do not include an offence under section 6 of the 1993 Act.  The effect of this amendment is to add the offence to the Schedule.The third Act being amended is the Bail Act 1997.  As it is proposed to make the offence an indictable or serious offence, it is appropriate that it be comprehended by the Bail Act provisions under which it is more difficult to obtain bail.The fourth Act being amended is the Sex Offenders Act 2001, to which I have made a brief reference.  The Schedule to that Act contains a long list of offences, in respect of which conviction entails an obligation to sign the sex offenders register.  The offence under section 6 of the 1993 Act is being added to the list.  However, it has wider implications than simply being required to register.  It will be possible for the Garda to apply to the court for a civil sex offenders order where a person has a conviction under section 6 of the 1993 Act, assuming all the conditions of Part 3 of the 2001 Act have been met.  Part 4 of the 2001 Act places obligations on persons with a conviction for a sexual offence, including in future an offence under section 6 of the 1993 Act, when applying for work entailing unsupervised access to children.  A judge will be able to impose post-release supervision in accordance with Part 5 of the 2001 Act on any person convicted of a section 6 offence.Section 5 increases the penalties in section 3 of the 2006 Act for the offence of attempting to carnally know a person under 17 years of age.  Without this amendment, the penalty for attempting to carnally know such a person would actually be less than the proposed penalty for soliciting or importuning, which would introduce a new and unnecessary anomaly into the penalty structure for sexual offences.As Deputies are aware, making soliciting or importuning a child or mentally impaired person for the purposes of the commission of a sexual offence an indictable offence has far greater implications than simply increasing the penalty.  It means that it is now included in the group of the more serious sexual offences and all that entails.  The consequential amendments it has been necessary to make in the Bill are evidence of this.  They are also evidence of the complex and convoluted nature of the way our criminal laws governing sexual offences have evolved during the years.  They are a perfect example of the need for codification of our criminal law, a project that has been commenced with the establishment of the Criminal Law Codification Advisory Committee.Whereas my officials and I overlooked this issue last year, it is also true to say an all-party committee examined the 2006 legislation.  Even when the Director of Public Prosecutions appeared before the committee, no one saw the point raised by Deputy Rabbitte.  It shows that when one scatters legislation across a number of statutes, it is possible to make such an error.  Fine Gael Members had intended using their Private Members' time this evening to debate a Bill which would have introduced a sexual grooming offence.  I decided to accept the Fine Gael Bill in principle.  I thought it better not to waste time with two debates on the sexual abuse of children in which a certain amount of overlap would develop.  Accordingly, I have decided to incorporate the substance of the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill into this Bill, and this I did in section 6.  When I decided to do this I thought, optimistically, that I could simply lift the provisions in the Private Members' Bill and transfer them without amendment to this Bill — and, if necessary, tidy up minor drafting points when I produce my own proposals on sexual grooming in the context of the trafficking Bill now being prepared in the Attorney General's office.  I took this view in the knowledge that much of the Private Members' Bill was based closely on the British legislation.  However, on closer scrutiny I have been obliged to make a few changes to make the offence operable, and the Members opposite may be interested in the changes that are necessary.The Private Members' Bill would have allowed for universal jurisdiction.  In other words, persons with no connections to this country could be prosecuted here for committing an offence anywhere in the world.  Such a provision, the Attorney General advises me, would fall foul of our Constitution.  Before Ireland can exercise jurisdiction, there must be some connection, however slight, to this country.  Therefore, for an offence of meeting a child, or travelling to meet a child, for the purpose of doing anything that would constitute a sexual offence, such activity would have to take place within the State or, if outside the State, the person would have to be an Irish citizen or ordinarily resident here.  That is a standard provision, similar to rest of our sexual offences extraterritorial legislation as set out in the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Act 1996.To commit an offence under the Private Members' Bill a person would have to either meet the child or travel to meet the child.  In other words, the person would have had to be intercepted before meeting the child.  I agree with that as a proposition and am not criticising it.  However, the wording in that Bill in section 3A(1)(b) which it was proposed to insert into the 1998 Act assumed that a meeting had, in fact, taken place.  It refers to doing or intending to do anything which would constitute sexual exploitation, either during or after the meeting.  I have tidied up that aspect somewhat.One other substantive point I have tidied up is to insert the word "sexual" into the definition of "sexual exploitation" at paragraph (c).  Otherwise, the offence of sexual exploitation could be deemed to be committed by a person who invited, induced or coerced a child to participate in any activity which is any type of offence under any enactment.  I know that Fine Gael did not intend that.  I have also made some minor drafting and presentational changes which there is no need for me to dwell on here.I have read and heard some comments over the last few days to the effect that children have been left unprotected against the nefarious activities of sexual predators.  Even leaving aside for a moment that section 6 of the 1993 Act is rarely, if ever, used to convict persons, there is no shortage of more serious offences which the Garda can use to charge persons.  The Criminal Law Act 1997 restated the general law that any person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of an indictable offence is liable to be indicted, tried and punished as a principal offender.  The Sex Offenders Act, in its Schedule, makes it an offence to aid, abet, counsel, procure or incite the commission of an offence.  The Schedule contains a comprehensive list of sexual offences against children including those created in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006, which we passed into law last year.In addition, the definition of "child pornography" in the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 includes any visual representation or description of, or information relating to, a child that indicates or implies that the child is available to be used for the purpose of sexual exploitation irrespective of how or through what medium the representation, description or information has been produced, transmitted or conveyed.  This provision was included specifically to criminalise paedophile networks passing information to one another over the Internet, although it has much wider application about the availability of a child to be sexually abused.  Transmitting that information would be deemed to be distributing child pornography and carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.The 1998 Act also made it an offence to take, detain or restrict the personal liberty of a child for the purpose of his or her sexual exploitation, to use the child for such a purpose, to organise or, more particularly, knowingly facilitate such taking, detaining, restricting or use.  This offence also carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.As regards matters that arose at Leaders' Questions or on the Order of Business today, I have discussed with the Attorney General the point again raised, I believe, by Deputy Rabbitte — I was not in the House when it happened.  There is no need in offences relating to children to constantly recite that an honest mistake is a defence in relation to legislation that this House is now passing.  If one goes back to the CC case, it decided that one section of the 1935 Act was, because of its legislative history, only capable of being interpreted as excluding that defence, and therefore that it was inconsistent with the Constitution.  Another section of that Act, which dealt with indecent assault, because it did not have that particular legislative history and although it was silent on that issue, was held by the Supreme Court to be compatible with the Constitution.  Legislation enacted post the Constitution is always to be construed as a primary canon of construction, as consistent with the Constitution.  I am not commenting on whether it applies everywhere, but to the extent that the defence of honest mistake is necessary in any particular case regarding a post-1937 statute, every such statute is to be construed on the basis that it has a constitutional meaning and is not to be construed unconstitutionally.  If an Act post-1937 is silent on the issue of honest mistake and if the Supreme Court or any court approaching it decides that it is constitutionally necessary to impute a mens rea honest mistake defence, the court is obliged, as a matter of constitutional construction, to accord it to that statute.  That was my understanding of the matter.  I spoke to the Attorney General this evening and it is his understanding of it too.  Therefore it is not incumbent on this House to constantly stamp every offence relating to a child with an honest mistake defence.  If we start doing it we then raise implications in other places where we had not done it, such as selling cigarettes to children and the like, indicating that somehow we were making a differentiation.  All of that could lead to complexity which is not there.  Another point is that if we change the Constitution to permit all of this, then we will be able to provide by simple statute that where, in relation to a whole series of offences it might have been the case that honest mistake was to be available as a defence, that it should not be so in the future.I will recite all the provisions in the Statute Book that protect children against sexual abuse and severely punish abusers.  It is enough for me to say that the Garda authorities have advised me that current criminal law contains a major series of offences punishable by very severe penalties for any person who, aids, abets, counsels or procures or attempts to commit a sexual offence against a child, who organises the use of a child for such purpose or who distributes such information about a child whether by Internet, phone, text message or otherwise.  A comprehensive protection mechanism exists, but in all frankness, the simple request to a child was only criminalised by this summary offence.  That was the significance of section 6.  It was the only case where a simple request to a child, without any other act which would amount in law to an attempt, was criminal.  As the House will know, the law of attempt is slightly complicated.  There have to be preparatory acts and matters must go beyond a certain point.  It was doubtful in my mind as to whether a simple request would, of itself, amount to an attempt.  For that reason I believe it is important to make the law very clear.To sum up, this is a short Bill and essentially two issues are involved.  I do not want to play down the importance of rectifying the regrettable omission in the 2006 Act and neither do I want to exaggerate the importance of a provision which, may seem significant, but which has not been used to convict any person over the last few years and probably beyond that.  Not to bring forward this Bill would leave a gap in the law.  It has also proved an opportunity to introduce into Irish law to a limited extent the offence of meeting or travelling to meet a child following sexual grooming and to make an amendment to the Child Pornography Act, to add a protection for children.The Fine Gael Private Members' Bill was very helpful legislation.  However, even its drafters would concede, I believe, that there are probably more complex provisions — they are currently being worked on in the Office of the Attorney General — relating to the substance of grooming, in other words engaging with a child and trying to create a relationship of confidence with him or her with a view to sexually exploiting the child, which will require extremely careful drafting.  I do not doubt that the Fine Gael official who drafted the Private Members' Bill did not want to go down that road.  Totally innocent people could be criminalised if the balance is not 100% right.  A great deal of thought and research is needed to ensure we do not create a monster when trying to chase people who are monsters.The Government intends to revisit the grooming issue with a more comprehensive statute.  Given that Fine Gael's Private Members' Bill came up with two measures which are undoubtedly an improvement on the present law, it would have been wrong of us to reject it or to fail to give it a speedy passage.  We have accelerated its passage into law by adopting its provisions as part of the Government Bill, rather than simply accepting it.  No party in this House has a monopoly on caring about protecting children from sexual assault.

#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	246	I am happy to support the Government's attempt to close the gap in the law relating to the soliciting and importuning of children for sexual purposes.  Our colleagues in the Labour Party did a service to the House and the country last week when they pointed out a loophole that inadvertently resulted from emergency legislation introduced last year.  It is important that we close the gap as soon as we can.I am pleased that the Minister, Deputy McDowell, has decided to adopt Fine Gael's proposals to outlaw Internet grooming.  I accept the minor drafting changes he has suggested.  While I am keen to see these measures enacted into law, we should think twice about the notion of dealing with such important issues by means of emergency legislation.  I would not like it to become a regular practice.  If these important issues are not dealt with in a studied and considered manner, it is possible — if not probable or inevitable — that there will be a recurrence of the unfortunate consequences of the 2006 emergency legislation.  Emergency legislation is not the best way to deal with important issues such as child protection.Fine Gael has expressed its support for the introduction of child protection measures.  It has made it clear, at the all-party committee and elsewhere, that it supports the introduction of a zone of absolute protection, the need for which has been highlighted by its party leader, Deputy Kenny.  It has resisted the Government's attempts to lower the age of consent.  The referendum on child protection issues sought by Fine Gael seems to have been lost among the broader child welfare issues which have arisen.  It seems almost certain that the referendum on child protection cannot take place during the term of the current Government.It is important to approach all these issues in a measured fashion.  With all due respect to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I am not sure his approach to these issues could be considered measured.  When last year's problem arose, he claimed there was no black hole in the law on statutory rape.  While he was uttering such platitudes on national radio, the High Court was getting ready to let child rapists walk free under the huge gap in the law that had opened in the absence of preparation or contingency plans on the part of the Government.  While the Government floundered, the Opposition spoke of the need to close the black hole I have mentioned.  Rather than concentrating on how best to do that, the Minister, Deputy McDowell, continued in denial until the last minute, when he decided that a change had to be made.The most recent Fine Gael Bill on child protection, which contains measures for dealing with Internet grooming, has had a happier fate than my previous Bill on the same issue.  The Government has accepted the legislation on this occasion, whereas the last time I presented a Bill on child protection, it was leaked to the newspapers.  We should all work in a measured way to achieve the best outcome in the area of child protection.  Nobody should claim to have a monopoly of care in this regard.  All of us should be prepared to be judged on our records.  A harsh judgment may be delivered on the Government and particularly the Minister, Deputy McDowell, based on their record.Last week, Deputy Rabbitte highlighted the removal of certain provisions relating to the soliciting or importuning of children for sexual purposes.  While the Minister can argue that many people looked at the Bill in question, he is responsible for ensuring that legislation is constitutionally and legally sound.  He can avail of his experience in this area, the support of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the advice of the many staff in the Office of the Attorney General.  We are about to close this gap, which was allowed to develop even though such assistance was available.When the Minister spoke about this gap, he made a highly insensitive reference to the soliciting or importuning of a child for sexual purpose as "a minor offence".  I presume he was speaking in legal terms about the fact that the offence in question was a summary offence in the District Court.  He should think of the children who have been subject to approaches from predatory adults and the parents whose children have been in such situations.  Any suggestion that such a predatory approach could be referred to as "a minor offence" would be highly insensitive.  I am glad we are taking the opportunity in this legislation to ensure that the offences which are being reinstated can be dealt with on indictment, with serious consequences in terms of the length of imprisonment to be served.I would like to speak about the Internet grooming element of the Bill.  I am quite familiar with this section of the Bill because I wrote it approximately three years ago.  Insufficient attention has been paid to the problem of Internet grooming.  The use of the Internet, which has infiltrated youth culture in particular, has not been dealt with in legislation.  The obvious evidence of serious Internet grooming has been ignored.  It is quite clear that Internet grooming has not been a criminal offence.  I have always believed that predatory adults were using the Internet for the purpose of luring children into a false sense of security with their only objective being to arrange meetings with children for the purpose of sexual exploitation.  While it is not known how widespread this practice is, the article in last Sunday's The Sunday Tribune brought the issue home.  The author of the article, Mick McCaffrey, had been released after being arrested and was able to devote his talents to an investigative story.  The information he gleaned and the responses to the approaches he made are quite appalling to anybody and opened an appalling vista of the kind of activity that is going on in our society.  It brings home to us the absolute need to make this a serious criminal offence in order to try and stop these people engaging in such heinous activity.The Minister referred to a precedent in UK legislation and I agree that one should not need to reinvent the wheel.  I plead guilty to looking at the legislation and policies in other countries relating to all aspects of the criminal justice system.  We have much to learn about policies on criminal justice and on legislation from tried and tested methods in other countries.  The Fine Gael Bill drew largely on the UK legislation.  Such legislation works in the United Kingdom and there is no reason such legislation should not work here.  I do not suggest it is the complete answer as there are other aspects of Internet grooming which need to be dealt with but this is one clear and sure way of bringing to justice those who are involved in such activity.I am pleased the Minister has taken the Fine Gael Bill on board.  I had been told to expect a copy of the emergency legislation from the Minister yesterday and I made some inquiries.  I did not receive any telephone calls and I did not see the draft legislation until this morning.  The Minister might have considered sending a text to say he was working on it and that he was adopting our proposals.  However, it is better late than never and the legislation is now before the House.  We should deal with it in as sensible a way as possible.When I saw that the Minister had taken the Fine Gael proposal on board and adopted it virtually line for line and word for word, I decided to withdraw the Private Member's Bill as I did not see any point in duplication.  I also was aware that the Minister could not move his Bill tonight while my Bill was before the House.  There is a precedent in this House that there cannot be a duplication of legislation.  I discovered that the Minister would have required a special motion to move his Bill tonight because it would have been duplicitous of the Fine Gael Bill.  This was another reason for clearing the Fine Gael Bill off the stocks since it was to be incorporated into the Government Bill and this would ensure that the provisions would be passed.  I am well aware that legislation from the Opposition benches generally has very little chance of being passed and I was particularly keen to ensure that with regard to such an important area of child protection there was law on this matter.It is important for the Government to clarify its position with regard to the clear decision on the referendum made by the all-party committee on child protection.  The Fine Gael leader, Deputy Kenny, has made it clear that we want to see the legislation on child protection and the necessary referendum to underpin that legislation in place as soon as possible.  I now have a real concern that because the welfare issues as enunciated by the Taoiseach were thrown into the mix the referendum on child protection will not be held in the near future.  The Government appears to have made up its mind that it would not run the referendum on child protection on its own.  For that reason, those of us in Opposition are forced to raise questions on the broader issues.  The issues relating to child protection had been carefully examined but perhaps the safeguards to be put in place on the issue of soft information had not been sufficiently examined.  In my letter to the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, I stated the aspect that needed to be clarified was how this was to be dealt with in legislation.The referendum was ready to run but it now seems that it will founder because of the add-on aspects regarding child welfare.  We will end up with no referendum and no legislation on that issue in the short term, during the term of this Government.  I am not happy with this outcome.  I want to get to the heart of the issue to ensure the child protection measures, in so far as we can, are on the Statute Book and are constitutionally sound.  This proposed legislation is a related matter in its aspect of child protection.I am happy to support these measures.  I am not happy that they are all being passed in one sitting.  Neither the Minister nor the Government has given any clear explanation why there is not a pause in order to ensure the legislation is absolutely right.  I had not seen the measures relating to importuning and soliciting until this morning.  I had the opportunity to consider the other issues fully three years ago.  I wish to put down a marker.  I support the reinstatement and the extension of the offences relating to importuning and soliciting.  However, Committee Stage of the Bill could be taken tomorrow or Thursday and people would have an opportunity of careful consideration.  It is vitally important that whatever legislation is put in place now will stand up to the rigours of questioning before the courts.  The Minister knows better than most and he has a lot more experience than I have of the Central Criminal Court.  He knows the abilities of the lawyers who will test not just the Bill and its sections but every word and phrase in it.I refer to an article by Fergus Finlay on this issue in today's Irish Examiner.  He quoted the Minister on the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006 — the emergency legislation of last year — as stating: “When the dust settles and the frenzy is over it will be seen that my colleagues in Government, myself and the Attorney General, have acted competently, honestly, truthfully and with the best interests of the children in mind.”  Yet, here we are back again with further emergency legislation.  I wonder whether the Minister still feels that particular sentence stands up.Having said all that, I am in favour of the Bill.  Let us get on and deal with it as effectively as we can.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	247	The offence we are seeking to re-enact this evening has had a curious legislative history that I had the opportunity to re-examine today.  It seems, when one reads over the enactments, to have been characterised by some fundamental errors as to its purpose.  It is, however, a serious offence — the offence of soliciting or importuning a child for sex.  It is an offence which I do not believe is a minor one, and one which I believe every citizen would regard to be a serious matter.When I say there were fundamental errors over time in its purpose, I do not expect to hold the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform responsible for the errors of his predecessors.  However, he has a responsibility to account for the current state of affairs.  To be fair, in his opening address, he very fairly accepted responsibility, although pointing to everybody else who could have shared it.  However, the onus and responsibility lies with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who brings legislation before the House.It is worth noting that the legislative history was characterised by four guillotined debates, of which tonight's is but the latest.  As a result, the section in question was never adequately scrutinised or debated by this House.  The offence dates back to 1993, when the then Minister, Mrs. Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, introduced the Criminal Justice (Sexual Offences) Act of that year.  That Act was primarily concerned, in agreement with the Labour Party, with abolishing the offences which criminalised homosexual behaviour between consenting adults, but, consequentially, amendments were required to deal with prostitution and soliciting.The then Minister, Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn, speaking in the debate on 23 June 1993, stated:I have . . . taken the opportunity in the Bill to revise and update the law in relation to prostitution and related offences.  Section 6 creates a new offence of soliciting or importuning for purposes of the commission of a sexual offence.  The offences comprehended by the section are those under section 3, 4 or 5 of this Bill and sections 1 or 2 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 1935.  This section will replace section 1(1) of the Vagrancy Act 1898, under which it was an offence for a male person in any public place to persistently solicit or importune for immoral purposes.Section 6 will protect young persons and mentally impaired persons from being solicited or importuned for sexual purposes, whether heterosexual or homosexual, and whether the person soliciting or importuning is a male or female.  It does not matter whether the soliciting or importuning takes place in a public place or not as the type of offence that could be committed could well be committed in a private residence.  We are all aware that some child sexual abuse is committed by neighbours or friends of the parents of children who are abused and quite often the potential abuser will solicit or importune the child in his own home or even in the child's home.It was clear from Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn's speech that she believed section 6 had nothing to do with prostitution and that the offence was broader in its scope.  Hence the reference she made to neighbours and friends.  However, for such a serious offence, the penalties, as the Minister rightly stated, were minor and the offence was summary.  It is not as if it was a minor offence like loitering.  This was a mistake.There was no clarity on the thinking behind the section because it was not reached due to the guillotine.  In any event, the new offence was prosecuted.  In one year, 2000, there were 55 prosecutions and 34 convictions — that year is as far back as the record can go.  Some 40 of those prosecutions were in Dublin, with 15 in the south east, and, interestingly, there were no prosecutions in the other regions.  Then, in 2001, an amendment to the 1993 Act was made by section 250 of the Children Act.  This amendment repeated, more or less exactly, the words of the 1993 Act introduced by Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn, but with the insertion of one new phrase, "(whether or not for the purposes of prostitution)".  The offence would now read that "a person who solicits or importunes another person (whether or not for the purposes of prostitution) for the purposes of the commission of an act which would constitute an offence" is guilty of an offence.  It seems the amendment was designed to make it crystal clear what was intended in 1993, namely, that the offence had nothing to do with prostitution and everything to do with protecting children against exploitation.I read the explanatory note that accompanied the Children Act 2001 but, bizarrely, it stated the exact opposite.  The explanatory noted stated: "Section 250 proposes a new offence which provides a higher penalty for soliciting or importuning a child for the purpose of prostitution".  This is bizarre.  In fact, the section did not create any new offence and merely restated the 1993 offence.  Again, the section was not debated or referred to on any Second Stage or Committee Stage debate, and the debate itself was guillotined.  If the Minister has access to the briefing notes prepared for that debate, he should explain to the House whether the draftsman was correct or whether the author of the explanatory memorandum was correct, and what was intended.Whatever the reason for the confusion, the enactment of the amending legislation seems to have coincided with a dramatic reduction in prosecutions for the offence, a point on which the Minister has taken many opportunities in the past few days to present this as being a minor offence.  I do not know why, but since the enactment of the Children Act 2001 this offence seems to have fallen away.  Part 12 of the Children Act, which includes section 250, came into operation on 1 May 2002.  The Garda annual reports show that from 55 prosecutions the previous year, there were just two prosecutions in 2001, none in 2002, two in 2003, none in 2004 and none in 2005, the last year for which we have published data.  There is no explanation in the reports as to why there was a sudden fall off in prosecutions from more than 50 cases a year to virtually none.  Why did this happen?  It is hardly as if the practice ceased or the behaviour stopped.As I have said, the main thrust of that amendment was to broaden the offence by making it clear that the soliciting and importuning did not have to be connected in any way.  This was the intention in Ms Geoghegan Quinn's 1993 Act but the later amendment made the position crystal clear.  In reality, however, that clarification or expansion never had the effect of leading to more prosecutions.  In fact, since the 2001 Act, prosecutions under this offence have largely dried up, as the Minister pointed out.  There may have been a change in either policing or prosecution policy following the 2001 amendment.  If so, who made that policy decision and who had authority to issue a directive that an offence should not be prosecuted?  Perhaps it is simply a matter of recording information differently but I would be interested to hear the view of the Minister as to what he regards as a serious enough offence to require the introduction of emergency legislation to reinstate, and why, having had a record of prosecution from its initial enactment in 1993, prosecutions should dry up in recent times.We then had the third guillotined debate, which was on the emergency legislation introduced last year.  When that legislation was brought to the House, there was an interesting debate, which I reread today.  It is enlightening to reread it in the light of yet another emergency enactment to protect children being presented to the House.  As I said during the debate last year, from the time the Supreme Court delivered its original judgment the Labour Party position was crystal clear, namely that temporary legislation should be introduced to close the loophole caused by the Supreme Court decision relating to the 1935 Act.  Unfortunately, the Government rejected the Labour Party's careful, staged and reasonable proposition and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform introduced a single measure which went well beyond the requirement to close the loophole in the 1935 Act.  I said at the time that the Minister was introducing a permanent measure without a sunset clause and if that approach was to be taken it must be with great care.  In several fundamental areas the Bill he introduced fell far short of that standard.The Minister said he had been thinking overnight on the subject and introduced amendments accordingly.  That is no way to introduce fundamental law, particularly law that protects our children.  We face emergency legislation yet again because we never had the time to properly scrutinise the measures involved.  The Minister is correct to say we need a consolidation Act to reinstate in a joined up, clear way all the enactments to protect children against sexual deviancy and predation.  It should be done as a matter of urgency and I am aware work is under way in the Minister's Department in that regard.I will not rehearse the full debate because I do not have time but much of it bears repeating tonight.  I said that rushed law was normally flawed, if not outright bad law.  I said the Bill attempting to address the requirements of the constitutional decision of the Supreme Court was flawed and that the Minister was introducing fundamental laws into this House which he would later regret.  We have reached a point of regret tonight.I will deal with an issue raised earlier in the day by the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Rabbitte, which was addressed in the Minister's opening remarks.  I listened to his detailed legal response to a very important point but I have not had time to take advices on the matter or to make sure the Minister is right.  We will not have time to reflect on it during the course of the debate in the House and that is not a good way to bring certainty to such matters.  The leader of the Labour Party gave an account of what happened last year, when the Supreme Court judgment struck down as unconstitutional an offence under the 1935 legislation prohibiting unlawful carnal knowledge of a child.  The offence, as the House will recall, was struck down because it concerned absolute liability and did not allow a defendant the defence of honest mistake.  The fact that a defendant believed a child was over age was irrelevant to that offence.  The Supreme Court held that, in the context of serious offences involving moral blame, there had to be a defence for a person in that situation.  I will not repeat everything the leader of the Labour Party said but it is clearly on the record.The Minister is a learned counsel and I am not.  I ask him to correct me if I misheard but he said the 1935 Act was constitutionally flawed because it predated the Constitution and enactments subsequent to the passing of our Constitution were deemed to have constitutional effect.  The honest mistake provision would be applied automatically to the courts and did not need to be recited directly in the legislation.  Is that correct?

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	249	I may oversimplify the matter but we need to get it clear before Committee Stage because we are expected to draft amendments to the Bill.  I am advised that defences are put into Acts which create offences not just because they are required by the Constitution but so that we in this House, the elected Members of the Oireachtas, can define the substance of those defences, instead of leaving the courts to make determinations without our guidance.  If the courts are obliged to read a defence of honest mistake into this Bill, as the Minister indicated to the House, on whom will the burden of proof lie?  Will the prosecution have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant was aware that a child was under age or will it be for the defendant to prove on the balance of probability that he was not?  If we legislate on the question we can specify what the rule should be.  If we do not we leave it open to individual judges to make the determination.In the absence of legislation putting the burden on the defendant, it is open to the courts to decide that the absence of honest mistake must be proved by the prosecution, rather than the reverse having to be proved by the defence.  If the courts are required to rule on the issue rather than the Legislature, will the defence be one of honest mistake or one of honest and reasonable mistake, which we could determine?  Will it be enough for a defendant to be honestly mistaken about a child's age or will he have to show that, in all the circumstances, it was reasonable to make that mistake?  These are issues which will bedevil prosecutions under tonight's Bill if we do not take it upon ourselves to deal with the issue in the legislation.  I would have liked more time to take better and longer advices on these matters, rather than having to respond to the Minister's speech on Second Stage without even having left the Chamber.These are important issues which we must get right.  I reject the Minister's claim, "Leaving aside for a moment that section 6 of the 1993 Act is rarely, if ever, used to convict persons, there is no shortage of more serious offences which the Garda can use to charge persons".  Such offences do not exist for certain types of crime.  For example, there is none for the man who hangs around outside a public lavatory or a school and approaches a child and importunes the child for sex.  Unless a sexual act is committed, Internet-related and other law does not come into effect.  We need this serious offence as a stand alone offence on our Statute Book.  The Minister must agree with that or we would not be in the House tonight.  It would be a catastrophe if, on the fourth attempt to deal with this matter, we made another mistake in a guillotined debate and the case was made in court that the burden of proof rested not with the defendant but with the prosecution.We asked that the legal advices from the Attorney General be presented to us in advance of the debate but that did not happen.  We have had to absorb the Attorney General's response to the Tánaiste, and that of his own legal expert advisers, but those two authorities were wrong last year.  They were wrong on another serious matter, which I will not deal with on Second Stage but will on Committee Stage, namely the knocking down of the offence of abuse of a minor.  That was one of the main offences used to prosecute offenders connected with the Ferns Report.  God knows that, given my geographical location, I am familiar with those offences.  Gross indecency against a minor under the age of 15 was, I believe inadvertently, knocked down last year.  The Minister originally said that was not the case, then that it was and, more recently, that he had intended to knock it down because it was not gender neutral.  However, we need that offence and hope to have time on Committee Stage to discuss it.These are important issues and there is a responsibility on us to get it right.  The public will not countenance another cock-up relating to the protection these Houses put in place for vulnerable and innocent children.  I regret we will have inadequate time to tease out the issue satisfactorily.  I greatly regret that we may be obliged to revisit these issues and engage in a more in-depth debate on them when further loopholes are identified.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	250	I move:That Dáil Éireann,notes that Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions have grown by 25% since 1990, with transport emission growth the highest in any sector;recognises that emissions in the transport sector have grown by 160% over the same period, with road transport accounting for virtually all of this growth;acknowledges that to reduce transport emissions we must prioritise the development of sustainable transport modes and must reduce Ireland's dependency on road-based goods transportation; andnotes that the amount of goods carried by road in Ireland has grown by 70% over the last ten years, while that carried by rail has declined dramatically;calls on the Government to:urgently address the growth in transport emissions by developing our rail freight sector as a viable and sustainable alternative to road-based freight transportation;immediately halt the decline in our rail freight sector by preventing the further erosion of rail freight infrastructure and rolling stock;introduce independent regulation of the rail freight sector, which will also be tasked with promoting and growing the rail freight sector; andprovide State supports to the rail freight sector to promote its growth and to increase the level of goods carried nationally by rail.I wish to share time with Deputies Shortall and Boyle.I move this motion on behalf of Fine Gael, Labour and the Green Party.  The thrust of the motion is to try to halt the decline in the rail freight sector and to make it into what we believe it can be, namely, a vibrant and growing industry that will contribute to reducing carbon emissions and congestion on our roads.  The Opposition is entirely in agreement about this joint motion and that signals how important we consider this issue to be, particularly in the context of the economy and the environment.Everyone believes that this is a crucial period for rail freight.  The latter has, to some extent, reached a tipping point.  If people continue to talk down the rail freight sector and if there is any further loss of business, infrastructure or rolling stock within it, the trend against it will become almost irreversible.  In other words, the rot is unstoppable.  We will lose the entire sector unless we take action of the kind to which the motion refers.At a minimum, we must stop the complete destruction of this sector.  Rail freight has for many years been talked down by CIE, Iarnród Éireann's road haulage division, the shareholder, namely, the Government, and those in the road haulage sector.  We have been informed that it is not viable, that the distances in Ireland are too short, that there is too much handling of goods required and that road freight is more flexible and economically viable.When listening to reports regarding total gridlock on the M50 earlier today caused by two trucks crashing into one another, I could not help wondering whether those trapped on the motorway — in some cases they were sitting motionless in their vehicles for up to two hours — are of the view that the transfer of goods by road is cheap.  All the business not done this afternoon — a great deal of it will never be regained — as a result of the incident involving those two trucks shows that road transport does not come cheap.  Everyone affected by what happened on the M50 today lost out financially.Cost lies at the heart of this issue.  If one carries out a direct comparison between transporting a container by road and sending it by rail, road is, on the face of it, cheaper.  Whether it remains that way is another matter.  I am of the view that it will not remain cheaper to transport freight by road.  The relative economics of road versus rail transport are changing every day.  Petrol is becoming scarcer and more expensive and roads are becoming congested and traffic slower, which adds to everyone's costs.  An increasing number of carbon credits will have to be purchased in order to offset the emissions caused by trucks transporting goods.  Even on the basis of a straight comparison, it is no longer certain that road will always be the cheaper option.We must also recognise that the hidden costs paid by taxpayers, private individuals and the Government on our behalf are absolutely enormous.  Among these is the fact that the emissions into the environment are infinitely in excess of those associated with rail freight and that people's use of non-renewable carbon-based fuels is incredibly inefficient.  Road congestion costs are increasing for all road users as a result of the ever-increasing number of heavy goods vehicles, HGVs, using our roads.  The cost of road accidents involving trucks are, relative to the numbers of such vehicles on our roads, are extremely high.  For example, trucks represent 10% of all traffic but they are responsible for causing 20% of road accidents.  When one is involved in an accident with a truck, one has an extremely slim chance of survival.We all bear the cost of road transport.  The most recent example of this is the Dublin Port tunnel, which cost €1 billion and which was built exclusively for trucks.  The Minister has stated that he does not believe in subsidising freight and yet we spent that amount on constructing the tunnel.  In addition, millions will be spent each year in order to ensure that it remains operational.  The tunnel emerges from a port out of which a number of rail lines also run.  However, not a single tonne of freight is transported out of Dublin Port on those lines.  No attempt has been made to maximise the value of the existing asset, nor was any attempt made to carry out a comparative value analysis.  It was merely a case that we should get rid of the old and get on with the new.  The various economic, environmental and social forces indicate that we have been overtaken by events and that we are rushing headlong in the wrong direction.There are many imponderables regarding the future of transport.  For example, there are many outstanding questions in respect of climate change and how best we might deal with it in the context of transport.  There are also many outstanding questions regarding trading patterns and how they will develop, how goods will be distributed and how the pattern relating to their distribution will change in the coming years.  At a time of such uncertainty, it is all the more important that we should not commit the absolute folly of getting rid of the rail freight option completely and leave ourselves with no choice when the direction we are going to take in respect of transport becomes clear.The Minister has suggested that it would be outlandish to subsidise the private sector in transporting its goods by rail.  I cannot believe that the Minister cannot see that he is already providing a massive subsidy in respect of the transport of goods by road.  All Fine Gael, Labour and the Green Party are seeking in this motion is the creation of a level playing field.  We want to give the rail freight sector a chance by putting in place a regulator.  The latter and the market could then decide what is needed to allow the sector, in terms of its viability, to compete with and overcome road transport in respect of the transport of some goods.  We accept that not all goods are suitable for transport by rail.  A modest subsidy, be it a capital subsidy or a subsidy paid per kilometre travelled, per tonne or whatever, may be all that is required to kick-start the sector.  If the introduction of a subsidy does not work, then so be it.  We would, however, lose nothing by trying.  The cost of a subsidy would, in any event, probably be more than offset by the cost of the carbon credits we will be obliged to purchase.With the right regulatory environment and a benign regime of financial supports, rail freight will work in respect of the kind of goods that it is intrinsically unsuitable, unsafe and undesirable to transport by road.  For example, bio-fuels would be eminently suitable to be transported by rail freight.The massive growth in our economy has seen an explosion in the number of HGVs on our roads.  The number of such vehicles increased from 140,000 to over 260,000 in ten years.  In 1995, Irish railways were responsible for the transportation of 6 million tonnes of freight annually.  This represented approximately 10% of all freight carried nationally.  At present, just over 1% of freight goods are transported by rail.  This goes against all logic.  It also runs contrary to the much publicised global priority being given to the development of sustainable and environmentally-friendly modes of transport.The Environmental Protection Agency recently indicated how the level of carbon emissions has increased in recent years.  The transport sector, in the context of its output, is way ahead of every other in this regard.  I do not believe it is possible for us to continue to ignore the figures and also to completely ignore the freight sector.The Government recently set targets in respect of trying to take action in this area.  However, these may lack credibility coming, as they do, so late in its ten-year term of office.  The current Administration has completely ignored rail freight and has no ambitions in respect of it.  Rail freight has huge economic benefits.  It is almost impossible to quantify the costs relating to road congestion but I suspect they are increasing on a daily basis.  The cost of congestion to business generally is put at approximately €2 billion, but I suspect the cost has grown since that figure was suggested.  An average freight train can remove up to 50 HGVs from the roads.  It is madness to ignore such potential at a time like this.  Per tonne carried, rail produces approximately 10% of the amount of carbon dioxide produced by road transportation, and yet we continue to ignore it.  I mentioned already that such vehicles account for 20% of road accidents but only 10% of the traffic.The only notable aspect of the Government's action policy to deal with emissions announced this week was that it contained nothing new and nowhere was there any commitment to rail freight.  Other EU member states have been quick to appreciate the benefits of rail freight in terms of the environment, economic viability and safety advantages for other road users.  They also recognised that until they take drastic steps to reduce their national reliance on motor vehicles of all kinds, the environmental, economic and health damage caused by emissions and congestion will continue to affect quality of life.Other member states have no difficult with giving subsidies to rail freight.  We have always heard the EU does not allow the Government give subsidies to various areas.  This is the one area where the EU not alone allows subsidies but encourages and promotes them and believes they can be well justified in terms of the shift from road transport and the reduction in emissions resulting from the shift to rail freight.Over the past number of years we have seen a significant decline in rail freight in Ireland due to the lack of vision demonstrated by the Government, and yet there has been considerable investment in the rail network.  While I understand €1.5 billion has been spent already and billions of euro more is planned to be spent over the next number of years under Transport 21 and beyond, one must ask is it wise to ignore this entire sector and not sweat the asset in which we are investing so heavily, and having invested over the past decade and with plans to do so in the next decade, why we do not get the maximum value and ensure the taxpayer, who is paying for this considerable investment in rail transport, gets more than passenger transport.  The existing network is unutilised right through the night, which is the ideal time to transport goods, and without any impact on passenger trains we could have trains running through the night.The Minister has repeatedly rattled off the same old mantra that there is no future in rail freight in Ireland.  He comes in here and states he has never sought to question rail freight and, when analysed in the light of growing carbon emissions, that he believes it cannot make any contribution and is unviable.  He does not seem to recognise that it has never been considered and that he always takes his advice from the same source, CIE, which itself is not interested in any way in the rail freight sector.Tonight's motion by Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the Green Party has as its central aim the reinvigoration of the rail freight sector.  We believe rail freight has an important future.  We set out the three basic requirements to achieve this aim and we are committed to advancing this agenda.In the time remaining, I will go through those three elements.  The first is that an independent regulator with expertise in the industry be appointed as soon as possible.  Since 2006, as the Minister will be aware, the EU rail networks and the domestic rail networks of member states, have been open to outside operators.  In essence, this means any EU operator can enter the Irish market and operate freight services on the network.  However, to date the Minister has done nothing to attract new operators into the market.  If anything, he has prevented and discouraged new entrants by his utterances and his indifference to the freight sector.  He is not interested in pursuing this.  I am aware of freight operators who have expressed interest in such services and who have been discouraged by the closed door policy operated by the Minister and Iarnród Éireann.  This unambitious attitude — to call it that is to be kind — to expanding rail freight underlines the need for an independent freight regulator.Under the current regulatory system for rail freight the Minister for Transport acts as the regulator but defers to Iarnród Éireann's authority and advice in managing access to the network and, most importantly, in setting the charges to access the rail system, and that is not in anybody's interests.  The Minister for Transport's role as acting effective rail freight regulator clearly conflicts with his role as primary shareholder in Iarnród Éireann.  While the role played by Iarnród Éireann is not conducive to encouraging outside operators into the market, clearly that company feels such operators would be in competition with it although there is no reason to believe that would be so because the rail network can be used at night for freight and if tenders were sought through a regulator, Iarnród Éireann would be as capable, and probably better placed than anybody, to provide such services.  The critical step to kick-start the industry is the appointment of a regulator who would be independent of the Minister and Iarnród Éireann and responsible not only for regulating the industry but for actively growing and encouraging the transport of freight by rail, whether by private or public operators.The motion also calls for an end to Iarnród Éireann's disposal of freight infrastructure and rolling stock, which has been going on wholesale right around the country.  It is heartbreaking to see this happening and to see the potential for development of rail freight services being sold and allowed to disintegrate, and the private sector being allowed build over rail lines ensuring, by indifference and neglect, that the industry cannot be resuscitated.  This practice must end today.  I do not even want to wait for a change of Government in the next few weeks.  We demand and end to the practice on behalf of all taxpayers who see their assets being frittered away by this Government.We want a dedicated State support for our rail freight sector.  I recognise that in order to opt for rail freight and make it commercially viable there will be a need, at least initially, for State support for the sector.  This is the norm in most European countries where active promotion of this sector and state incentives have resulted in significant growth in the percentage of goods carried by rail.  Our closest neighbour, the UK, has successfully grown this sector by 60% in the past ten years and that is the direction in which we want to proceed.New economic and environmental challenges will compel all policy makers two adapt.  All future State investment must take into consideration the environmental effects of those decisions and the impact on the country's carbon footprint.  We cannot afford not to think in the round about all decisions that are being made.  Rail freight is clearly a much more sustainable mode of transport, and one which will reap significant benefits for all of us.  We cannot ignore the untapped potential of this sector and we should allow its capacity to reap significant environmental benefits and reduce our carbon emissions.This must be a priority for any government.  It will become increasingly important, no matter what government or economy one is speaking of.  I urgently ask that the Government consider the motion we are putting before the House.  It needs to be addressed, no matter what Government is in power.  I am happy to propose this motion on behalf of Fine Gael, Labour and the Green Party.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	251	The Labour Party is happy to jointly table this motion along with Fine Gael and the Green Party.  No doubt it will be supported by many other Members because it is a commonsense approach to an aspect of transport policy that is critically important.  The proliferation in road freight comes with a significant cost in damage to the environment, as a contributing factor to deaths on the roads, as a major contributor to road congestion, and in the lack of competitiveness for the business community.Ours is a commonsense approach which pays attention to what is happening in other EU member states.  In many ways, it could be described as a "no-brainer".  The intention is to encourage action by industry on something that will benefit the entire community on several fronts.Nothing symbolises the Government's inaction and laissez-faire attitude to transport and the environment more than its attitude to rail freight.  Basically, this Government does not have any policies for rail freight.  The latest pan-European statistics on rail freight show that Ireland experienced a significant reduction in the tonnage of goods carried by rail in recent years.  Rail freight decreased by 28% in 2005 and a further 47% in 2006, with the result that it has all but disappeared.  The latest CSO statistics indicate that the large white van rather than the freight train is now the workhorse of our freight industry.  Practically all our transported goods, or 99.5%, are transported by road.  That is a serious indictment of the failure of the Minister for Transport and his predecessors to devise holistic transport policies that would ensure freedom of movement and protect our environment.  Little or no action has been taken and there has been no attempt to initiate any new policies that might reverse the dramatic downward trend of recent years.  In 2005, almost 100,000 goods vehicles travelled 1.4 billion freight kilometres and carried 172 million tonnes of goods.  By contrast, rail freight carried only 2 million tonnes in 2005 and less than 1 million tonnes in 2006.  That is a further indictment of this Government’s lack of policies.I can give several examples of where the trend of recent years could be reversed by transferring significant business from road to rail.  On various parts of the Dublin-Sligo line, the transport of tar, containers, kegs and bulk oil was discontinued in 2005.  Oil and unit-load container services were discontinued in 2005 on various parts of the Dublin-Westport line, while kegs went in 2006.  This happened because the Minister took a completely hands-off approach to the issue.  On various parts of the Dublin-Galway line, transport of containers discontinued in 2004 and 2005 saw the loss of kegs and cement.  Transport of fertilisers was discontinued on various parts of the Dublin-Cork line in 2002, with cement following in 2004, containers in 2005 and kegs and beet in 2006.  On the Dublin-Belfast line, fertiliser and cement freight was lost in 2003, while containers and kegs followed in 2004.  On the Limerick-Rosslare line, containers were lost in 2005 and kegs in 2006.  On the Cherryville Junction-Waterford line, containers were lost on 2005 and kegs in 2006.  It appears that much of the lost business will never return.  That is an indication of the Minister's inability to realise the broader picture when it comes to transport and the environment.The Government cannot say it was not warned about this.  The strategic rail review of 2003 set out four options for the Government on rail freight, namely to do nothing, to stimulate Iarnród Éireann to improve its position, for the Government to become actively involved in growing rail freight, which is the logical and responsible approach, or to limit Iarnród Éireann's role and introduce new logistics partnerships.  Save for complying with a few EU directives, it is clear to all that the Government has chosen to do nothing.  Its lack of policy on rail freight has allowed Iarnród Éireann to shed its rail freight operations and dismantle much of its infrastructure.  The strategic rail review spelled out in detail the consequences of doing nothing, warning that the disappearance of rail freight could pose serious problems for the future in terms of congestion and the environment.  That report indicated the cost of doing nothing was €63 million per year, which must be a significant under estimate of the real cost.  In environmental terms, the transport sector was responsible for 33% of Ireland's energy related CO2 emissions in 2005 according to Sustainable Energy Ireland.  This was higher than any other sector.  Within transport, road transport accounted for 65% of the total fuel consumption.  Fuel consumption by road freight was of particular significance, increasing by 264% over the period from 1990 to 2005, or 9% per annum, which makes it the mode with the highest growth rate.The 2004 road traffic collision fact book, which is the most recent edition, reveals that 19% of vehicles involved in fatal road deaths and 13% of the vehicles involved in accidents where victims suffered injuries were goods vehicles.  That adds a significant additional cost to transporting most of our freight by road.  Given that the economic cost of every road fatality is estimated as being in the region of €1 million, there are clear economic as well as environmental and societal reasons for encouraging a switch from road to rail freight.When I raised this issue in a parliamentary question to the Minister a few weeks ago, he could not point to any clear policy initiative undertaken by this Government on rail freight other than the minor EU directives I referred to earlier.  He claimed that Iarnród Éireann continues to pursue a policy of growing its rail freight business where opportunities present.  That is patent nonsense because, in the absence of a subsidy or some kind of financial incentive, Iarnród Éireann has no chance of growing its rail freight business, as the experience with Norfolkline clearly demonstrates.  That company wants to expand its trade in Ireland by moving freight by rail but it is not cost-effective for it to do so because our Government offers no incentives.The situation could be very different.  The Irish Exporters Association claims it has 22 companies interested in rail freight.  Significant opportunities would arise for regaining rail freight if the Government made it financially viable.   Container transport could be restored to the lines from Clonmel and Ballina to North Wall, Waterford to Cork and elsewhere.  The cement business could be reinstated.  The current quantities of timber being transported to Waterford could be increased and timber freight could be restored to Clonmel.  The Minister has only to observe the practice in many other EU countries.  In Britain, a grant is made available to the rail user, with a subsidy offered towards infrastructure and rolling stock.  In France, a grant is available to the state operator amounting to a subsidy to SNCF.  In Germany, a tax break offers operators a 50% discount on energy taxes.  In Austria, a grant is available to rail users and subsidies are paid on infrastructure, rolling stock and training.  The Minister should open his eyes to the policies of other EU states on rail freight.  If it is to be encouraged and expanded, a system of subsidies must be in place and that is key proposal in the motion.  It is also time to lay to rest a number of the spurious arguments against offering a financial incentive to encourage rail freight.  The usual argument that such freight cannot survive in Ireland because the distances are too short does not hold water.  Two of the most profitable freight flows operated by Iarnród Éireann are Tara Mines zinc ore, for which trains travel approximately 48 miles, while the shale traffic on the Limerick-Ballybrophy route to Irish Cement's factory in Mungret, County Limerick, travels only 16 miles.  There are also many examples of short, profitable routes throughout the UK.The motion, jointly tabled by the three main Opposition parties, is sensible and logical and its proposals could be implemented quickly if the political will existed.  They would bring undoubted benefits by improving road safety, reducing traffic congestion and, most important, improving the environment.  There are no further excuses for failing to act.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	252	I am pleased to contribute to the debate on behalf of the Green Party.  This is one area in which the three main Opposition parties, who jointly tabled the motion, would make significant changes in the way the country is run.  The motion also highlights the paucity of Government thinking on tackling one of the most important issues globally, namely, climate change.  The motion refers to a rational approach to transport policy.  Unfortunately, standing in its away is a Cabinet member who has shown no sanity or rationality when it comes to transport policy and it is unfortunate that he is not present to contribute to the debate.  I hope he takes an opportunity to answer a number of the charges we will make against him.The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has made a hollow boast that the very least the Government has managed to achieve is to decouple economic growth from increases in carbon emissions.  Such decoupling has been achieved everywhere else in the world.  However, this is an even more hollow boast when one considers that road freight over the same period has increased at a faster rate than economic growth.  The other side of that equation is that rail freight has decreased accordingly because of the lack of effective Government policy in this area.  Road freight accounts for 96% of all freight transported and that percentage is increasing while the European average is 77%.  Ireland once had the most extensive rail network in the world.  The bones of such a system remain should the political will exist to invest in rail infrastructure on a par with investment in roads.  However, last year the Government spent six times as much on roads than on public transport and, as a result, we are lagging behind in what can be achieved.Other elements of policy need to be put in place.  Ports such as Rosslare, Waterford, Foynes and Cork should be used more because they have rail links, which could be connected to the national system, thereby providing for more freight to be carried.  The State should move away from a radial rail system, which comprises only lines in and out of Dublin, and restore the remnants of the rail system, which covered all points north, south, east and west.  For example, the rail corridor between Cork and Limerick is still in place.  It passes through Patrickswell into Limerick city and would obviate the need to travel through Limerick Junction.  The western rail corridor could be opened sooner and could be extended further than the Government proposes.  Last weekend I read a book on the Letterkenny to Burtonport railway line, which was still in operation in 1935 when my father was a young man.  These decisions had a negative effect on the promotion of our rail infrastructure.Sinister decisions relating to rail freight have been made in recent years.  For example, in my constituency, the freight hub in Cork depends on the Norsk facility, which has been put up for sale.  In recent years, the rail turntable, which allowed freight trains to change direction, because Cork is a terminus, was dismantled.  This was an attempt to disentangle the rail freight infrastructure.  Previous speakers are correct that incentives must be provided to achieve a balance between road and rail freight.  Under the current system, however, significant subsidies are provided for road freight.  The motor tax paid by commercial vehicles on the basis of road space used, the weight of vehicles and the consequent damage done to the road surface is out of proportion with the tax paid by private car users.  As the playing pitch in this regard is not level, commercial road freight is subsidised significantly.  If the same principle were applied to rail freight, I would be confident that we could begin to turn the current statistics around.The Minister for Transport has stated he has been informed by Irish Rail about difficulties in expanding rail freight.  When I was first elected as a councillor in Cork city in the early 1990s, I asked the manager of Kent Station in Cork about the future of the Cobh suburban line, which was under threat.  Thankfully, that is no longer the case.  The attitude of the manager, who has since moved on, was that the Cobh line was not worth preserving and when I pointed out that the town had a similar population to Mallow, which is on the Cork to Dublin line, it was news to him.  That reflected an attitude that not only existed in Irish Rail but also in the Department of Transport.  As a result of biases in perceptions, which are not backed up by statistics or potential, policy decisions have been made that rail freight should go the same way as the rail network in the 19th century.  This is not a smokestack industry, as it offers future potential and hope to deal with problems that we have yet to grapple with as a society and on a global level.  Rail freight deserves more than the indifference the Government and the Minister are showing towards it.If rail freight is incentivised effectively, it has the potential to create significant employment growth.  Its environmental potential would also be unleashed if we managed to reverse the imbalance between road and rail freight in Ireland.  I have run out of hope for the Government in the remaining weeks of this Dáil and, therefore, the next Government should at the very least seek to achieve the same balance between road and rail freight as other European countries, which is 77% by road and 23% by rail.  A timeframe of ten years should be set down to achieve that.  It will mean investment and a reversal of policy but, in the long run, the country can achieve something it used to when it had the largest network in the world.  Until we start believing that and putting such policies in place, rail freight will become a footnote in history.  That is not something my party is prepared to allow happen in Government following the next election.  Given the track record — to use the pun — of the Government, I cannot see it giving solace in achieving these policy goals.

Traffic volumes have grown in line with the population and growth in the economy.  There are now over 2.1 million registered vehicles carrying more people and freight than ever before.  Our economic success has created major new transport needs.  We are victims of our own success.  We have created an economic atmosphere conducive to investment.  However, the Government has responded to these needs through the national development plan and continues to do so.I take the opportunity to outline in detail, particularly from a public transport perspective, what has been achieved since 1997.  Over €2.5 billion of Exchequer funds was invested in public transport capital projects between 1997 to 2006.  Nearly €600 million in Exchequer funding was invested in public transport in 2006 alone.In Iarnród Éireann which is at the heart of the motion we now have one of the fastest growing rail network companies in Europe, carrying a record 43 million passengers in 2006.  Significant investment has taken place in rail infrastructure to match this.  There has also been a major rolling stock investment programme.  In December 2004 Iarnród Éireann placed an order with Mitsui for the manufacture of 120 intercity railcars at a cost of €263 million.  Delivery of the new railcars has begun and they will operate on the Galway, Waterford, Limerick, Westport-Ballina and Tralee routes.  In 2005 Iarnród Éireann placed an order for 30 intercity railcars — additional to the 120 already on order — to be deployed on the Rosslare and Sligo intercity routes.  The addition of these new units will see the removal from service of all older rolling stock and the provision of clock face timetabling on all intercity routes.  The order has been further enlarged by Iarnród Éireann following recent approval of funding for a further 33 railcars to serve Portlaoise, Athlone and Carlow.

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	255	Some 67 new carriages have entered service on the Dublin-Cork route at a cost to the Exchequer of €117 million.A targeted investment in the development and enhancement of the Dublin suburban rail network has been ongoing since 1997 in recognition of the role played by rail in providing a real alternative to the use of the private car and tackling congestion and related environmental problems.  The development of the Luas system at a cost of €718 million was a major achievement and success story in this regard.  Both Luas lines have progressed from planning and statutory approval stages to construction and opening of the lines within this period.  Some 25 million passengers were carried on the system during 2006, exceeding expectations and creating the cultural shift towards the attractiveness of rail-based systems which was a critical success factor in securing the commitment to the enhancement of suburban rail and Luas networks under Transport 21.In addition, a range of incremental improvements in the DART and suburban rail systems have been effected, for the most part without significant disruption to services.  Some 78 new DART carriages were delivered since November 2000 bringing the DART fleet up to a total of 156 units, just short of double the initial fleet of 80.  The DART upgrade project was completed at an outturn cost of €174 million, making it the single largest investment in Iarnród Éireann's Dublin suburban rail services since introduction of DART in 1984, and completes a process which has seen peak capacity on the service doubled since 2000.  In conjunction with the DART upgrade project, the DART refurbishment project provides for the complete mid-life overhaul of the original DART fleet of 76 units, allowing each set to be fully compatible with the rest of the DART fleet.  While the refurbishment programme has been delayed due to difficulties with the contractors in achieving the planned programme for the works, the first eight of the refurbished cars have now been delivered.In regard to other suburban services, incremental improvements in capacity and frequency have been introduced progressively in recent years largely due to Iarnród Éireann's rolling programme of commuter railcar acquisition.  In total, 116 new commuter railcars have been introduced to the Iarnród Éireann fleet since 2002 at a cost of €179 million.Investment has also been directed at improving facilities at railway stations and opening new stations such as at Monasterevin and the docklands. Facilities at stations have also been upgraded for passengers.  This investment has rescued the rail network from a slow and terminal decline.  The revitalised rail service is now carrying more passengers than ever before and is well placed, with the benefit of the investment by the Government to date and that to come under Transport 21, to grow and develop its passenger and freight business further.  This is a record of which the Government is very proud.

It has also facilitated the upgrading of many stations throughout the Bus Éireann network and funded the construction of a state-of-the-art garage in Harristown to facilitate the expansion of the Dublin Bus fleet.  In September 2006 the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, announced that the Government had decided to provide up to €30 million to enable Dublin Bus to buy 100 additional buses for delivery in the period 2006 to 2007.  Over €15 million is also being provided for Dublin Bus to part fund the replacement of 100 buses.In addition, there has been significant investment in initiatives such as the rural transport initiative, traffic management grants, quality bus corridors, green routes and accessibility.

Two metro lines are planned, metro north and metro west.  Metro north will be completed six years from now in 2012 and will make it possible to travel from Dublin Airport to the city centre in 17 minutes.  Metro west will be a western orbital route around the outer suburbs of Dublin, linking with metro north and extending from there to Blanchardstown, Lucan, Clondalkin and Tallaght.  Metro west will be completed in four phases by 2014.The two very successful existing Luas lines carried over 20 million passengers in 2005, their first full year of operation.  Transport 21 will fund seven new Luas projects extending and expanding the existing Luas network.  The green line will be extended in the city centre to meet the red line and onwards to Liffey junction in the north of the city.  Subject to developer contributions, the red line will also be extended westwards from Tallaght in 2008 to serve the Citywest area.  Negotiations with developers are at an advanced stage.Iarnród Éireann operates an extensive suburban rail system in the greater Dublin area.  A fleet of over 100 modern diesel railcars operate commuter services from Dublin to Drogheda, Maynooth, Kildare and Wicklow, while the DART operates as far north as Malahide and as far south as Greystones.Transport 21 will eliminate the capacity problem through a number of major projects, with which the House is very familiar.  Two dedicated commuter lines will be provided on the Kildare line as part of the Kildare route project.  Most important is Iarnród Éireann's interconnector project.  This project involves the building by 2015 of an interconnector rail tunnel between Heuston Station and Dublin's docklands and has been described as the missing piece of the jigsaw that is Dublin's rail infrastructure.In addition, the old Navan railway line will be reopened in two phases.  Phase one will see a spur reopen in three years' time, in 2009, from the Maynooth line to Pace, which is just beyond Dunboyne.  This will terminate at the Docklands station, pending completion of the interconnector project.  Phase two will see this line extended in 2015 to Navan and the reopened Navan line will also form part of the greater Dublin area DART network.The integrated rail system planned under Transport 21 has been designed to have integration at its core.  It is designed in order that it will be possible to travel throughout the greater Dublin area rail network with no more than one change.  I believe this will transform commuter transport systems in the greater Dublin area.By the end of 2015, when the transport infrastructure funded under Transport 21 is completed and fully operational, I expect a fourfold increase in DART and suburban rail passenger numbers to 100 million per annum.  I also expect 100 million passengers to travel on the Luas light rail network and metro lines.The national strategy will also see significant enhancement of public transport services throughout the country.  The upgrading of the national rail network will be completed under Transport 21.  Apart from the inter-city network, Transport 21 will also fund new and expanded commuter rail services for Cork and Galway cities.  Galway city will have its first dedicated commuter rail service from Athenry, while Cork city's commuter rail services will be expanded with the reopening of the Midleton railway line.  The western rail corridor from Ennis to Claremorris will also be reopened in three phases and work on the first phase from Ennis to Athenry has already begun.I have set out in detail the plans for public transport investment under Transport 21 to emphasise the major rebalancing that is taking place in transport investment.  The major proportion of Transport 21 investment is devoted to roads, reflecting their importance to our transport and economic system.  Such investment in roads will have a positive impact in respect of the elimination of congestion and bottlenecks.  However, it should be acknowledged that Transport 21 is a balanced and integrated package of investment in both public transport and roads that will provide Ireland with a sustainable transport system.The position regarding rail freight is that Iarnród Éireann has sought to return the rail freight business to a more sound economic footing.  To help achieve this turnaround, Iarnród Éireann withdrew from loss-making groupage, palletised and single container rail transport.  Iarnród Éireann has made progress in growing the rail freight business in areas in which it holds a competitive advantage over road haulage, such as in handling large volumes or trainloads over long distances.For example, Iarnród Éireann has reintroduced the trainload pulpwood business by modifying surplus wagons and providing additional services for Coillte between the west of Ireland and the south east.  It has altered its rail schedules and at present provides three additional trains per week for Tara Mines with a potential to carry an extra 85,000 tonnes of lead and zinc between Navan and Dublin Port per annum.  It has modified surplus platform wagons to provide a trainload service for containers between Ballina and Waterford Port.The Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, has introduced the European Communities (Access to Railway Infrastructure) (Amendment) Regulations 2005, SI 780 of 2005, to implement EU Directive No. 2004/51 on the development of the Community's railways.  These regulations open the freight market to competition from both domestic and foreign operators from 1 January 2006 in the case of international freight and from 1 January 2007 in the case of domestic freight operations.Iarnród Éireann has undertaken extensive engagement with industry and transporters nationwide to try to identify long-term sustainable business opportunities.  However, it has had genuine difficulty in identifying business opportunities that offer reasonable volumes of business on a regular basis.  It is not feasible to run trains with one or two containers and Iarnród Éireann has not identified sufficient business, with the exception of the Ballina to Waterford stream, to group together a number of separate activities to form a viable trainload.Most Irish industry is focused on "just in time" transport and as our road network continues to expand and improve, the role of rail freight becomes more problematic because all rail journeys involve road movements at each end of the logistics chain.  Furthermore, distances in Ireland are short.  The experience across Europe is no different in that rail freight activities are most economic when distances are long, there are large volumes to be transported or the freight to be carried is not time-sensitive.As part of the engagement with industry, Iarnród Éireann works closely with port authorities to increase rail-based freight such as the transport of lead and zinc to Dublin and container traffic to Waterford.  The Government's ports policy statement recognises the need for the integration of ports with other transport modes, including rail, as a fundamental link in the supply chain.In the absence of opportunities or proposals for viable long-term rail freight business, the development and use of fiscal incentives has not been considered.  While the Government is open to any views on how rail freight can be expanded, the business environment is such that I have not seen the identification of any real opportunities.  The market for rail freight is now fully liberalised and if opportunities exist, I would welcome expressions of interest.  Although the movement of goods by rail offers environmental benefits over the movement of goods by road, the real issues are distance and type of goods to be moved.  Ireland has little heavy manufacturing industry.  Moreover, distances are short and in this context, road scores over rail in terms of reduced journey time and less handling.As for the issue of greenhouse gas emissions, it is important to put Ireland's performance into an overall context.  In the past 15 years, Ireland's economy grew by more than 150%, while its greenhouse gas emissions grew by 25%.  Consequently, for every unit of GDP, Ireland now produces emissions at 48% of their 1990 levels.

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	272	While this will be done in a way that requires all to act, it will not be done, as some would do, in a manner that would undermine Irish employment.  Progress on meeting our Kyoto obligations involves a range of measures.  For example, our major industries were one of the first to become part of the EU emissions trading scheme.  The greener homes grants scheme has been an outstanding success and the purchase of carbon credits is also an instrument recognised in the Kyoto Treaty.  It is a strategy followed by many of our EU partners and it brings real benefits to the developing world through investment in environmental projects.Although Ireland is making progress on decoupling economic growth from emissions locally, the pace of climate change globally has increased very significantly.  In response, the EU is ready to commit to deeper reductions in emissions and one proposal is for the EU to agree unilaterally to a 20% reduction in the 1990 level of carbon emissions by 2020.  Regardless of the final target to emerge, Ireland will play its part in meeting the obligations to be agreed nationally with each member state.The publication of the bio-energy action plan by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is one example of the greater emphasis on emissions reduction and the imminent publication of the White Paper on Renewable Energy will demonstrate how we will move Ireland to a low carbon economy.  The growth in emissions from the transport sector reflects the growth in the economy, a larger population and a below average rate of car ownership.In all developed countries the reduction in emissions from the transport sector is seen as a particularly complex challenge without a single easy solution.  The Government has already taken steps to reduce emissions from the transport sector.  These include a national bio-fuels obligation on fuel suppliers of 5% by 2009, generous tax breaks for hybrid and bio-fuel cars, a tax system through VRT and motor tax that is already heavily biased towards smaller engine cars that emit fewer emissions, a commitment announced in December's budget that VRT and motor tax will be further refined to reward more efficient cars in the future and fiscal supports to encourage the growing of crops for bio-fuels.The investment in Transport 21, which I outlined, will make a significant contribution to a more sustainable transportation system.  Overall, €18.5 billion will be invested in the national roads programme, which will upgrade national roads, remove bottlenecks, reduce congestion, improve journey times and, consequently, improve competitiveness.  Furthermore, €15.8 billion will be provided for public transport projects, in a significant rebalancing of public expenditure, which will encourage commuters to switch to public transport.The transport sector has a key contribution to make in meeting our Kyoto obligations and I already announced the preparation of a sustainable transport action plan to address this contribution.  This action plan must consider a range of innovative measures and policies, which will guide the transport sector to 2020.  It will affirm our support for EU proposals to reduce carbon emissions of new passenger cars to reach an average level of 130 grammes per kilometre by 2012.I recognise the preparation of this sustainable transport action plan will take some time and will necessitate full consultation with stakeholders and the public.  As an indication of our commitment to this policy we took a number of recent initiatives to demonstrate practical steps which can be taken to improve sustainability.The Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, asked Dr. Lynch, the chairman of CIE, to move the Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus existing fleets to a 5% bio-diesel blend and to plan to achieve a 30% bio-diesel blend in all new buses.  It is intended the projects will demonstrate a viable, reputable green transport module for Ireland.  The project represents a further commitment by the Government to fulfilling its obligations under the bio-fuels directive through encouraging the indigenous bio-fuels industry and providing market incentives.I stress these new incentives are a further demonstration of commitment to sustainable transport.  The proposed sustainable transport action plan is intended to go further and offer a vision and framework to ensure sustainability in transport is mainstreamed across all areas of Government.This is a time of great opportunity for transport change.  More clearly than ever we identified what needs to be done.  Unlike the opposition, we have clear policy and funding frameworks to guide us in achieving our objective of a state-of-the-art transport system which will be sustainable in economic, social and environmental terms.
#JimGlennonFF	unknown-#JimGlennonFF-party	unknown-#JimGlennonFF-dob	unknown-#JimGlennonFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	273	The strategic rail review commissioned by the Department of Transport contained a comprehensive examination of the rail freight business and its realistic potential to support economic development and contribute to sustainable development.Iarnród Éireann, in responding to the challenges contained in the review, developed a business plan with regard to freight and continues to pursue a policy of growing its rail freight business where opportunities present such as in bulk and trainload traffic.The company also sought to return the rail freight business to profitability.  To help achieve this turnaround, Iarnród Éireann withdrew from loss-making groupage, palletised and single container rail transport.  This resulted in the deficit on rail freight being reduced by 50% in the past three years.Since 1999, Iarnród Éireann invested more than €1.6 billion in rebuilding the railways, with Government and EU support for the investment programme.  I must state as a regular user of the commuter rail service, the improvement during this period is there for all to see on a daily basis.  This investment programme delivered improvements in new trains, upgraded infrastructure and customer facilities.  While such investment primarily focused on improving passenger services, the investment in improving rail infrastructure also had a direct beneficial impact on freight activities.Iarnród Éireann has no plans to eliminate capacity or freight infrastructure.  Iarnród Éireann has made progress in growing the rail freight business in areas where it holds a competitive advantage over road haulage such as large volumes or trainloads over long distances.  The company re-introduced the trainload pulpwood business by modifying surplus wagons and providing additional services for Coillte between the west and the south east.The company altered rail schedules and provides three additional trains per week for Tara Mines with a potential to carry an extra 85,000 tonnes of lead and zinc between Navan and Dublin Port per annum.  It also modified surplus platform wagons to provide a trainload service for containers between Ballina and Waterford Port.Regulations to open the freight market through EU Directive 2004/51 to competition from both domestic and foreign operators, from 1 January 2006 in the case of international freight and from 1 January 2007 in the case of domestic freight operations, were also introduced.I support Iarnród Éireann's extensive engagement with industry and transporters throughout the country to try to identify long-term sustainable business opportunities.  The company had genuine difficulty in identifying business opportunities which offer reasonable volumes of business on a regular, ongoing basis.  Unfortunately, it is not feasible to run trains with one or two containers and Iarnród Éireann has not identified sufficient business, with the exception of the Ballina to Waterford stream, to group a number of separate activities together to form a viable trainload.Most Irish industry is focused on what is known as "just in time" transport and as our road network continues to expand and improve across the country the role of rail freight becomes more problematic because all rail journeys involve road movements at each end of the logistics chain.  Furthermore, in Ireland distances are necessarily short.  The experience across Europe is no different.  The simple fact is that rail freight activities are most economic where distances are long, large volumes are to be transported and the freight to be carried is not time sensitive.As part of this engagement with industry, I understand Iarnród Éireann also works closely with port authorities, including in Dublin relating to transport of lead and zinc and Waterford relating to container traffic, to increase rail based freight.  I look forward to the company working closely with the Drogheda Port Authority on the proposed development at Bremore which is blessed with the existing rail service running straight through the proposed site for the new development.  As such, it will be able to link directly with minimum capital outlay and negligible work to be done to the port project.The Government's ports policy statement recognises the need for the integration of ports as a fundamental link in the supply chain with other transport modes including rail.  In the absence of opportunities or proposals for viable long-term rail freight business, the development and use of fiscal incentives would be difficult to justify.It is interesting that during the debate on this motion we have not heard any particular proposals on how the situation can be changed.  Any worthwhile suggestion which anybody has on how rail freight can be expanded within the business environment in which we operate should be considered.  The market is now fully liberalised and if opportunities exist let us hear them and provided they are valid I have no doubt the company and everybody would be delighted to see the resurrection of the rail freight business.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	274	I propose to share time with Deputies O'Shea, McEntee and Kehoe.I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  I immediately noted the Minister of State's speech overwhelmingly dealt with Transport 21 and the Government's suggested achievements in public transport.  Only in the final third did he turn to the specific issue of rail freight.  The Minister of State's speech contains some very dangerous phrases on the future of rail freight.  For example, he states:I am open to any views on how we can expand rail freight but the business environment is such that I have not seen any real opportunities identified.  The market for rail freight is now fully liberalised and if there are opportunities I would welcome expressions of interest . . . . . In the absence of opportunities or proposals for viable long-term rail freight business, the development and use of fiscal incentives has not been considered.There has been an appalling neglect of freight and although I have only five minutes I wish to make a few points with regard to, for example, the West on Track movement.  CIE is in possession of a site of 14.75 acres in Galway city centre.  It has decided to address its use of that site rather in the mode of a property development company than the public transport company it is under its basic Act.  CIE is governed by legislation which established it as the public transport company, and when it was split up the right to acquire and dispose of property existed.  What is referred to as the O'Rourke letter emerged, a letter from the then transport Minister suggesting that an evaluation of sites should be made so that their value might be realised.In the Galway case a misleading presentation was made, presided over by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, and assisted by the CIE board and chairman, Dr. John Lynch.  This mooted a €1 billion proposal for Ceannt Station, but the €1 billion was the value of the site.  As the presentation went on, it became clear that a proposal for 800 apartments and a retail street was being put forward.  There were to be three platforms, with an increase in the number of bus lanes, but they were all pointed towards the wall in such a way that none of them could ever get out.  It is outrageous but reflective of something else.We have some interesting bodies in this country.  An example is the National Roads Authority but because of the ideological opposition to rail and public transport, we do not have a national transport authority.  What we needed in the west was a regional transport authority which would adopt an integrated approach to public transport.The price we have paid for our homage to roads above rail is appalling and has been identified in the speech made by my colleague, Deputy Shortall.  She indicates that the impact of road freight is of particular note, with fuel consumption by road freight increasing by 264%, 9% per annum, over the period 1990-2005, making it the mode with the highest growth.  How can any of us elected in the west suggest at a time when the forests are maturing and logging is to take place that it makes sense to close down rail freight and start the transport of cut logs across the country from the north west to the south east?  It is outrageous and irresponsible.Again buried in the Minister of State's speech is no doubt what he will have received from Dr. Lynch.  He argues that we do not go looking for trade for freight and we have told our existing customers that we cannot guarantee we will be there.  Having frightened them off, we now argue there is no point in offering fiscal incentives to try to develop rail freight.  There is a pattern all over Europe where people have wanted sustainable transport policies.  People are being turned from road to rail freight, and it makes sense.It is very interesting that Iarnród Éireann continues to pursue a policy of growing its rail freight business where opportunities present, which the Minister of State for Transport stated in answer to Deputy Shortall some time ago.  We have seen the derogation by CIE of its duty and we have seen the Minister presiding over a "roads only" policy.  We have seen total hypocrisy in attempts to achieve an environmentally justifiable and sustainable policy.It is time for the light to shine on the betrayal of public transport by this Government, CIE and the people we have trusted to provide a public transport system into the future.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	275	Tá áthas orm go bhfuil seans agam labhairt sa díospóireacht thábhachtach seo.  I compliment Deputies Shortall, Mitchell and Eamon Ryan on bringing this very important motion before the Dáil on behalf of their respective parties.  Essentially the issue centres on the largest problem facing mankind currently, global warming, climate change and the consequences.One of the statistics which made me sit up and take notice was that there has been a declining market share of rail freight from 5% in the 1980s to less than 1% today.  Ireland had a fine rail system until the 1950s, but we are essentially now down to the Dublin commuter lines, the rail links between Dublin and the main urban centres and some other links beyond those.The Government has set its face against the whole area of fiscal incentives.  If we approach the issue of global warming and its consequences purely in the context of market forces, a situation which is deteriorating will only get a good deal worse.  As both my colleagues, Deputies Shortall and Michael Higgins, have pointed out, possibly up to eight of our EU partners provide some kind of financial or other assistance to rail freight operations.The benefits accruing from switching a significant amount of freight from road to rail are self-evident.  They are so rooted in common sense that we are inclined to pass them by without their really registering.  The wear and tear on our roads comes to mind immediately, and there would be safer roads, less congestion and gridlock.Other issues arise from the transfer of freight to our railways.  For example, approximately 19% of accidents involve a heavy goods vehicle.  On the other side of the House the financial and economic aspects of this issue, as against the social, environmental and other virtuous aspects, seem to be of major importance.  I understand the economic cost of each fatality is of the order of approximately €1 million.  This is clearly very insignificant at the end of the day when one considers lives that are lost.From the environmental perspective and taking into account greenhouse gases, the transfer of freight to our rail system is imperative.  The Government is looking for people to make suggestions, but good government is about going out and developing vision, putting measures in place which achieve the objective.  To leave our solution to the freight issue only to market forces is a route that will lead to disaster.A great deal of work needs to be done by all sides regarding how we could achieve the transfer and the measures required to do so.  If we do not act, the clogging of our roads and the damage done to them, along with the cost of wear, tear and maintenance, will have to be dealt with.I support this motion, one of the most important to come before this Dáil, the days of which are drawing to a close.
#ShaneMcEntee	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-party	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-dob	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	276	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this debate because I was brought up on a farm split in two by a railway line that carried freight from Gypsum Industries four times per day.  The cows used to go under the line in the morning and across it in the evening.  Due to a dispute 15 years ago after the then Minister, Senator O'Rourke, spent a fortune improving the line between Kingscourt and Navan, it closed and has never been re-opened.  As it went from Kingscourt through Navan, Duleek and Drogheda to the line called for by Deputy Glennon, I wish to speak on what he called a "possibility".Since the close of the Kingscourt-Navan line, several industries have taken over and there is a need for a freight railway.  In County Meath, particularly in Nobber and Kilmainham Wood, Gypsum Industries is stronger than ever.  It imports raw material by road to sustain itself, material that leaves the next morning in a different manner.  All of the raw materials used by College Proteins, one of the largest and most up-to-date rendering plants in Europe, arrive by road, which is grand at this time of year, but is not as nice during summer, as Deputy Johnny Brady across the road from me knows.  This is another way in which rail freight could improve the area.  Further down the road, Thornton's Recycling and another company have set up recycling plants to which thousands of tonnes of materials are brought, while Kingspan and Kingscourt Brick Limited are in Kingscourt.  There are several areas where a freight railway could be introduced.The line in question is intact, but it is never mentioned when we discuss the lines from Dublin to Dunboyne and Navan.  Every rail crossing in Wilkinstown, Kilberry, Castletown, Nobber, Kilmainham Wood, Gypsum Industries and Cabra Castle could be re-introduced.  People do not know the line exists and our county manager was flabbergasted to see it.  The industries have destroyed our roads.  It is a difficult situation for the contractors and lorry industry, members of which I have met several times.  They will go out of business because of the time it takes to get from A to B.  Their business could be put elsewhere if we placed stop lines in the areas where the raw materials are used.In Nobber, the railway's edge has seen a significant historical find, namely, a crannóg.  Dug up 20 years ago, we have learned it is older than Newgrange, Knowth or Dowth.  While I may not see it, I intend to get the ball rolling to bring more visitors in by railway rather than road.I ask the Minister for Transport and his colleagues to plan for 50 years from now.  As Ireland will have 6 million to 7 million people, many of whom will be on the east coast, we will need freight railways.  The 22-mile stretch between Kingscourt and Navan is lying idle despite the millions of pounds spent on it and the then Minister's good work.  This issue must be examined and put on the agenda sooner rather than later.We cannot all travel by car or lorry.  Freight trains travelling from one end of the country to the other will be the solution.  It will reduce a great deal of congestion on our roads and leave them like the Drumcondra Road in Dublin, that is, with no lorries on them.  Too many businesses are going out of business because of the length of time they must spend on the road.  The 22-mile stretch in question is ready to go and is an example of what could be done.  With so many industries in the north Meath and Cavan area, a survey on the profitability of the line would be worthwhile.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	277	I thank the spokespersons of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the Green Party for tabling this motion.  It is nice to have an opportunity to speak on this important matter.Deputy O'Shea hit the nail on the head when he stated the Government must develop a vision, but the Government has failed to do so for many years.  This evening, I learned the Government has not developed rail freight since 1997.  Rather, it has dismantled rail freight.  Deputy McEntee referred to the many companies in his area and the dedicated freight line running through his county that serves many industries.  The Government has not helped to develop rail freight.  The heavy vehicles clogging up towns, villages and cities could be taken from our roads and their loads could be put on dedicated rail freight services.  While the Minister of State said he would welcome ideas or visions, no one who steps forward with sensible ideas is listened to.County Wexford has a fine port that is the gateway to Europe.  The service it provides could be explored as a means of taking a great deal of freight through Rosslare to France, England, Italy or elsewhere.  Many ships leave the port on a daily basis.  That this service is not being regularly used is disastrous.In the early 19th century, there were more rail services than currently.  Many railways have been dug up and taken away by successive Governments, but those opposite have been in Government for longer than any other party.  The Wellingtonbridge station on the Cork-Wexford line was threatened with closure when the beet industry was removed.  We should examine whether the Wellingtonbridge depot could be used as a base for rail freight from Waterford, Cork or elsewhere.The Tánaiste is muttering under his breath, but that is all the Government has done in recent years.  I call on the Government to carry out a feasibility study in respect of re-opening the Newross line, which would benefit the local area by creating many jobs.  An unused rail line passes through an industrial area in the town.  Regarding the daily train services between Dublin and Rosslare, there are few freight transports.In my younger days, freight carriages were used daily, but they are never used now.  Instead, heavy vehicles are on our roads causing accidents and gridlock.  I want to see the Minister of State working closely with Iarnród Éireann to encourage more rail freight.  He referred to Transport 21, which does not contain much on this matter and left it to the end.  The Government has not actively sought companies to use rail freight on a more user-friendly basis.  I hope the Minister of State takes on board the many points raised.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	278	I want to share time with Deputies Ó Snodaigh, Connolly and Catherine Murphy.The Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in opening today's debate, sought to construct a big tent as regards the fiasco that is this legislation.  He welcomed the draft legislation produced by the Labour Party.  He incorporated the Private Members' Bill produced by Fine Gael, although not without questioning the ability of the draftsman to produce a correct Bill.  He sought solace from the fact that officers of the State who appeared before committees of the Oireachtas failed to spot the omission he detected, and then sought to apportion responsibility for the legislation and the omission collectively on this House.He called for consolidated legislation in this area, with which there is no disagreement on this side of the House.  However, it is the Minister's role in producing legislation in the manner he has that has given rise to the problem we are now facing, because he is a prince of "ad hocery".  We are going through the motions to repair the damage of emergency legislation.  What makes this Bill even more poignant is its subject matter and the fact it deals with the protection of children in circumstances where they are most vulnerable and where most damage can be inflicted upon them.  This does not reflect well on this House.  It reflects less well on the manner in which we are expected to do our business when legislation is presented to us.This Minister, more than most in this Government, has been guilty of presenting legislation to the House in a haphazard way.  Rather than trying to seek collective responsibility for the legislative mess we find ourselves in, it would be better if the Government took that collective responsibility. That, after all, is its constitutional responsibility.This brings us no closer to the fact we have a loophole to address.  There are grey areas to be filled in.  The Bill is being taken on trust in circumstances where we have accepted similar legislation on trust from the same Minister and brought ourselves to exactly the same situation.  I share the fear expressed by Deputy Howlin in his contribution that because we are dealing with a Bill the House has just been presented with, the way the debate has been structured and the lack of subsequent scrutiny it will receive as well as the Minister's track record, there is no guarantee we will not have to revisit it.  This will probably not be in the life of the 29th Dáil, but the whole area will almost certainly have to be addressed again within a few months.  In the event, perhaps we may then start to consolidate this entire important area of legislation.We should go beyond this House.  The Green Party, for example, supports the Barnardos call for a national child protection summit.  This is a debate that requires the full involvement of civil society.  We cannot go hopping from one crisis to another in this House in trying to produce legislation in this important area.  We can no longer produce legislation on the basis of the most recent newspaper headline.  We can no longer produce legislation on the basis of trying to deal with the most pertinent political crisis.  We have a more considered role to undertake in this House.  We have to look to the long term and put in place, after proper consideration, legislation that will survive long after us.It is ironic that last week in the House we were dealing with the Statute Law Revision Bill 2007, which meant asking whether we should keep legislation dating from the 13th century.  Here we are in the 29th Dáil trying to repair Bills that we cannot get right over a six-month interval.  If anything testifies to the way this House is not working effectively, and how the Government is failing in its role to produce a proper legislative programme, this in particular speaks volumes.The Bill will not receive any objection from the Green Party.  It is obvious the loopholes need to be filled.  Can we be confident, however, that the issue is being dealt with in its entirety?  Even though the House is obliged to the Labour Party and Deputy Rabbitte for pointing out this omission, it is something that should have been detected during the legislative process and talked about on Second and subsequent stages.I was taken by Deputy Howlin's contribution when he outlined the history of this legislation and talked about how the previous guillotines had worked.  Guillotines are very pernicious instruments.  The Government decides and votes through on a majority that time is not available to deal with a Bill.  This means the elements that have not been examined, debated or voted upon in any proper sense in the House, become part of the Statute Book.  Omissions that arise as a result eventually become obvious and glaring.  I hope that if any lesson is capable of being learned by this Minister and Government, it is that we will not return to this situation again.  I suspect that in the 29th Dáil the amount of emergency legislation probably rates as an historical high, outside the state of emergency during the Second World War.  I would urge that an analysis be carried out in this regard.  It is a damning indictment of this Administration's inability to govern that in peace time, given such a prosperous economic period and the stability of governance, it has been forced to come back to this House with such a large amount of emergency legislation.  This is illustrated all the more in an issue of this type where the protection of our children is paramount.  While the Government will get the support it needs, it does not enjoy the House's confidence that it is dealing adequately with the issue.

That is the case today and it is inexcusable because there was no need for any of this to have been crisis-led.  In 1990, when the Law Reform Commission first recommended the law on statutory rape be changed, this Government and successive Administrations, including the Fine Gael-Labour Party-Democratic Left coalition, were aware of a possible clash with the 1937 Constitution.  However, they all failed to act sensibly on this knowledge.  Hence, it was only in June 2006 following the release of a convicted child sex offender that action was taken to amend the legislation accordingly.  At the time we facilitated passage of the emergency Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006.  In doing so we called on the Government to use the period immediately following its passage to review, debate and introduce proposals for a comprehensive and coherent code of law covering offences against children that is free from anomalies and loopholes.  It may be difficult to cover all angles, but that is part of our job in this House, and this is one initiative on which I would welcome legislation for once from this Minister, who is a serial legislator.Speaking during that crisis last summer and with reference to his proposed emergency legislation, the Minister said: "I am confident that when the dust settles and the frenzy stops I will be seen to have acted with good authority and with competence, honesty and courage".  I am not questioning the Minister's honesty in this but competence is lacking as may be seen from the legislation before us.  The dust has settled, the frenzy continues because of his incompetence and that has led to new loopholes being clearly visible and further emergency legislation is required.  A range of issues which should have been addressed by legislation subsequent to last summer's Act remains outstanding, with no evidence that this Government intends to address them at all.  I shall return to those.However, I wish to make a few points on the limited content of the Bill before the House.  According to its explanatory memorandum, the purpose of the Bill is to add to the offences provided for in last summer's emergency legislation the offence of soliciting or importuning a child or a person who is mentally impaired for the purpose of committing a sexual offence.  It also broadens the definition of "sexual exploitation" in the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 by including references to inviting, inducing and coercing a child "to participate in or observe any activity of a sexual or indecent nature".  The Bill also introduces the offence of grooming.  These developments are welcome in principle.Like other parties in the House, Sinn Féin will facilitate the passage of this emergency legislation by not opposing it.  The Government needs to ensure that the technical outworkings of the Bill will not create further loopholes or anomalies and that this Bill is constitutionally sound.  Ultimately, the ad hoc nature of the developments in this area is unacceptable and is not in the interests of children.The scale, extent and impact of child sexual abuse has been uncovered in recent reports.  Many cases have been reported on, after years of denial when these issues were kept in the dark.  Child sexual abuse often has devastating lifelong consequences for its victims.  Under-reporting is a reality in this area, as it is with other crimes of sexual violence.  Very few of the small number of cases which reach the courts result in convictions and appropriate measures.  The health and counselling needs of victims are often not met, sometimes for resource or legal reasons, such as the requirement for parental consent.  Traumatic court procedures can again make victims of children who have already suffered the worst forms of abuse.  Uniform responses are not guaranteed under the reporting procedures involving the Garda and the HSE.  Adequate resources have not been allocated for the Garda vetting of applicants who seek to work or volunteer with children.It is not sufficient to create one or two additional offences — many matters need to be addressed urgently.  While some of them will require underpinning legislation, others will not.  On behalf of Sinn Féin, I ask the Government to introduce legislation to place on a statutory footing the recommendations of Children First: National Guidelines for the Protection And Welfare of Children.  The Government should ensure that the guidelines are resourced and implemented fully.I call on the Government to protect vulnerable children during court proceedings, for example by appointing court commissioners to take evidence.  We should follow the lead of the authorities in Scotland by preventing the cross-examination of vulnerable children by aggressive counsel.  The issues I have mentioned, as well as many other outstanding problems, need to be addressed if children are to be protected.

The full horror of the heinous practice of sexual predators grooming young people over the Internet has emerged into the public consciousness over recent weeks.  The phenomenon of Internet grooming, whereby paedophiles use the Internet to cultivate relationships with children with the aim of making contact with and abusing them, must be made illegal.  We need to enact clear, coherent and effective laws which adequately respond to the issues of sexual abuse and, in particular, paedophilic use of the Internet.  Legislation that makes Internet grooming a criminal offence, and nails the offender in the specific act of grooming prior to an off-line meeting taking place, is long overdue.For several years, paedophiles have been using the Internet to contact children.  They often pose as teenagers and initially make contact in chatrooms.  They engage in e-mail correspondence with young people before attempting to arrange meetings.  The problem of grooming has continued to escalate, even though children are being told each day about the risks they face on-line.  I do not think education alone will stop children from trusting strangers they meet on-line.  No amount of parental control or filtering software will stop children from giving their mobile telephone numbers, or home addresses, to people who have carefully groomed them over a long period.  The legislation before the House is vital if we are to deter predators from engaging in activity of this nature — if we are to catch them in their tracks on-line before they commit sexual offences.  I hope that evidence of abusive conversations or on-line solicitations will be sufficient to warrant convictions.This problem is too serious to be the subject of political point-scoring or to make cheap political capital from it.  I am delighted that this Bill will not be opposed.  I am happy to note the Minister's intention of incorporating in this legislation the spirit of the Labour Party's Bill and the substance of Fine Gael's Bill.  He was accused this morning of cogging, but he is cogging for right, admirable and useful reasons.The issue of the protection of children has long been approached in a half-hearted manner.  The Garda central vetting unit is able to check the backgrounds of people who work in the health service, but it lacks the capacity to perform similar checks on people who work with children in the voluntary sector.  Voluntary organisations have to rely solely on Garda checks of criminal records.  Such checks fail to take cognisance of the fact that just one in ten abusers has a criminal record.  The differences between the child protection systems on either side of the Border create loopholes which can be exploited by child sexual abusers.  In some cases, prospective abusers can work as ancillary workers in the same buildings as children.  They will not have been the subject of Garda checks because they are not deemed to be working with children.  I know of cases of this happening in schools.  We need to make progress in that regard.The anomalies and inconsistencies in the vetting procedures of both jurisdictions could be ironed out by the creation of a centralised system, such as a vetting clearing house.  I have called previously for the establishment of such a facility, which would impose more rigorous standards in the background checks undertaken on prospective employees.  The protection of our young people should be the over-riding priority.  While many young people have mastered the use of technology, they remain vulnerable to insidious seduction by abusers.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	281	It is valid to question whether we would be here tonight discussing this Bill if a guillotine had not been imposed last year on the legislation introduced in this area.  On that occasion, we were not given enough time to tease out the various measures proposed.  The Government is pursuing a piecemeal approach that is reactive rather than proactive.  It is a defective way of making legislation.  The Minister, Deputy McDowell, has accepted that the lack of consolidating legislation in this area is not helpful.I regard this Bill as important.  If we do not provide for a deterrent targeted at initial access, more serious offences will occur.  The crime that will be committed in such circumstances will be a greater one.  It is not enough to put laws on the Statute Book without considering how they can be enforced.  An article in last weekend's edition of The Sunday Tribune highlighted in a graphic way the fact that behaviour of this nature is anonymous and difficult to police.We need to reflect on the significant difference between the way many first approaches are made to children nowadays and the way this was done in the past.  Most approaches were made personally in previous times, but now many victims are not contacted personally.  Forms of technology such as text messages, chatrooms and the Internet generally are now used as first points of contact with children.  That young people are often more competent than their parents in the use of such technologies makes them even more vulnerable.  The word "grooming", for example, meant something completely different 20 years ago.  It would have been almost strange to describe it as something that would become an offence at some future stage.It is important to understand the means by which crimes are committed.  A lack of consolidated legislation has led to the problem we are trying to fix today.  Our understanding of the use and misuse of technology, as it develops, will inform us about what is needed.  I regret that we do not have enough time to consider this and other aspects of the legislation.  Most people want to see more gardaí on the streets.  It is clear that policing the Internet involves ensuring we have expert knowledge of the criminal ways in which technology can be used.It is not enough to pass legislation — we must consider its end use.  I support Deputy Boyle's proposal that we adopt the suggestion made by Barnardo's to organise a child summit.  We need a more comprehensive approach.  It is not just about legislation — it is about providing the resources to ensure that it is applied.  We need to be ahead of the game in terms of understanding the use of technology.  We should not be penny-pinching in providing the resources to deal with the problems which ensue when offences are committed.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	282	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2007.  Before speaking on the substantive Bill I wish to make a number of preliminary comments.I do not believe there is such a thing as a "minor" offence, as has been suggested, when it comes to the sexual abuse of children.  During the deliberations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Child Protection it was clear that the physical act of statutory rape or sexual abuse is almost always preceded by a period, sometimes a long period, of sexual grooming.  While no physical act may take place, this has the potential to inflict life-long psychological damage on the child.  The sexual abuse of a child is a depraved act.  The preparation, solicitation and importuning of a child is equally depraved.  It shows a level of deviousness and planning and demonstrates real malice aforethought.  For this reason I am pleased the proposed legislation provides that the offence of solicitation and importuning will not be just a summary but also an indictable offence.It is clear from events in the past twelve months, from the legislation that has been brought forward and from the deliberations of the joint committee, that the time has come for a complete restatement of the law relating to sexual offences against children and child protection in general in a new statute along the lines proposed by the UK legislation.  A criminal law codification committee is currently working on this subject.It is time to consider the increasing sexualisation of children which makes them sexual objects and increases the likelihood of predation.  We must look at the causes of the increased levels of predation in society.  There is something fundamentally wrong in society when a 14-year old boy accesses sexually explicit websites about gay sex.  This is particularly disturbing and it raises questions more fundamental than the legislation which the House is debating tonight.  The excellent journalism in the report by Una Mullally and Mick McCaffrey in The Sunday Tribune article exposed something terribly sad about our society.  This is a society in which children, instead of reading “Roy of the Rovers” or Enid Blyton books or going out to play football with their friends in a safe and secure environment are instead at 14 years of age accessing gay sex sites.This is a terrible commentary on society not just in Ireland but across the globe.  As a global society we have presided over the increasingly early sexualisation of our young people so that they cannot enjoy the innocence of childhood in a carefree and pressure-free world.  There is hardly a parent in the country who does not lament the early sexualisation of their children through television, magazines, the Internet, mobile phones, advertising, marketing and — increasingly and in a sinister development — through toys for very young children.Today's pop culture, media and information society have made sexuality so pervasive and ubiquitous that it encourages young children and particularly young girls to see themselves as mere sexual objects without dignity.  This is the society we have created and the sort of mess into which we have got ourselves.  It has created and encouraged the type of offences for which we must now legislate.  We must examine the society we have created.  I recognise it may be difficult, if not impossible, to legislate in this area but surely those in authority, people in the media, people who control what our children read and see and what toys they play with, need to examine the effect which their publications are having on our young people.  Is it right or proper that, in the pursuit of sales and profit, some of our newspapers openly advertise gay sex chat lines or any type of sex chat lines which are easily accessible and available to children?  Is it not possible to exercise some moral judgment and to decide that this information will not be made freely available to 14-year-old children which inevitably encourages them to access sites such as Gaydar.ie, the subject of much comment in recent times?I know that I am expressing a deep frustration felt by parents throughout our country, the same parents who protested outside the gates of Leinster House nine months ago about the lowering of standards of child protection as a result of the Supreme Court decision in the CC case.  This case prompted the legislation which gave rise to the anomaly we are correcting today.  The CC case also gave rise to the establishment of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Child Protection which spent six months examining the issue of child protection and sexual offences in general.  It was clear from the committee's deliberations that a full restatement of our law on child protection and sexual offences against children was needed.  This was the core and first recommendation in the committee's report.  I invite the Minister to make a commitment to this recommendation in his reply.  The case for full restatement of our child protection could not be clearer.Some of the issues which need to be addressed go beyond the technical correction being introduced tonight.  There must be a full restatement of the law in order to keep pace with the increasing levels of predation and the sophisticated and subtle means in which sexual predation against children is now carried out.  It is clear that the sentences are not severe enough and neither are they being imposed by the courts which increasingly take the side of the criminal and the predator.  The scales of justice are tilted in favour of the accused rather than the child victim or the victim of general crime and they need to be recalibrated.The committee has identified a clear need for a new offence of child sexual abuse and the need for training and education of gardaí and others in child psychology.  The entire body of rules of evidence needs to be reformed with regard to the cross-examination of child witnesses, the giving of evidence behind a screen, video-link evidence, the videoing of witness statements from children.  The law relating to sexual offenders and the internationalisation of sexual predation against young children also needs to be considered and updated on a regular basis.Two further major issues also need to be addressed.  The vetting of adults who have unsupervised or limited access to children needs to be fully addressed.  The joint committee's report contains numerous and helpful suggestions in this area.  Second, legislation is required to govern the area of soft information.  I welcome the proposed referendum which would give the Oireachtas constitutional authority to legislate in this area.  A full and comprehensive statutory scheme needs to be formulated.The proposed legislation will close off the anomaly created by the 2006 Act.  While it is important to have these offences reinstated and anomalies corrected, despite adverse media comment, I have no doubt there were other offences, including common law offences of aiding, abetting, counselling, procurement and incitement, which could have been used to deal with recent offences highlighted in the media.I have a concern with regard to section 2(3)(b) which provides that a person guilty of an offence under this Act will be liable on conviction to a prison sentence of less than five years.  This is far too short a time.  The Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998, which makes the distribution of child pornography illegal, carries a maximum sentence of 14 years.  I see very little difference between both offences.  Solicitation is connected to grooming of young children by groups of men.  The act of planning and preparation and solicitation can be just as sinister and depraved as the offence itself.  If somebody has been conclusively proven to be planning, preparing, soliciting, importuning and grooming children for the most depraved acts, are we seriously suggesting that, with good behaviour, they should be let out on the streets after four years?  It is regrettable that the depravity to which some individuals are prepared to stoop is only matched by their imagination and a sentence of less than five years is surely not sufficient in this area.While it may be a discussion for another day I am deeply concerned that the courts are not handing down more severe sentences in the area of sexual abuse in general.  I have raised this point in the House before.  A premeditated and violent rape or sexual act, be it against an adult woman or a child, should carry a minimum sentence of 15 years without remission.  The sort of sentences being handed down for premeditated rape, which are of eight, nine and ten years, fall far short of the level of protection for our children and adult women which the courts ought to be providing.  I am reflecting a view which I believe is held strongly by people, namely, that the short, increasingly lenient sentences which the courts are handing down, particularly in rape cases, is a matter that needs to be addressed.  I invite the Minister, who has not been shy in pointing out to the Judiciary where it is falling down in this area, to again take up this important matter.  It sends out certain messages to society generally that the abuse of our children and women by sexual predators is not being dealt with in the most severe way by the courts and the Judiciary.I commend the Bill to the House.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	283	I thank Deputies for their contribution to this debate.  I will begin by referring to the contribution of Deputy Peter Power, which was thoughtful and which surveyed recent events in a fair-minded and reasonable way.  I agree with him that this area needs to be restated comprehensively.  I will ask that the criminal law codification committee takes this as its first task.  It is not good enough that our law on sexual crime is scattered over so many statutes that keeping them all in synch poses a significant difficulty.  The attempt to find out what is the law and trying to work out exactly how one Act interacts with another Act have become difficult tasks.Deputy Peter Power has the unique experience of having chaired an all-party committee on sexual offences in recent times.  The central theme of that committee was that this process of codification should be done.  Even though we are somewhat overhung by the uncertainties in regard to the zone of absolute protection, it seems the criminal law codification process could get going, notwithstanding that this issue has not yet been decided on finally.  Bearing in mind there is an all-party consensus to create an absolute zone of protection, the committee should proceed to prepare a draft chapter of a code in this area which would consolidate all sexual offences, both in regard to adults and minors, on the assumption that these Houses and the people will reinstate a zone of absolute protection in the proximate future.  That would be a good idea.It is noteworthy that, as Deputy Power said, the exploitation of young people is a very complex issue and that sexualisation of young people is now also a very complex issue, and very prevalent.  I do not know whether we are in the midst of an irreversible tide of sexualisation of young people or whether it can be reversed — it is a matter on which I am not in a position to express a useful opinion.  However, while I do not say this critically with regard to anyone, if one runs a newspaper, for example, and has chatlines which are accessible to children, one should not at the same time on earlier pages in the same newspaper be giving out about monsters.  To do that would be to burn the candle at both ends.Section 6 of the 1993 Act, as Deputy Howlin pointed out, had a very chequered career.  It did not emerge as the primary defence of children in this area but as a by-product of the reform of the law in regard to prostitution and homosexuality, as set out in the legislation of the former Minister, Mrs. Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, when the Fianna Fáil-Labour Party coalition was in office.  Clearly, attitudes have since changed.  A summary offence under the Constitution has to be categorised as a minor offence but most people would not consider it morally minor that an approach was made to their child by somebody——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	284	I do not believe the Minister does either.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	285	Nobody does.  It is not morally minor in that sense.  This explains to some extent how the particular section was overlooked.  If it had been an indictable offence, it would have leapt out in the drafting process for last year's law that there was a problem in this regard which had to be addressed.  However, it looked like a District Court offence and did not look to have all the importance it now does in retrospect.  There is no doubt there is now a consensus in the House that it should not be regarded either constitutionally or legislatively as a minor offence.  This is the reason it has been made indictable.Deputy Peter Power raises the good question of why the sentence for solicitation is only five years.  The point we must bear in mind is that last year, in the context of legislating for attempts, we set in place penalties which were less than five years.  This is why a general upgrading of the penalties is contemplated in this Bill.  To make this an arrestable offence in which there was a power to detain for questioning, the maximum penalties for these other offences, which are by definition more serious — an attempt is more serious than pure solicitation — have had to be recalibrated across a number of offences.Deputy Howlin asked me to explain why, with regard to this particular offence, we are not providing a defence of honest mistake.  I go back to the old offence of indecent assault, now called sexual assault.  It was in the same 1935 statute and the Supreme Court, for reasons which are quite complicated, held that it did not carry with it an exclusion of the requirement for mens rea in that particular case.  Therefore, the offence of sexual assault as we now know it was not comprehended by the finding that portions of the 1935 Act were unconstitutional for the reasons set out by the Supreme Court.With regard to sexual assault, for example, we did not amend the law last year to provide for a specific defence of honest belief because the Supreme Court had said it exists as a matter of constitutional construction.  That is why in regard to these offences——

On principles of constitutional construction, an Act is construed in accordance with the presumption that it is constitutional and if there are two ways of construing it, the constitutional construction is preferred.  I will deal with the other matters raised on Committee Stage.  I do not want to ignore them, nor do I want to be disorderly.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	294	I will make a general point and will not repeat it.  This is not the proper way to hold a debate on Committee Stage.  A Bill of this kind should be parsed, analysed and perused in detail to ensure what ends up on the Statute Book is cast-iron.  This process creates the possibility that a defect will occur in the Bill.  I agree in principle with what is contained in the Bill so we should do the best we can in the time allowed by the Government.Section 1 refers to a number of the main Acts, namely, the Criminal Law (Rape) Act 1981, the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act 1990, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 and the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006.  One of the main Acts we are amending relates to grooming, which involves amending the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998, but that is not included in the list of Acts in section 1, which begs the question as to why.  Is it an indication that portions of the Bill dealing with grooming were a late addition?  Would it not be a tidier arrangement to refer to the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998, which we are now amending following the Fine Gael proposals on grooming?  I accept that Act is specifically mentioned in section 6 but it is not a tidy way of doing business.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	295	I support the general principle that this is a difficult way to make law.  When the Labour Party pointed out the loophole last week the Minister acknowledged fairly speedily that it needed to be addressed and we want to facilitate it.  The Minister has chosen yet again to go further than simply plugging a loophole.  I do not wish to sound smart but lifting a portion of the Fine Gael Bill and grafting it onto this, while the right thing to do given we want to enact the legislation, has a smart alec quality.  If the Minister wanted to do that he should have addressed other issues.  The Minister is plugging a loophole with emergency legislation which the Opposition has had very little time to scrutinise, as we only received it today.  I have, to the best of my ability and with the benefit of little advice, tried to examine the Bill forensically and in its historical context to come up with amendments worthy of teasing out the issues in the House.  I will be interested to hear the Minister's answer.This is neither emergency legislation to plug a gap nor a comprehensive response to real deficiencies in our child protection law.  It is a hybrid of both, in plugging the gap but also going somewhat further.  The Minister cannot have it both ways.  Either it represents an emergency measure on which we are all agreed to plug an acknowledged gap in legislation, or it seeks to achieve other objectives.  In the latter scenario we on this side of the House, with much less legal support than the Government, need more time to consider the proposed measures to ensure we do our constitutional job to address genuine fears and concerns.There is an all-party consensus on the issue, which is reflected among members of the all-party Joint Committee on Child Protection, whose Chairman, Deputy Peter Power, has now left the House.  Many people have worked very hard on that committee, not least the Chairman.  One of its recommendations was a consolidation of the law in this area so we are not constantly plugging gaps and inadequacies in the law.  I have no doubt we will return to the issue as technology advances, because legislators everywhere are one step behind the potential of evil people to do harm using technology.  We try to keep up to provide general protection.I will make a final comment on the sexualising of children, about which we all have concerns.  Television, radio and newspapers participate in almost vulgarising public life and discourse in this regard.  We cannot turn the tide in that respect but the issue needs to addressed and our responsibility is to provide robust laws.

Committee Stage is a mechanism with which to tease out problems in legislation.  It is useful in spotting loopholes or mistakes made in drafting, which parliamentary draftsmen, the Minister and Members on this side of the House will acknowledge.  As I said earlier, it is very difficult to produce legislation which is free from anomaly but we should try to achieve it as far as possible.It is a pity we do not have enough time with this Bill, because of its emergency nature.  At this hour it is difficult to focus fully on the urgency and importance of getting it right.  I will not oppose the Bill but urge the Minister to address the other issues that have arisen, because we are only putting sticking plaster on the problems.  Given new technologies, such as the Internet, and the sexualisation of children we need legislation to prevent people abusing the greater openness of today's society.  Hopefully that work will be done in the coming months so that, by September or October, it is concluded and the all-party agreement that exists in respect of this Bill can ensure we have the best laws possible to deal with sexual offences, which we can be proud of and which take account of future developments as far as possible.This Bill is not time-sensitive, as was the legislation dealing with risk equalisation.  Perhaps we should have spent more time on it today or even allowed a full day later in the week to discuss it properly on Committee Stage, once we had time to reflect and reconsider after Second Stage.  There should have been a delay between Committee Stage and Report Stage because that is a vital period in which the Minister and the draftsmen can reconsider the points Members have made.  However, that cannot be done tonight because the draftsmen do not have quick answers to the points raised.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	297	On Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's point, the Bill refers to the 1998 Act in the list of legislation referred to.  It is a matter of drafting style as to whether we should include everything.  I do not believe that much hangs on whether reference should be made in the section to the Act of 1998.  Including such a reference might make the section more easily readable or it might make it less so.  I am of the view that section 6 is quite clear and that one would not be obliged to consult the list in order to discover which legislation is the Act of 1998.  That is merely a drafting point and I do not wish to make an issue of it.When Deputy Rabbitte pointed out on Thursday last that a difficulty existed, I did not know whether he was right or wrong but I assured him that if there was a problem, I would deal with it as quickly as possible.  He issued a statement on Friday asking me to deal with it as a matter of urgency and presented his Bill.  Fine Gael also presented a Bill.  My approach in respect of this matter has been to try to achieve a consensus rather than engaging in arguments as to who produced the better text.  I took the spirit of the Labour Party Bill and the text of the Fine Gael Bill and tried to achieve a fair blend of the two in order that we might deal with this matter today.  I am trying to deal with it as a matter of urgency.Despite what was stated earlier regarding the origins of the 1993 Act, it is a strange anomaly in our law that it was a summary offence, triable only summarily and with no power of detention for questioning, to ask a child to engage in sexual activity.  I do not know why that was the case or how we arrived at that position.

I cannot really answer the Deputy's question save to say that prosecution policies are laid down by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  All the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform does is sponsor laws.  It does not contact——

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	301	I am not clear as to why use of the provision appeared to dry up.  It may be that a more serious view was taken in respect of offences of this type and that an effort was made to deal with them on an indictable, rather than a summary, basis.  Perhaps that is what happened.  However, I cannot say much more because I am not privy to the prosecuting policies that are adopted in respect of these matters.I took on board Deputy Rabbitte's statement on Friday that this deficiency should be met on an urgent and agreed basis.  It is not a stroke on my part to take the Fine Gael point of view.  I did not want a situation where the House would become involved in parallel debates, on the one hand, in respect of grooming and, on the other, soliciting, and where there would not be a meeting of minds as a result.  It occurred to me that if I examined Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's Bill and came to the opinion that it was good, I should not then decide that we would deal with its subject matter on another day because of the need to deal with this issue now.  I thought I would create a division within the House by deciding that the Deputy's priorities would not be mine or vice versa.  I am trying to be reasonable in respect of how I am dealing with this matter.Deputy Jim O'Keeffe very reasonably complained that I did not tip him off regarding the use of his Bill.  I thought the first action I should take was to obtain the views of my colleagues in Government and I did so this morning.  The draft version of the Bill before us was only circulated to them before today's Cabinet meeting.

The Minister may have noticed that a number of my colleagues on this side of the House did not contribute to the debate on Second Stage.  A number of them stated that they wished to speak on the Bill but they did not have sufficient time to study its provisions.  It is a great pity that it was not possible for more Members to contribute.  Rushed legislation tends to be bad legislation.  The more time people are given to consider legislation, the better it is for everyone.Various Members eloquently made the point that enactment of the Bill will mean that we will merely be presented with a further part of a patchwork quilt.  Inevitably, more holes will appear in that quilt as time passes.

Our law is scattered across an archipelago of individual Acts.

Unfortunately, however, we are not in a position to do that work now and we will not be able to do it or implement the report of Deputy Peter Power's committee until we resolve this fundamental constitutional question.  There are some obstacles to a consolidation.On Friday, Deputy Rabbitte welcomed the fact that I had cleared the decks in order to make time available today to deal with this issue on an urgent basis.  I am trying to deal with it on just such a basis.  I am not trying to take advantage of anyone; I am merely trying to maintain unity in the House.

At what stage does an offence arise?  What requirements must be met in the context of proof in order to bring a charge — such a charge will now be indictable — of soliciting or importuning?  Will the Minister clarify what is involved?  I was somewhat alarmed by Deputy Howlin's comment that this type of charge has apparently fallen into disuse and that where such charges were brought in the past, they are no longer brought.  Is there a difficulty from the point of view of proof or otherwise?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	309	I would not state that there were no such charges.  However, Deputy Howlin is correct that there appears, in the context of prosecuting policy, to have been a decline in the use of the summary offence.  Perhaps it is the case that mere verbal remarks were not provable beyond a reasonable doubt and that attempts——

When the Deputy provided his figures, I was struck by the thought that perhaps they were used in respect of child prostitution cases.  It is not clear why——

If I did so, I would only be speculating.We tried to obtain reasons that language which includes terms such as "solicit" and "importune" were used in previous statutes.  It is clear that this does not have to be for the purpose of prostitution, so, since 2001, it does not have that narrow meaning.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	321	No.  The payment of money is not the issue.  Soliciting a prostitute does not involve paying money.  Kerb-crawling would amount to soliciting a prostitute and it was prosecutable as a summary offence.  It was not regarded as an indictable offence.  It was the division of that offence into two categories that led, I believe, to this particular offence being regarded as a summary offence in the past.I would draw the House's attention to the fact that we are dealing here — this is a point that will arise later on a Labour Party amendment — with offences under section 2 or 3 of the 2006 Act or an offence referred to in section 2 of the 1999 Act which is sexual assault.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	322	I welcome that.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	324	Less.

At the point of solicitation, unless some remarkably clear language is used, one must be in a position to include sexual assault in it as well because otherwise it is extremely difficult to prove that it is for that purpose.Another point that will arise later on the Labour Party's amendments, is that this is gender neutral.  That was one of the reasons it occurred to me last weekend that it was not simply a matter of looking to defilement of girls or whatever with which we were concerned which was the offence to which the solicitation offence originally applied, but that young boys, especially in the context that we were dealing with last week, had to be comprehended in exactly the same way by whatever legislation we put in place.The one point I want to emphasise is that if we do not make it indictable — I think there is a consensus that we should——

It is essential in these cases that we deal with it that way.There is also the question if one is dealing with a summary offence — there may be some exception for children offences but I think I am correct in saying — that it must be prosecuted within six months of the commission of offence.  Most summary offences, in any case, are so prosecuted.  The issue of time limits would arise for this offence which might not otherwise arise, and by making it indictable we get around that issue as well.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	330	Before we get to my party's amendments which have been trailed by the Minister, I want to state that I welcome the inclusion of the sexual assault provision, which goes further than the draft Bill the Labour Party produced last Friday and which is a good addition.In terms of the genesis of this legislation, I posed another question but I do not know whether the Minister has had an opportunity to address it.  The confusion arose over the 2001 Act in which section 250 was quite clear that it did not relate solely to prostitution whereas the explanatory memorandum circulated with the same Bill specifically stated it was increasing the penalties for acts related to prostitution.  I do not know how that confusion and conflict between the explanatory memorandum and the Act came to be, but we are where we are on section 2.  I thought the restatement of the 1993 offence in the 2001 Act was there to clarify and crystalise the position, or at least seemed to do so on reading it.I do not know whether I will get an opportunity to deal with the broader issue which for me, as a non-lawyer, it is a complex one, namely, the constitutionality provision that Deputy Rabbitte raised earlier.

However, it is interesting to note that sexual assault is not now the subject of any express defence.

What I am saying is that in nearly all of these cases one will not get solicitation which is clearly for an act of intercourse as opposed to a sexual assault.  Solicitation will rarely be put in terms which makes it clear that it is for——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	347	Penetration.

Therefore, there would be a peculiar position if we started erecting defences now to this particular offence without going down the road of providing an explicit defence for sexual assault cases as well.  I am trying to contain the entire operation.  Unless one contains the legislation, this is a little like a chain of dominos in a room where if one pushes one and it falls and hits another, the implications grow ever wider.Let us be clear that the Supreme Court decision in the CC case rotated around the seriousness of the offence and the fact that there had to be mens rea and that excluding mens rea was an unconstitutional approach.  We are now in the position that the law relating to what used to be called indecent assault and which is now sexual assault is subject to the honest belief defence.  If that is the case in sexual assault, it must be the case in relation to this offence as well.  For instance, if one was soliciting a child over the Internet or over a phone to have sexual intercourse with one, the prosecution would have to prove that one knew one was dealing with a child.  There could not be a situation where one sent a text message, it landed on a child’s phone and that fact alone put one in a position of proving the reasonableness of one’s view or whatever.

Although I was relatively reassured by the Minister's comments on Second Stage, I am much less reassured now for the following reason.  The Minister is now confirming that the general application of the constitutional principle determined last year by the Supreme Court has universal application and all legislation is presumed to capture it.Is he also saying that under this Bill, the burden will fall on the prosecution to prove that the person soliciting knew that the individual solicited was under age?  We should seek to delimit such a provision.  While we have to preserve the right to claim a mistake until such time as the Constitution is amended, we could surely require that such a belief is reasonable.  Could we insert a reasonableness clause so that proof does not rest with the prosecution to the point of unreason?  This is an important issue because the Bill will otherwise fall at that hurdle.

However, the other side is that the entire onus is on the prosecution to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

That might require the prosecution to make a prima facie case which the accused must answer.  It would then be a matter for the accused to prove objectively that ——

At the end of the day, if the jury has a reasonable doubt about whether the accused knew the child was under age, it must acquit in the aftermath of the Supreme Court's decision.

If there is no evidence from which a jury could draw an inference beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew the child was under age, perhaps the accused is entitled to a direction.  I am not going down that road with this Bill; I am merely saying we are dealing with exactly the same situation that exists with regard to sexual assault.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	364	That is the point I am making.  If I begin to go through the law on sexual assault, this Bill will become immensely long and complicated and I will start addressing problems which nobody thought about before we started this evening's discussion.  I do not want to reopen the question of whether a genuinely held belief, even though unreasonable, is a defence because, according to my recollection of the Supreme Court decision in the CC case, as long as the belief was honestly held and even if it was an unreasonable opinion, it is a defence.  Therefore, section 2(3) of the 2006 Act states:It shall be a defence to proceedings for an offence under this section for the defendant to prove that he or she honestly believed that, at the time of the alleged commission of the offence, the child against whom the offence is alleged to have been committed had attained the age of 15 years.Section 2(4) continues:Where, in proceedings for an offence under this section, it falls to the court to consider whether the defendant honestly believed that, at the time of the alleged commission of the offence, the child against whom the offence is alleged to have been committed had attained the age of 15 years, the court shall have regard to the presence or absence of reasonable grounds for the defendant's so believing and all other relevant circumstances.That does not mean an honest but unreasonable relief is not a defence.  We are back to the old conundrum, so the decision we have made in respect of the Bill before us is to leave the issue of guilty knowledge on exactly the same basis as applies in the case of sexual assault and to push it no further.

Subsection (4), which amends the Civil Legal Aid Act, states:Section 26 of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 is amended, in subsection (3)(b), by the substitution of “an offence under section 6 (inserted by section 2 of the Criminal Law (Sexual 35 Offences)(Amendment) Act 2007) of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993, or of an offence under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006” for “unlawful carnal knowledge under section 1 or 2 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935”.I wonder how a law student could make any sense of that, never mind poor unfortunate legislators.  To be blunt, it is legislative gobbledygook of a high order.  We should be aiming to draft legislation which people can understand, if not at a first reading, then at least with a second glance.  Anybody coming fresh to that subsection could spend the night wondering what in the name of God it is about.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	383	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 5, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following subsection:"(3) The Schedule to the Act of 2006 is amended, in the row relating to the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993, in the third column of that row, by the deletion of "Sections 3 and 4" and the substitution therefor of "Section 3".".This is an important amendment and the Minister referred to this issue earlier.  The amendment reverses the repeal of the offence of gross indecency.  The offence was created under section 4 of the 1993 Act, which was repealed in the Schedule to last year's Act and we seek to amend the Schedule to reverse the repeal of that offence.  On Second Stage, I mentioned it was patently clear in the Ferns Report that the offence of gross indecency had a major relevance to the enforcement of criminal law until the Minister abolished it last year.  I do not know whether that was by mistake or intent because he has signalled both since.  However, this offence comprised a significant part of the charges laid against Fr. Sean Fortune, allegedly one of the most egregious offenders who occupied much space in the Ferns Report.The legislation is primarily before us to rectify one mistake in the 2006 Act but it does not deal with another error, which I presume was the inadvertent decriminalising of the offence of gross indecency.  When I pointed this out, following the short time I had to conduct analysis with my legal advisers on this last year, it was hotly denied by the Minister in the House.  I had to leave the House to have a letter typed up, which I handed to the Minister to make the point with emphasis.  He then took a different tack and pretended that the offence was obsolete but, in last weekend's newspapers, the Department put out the line that the abolition of the offence of gross indecency was intended all along on the basis of gender equality.  The bottom line is the offence provided a measure of protection for young boys aged between 15 and 17 years until it was abolished last year.  This protection was deliberately crafted and put in place by the former Minister for Justice, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, when she presented the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 1993 to the House.I fully accept there may well be issues regarding gender proofing of age based on a zone of exemption but the offence should not simply be abolished pending resolution of that issue.  The offence should remain in place and the broader issue can be addressed because there are issues to which we must return.  This lacuna should not remain.  The measure was designed to protect young boys aged between 15 and 17 years and it was deliberately inserted and crafted by Máire Geoghegan-Quinn before being deliberately or inadvertently deleted last year.  I ask that it be restored and if there are issues relating to gender equality, we should deal with them, as we have resolved to deal with other issues relating to the legislation at a later date.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	384	The 2006 Act prohibited certain sexual acts, including sexual intercourse, buggery or acts described in section 4(1) of the 1990 Act such as sexual defilement involving humiliation and aggravated circumstances of that kind.  However, what we have now is a situation in which a girl aged between 15 and 17 years can engage in heavy petting with a boyfriend aged over 18 without him committing an offence.  If I acceded to the Deputy's amendment — I do not say there is no argument in favour of it — heavy petting between two males would result in the older male committing a criminal offence of gross indecency.I take the Deputy's point about the Ferns Report but, by the same token, I am not attracted to a situation in which an 18 year old gay boy who has a 16 year old gay boyfriend would engage in a criminal act where if they were a heterosexual couple, it would not be a criminal act.  This is a matter for judgment, which is not that easy.  It would be very difficult for me now, whatever about last year, to say I have been thinking about this for a year, which I have not, and I have decided to revert to the old system.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	389	I welcome the Minister's frank explanation, which is a significant advance on last year.  We are trying to grapple with difficult issues and nobody is gainsaying that.  The Minister is correct that we are making law that has general application.  However, I did not have the case of an 18 year old gay man who has a 16 year old boyfriend in mind.  I have in mind a 16 year old boy being inveigled into a sexual act by a much older man.  When she decriminalised homosexual acts between consenting males and set the age of consent at 17, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn felt it was important in doing so to insert a zone of protection for those aged between 15 and 17 years so it would not be open to older people to inveigle children into sexual acts with them.  There is still a case for that.  I had to read the Ferns Report in detail because it concerned my constituency.  This issue so parallels many of the offences in that report, particularly those committed by Sean Fortune, and they comprised the bulk of the charge sheet against him, but those charges no longer exist.  I am not content that is right, although there is obviously some logic to the Minister's explanation.  My preference is to err on the side of the zone of protection, even if it is intrusive in respect of young people.  On whether boys of 16 years should be engaged in this sort of behaviour, I am not saying it should be criminalised for the 16 year old, and it would not be under this provision.  However, it would be for the older man, someone over 17 years.  There is a case for it.

I am not getting on some politically correct high horse and saying there is no substance to the Deputy's point.  What I am saying is that one might say very heavy petting, including masturbatory behaviour, by a girl aged 16 years with a man aged 36 or 56 years——

However, whatever we do, I do not believe there is a basis for saying a 16 year old gay boy should be dealt with differently from a 16 year old heterosexual girl in the same circumstances.  I do not see there is a huge difference between the two.  If, as a Legislature, we say a girl is entitled to behave in a manner which would amount to gross indecency with a much older man, I do not see how we can say we should criminalise it just because there are two males involved.  That is the only view inherent in the 2006 Act, namely, that it was a gender neutral Act in so far as we could make it one.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	395	I do not know how it sounds to the Minister but the notion of a 36 year old man engaging in the type of activity he described with a 16 year old girl is not acceptable either.

The answer to that is: "I do not know."  This is not an easy one and I do not want to get into the matter.The principle of the 2006 Act was that it was gender neutral in so far as it could be with one exception, namely, that we did not want to criminalise pregnant girls.  Subject to that exception, we approached it on the basis that an offence could be committed equally against boys and girls and that all acts which were not criminal with a boy were not criminal with a girl.  That was the approach we took.If I were to accept the Deputy's amendment, I would be turning back the clock and saying that a 16 year old girl can commit certain acts with a 50 year old man but a 16 year old boy cannot.  I am not particularly happy going down that road.  That is the position in which we find ourselves.

This is the third loophole we have identified.  There are probably many other anomalies.  This section begs the question what we were doing in 2006 because we are now introducing a range of new penalties and increasing the sentence from two to five years.  I am not questioning the increase but what happened between June of last year and now to result in an increase in the sentence to a longer period.  Why did we not set it at five years last year?We need to return and debate the complexities of this at the earliest opportunity.  Other anomalies and loopholes will be highlighted as cases are taken and as barristers and the courts grapple with this legislation and the 2006 Act.  I hope they will not affect convictions and that judges will find in our favour as legislators.  This is the wrong way to conduct business.

It would be very strange indeed if asking somebody to do something carried a heavier penalty than attempting to do it to them.  That is all we are providing for.

I am impressed by the Minister's explanation.  There is a requirement that the law should be as gender neutral as possible.  The Minister made the exception last year in regard to pregnant girls.  We cannot always follow that general principle.We will have to return to this issue.  In the meantime, I will not press my amendment because the issue has received a fair airing and a fair explanation of the Minister's stand has been put to the House.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	414	I overheard the debate on this interesting subject, which is similar to a matter on which I have corresponded previously with the Tánaiste by way of parliamentary question and it should not surprise him.  As the law stands in respect of minors and their protection from predators, I can testify there is virtually no protection.  My experience in this regard suggests the amendment under discussion would leave parents asking who will look after the interests of the child in the case of an adult male predator, for want of a better description.  The agencies to which one has recourse are the Garda, the health services and, in the case of a schoolchild, the National Educational Welfare Board.  In the case to which I refer, all three were approached and nothing happened despite repeated parliamentary questions and repeated raising of the issue.It was not that no one knew of the circumstances but that clearly no one wished to respond despite the fact that the child was 17 years of age and in some quarters might be deemed to be sufficiently adult to be able to give consent.  However, parents' views must also be taken into account.  The mother of the child in the case in question was rendered distraught by the suggestion that an adult male predator was able to take control, encourage the child away from home and win.  Moreover, despite their best efforts, the parents failed to elicit a response from any agency.  This is extraordinary and the Tánaiste should investigate the circumstances because I tabled questions subsequently.Ultimately, the parents took a civil action, went to court and won.  However, the other side received free legal aid.  There are extraordinary anomalies in this regard and as legislators, Members must come down hard on the side of the child and the parents, when the latter are of the opinion that something is wrong and are interested in their child's welfare.  While I have listened carefully to this debate, this has not been done thus far.  This matter is extremely serious and is so viewed by the parents of young people outside the House.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	415	I move amendment No. 3:
In page 5, paragraph (a), between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:"(1A) (a) A person commits an offence if—(i) he or she intentionally arranges or facilitates something that he intends to do, intends another person to do, or believes that another person will do, in any part of the world, and(ii) doing it will involve the commission of an offence under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006.(b) A person guilty of an offence under this subsection is liable—(i) on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or a fine not exceeding €5000 or both,(ii) on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years.".In essence, the Tánaiste has replicated part of a Bill tabled by the Fine Gael Party in respect of grooming.  I understand it mirrors section 15 of the United Kingdom enactment.  I suggest the inclusion of section 14 of the United Kingdom Act in the legislation before the House because it deals with the issue of grooming itself.  In the United Kingdom Act, sections 14 and 15 complement each other and go together.  However, only section 15, which pertains to travelling, is to be put into Irish law.  Is there a reason section 14 of the United Kingdom Act, which deals specifically with the grooming element, should not also be mirrored in Irish legislation?Deputy Jim O'Keeffe was the original proposer of this Bill and the same path has been followed by the Tánaiste.  Is there a reason this provision was not included?  Would accepting my suggested amendment not strengthen the provision?  I acknowledge it has been lifted from the United Kingdom provision.  Sections 14 and 15 of the United Kingdom Act appear to be both complementary and necessary.

As mentioned earlier, I am prepared to take on board the technical changes suggested by the Tánaiste.However, I am unsure whether this section of the United Kingdom Act translates readily into Irish law.  Were the Tánaiste and his officials happy with it, I would be inclined to go along with it.  I considered that the question of grooming, which involves communication with and subsequent travelling to meet the child, is clear and explicit and could be dealt with.  However, I am unsure whether the manner in which it is proposed to transpose this section of the United Kingdom legislation is clear and explicit.  As it stands, it probably requires further teasing out before being translated into Irish law.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	417	While listening to the debate and considering its history and the point to which it has brought Members, particularly in respect of this section and the proposed amendments, I have become worried that the Tánaiste's intention to achieve consensus will not lead to good or comprehensive legislation.  People will not forgive Members if they get this issue wrong for the fourth time.  If they so do, whoever is returned after the next election will not return to the issue until well into the autumn.  Consequently, children will be left unprotected for the entire summer, or more worryingly, will have a false sense of protection.  In respect of the section under discussion in particular, the Minister is now lifting individual provisions from other legislation and is transposing them without taking account of their context within the legislation introduced in the United Kingdom.  Members should not put together laws to protect children in this fashion and I have grave concerns about such legislation.I am also concerned about implementation.  Where are Members going with this issue and how will it be implemented?  Where is the protection?  Members should consider that last year, 300 children who came to Ireland seeking protection and who were placed in the care of the Health Service Executive went missing.  While I am sure there were many reasons for this, when one considers the legislation before the House and the manner in which it is being introduced, I do not see that Members are giving children the protection they need or deserve.  Moreover, I am worried that people will not forgive Members for rushing this through again.  This issue pertains to rushed legislation.  When one takes a serious look at the complexity of legislation such as this and realises how difficult it is, I do not think it can be dealt with in this manner, particularly considering the issues we discussed during the past few minutes on whether one has a zone of complete protection from 15 to 17 years and whether it is extended to both males and females.I am getting very worried listening to the debate.  The Minister cannot for the sake of consensus do it in this fashion.  I do not want to be one of the people who reads headlines during the coming months telling me an awful crime was perpetrated and somehow we did not legislate to protect children.  It must be done, but is this the best way to do it?  Will we offer complete protection to children?  If not, parents will not forgive us.

The UK Sexual Offences Act 2003 is extremely far-reaching legislation.  I would not be immediately attracted to some of its provisions which is why I took what Deputy Jim O'Keeffe tendered as a balance.  It had an adjustment of the child pornography Act of 1998 to amplify the protection for children and a particular offence of travelling having groomed.  Those are the two offences he chose, one of which is based substantially on section 15 of the UK Act.Section 14 of the UK Act is worrisome.

I feel if I produced section 14 in a Bill and sent it to the Attorney General's office the staff would, as they have done on a number of occasions, state it is so vague it is impermissible.  If one wishes to criminalise something, one should state what one wants to criminalise.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	422	It is extremely opaque.  To be fair, my officials examined the Fine Gael Bill and saw what was done.  It tweaked the 1998 pornography Act and brought in a travelling having groomed offence.  Those are two fairly safe changes.I am grateful to Deputy Howlin for raising this issue.  It underlines that certain provisions introduced in UK legislation are extremely vague in their ambit.  Section 14 of the UK Act states:14(1) A person commits an offence if—(a) he intentionally arranges or facilitates something that he intends to do, intends another person to do, or believes that another person will do, in any part of the world, and(b) doing it will involve the commission of an offence under any of sections 9 to 13.Section 14(1)(a) is extra-territorial in context.  Sections 9 to 13 of that Act encompass a series of child sex offences.I do not wish to make a point on Deputy Howlin's drafting.  However, his amendment states "doing it will involve the commission of an offence under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006", which is territorially bound to Ireland.  It does not lie easily with the previous subsection in his amendment which mentions "any part of the world".  I do not want to go down this road.Returning to a point I made previously, interestingly the amendment does not cover sexual assault.  To commit this version of the offence, one must prove it was for buggery, intercourse or the aggravated sexual activity in the 2006 Act.  A mere sexual assault would not be covered.  Therefore, one must prove exactly what type of perverted behaviour was in contemplation when the arrangement was made.  It would be almost impossible.

At this stage, I can confirm that in drawing up the Fine Gael Bill I had the assistance of somebody who once worked in the Attorney General's office.  I was happy it was largely acceptable which is why I pressed it so strongly.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	426	I take much of what the Minister stated on this area.  All the talk about Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's Bill and the Minister's acceptance of it has been on outlawing the crime of grooming.  In fact, the section does not do this — it outlaws grooming and travelling.  However, grooming a child for sex is not an offence and will not be after enacting this Bill unless it is followed up by someone travelling to commit that sexual offence.We need to deal with this aspect.  The Minister stated section 14 of the UK Act is vague.  This is why my amendment redrafts it in a way which makes sense in my judgment.  It does not deal with the offence of sexual assault because it deals with grooming for a serious offence.  This was a deliberate decision made.  Often, one can prove this by text or e-mail communications that were made.  They would be part of the evidential chain to prove it.  People do travel and one hears reports that many people travel to the Philippines to exploit children.  In my judgment, the grooming element alone should be an offence.We must wait for the Criminal Justice (Trafficking in Persons and Sexual Offences) Bill.  Bluntly, it will not happen in this Dáil and this is a great pity.  The Minister circulated the heads of the Bill and it is extremely important and urgent legislation.  In that context, I do not wish to delay the House much further on this amendment.  It is a mistake to believe the capturing of Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's proposal and the reinstatement of it in tonight's Bill by the Minister deals with the issue of grooming.  It is an illusion to believe this is the case.  It deals partly with it, in that grooming must be followed by the action of travelling for sex.  I believe we have consensus in the House that the act of grooming should be addressed as an offence in itself.  I know it will be when the Criminal Justice (Trafficking in Persons and Sexual Offences) Bill eventually comes before the House.  Alas, it will not happen in the lifetime of the 29th Dáil.

However, in drafting the Bill initially, I was cognisant of the difficulties of proving issues arising from the exchange of texts and Internet communication and the proofs which would be necessary to constitute an offence.  I agree entirely that while the main issue is covered in the Fine Gael Bill now incorporated in the Minister's Bill, we need to return to other aspects of grooming.  However, we covered the worst aspects of grooming which involve the initial creation of a sense of trust and security on the part of a vulnerable young person followed by travelling and meeting for the purpose of sexual exploitation.  We covered the main criminal aspects of grooming.  I am open to the proposal from Deputy Howlin that we must return to the other aspects of grooming and deal with them in far more detail in the future.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	428	I welcome amendment No. 3 on section 6 and I particularly welcome the Bill.  So far, we had an extremely balanced debate which is important.  We all have one shared objective regardless of political view points.  The objective of this legislation is to do our utmost as Members of the Oireachtas to protect children.This is a very important Bill, which I strongly support.  I feel very strongly about the issue of sexual exploitation of children, which is a horrific crime that has gone on for many years.  It has occurred through history and still occurs.  Children must be the priority in this debate.I have worked with many cases of child abuse over the past 20 years and met many victims.  A very good friend of mine was sexually abused as a child and I know at first hand how that person has suffered and still suffers today.  It is nightmare and a living hell for many people.I use this opportunity to say to those who bear responsibility for some of the abuse in the past, particularly the religious orders, that they must reflect on the way they acted and treated some of the victims.  It is an issue that must be dealt with.It is important that the Bill provides for a grooming offence, and I welcome that important provision.  A number of Deputies have mentioned other countries and the act occurs in certain other nations.  I will not name the countries as I do not believe it fair to label different countries.  We all have people in our societies and countries who exploit and sexually abuse children.I welcome the debate and will strongly support the amendments.

We are working on a major piece of legislation relating to grooming.  It is very difficult to create grooming offences and we must be extremely careful about the language used.  Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's two proposals in his Private Members' Bill occurred to us as reasonable amendments which were safe, and he tip-toed around the unsafe aspects.  That is no bad thing as they could cause us all to hesitate if we were to discuss enacting them this evening.

In page 5, lines 38 to 40, to delete all words from and including ", having" in line 38 down to and including "occasions" in line 40.It is not clear why it is necessary to have prior communication on two occasions.  Did the Minister pick that number for a reason or would one occasion be sufficient?  Is it there because a mistake could be made by an individual who would not know the age of a child?  I seek elaboration on this aspect.

Their approach was that if there was an established pattern of behaviour, they would be in a better position to convince juries the act was no accident, misunderstanding or impulsive action, but a careful grooming pattern.  The person would have put in place on a number of occasions steps to bring about the encounter with the child.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	436	I can see how that would be very helpful to the prosecution in getting a conviction.  If somebody made contact with a child abroad and explicitly sought to plan a rendezvous for a sexual encounter, before travelling and having the encounter abroad, no offence would be committed unless it was done more than once.

As I understand, the British draftsman wanted to make it very clear that in order for this offence to take place, an established pattern of behaviour, and not just a once-off text message or something similar, would have to be in place.  Grooming, conceptually, is not just simply making an arrangement to meet somebody but teeing up the child over a period of time with a view to inducing the child to be available.  It is the difference between soliciting or importuning, which we are dealing with elsewhere in the Bill, and grooming, which is a pattern of insidious behaviour and making arrangements for the child.I agree that one could look at the section and ask why the stipulation for at least two communications in the past.  This was to establish that this offence was committed where a prior pattern of communication existed.

It was put to me that grooming did not arise from a chance encounter, and I accepted that ultimately.  From that point of view, in order to prove grooming it had to be proved that a person lulled a child into a sense of false security and trust and that, essentially, it would not be grooming if that arose from a chance encounter on one occasion.  It would have to be shown that there were two encounters or communications to achieve, as mentioned by the Minister, a pattern qualifying as grooming.The view might be taken that there should be a separate offence.

If we are depending on section 15 of the UK Act alone, there is no parallel grooming offence, inadequate as the Minister deems it to be in the UK legislation.  We do not have such an offence and will not have it following the enactment of this legislation.  It seems to be a lacuna and yet another issue we will have to return to with the comprehensive package on which the Minister has drafted heads of a Bill.  There are many more holes to deal with in future.

Most people want to know whether this legislation will protect their children until we have a consolidated Act that deals with all of the issues identified.On grooming, I understand the requirement for two contacts.  The English drafters wanted to verify whether a person backed off even after meeting someone who was obviously a child.  It involves being clear on the person's intentions.  Grooming does not always take place on the Internet, via texting or abroad.  The expert in this matter is Dr. Kevin Brown, who works for the UK Government and makes the point that paedophiles often move into new areas because they have identified children they consider targets.  He makes the point that the first contact can be——

We must get the important issue of grooming right because it is sometimes the parents rather than the children who are groomed.  The paedophile is allowed to become part and parcel of the family's immediate circle and a trusted friend.While the child becomes the victim, we must cater for this difficult matter in the forthcoming legislation.  It was what transpired in respect of most of the sexual abuse that occurred in Ireland.

It is important that we not make information technology or the Internet out to be the enemy in this regard.  We must consider long and hard about the dangers to which young people are subjected through their families and family friends.  We should not ignore that issue in the debate.There is a danger that too much attention is given to tabloid headlines on Internet usage and the fact that young people are using Myspace and Bebo to meet new people and make new friends.  This new social network is not wrong and should be welcomed because it is part of what a young person does today.  We should be careful not to criticise it.We must revisit some of the protection afforded young people and we should ensure the Stay Safe programme is available in every school and teachers, parents and young people are informed about what can happen.  That said, we should be careful not to scapegoat new technology.  We should ensure proper safeguards are in place and that children are protected when they are with their families, friends or family friends as well as in the context of emerging technologies.

One is traceable if one participates in a chat room.  Parents who are afraid for their children can control a great deal, but unless they sit behind the children while on-line, they cannot determine what sites are being visited and what is being said.  There is a heightened risk.I take Deputy Lynch's point that irrespective of the Internet, a determined paedophile can go to extraordinary lengths to insinuate himself or herself into the company of parents and children.  We should not be blind to that fact, but we should acknowledge that what Deputy Peter Power stated is true, namely, children are being bombarded on all sides by ideas, images, a lack of values and sexualising material as part of the new information age to which Deputy Cuffe referred.  No matter how vivid our imaginations were 30 to 40 years ago, we were not in the same place.  Human nature changes to some extent, but it does not in other senses.  Whereas Ireland in the 1950s had its fair share of dirty thoughts, occasions of sin and so on, we are in a different world.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	476	I move amendment No. 5:
In page 6, line 31, before "inviting" to insert the following:"in the case of a child who is more than 5 years younger than the person concerned,".I tried to read the legislation today.  The last part of the Bill causes concern, namely, the definition of sexual exploitation.  The proposed subsections 3(a), 3(b), 3(c) and 3(d) are fine, but the definition in subsection 3(e) includes “inviting, inducing or coercing the child to participate in or observe any activity of a sexual or indecent nature”.  Inviting a child to participate in any activity of a sexual nature would become an offence under this provision.The Labour Party welcomes the offence of travelling to meet a child for the purposes of under age sex.  The House is unified in outlawing such, but we want to enshrine the provisions in a logical way.  In the new subsection 3(e), the Tánaiste proposes that it be an offence to travel to meet a child for any sexual purpose, regardless of the age of the person, who may be a child himself or herself, meeting the child.  For example, if an 18 year old girl made an arrangement to travel to meet a 16 year old boy to engage in intimacy — I am not referring to penetration — she would be committing an offence although the acts committed are not offences.  It is an anomaly that travelling to do something that is not an offence could be an offence itself because of this provision’s broad sweep.  While I am sure such is not intended and that the people involved would not be prosecuted, the law as defined is open to that interpretation.I sought a way around the difficulty because there is a requirement to avoid the exploitation of children.  After the hour or two in which I had to consider the matter, I would suggest introducing an age gap.  In the case of a child who is more than five years younger than the person concerned, the exploitative motivation could justify a criminal provision, but two young people arranging a rendezvous for a snog should not be criminalised, which is not our intention.  Encompassing any activity of a sexual nature as a potential offence under this section strikes me as being a broad canvas.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	477	It is important that we look at the whole of section 3 of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998.  It reads:(1) Any person who organises or knowingly facilitates—(a) the entry into, transit through or exit from the State of a child for the purpose of his or her sexual exploitation, or(b) the provision of accommodation for a child for such a purpose while in the State,shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for life.(2) Any person who—(a) takes, detains, or restricts the personal liberty of a child for the purpose of his or her sexual exploitation. . .Sexual exploitation is given the particular meaning with we are dealing.  It is not as broad as one might think.  It criminalises somebody who takes, detains or restricts the personal liberty of a child for the purpose of his or her exploitation.  Exploitation now includes——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	478	Will the Minister please read that again?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	479	Subsection (2) refers in paragraph (a) to a person who takes, detains or restricts the personal liberty of a child for the purpose of his or her sexual exploitation, in paragraph (b) to a person who uses a child for such a purpose, and in paragraph (c) to a person who organises or knowingly facilitates such taking, detaining, restricting or use.  Such a person shall be guilty of an offence and liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years.  I am just making the point that this definition of sexual exploitation is restricted to certain activities which are criminalised under the section.  It is not a general statement that anybody who exposes a child to observing sexual activity commits an offence.  It is not that broad.  That would amount, in effect, to turning on a blue movie in a room or something similar.

There is an enormous amount of material on television channels such as Sky that could be seen as of a sexual nature.  We should be cautious in introducing such catch-all definitions.  I take the Minister's point about taking, detaining or restraining, but on the other side this is a very broad definition of activity.

Perhaps he could reflect on the matter.  He is reading out subsections (1) and (2) which I understand have nothing to do with the Bill.  The new definition in the new subsection (3)(e) will apply to a new offence under subsection (2)(a).

I wish we had more time to consider this matter and come back to it on Report Stage because I am not content that the broadness of the definition I am suggesting does not apply.  I need to cross-reference the 1998 Act with it again.  We are back to the situation we dealt with last year.  On the floor of the House we are cross-referencing legislation.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	565	At every step of the way, we have unveiled the complexity of the legislation in this area and the absolute requirement for care in that regard.  Anybody who reads the transcript of this debate will be less secure in their belief that the House has legislated well for these matters.  I genuinely believe we will have to return to this issue at an early date.  I am not looking forward to the complex and difficult debate that will ensue on that occasion.  We will have to make judgment calls on a number of issues.  I am not convinced that the Minister's explanation of the last point we considered is accurate, but I do not have time to reflect on it adequately or get proper advice on it.  The net point is that it is important to enact two provisions into law.  The first of those provisions will close the gap we identified last week.  The second provision, which was proposed by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, has been embraced by the Minister.  It will prohibit grooming and travelling to use children for sexual gratification.  It is important that we adopt those two measures.Careful work needs to be done throughout this area because there are large holes in the body of our child protection law.  The consolidation Bill that has been promised by the Minister needs to front-loaded.  The production of such a Bill in any area is complex, but it will be particularly difficult in this area.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate a timeframe for that Bill.  Does he have a team of officials working on it on a full-time basis?  When can we expect the Bill?  It is obvious that those who are developing the Bill have to presume that the House will speedily pass a resolution to cause a referendum to be put to the people and that the people will allow us to create the zone of protection that the all-party committee envisaged.  A substantial amount of work can be done, with that proviso, to improve the existing law vastly.  We will have to make some hard calls.Deputy Jim O'Keeffe and I have been in dialogue with the Minister of State with responsibility for children, in particular.  I do not know what the Government's firm view is on the development of a zone of protection based on age.  I do not know what its settled view is on the age of consent.  We need to go beyond political deft footwork to the point of determining what we can agree on a consensual basis.  We should not try to hand-trip each other on these matters because they are too important.  We need to provide for a general joined-up process.  It was too smart by half to have a protection amendment ready to roll, in the absence of any mention of an agreed zone of protection in terms of age, or an agreed age of consent for sexual intercourse.  The Government needs to outline its views on such matters so we can make progress with them speedily.  I will not pursue amendment No. 5.  All of my amendments have unveiled the frailty of this enactment, which is far from comprehensive.  It attempts to plug one identified loophole, but we will have to try to plug many other loopholes very soon.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	566	I take the point that Deputy Howlin is making.  The Deputy and I, along with many others, worked hard over many months at the committee chaired by Deputy Peter Power to develop an agenda for reforming the child protection law.  In that context, we appreciated that the law would have to be restated.  It is hard to pull it all together because it is spread over a pile of difficult and obscure statutes.  Our consideration of the sexual abuse of children must form part of a broader consideration of sexual abuse among adults.  We really need a restatement of our law in relation to sexual offences generally.  It should also be stated and acknowledged that the law on sexual offences is complex.  There are moral, judgment and value issues to be considered and also gender and sexual orientation issues which are sensitive.  There is no point in codding ourselves about all these issues.  It is not an easy area of law to deal with and if it was easy, doubtless we would have had significant reforming Acts.  I refer to the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act and legislation relating to fraud and theft offences which are significant codifying statutes.  However, this is a difficult area.Last Friday I was informed that it was to be welcomed that the House would address the issue of section 6 of the 1993 Act but as the Deputies have seen, dealing with it has been slightly more complex than was then thought; if it was to be made an indictable offence, there were certain consequences and certain other knock-on effects of changing the law which had to be dealt with.  Last Friday, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe tabled a Private Member's Bill on an issue which was of immediate relevance to many people — the issue of grooming.  I could have allowed Deputy Jim O'Keeffe proceed with his Bill and then I could ignore it while dealing with the narrow issue.  If I had done so, this would have been a very unsatisfactory evening because we would have been like trains on different tracks, talking about the same issue but never meeting and with no meeting of minds.  My officials and I looked at the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill.  We saw it had been careful not to trespass on to the more controversial areas of grooming which must await the more comprehensive legislation.  It had taken what I believe to be an improving but careful approach which most people would say was a desirable improvement in the law and which would give confidence that something was being done about people who planned to prey sexually on young people.  We decided that rather than have an inconclusive debate in which the Fine Gael Bill would be accepted by the Government and then fall into limbo, we should try and give it the impetus of enactment if possible.  I have taken the spirit of the Labour Party Bill and the substance of the Fine Gael Bill and done my best to make sure the two are dealt with in this measure.  I have done this on the basis that I wanted to unite the House.I fully accept and agree with what Deputy Howlin is canvassing, namely that all this underlines the proposition that a comprehensive new sexual offences law is needed.  I advance the second proposition that we also need to clear up this issue of the absolute zone of protection because legislating in this area without clearing this issue up will be deeply unsatisfactory, for all the reasons canvassed in Deputy Peter Power's committee.The Deputy raises the point that it was too clever by half to propose an amendment to the Constitution allowing for an absolute zone of protection without stipulating in advance what the Government's view about the age of consent should be.  This is an issue on which I respectfully beg to differ from him.  It is possible for this House and after a general election it is possible for the newly-elected Members of this House later this year to decide where they want to be on that issue.

It is a case of talking about 365 days.  I know that a year is a long time in the life of a child but the Deputy is talking about a fairly arbitrary distinction, one way or the other.

I am conscious we have only 15 minutes remaining.I wish to be clear about amendment No. 5 but I will not be putting it to a vote.  Section 6 creates a new subsection 2(a) of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998.  It is a new offence.  The key point of the new offence is visible in subsection 2(a).  The new offence will be to meet a person for sexual exploitation after two prior contacts.  Sexual exploitation is defined as meaning what subsection (3) says, including inducing or coercing a child to participate or observe any activity of a sexual nature.  I think that stands alone from the provisions which the Minister has quoted regarding capturing or corralling or whatever other phrase was used.  It is a stand-alone provision and I believe my interpretation of it is correct.  It shows that both the Minister and I need more time to be quite clear and explicit on these things.

I specifically proposed an amendment suggesting the House would revisit the legislation within six months.  Little did I know that my wish would be granted and that the Minister would have to come back to the House to propose new legislation.  I feel a sense of déjà vu.  Deputy Howlin is showing up some of the problematic areas within the legislation.  Members only received the text of the Bill this morning.  It is unacceptable to expect all parties within a matter of hours to digest complex legislation and ensure it is watertight.  It is ironic to be considering changes in legislation, given that only last summer the House was trying to close the loopholes.  I have concerns about this section.  I worry about the loose definitions listed in section 6(3)(e) of inviting, inducing or coercing a child to observe activity of a sexual or indecent nature.  I am worried the Minister is suggesting that a reasonable court would not interpret the proposed legislation badly.  We are doing a rushed job, as we did last summer.  I humbly suggest we will probably have to revisit this legislation in the coming months.  It is important that we put on record the need to consider this legislation more calmly.  I am sure the consolidating legislation to which the Minister referred will enable us to do this, but I feel uneasy at rushing through legislation at what is literally the eleventh hour.  It is late in the day but we have had less than 24 hours to consider the Bill.

I am delighted my colleague from Limerick East, Deputy O'Sullivan, is also raising the issue.  Only last week, I spoke on the Adjournment about the crisis in the catering services at Shannon Airport.  The airport is facing a critical period in the coming months and years in an era of open skies.  People in the region are very concerned about the airport and the Government's commitment to it.  Obviously, there will be some opposition to the open skies agreement among the transport Ministers — I understand the UK has some reservations — but it is expected it will be ratified at a US-EU summit on 30 April next.The Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, talks up open skies and claims significant economic benefits will flow from such an agreement.  That may be so, but if that is to happen, Shannon Airport must be prepared for it.  I have always argued that while open skies are good for Dublin, they may not be good for Shannon.  When the Minister, Deputy Cullen, negotiated the amendment to the current bilateral agreement in November 2005, it was a bad deal for Shannon.  He negotiated an 18-month transitional period for the airport when it should have got three to five years to prepare for open skies.  Unfortunately, that did not happen.We were of the opinion that an 18-month transitional period would come into place once an agreement between the EU and the US was signed.  It now appears the Minster has backtracked once again and that this transitional period has applied since last October.  If the open skies agreement is signed off in April, Shannon Airport will only have a 12-month transitional period, which is a very short time — just one season.  The Minister has sold out the mid-west and has done a very bad job in preparing Shannon Airport for open skies.  I wonder how his colleagues in the European Commission feel on this issue because they never had any problem with Shannon Airport having its own agreement in preparation for full open skies.The Minister went on local radio yesterday to defend his transitional period and open skies.  As I said, we now know the transitional period is for 12 months.  He claims the Government has put the necessary infrastructure in place in the mid-west region to prepare it for open skies but that is not the case — it is not in place.  The Minister will argue the Ennis bypass has opened but that is only part of the solution, and only part of the bypass is open at present.  We need to have full infrastructure in place and a full bypass through all towns, particularly Gort and Crusheen, to open the west to Shannon Airport.  This will not be in place for some years.I am sure Deputy O'Sullivan will have similar to say in regard to the Shannon tunnel, which will not open for a few years yet.  Anyone travelling through Limerick city at peak morning work times will see the problems people must endure, such as a travel time of one hour.  Passengers who travel to Shannon Airport via Limerick city are also facing a critical problem.  The infrastructure is not in place.  Neither is the western rail corridor, which the Minister promised to improve with rail infrastructure for the airport.  That will not happen until 2008 at the earliest, and only from Athenry.  For the Minister to say the Government has delivered the infrastructure in preparation for open skies is entirely untrue.  I hope some of that infrastructure can be fast-tracked in preparation for this agreement.I would also like to know what will happen for the 2007 season at Shannon Airport.  We were told a tourism and development plan would be in place to prepare for open skies but we are now told by the Minister, in another U-turn, that this plan is currently being prepared and that it will come into place when the open skies policy begins to operate.  That is not good enough from the Minister and his officials.  This tourism and development plan should have been in place 12 months before open skies.  I am disappointed this has happened.The Minister has made a solo run and has let down the west.  I hope the Government will do something to bring forward the infrastructure and the tourism and development plan so Shannon Airport is prepared for open skies and can compete with the other airports in Ireland, particularly Dublin Airport.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	586	I am happy to raise this issue with Deputy Pat Breen.  The news that agreement on an open skies transatlantic deal is imminent and likely to be put in place in 2008 has sent shock waves through the mid-west.  It is not that we did not know it was coming but that commitments on transitional arrangements for Shannon are so blatantly being thrown aside by the Government.This is the biggest change in the history of Shannon Airport, which has known many changes over the years.  Its consequences cannot simply be left to chance.  I want to quote from the reply to my Adjournment matter of 8 November 2005 and to my written parliamentary question tabled on 27 June 2006.  In November 2005, I was told: "I want to assure the Deputy that it has been the consistent policy of this Government that any change in transatlantic arrangements will be accompanied by an appropriate transitional arrangement to enable a smooth phasing in of open skies with the US in the future."  Last June, the Minister, Deputy Cullen, stated:In announcing the agreement reached with the US authorities last November, I indicated that I would prepare, in consultation with my colleagues, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, a tourism and economic development plan for Shannon and the West of Ireland.  Preparation of this plan is at an advanced stage.I was told that last June but, nine months later, the plan is nowhere to be seen and the lead-in time for open skies has been reduced to one year.  How can the Government renege on promises that are vital to the continued prosperity of the mid-west and west?I call on the Minister of State to ask his colleague to publish the tourism and economic development plan without further delay and to begin its implementation immediately.  An estimated €44 million is required over a five-year period to sustain the marketing and tourism product and the 75 American companies, employing 29,000 people between Donegal and north Kerry, must be assured that they will continue to have regular flights, winter as well as summer, for their business needs.I emphasise the reference to winter because there is a real concern there will be summer but not winter flights.  Without it, the job losses in Limerick and potential job losses in Nenagh that are in the news today will be followed by many more.  This is not idle speculation.  It is based on what has happened in other countries where airlines have consolidated their business into and out of the capital city.  In particular, we need an assurance that the national airline, Aer Lingus, will not renege on the commitment made two years ago by its CEO, Mr. Dermot Mannion, that it would maintain regular winter flights.  There is real scepticism in the Shannon region about Aer Lingus's commitment to Shannon and we need to see a commitment to maintaining flights into and out of Shannon all year round when open skies becomes a reality.The national development plan and Transport 21 are delivering huge infrastructural projects to the eastern part of the country but the western road and rail corridor has a much longer timeframe and there is no commitment to funding a rail link to Shannon, even though a feasibility study has now been completed.  Road links to Dublin are given a far higher priority than links from a wider hinterland to Shannon.  How can the airport compete unless a critical mass of the population can get to it easily?  I refer to people in the west midlands who go to Dublin at the moment but who would, if the roads were decent, travel to Shannon.While attaching no priority or urgency to Shannon, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, had no problem in finding €22 million for Waterford Regional Airport.  That is significant and it is about time the Government party representatives for the mid-west stood up and insisted their region be looked after as well.  The wide web of industry and tourism that has been built up on the strength of the access provided by Shannon Airport could fade away unless it is sustained and developed at this critical time.  We want clear answers and commitments on these issues and we want Government Deputies and Senators who represent the people of the mid-west to wake up and fight for their constituents.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	587	I thank Deputies Pat Breen and O'Sullivan for raising this matter on the Adjournment.The Government is committed to the liberalisation of air transport services between Ireland and the US and it is my firm belief that the introduction of an EU-US open skies regime will be good for Irish tourism, good for the country's business links and good for the economy generally.  A number of reports, such as the Brattle report for the European Commission, the report of the tourism policy review group and the Air Transport Users Council, ATUC, of the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, all support moving to open skies with the US as soon as possible.As experience at European level shows, liberalisation leads to strong growth and decreased prices in the aviation market.  Freedom of access leads to many more destinations being served.  A liberalised EU-US open skies environment could lead to similar growth across the Atlantic and will also mean more business opportunities for Irish airlines, particularly Aer Lingus.  The Government's main objective in selling a majority of its shareholding in Aer Lingus last year was to provide the company with access to new equity to enable it to compete effectively and to grow its business on short-haul and long-haul routes.  As a result of the proceeds generated by the IPO, Aer Lingus will, under the proposed open skies regime, have a unique opportunity to fulfil its potential and to contribute in a positive way to the country's economic development through the expansion of its transatlantic operations.  It is noted that the head of the Irish Hotels Federation recently commented that open skies with the US could double the number of US visitors to 2 million within seven years, generating an extra €1 billion for the Irish economy.In November 2005, EU and US negotiators concluded work on the text of a first phase EU-US open skies agreement that included a transitional arrangement for Ireland, relating to the phasing out of the Shannon stop.  During the transition period, the ratio of Dublin to Shannon flights would move from 1:1 to 3:1, so that for every one flight to or from Shannon, a carrier could provide three flights to or from Dublin.  The draft agreement was unanimously endorsed at the December 2005 Transport Council subject to sufficient progress by the US side on opening up ownership and control of US airlines to EU investors.In December 2006, following opposition from Congress, the US authorities withdrew the rule-making proposal concerning control and ownership of US airlines.  The rule-making provision has been a key demand for a number of member states and its withdrawal by the US side is a significant barrier to concluding the EU-US open skies agreement.  Negotiations at EU-US level resumed in January 2007, with both sides reaffirming their commitment to the goal of concluding an EU-US agreement that would open access to markets and maximise benefits on both sides of the Atlantic.Following intensive negotiations over recent weeks a draft open skies agreement between the EU and US was finalised last week and the text will be presented to Transport Ministers for decision at the next Council meeting on 22 March 2007.  As the transitional arrangements were incorporated in the proposed EU-US aviation agreement, their implementation was conditional on the conclusion of that agreement.  It has been agreed with the US and the EU that these transitional arrangements will stand and will enter into effect immediately following approval of the draft agreement by the Council of Ministers.  It is not true to say that a reduced transition period has been negotiated.  The original transitional provisions, as negotiated in November 2005, still stand.The Minister is confident that the liberalisation of air transport services will deliver major benefits for Ireland's economy.  The additional access to the US, as well as the increased numbers of US tourists into Ireland, will greatly benefit Irish tourism, aviation and business links generally in all parts of the country, including Shannon and the wider mid-west region.  With a view to assisting Shannon Airport and the wider region to adapt to the proposed new arrangements under an open skies regime, the Department of Transport is currently finalising an economic and tourism development plan for Shannon.  This plan was initiated in the context of the ongoing EU-US negotiations on open skies when negotiators concluded work on the text of a first phase EU-US agreement in November 2005, which included a transitional arrangement for Ireland relating to the phasing out of the Shannon stop.In preparing the plan, the Department of Transport has consulted with the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment and the Department of Finance.  A liaison group, established by the Mid-West Regional Authority, has separately prepared a report on the future development of the Shannon region as an input to the plan.  The Minister intends to bring the economic and tourism development plan to fruition in the context of the formal agreement of the EU-US open skies proposals.The aviation industry has experienced dramatic change in recent years and the future development and growth of all international and regional airports in the State will depend largely on how each airport responds to the new challenges and the extent to which emerging opportunities, such as open skies, can be exploited.  If Shannon Airport is to develop as a successful and sustainable business it is clear that one of the issues that must be addressed in its business plan is the airport's uncompetitive cost base.  When that obstacle is overcome the airport has a real opportunity to develop new markets and to attract the airline customers that it needs for its commercial future, the area's tourism and other industry.
#PaddyMcHughIND	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-party	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-dob	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	588	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to raise the serious issue of the threatened closure of Seamount College, Kinvara.  The saga surrounding Seamount College is well known to everybody.  It is known to the Department of Education and Science and the Minister for Education and Science, and last week the Tánaiste visited the school and was apprised of the situation by the very active and professional committee running the campaign to retain the college.As I said, the facts are available to everybody and presented in a manner which is easily understood.  Facts and figures have been put forward to show the need for this school now and in the future.  The statistics are indisputable and it is, therefore, incomprehensible that the Minister has not acted on this issue to date.A simple request was made to the Minister in the initial stages to create a mechanism for the enrolment of first-year students in Seamount College in September 2007.  To date the response from the Minister has been stunning silence.  That stunning silence is no way for a Minister to behave, especially when young people and the quality of the education they receive is at risk.  The Minister is responsible for those students but to date has failed to live up to her responsibility.  In the catchment area of Seamount College the CSO figures and primary school enrolments show growth of about 30% in the four years 2002-06.  In time this growth will impact on secondary schools.Parents in the catchment area of Seamount College have been attempting to have it opened to boys and girls.  The figures show there will be 600 boys and girls of secondary school age in the catchment area in three years' time.  Approximately 500 of these are already in the eight local primary schools.  Under the ham-fisted approach adopted by the Department and the Minister, it has been suggested the children can be sent to neighbouring secondary schools.  The enrolment statistics and capacity of the schools, namely, Calasanctious College, Oranmore, and Gort community school, have been studied.  Taking into account the statistics relating to Seamount College, it is simply not possible for the latter two schools to cope with the numbers that must be accommodated.The population of the area is growing so rapidly that there will, even if Seamount College were to remain open, be a severe shortage of school places in as little as two or three years' time.  Even if the college is allowed to remain open and convert to co-ed, Gort community school needs to be expanded to cater for 1,000 students.  Where do the Minister and the Department of Education and Science expect those children to find school places?Why close Seamount College?  Gort and Oranmore have excellent schools but the places available are required by the children who live in both towns.  The 600 children from the Seamount College catchment area are entitled to be educated in their locality.  The Minister, her officials and the Government should act in order to ensure this happens.  The only way it will happen is for a secondary school to continue to operate in Kinvara.  The Minister and the Government are the only people who can facilitate this.  The time for talking is over and the time for analysing figures has passed.  The statistics are stark, the figures add up and the numbers are there; all that is missing is Government action.Government thinking in respect of this matter is worthy of attention.  On his visit to the school last week, the Tánaiste stated the situation was unacceptable.  This leads one to believe that the Fianna Fáil wing of the Government is intent on closing the school.  We need clarification in respect of this matter.  If the Tánaiste is in favour of the school's survival but cannot bring it about, are we to believe the Progressive Democrats has no influence within the Government?  The Progressive Democrats promises in respect of this issue are of no use.  We need that party to demonstrate that it has influence within the Administration by bringing about a Government decision to save the school.  The Fianna Fáil wing of the Government can avoid being forced into action by the Progressive Democrats by making the decision to save the school before the latter exerts pressure.The Government parties should not play politics with this issue.  The children, their education and their futures are too important and the situation too serious to allow anyone to play politics.  I plead with the Minister to show that she cares, to live up to her responsibilities and to immediately move to save Seamount College.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	589	I thank Deputy McHugh for raising this matter.  I am making this reply on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin.In October 2006, the trustees of Seamount College, namely, the Sisters of Mercy, announced their intention to withdraw as providers of education in the Kinvara area and to close Seamount College.  The latter is a voluntary secondary school and decisions such as this are within the remit of the patron body, the Mercy Sisters.  The trustees decided that closure was to be on a phased basis with no intake of first years from September 2007, culminating in a full closure in 2012 and thus allowing the junior students to have a transition year, if feasible, and complete their leaving certificate examinations.  The trustees have confirmed directly to the Department that the current site at Seamount College will not be available for the provision of post-primary education once the college closes.Following the announcement of a phased closure by the trustees, a local action group met the Department and outlined its concerns.  Officials of the school planning section of the Department met separately with representatives of Gort community school who outlined their concerns in respect of the trustees' announcement.With regard to a decision by a patron body to close a school, the main role of the Department in a school closure is to ensure the best interests of the pupils are looked after in the period up to the closure and that there will be sufficient pupil places in existing schools in the general area for pupils who would have normally enrolled in the closing school.  Having considered the immediate implications of the decision by the Sisters of Mercy, the Department will facilitate the enrolment in Gort community school of students from the Kinvara area by amending the existing catchment area.  To facilitate an increase in enrolments at Gort community school, any additional accommodation for the school will be treated as a matter of priority by the Department.The Department recently met the authorities of Gort community school with a view to agreeing the extent of the additional accommodation required.  In addition, the Department will be reviewing the overall accommodation requirements at post-primary level in the south Galway area to identify what additional provision is required in the longer term.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	590	On Friday last I visited Tallow fire station in County Waterford.  Having raised this issue on previous occasions, and with staff and local residents waiting over a decade for a new fire station to be provided, I wanted to see for myself the dire conditions that staff at the fire station staff are obliged to endure.  What I saw amounted to a scandal.The problems begin even before one enters the building.  The fire station is located at a T junction where there is virtually no car parking.  Other spaces in the vicinity are in high demand so when firemen arrive at short notice to attend to an emergency, optimum car parking can be an issue.  When one arrives inside the premises, matters become even worse.  Part of the station is in a Portakabin.  There is no drying room for the firemen's gear.  The heating system is inadequate and does not heat the station properly.  All doors in the station have to be opened when the fire appliance, now over 16 years old, is started.  The toilets and showers are totally inadequate.  With only one toilet-cum-shower unit, firemen must queue up to use the shower after tending to fires or other emergencies.  This is not acceptable.Waterford County Council is an equal opportunities employer.  However, there is no female member of staff at the fire station at present.A site for the new Tallow fire station has been lying idle for 14 years, which is a scandal.  A few weeks ago I specifically asked the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government his proposals in respect of providing funding for the construction of a new fire station in Tallow.  The reply I received from the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, was completely inadequate and merely stated that approval in principle was granted in 2001 for a new fire station in Tallow.  The Minister of State also stated that while it has not been possible to provide funding for this station as part of the 2007 fire services capital programme, funding has been provided for various other priority projects in County Waterford since 2001.  These include replacement stations and extensions or upgrading works at stations in Ardmore, Cappoquin, Dungarvan, Dunmore East and Tramore.  That is good news for those five fire stations but it is of little benefit for those who are obliged to work in or depend for a service on the Tallow fire station.The Minister of State concluded by stating that "The provision of funding for a replacement fire station in Tallow will be considered under future fire services capital programmes having regard to overall resources and priorities under the programme".  This is not good enough.  As matters stand, and from what I saw at first hand last week, Tallow fire station must rank among the worst fire stations throughout the country.  A number of new housing developments were constructed in the Tallow area in recent years and the area covered by the fire brigade includes an oil depot, a factory and seven schools.  Tallow urgently needs a fully equipped modern fire station.  The current situation cannot be allowed continue.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	591	I thank Deputy O'Shea for raising this matter.  I am glad to place on record the Government's commitment to the fire services in terms of modernisation and financial investment.  I also wish to express our appreciation for the significant contribution which the fire services continue to make each day in safeguarding our communities.  As the Deputy will be aware, this commitment can be a dangerous one, as evidenced by a recent traffic accident resulting in the death while on duty of fire fighter Michael Liston and Garda Brian Kelleher.  I am certain that the Deputy will join me in expressing my sincere sympathy to both families.Funding has been provided for a range of priority projects which have been advanced in County Waterford in the past five years or so.  These include replacement stations and extensions or upgrading works at stations in Ardmore, Cappoquin, Dungarvan, Dunmore East and Tramore.  It would be an understatement to say that Waterford has done well.My Department has accepted the case for a replacement station at Tallow.  While approval in principle was granted for a new fire station some years ago, I expect that this project will advance through more detailed cost and design procedures as soon as possible within the wider context of Waterford's fire services development programme.  Requests submitted by fire authorities for funding for the building or refurbishment of fire stations are considered on a case-by-case basis having regard to the existing facilities, the level of activity, the proximity of other fire stations, the fire authority's priorities and the competing demands of other fire authorities for available funding.The fire service has been in receipt of considerable resources.  There have been massive improvements affecting all areas of the service — more investment in infrastructure and equipment, more staff, better training, improved communications and the stepping up of the legislation.Over the past 25 years, almost €240 million has been provided under the fire services capital programme for the provision of new and refurbished fire stations and the purchase of fire appliances and other equipment.  At this stage, over two thirds of our fire stations, including almost all of the busiest stations, have been replaced, we have a modern fleet of front-line fire appliances, and we have a modern emergency response communications system.Much improvement has been achieved already and I assure Deputy O'Shea that we are fully aware of the needs in Waterford.  I hope to respond positively to the current request in respect of Tallow as soon as resources allow.  I am conscious of the need for a new station in Tallow and it is a matter that will be very much borne in mind under the new programme.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	592	The Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, which implemented EU Council Directive 93/104/EC, of 23 November 1993, concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time, provides for an entitlement to nine public holidays per annum.Publication of data by the European Employment Observatory shows that there is a wide variation in the number of public holidays among EU Member States. The average public holiday entitlement in the EU at present is approximately 11 days per annum. Variations in the number of public holidays must be considered in the context of other factors which may bear on this matter including for example, the relationship with annual holiday entitlement, whether statutorily based or obtained by way of collective agreements. Some entitlements also stem from the legacy of historical and religious developments of specific and differing societies.Were an increase in public holidays to be considered and I stress, no increase is, at this moment, being contemplated, it would be necessary to undertake detailed and substantial consideration of issues arising, including wide ranging consultations with Social Partners and other interested parties. Among the matters to be considered would be the impact of any such increase in public holidays on the competitiveness of firms, in particular, in relation to small and medium enterprises with smaller workforces, and in terms of output and the impact on employment.Finally, I would point out that the matter of an increase in public holidays did not emerge as an issue for consideration during the detailed and substantive phases of negotiation of the recent Partnership Agreement — Towards 2016. However, there is nothing to prevent any party raising such matters for discussion in the context of any subsequent Agreement.In the circumstances, I do not share the view that proposals of this kind should be considered without regard to the wider interests of workers and the enterprises in which they are employed. I suggest that Social Partnership provides the appropriate forum in which such matters can best be considered.

Community Employment helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and by assisting them to enhance and develop both their technical and personal skills.To this end and in order to support the delivery of essential services, the ring-fencing and prioritisation of places for health related services, including assistance for persons with disabilities, childcare and Drugs Task Force clients was introduced over the period 2002/2003. As a result, service provision levels by Community Employment participants within these sectors was and continues to be maintained at a constant level.In November 2004, following a review of FAS Employment Schemes, it was announced that Community Employment places supporting the delivery of health services will continue to be ring-fenced.The total number of places spread across the three ring-fenced sectors, namely Drugs, Childcare and Health, is approximately 6,000 which represents 27% of current places and there are no plans to increase this number.

#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	595	As part of Enterprise Ireland's mission to grow global export sales, the Moscow office of that agency is running a Market Study Visit to Kazakhstan from 12th to 16th. March. The visit is part of a number of initiatives designed to introduce Enterprise Ireland client companies to one of the world's fastest growing economies (average GDP growth of 9% p.a. since 2001) and to tap the many market opportunities, in what is the world's ninth largest oil producer. The visit will also support the in-country activities of the growing number of Irish companies already active in the Kazakshstani market.As the initiative is a Market Study Visit, and not a Trade Mission, there will be no Ministerial component to the visit. However, Mr. Justin Harman, the Ambassador of Ireland to the Republic of Kazakhstan, who is based in Moscow, will actively participate in the visit. There are currently seven Irish companies intending to travel. The range of activities include:-  individual itineraries of buyer meetings for the companies; a  dinner for participants and their clients; and a networking reception co-hosted with the Kazakhstan European Business Association, which, for the first time, will also mark Saint Patrick's Day in Kazakhstan. The latter event will also be used to promote Ireland into the wider Kazakhstani business community and several non-participating Enterprise Ireland clients will use the event for product and service marketing.  Full logistical and on-the-ground support, including the provision of meeting space, is also being provided to participants during the course of the visit. The net cost of running the visit and associated events will be less than €10,000.This visit is part of Enterprise Ireland's commitment to Irish companies seeking to access the Kazakhstani market. This process began with a seminar in Dublin in July 2006 on conducting business in Kazakhstan, an October 2006 Education Mission to that country and the development of the Russian language Enterprise Ireland website with a Kazakhstan domain. Last year's Education Mission to the country resulted in multiple contracts for the twelve visiting Irish colleges and will shortly see up to forty Kazakhstani scholarship students per annum coming to study third level courses in Ireland in colleges such as: the University of Limerick; Dublin Institute of Technology; Trinity College Dublin and Waterford Institute of Technology. This mission also resulted in the signing of a major contract for the supply of English language training to staff and pilots at Air Astana, Kazakhstan's national airline.Enterprise Ireland's focus will be to assist client companies seeking to develop opportunities in the following sectors: oil and gas support services; building and construction services; telecommunications; banking and financial services; agricultural machinery; and consulting. In the context of the Market Study Visit, nearly all of the companies participating are coming to Kazakhstan for the first time; however Enterprise Ireland would be confident that their time spent in the country will result in real business for the participants and increased exports for Ireland. It is worth noting that several Irish companies already have a strong business presence in Kazakhstan. Three Irish players of note include one with significant oil sector support operations in Atyrau; another which is in the process of delivering a €5.5m oil platform support barge; and a company which provides significant training services in Almaty.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	596	Following the identification in early 2006 of anomalies in the employment contracts of some sub-contracted staff at the Moneypoint Environmental Retrofit Project (MERP) site, both the ESB and the Labour Inspectorate conducted investigations into the matter.  As a result of these investigations a Memorandum of Understanding between the ESB, the contractor and sub-contractor was agreed in March 2006 providing, among other matters, for the payment of the appropriate industry rates and the associated arrears to the workers concerned. Contractor Auditing Services (CAS), who are retained by the ESB to monitor payment and employment conditions at the Moneypoint site, have confirmed that these rates continue to be applied to the relevant workers.The ESB is satisfied that the monitoring of the conditions of employment for contracted and sub-contracted staff at the Moneypoint site is working effectively in terms of ensuring that workers are remunerated in accordance with the agreed industry standards and bringing immediate attention to, and taking prompt action to address, any discrepancies that arise. The Labour Inspectorate's role has been to ensure that statutory minimum rates of pay and other conditions of employment for the workers involved are adhered to, that any breaches of the legislation that arise are rectified and any arrears paid. Ultimately, the Labour Inspectorate may initiate proceedings against employers in relation to such breaches. Employees also have access to the Rights Commissioner Service or the Labour Court in this regard.I share the Deputy's concern to ensure that Irish employment rights legislation is applied in full in so far as employees engaged on Public contracts are concerned.  In this regard, assurances were sought in March last year from all State Agencies that the statutory terms applicable to all workers in Ireland, regardless of nationality, were being adhered to in relation to all public contracts involving the supply of labour.The Deputy will also be aware that the National Partnership Agreement Towards 2016, provides for a number of measures designed to enhance employment rights compliance. The new National Employment Rights Authority has been established on an interim basis while work is progressing on new employment rights legislation. A reconfiguration of the Labour Inspectorate is planned which will see its resources almost treble together with a process of regionalisation being implemented. In tandem with these activities a major programme of ‘Education and Awareness' in respect of employment rights entitlements and obligations is to be researched and delivered.The Government also signalled, in the context of the National Partnership talks, that the issue of better compliance with employment law was a high priority. This led, among other matters, to an agreement among the Social Partners on the importance of public procurement policy as a mechanism for contributing to the maintenance of employment standards and norms, including in respect of wage levels, while also ensuring competitive tendering and value for money in public expenditure. A number of specific measures were agreed in Towards 2016 in so far as supporting employment rights through public procurement is concerned.I would urge those who may have information in relation to possible breaches of employment rights legislation to contact the Labour Inspectorate of the new National Employment Rights Authority.

The wages and conditions of employment of workers on board those vessels are, therefore, governed by the flag State's legislation (in this case Jamaica) and neither I nor the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment have any responsibilities in these matters.I understand that the vessels are subject to Port State Control (PSC) inspections in Ireland under the Paris Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)/EU Directive 95/21/EC.  PSC inspections, which are undertaken by Marine Surveyors of the Department of Transport, include, amongst other items, inspection of the vessels' living and working conditions as regulated under the current International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions and in this case ILO 147/ ILO 180, which Ireland has ratified.At a national level Ireland has consistently supported the International Labour Organisation in its efforts to promote decent global labour standards for seafarers.   A new consolidated Maritime Labour Convention was adopted in February 2006 at the 94th International Labour Conference in Geneva.  Ireland was represented at the 94th Conference by a tripartite delegation consisting of government officials, nominees of the employers (IBEC) and of the workers (ICTU).  The new Convention sets out clear principles and rights for seafarers.  Ireland fully supports the new Convention and voted in favour of the proposal.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	598	I propose to take Questions Nos. 105, 369 and 370 together.While there has been some variation in our merchandise export performance during the course of this year, the latest expectations, based on figures from the CSO, are that the value of exports for 2006 will increase by 3% relative to 2005, when full year figures for last year are available later this month.  This is a very creditable performance, against a background of a difficult global trading environment, and shows that Irish exports have remained competitive on world markets.  Similar gains were made in the previous two years, with increases of  3% between  2003 and 2004  and also  3% between 2004 and 2005. In relation to services exports, where more detailed data is now available from the Central Statistics Office, the rate of growth is even more impressive, with these exports growing by 9% between 2004 and 2005, the latest year for which data is available.Preliminary indications from Enterprise Ireland, the agency with responsibility for the development of manufacturing and internationally traded services companies, are that Irish companies have gained strong positions in international markets during 2006, which will result in the achievement of one billion euros in new export sales for the full year.The Irish Government's policy has, for a number of years, been to fully exploit our membership of the European Union by diversifying into EU export markets, and also to focus on new opportunities in the US and further afield.  From a position of 75% of Irish merchandise exports going to the UK in 1960, we have now reached a point where the EU now accounts for 64% of our exports, with only 17% of exports going to the UK.  During 2006, the value of exports going to key markets such as the United States, Germany and Belgium showed solid growth.Since the accession of the new EU Member States, new export opportunities have been developed and exports to these countries are increasing.  For example, during 2006, exports to Poland increased in value terms by 36%, to the Czech  Republic by 38%, to Slovakia by 28% and to Estonia  by 60%.  I have no doubt that in time, Irish exporters will establish a substantial presence in Central and Eastern Europe.The second phase of the Asia Strategy, launched by An Taoiseach in 2005, prioritises eight countries in Asia and sets out targets for increasing our exports to that region up to 2009.  Within the context of this Strategy, work is underway to ensure that agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia, Tourism Ireland and organisations engaged in the education sector, will be combining closely to exploit and increase Irish exporting opportunities in this area over the lifetime of the Asia Strategy and beyond.In addition, both myself, and my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Micheál Martin, T.D., continue to be active in leading trade missions, in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland, to target markets abroad with a view to increasing our share of exports by Irish companies to these countries.I am confident that the strategy of diversifying into export markets abroad, such as the wider EU, the US and Asia and the ongoing process of building on the higher value sectors of the economy, particularly in the knowledge-based areas, will ensure that Irish exporters will continue to rise to the challenges posed by the global trading environment and increase the value of their sales incrementally, for the future. It is difficult to make firm predictions for the next five years, given the many uncertainties that exist, but the indications are that we will continue to enjoy steady growth in our export trade and maintain a healthy trade surplus, as at present.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	599	I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 and 168 together.The Control of Exports Bill 2007, which I am pleased to inform the House has passed all stages in the Seanad, contains provision for the publication of an Annual Report to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is in line with a key recommendation of the Forfás review on export licensing and responds to calls for greater transparency in this area.The Report will contain, inter alia, information on the aggregate actual value of goods exported under licence by category and country of destination.  I am firmly of the opinion that this will present a far more accurate representation of trade in licensed products rather than relying on licensed values.  These by their nature tend to be considerable overestimations of the volume of trade.  The format proposed is similar to that of the EU's Annual Report on the operation of the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, which reports on the export of military goods from EU Member States and to which Ireland contributes.As regards information on individual exporters and end users, let me be clear that I do not consider it appropriate to provide such data.  Not only would this measure be anti-business, in that it would provide commercially sensitive information to foreign competitors, but there are also international and security considerations.  Ireland works closely with our EU partners and other like-minded countries in the International Export Control Regimes and we share information on end-users of concern on a confidential basis.  Publication of information on individual exporters and end users could prejudice or impair the enforcement of, and compliance with, applicable Irish and European legislation.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	600	The National Development Plan 2007 to 2013 contains a Human Capital Priority Chapter which sets out the broad priorities for investment in the development of Ireland's human resource capability over the period of the Plan.Over €25 billion has been allocated to investment in the Human Capital Priority, of which over €7.7 billion will be invested in the Training and Skills Development Programme through the Upskilling the Workforce sub-Programme, and the Activation and Participation of Groups outside the Workforce sub-Programme.I can assure the Deputy that FAS and the State development agencies currently engage proactively with workers facing industrial restructuring. In the event of any major closure, FÁS endeavours to engage immediately with the affected staff and makes the full range of its services available to equip redundant workers for new employment opportunities.   Both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are constantly seeking new and expanded investment and employment opportunities and the City and County Enterprise Boards also have an important role to play in this regard.I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by these agencies together with the Government's ongoing commitment to regional development, will continue to bring investment and job creation to those affected by industrial restructuring.In this context, financial allocations for training people facing industrial restructuring are not specifically ring-fenced in the National Development Plan as such training and support will be provided as the need arises.  I would also mention that the FAS One Step Up and Skillnets Programmes are placing a greater focus on the low skilled and this will also include many workers facing industrial restructuring.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	601	The mode of transport which staff of my Department use in travelling to and from work is a matter of choice for each individual.  However, my Department generally supports the use of public transport by staff.  In this context, it operates a scheme which facilitates staff in obtaining annual bus and rail passes through salary reductions.  A particular attraction of the scheme for staff is that it complies with Revenue guidelines for the exemption of payment of tax and PRSI on the salary foregone.  A total of 216 staff are availing of the scheme in 2007.Travel by staff on official business is governed by travel and subsistence regulations issued by the Department of Finance.  The overriding principle in these regulations is that all official travel should be by the shortest practicable route and by the cheapest practicable mode of transport.  As a general rule, officers are only authorised to use their own transport on official business where suitable public transport is not available, where public transport is available only at equal or greater expense, or where the use of public transport would result in the unnecessary loss of official time.Given the nature of the work carried out by some areas of my Department, it is not always feasible for staff to use public transport.  For example, Labour Inspectors and Prices Inspectors are often required to carry out site visits at locations or at times which make the use of public transport impractical.  In such instances, the use of an official's private car is authorised.  As far as possible, journeys of this nature are arranged to maximise the amount of business carried out in a particular geographical area.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	602	The CSO release on County Incomes and Regional GDP notes that county estimates should be treated with caution because the underlying data are not always sufficiently robust. Also while the Live Register provides data on a county basis it is not designed to measure unemployment. It includes part-time workers as well as seasonal and casual workers entitled to Jobseekers Allowance or Benefit.Employment/unemployment is measured by the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) which provides a breakdown of data on a regional basis only.  The latest QNHS release (February 2007)) shows that unemployment in the South West Region (Cork and Kerry) in the period Sept-Nov 2006 was 3.6% compared to the figure for the State overall of 4.1%. Numbers in employment in the region for the same period stood at 301,500 an increase of 11,200 over the corresponding period in 2005.The enterprise development agencies (Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Shannon Development)  are committed to promoting Kerry as a location for investment, as well as supporting and developing businesses already present in the county. Full time permanent employment in enterprise agency assisted firms in Co. Kerry stands at 5,434 at end 2006.IDA Ireland continues to work with its existing base of companies with a view to supporting such companies with potential expansions and the agency also targets potential new investment projects. IDA Ireland will continue to actively promote the region and the advantages of locating in Kerry, which include a young skilled population, the presence of the Institute of Technology in Tralee and the availability of first class business parks and a regional airport.  IDA continues to market all available land and buildings in the county and has completed a €1m investment in site development works on its Business & Technology Park at Tiernaboul, Killarney, Co. Kerry.  The site area totals 4.66 hectares. These works involved significant landscaping, access development and site clearance work, all of which has resulted in the upgrading of the overall appeal of the location.IDA is also marketing Shannon Development's Kerry Technology Park (KTP) and buildings, which are adjacent to the Institute of Technology Tralee (ITT). This Park has 50 acres of enterprise space including fully-serviced industrial sites, a Business Incubation Centre and a range of quality manufacturing and office style accommodation.  It has state-of-the-art telecommunications infrastructure and access to the facilities, services and resources of the Institute of Technology, Tralee. At year-end 2006 there were 16 companies operating from the Park, employing over 200 people.Enterprise Ireland activity, in terms of job creation, is focused on the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies, the creation of new jobs by supporting entrepreneurs to set up High Potential Start-Up Companies and also through enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional level by supporting research in companies and third level institutions.Shannon Development has entered into an ‘option-to-purchase' agreement with Shannon LNG in relation to 281 acres of the 600-acre Shannon Development owned land bank between Tarbert and Ballylongford, County Kerry. Under this agreement, it is proposed to build a €400 million liquefied natural gas (LNG) receiving terminal on the site. The Shannon LNG project has the potential to provide over 40% of Ireland gas requirements.  The terminal could provide about 50 long-term permanent jobs, along with additional support jobs and around 350 construction jobs at its peak.

While I may give general policy directives to the agencies under the Industrial Development Acts, I am precluded from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.I have been assured by the agencies under the remit of my Department that they are actively endeavouring to attract new investment, to encourage the start-up of new businesses, to grow existing businesses and to develop the labour market in County Mayo. A high quality urban environment with a critical mass in population, skills and world-class access infrastructure, are critical to prospective investors when they are deciding where to locate.In this regard, County Mayo will benefit from the ongoing investment in transport, energy and utilities set out in the new National Development Plan.  It is also vital that national investment is partnered with local vision and leadership and that private investment also plays a role.IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are working closely with local authorities, utility providers and others to maximise the attractiveness of Mayo in terms of meeting the needs of potential investors.  To enhance the attractiveness of the County for new and expansion projects IDA Ireland is developing world class business parks in Ballina, Castlebar and Westport. With regard to the Ballina site I was pleased to hear recently that significant progress has been made by Mayo County Council in securing unburdened title to this 10.29 hectares site on the Sligo Road.Enterprise Ireland is focused on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs setting up new High Potential Start-Up Companies, the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and in enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional level through support of research in companies and third level institutions.  The overall aim of Enterprise Ireland's strategy is to transform Irish companies into market focused and innovation driven businesses and to increase their exports, sales and employment.At the end of 2006, there were a total of 6,118 Enterprise Agency supported full time jobs in County Mayo.  In addition, the Mayo County Enterprise Board (CEB) provides a source of support throughout Mayo for small businesses with 10 employees or fewer.  During 2006 Mayo CEB approved a total of €620,000 to 30 projects and paid out in the region of €440,000 in grant assistance to 29 projects, which resulted in the creation of 110 net jobs in CEB assisted companies throughout the county.

For the first two months of this year, 11 new employment permits were issued in respect of Romanian nationals, and 2 new employment permits in respect of Bulgarian nationals.I understand that the Department of Social and Family Affairs issued 4,877 PPS numbers up to 23rd February, 2007 to Romanian nationals and 199 to Bulgarian nationals.Under EU rules nationals of Romania and Bulgaria may come to Ireland and set up a business here and be self-employed. However, the self-employment must be genuine.A major package of measures has been agreed by the parties to Towards 2016, the new Social Partnership Agreement, to provide for enhanced public confidence in the system of compliance. New legislation will be published this year which will empower the Labour Inspectorate to join with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to work together in Joint Investigation Units. Such units will have a particular focus on the employment status of workers. The National Employment Rights Authority, which has already been established on an interim basis, is currently meeting with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners with a view to the early establishment and operation of Joint Investigation Units within existing legal and administrative frameworks.I am informed by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners that attention is paid by them to the matter of bogus self-employment in the course of their compliance activities and appropriate action taken. Complaints in relation to bogus self-employment should be referred to all or any of the following — the Labour Inspectorate of the National Employment Rights Authority, the Department of Social and Family Affairs or the Revenue Commissioners.New legislation will be published this year that will provide for enhanced employment rights measures including the establishment of the National Employment Rights Authority. Providing for greater clarity in the application of employment rights legislation to employees and the self-employed will be considered in the context of drawing up that legislation.The package of measures provided for under Towards 2016 will be supported by enhanced employment rights promotional and educational efforts. The Social Partners and other organisations such as the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners will be invited to bring their knowledge and networks to bear on the design and delivery of this education and awareness programme which, it is anticipated, will also address the issues associated with bogus self-employment.Towards 2016 also includes a number of other specific commitments in relation to employment status and in relation to the "Hidden Economy".  The Government and social partners have agreed under the Towards 2016 to review the application of the existing Code of Practice on employee status with a view to more effective implementation.  My Department will be actively involved in that review.  In addition, the Government and the social partners agreed under the Towards 2016 to continue and expand the Hidden Economy Working Group.  The group, which comprises representatives of Office of the Revenue Commissioners, Department of Social and Family Affairs, ICTU, IBEC, SFA, CIF and, since the ratification of the Social Partnership Agreement, my own Department and the National Employment Rights Authority, has met on two occasions to date.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	607	The National Minimum Wage Act 2000 requires that an employer must pay the appropriate minimum hourly rate of pay. In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that under the provisions of the Act the statutory minimum rate of pay payable to an experienced adult worker was increased to €8.30 per hour with effect from 1 January, 2007. This rate will be further increased to €8.65 per hour with effect from 1 July, 2007.In the past year the Labour Inspectorate undertook a number of targeted campaigns, including a campaign, which focused on National Minimum Wage compliance. I can assure the Deputy that the inspection of compliance with the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000 and with other statutory instruments and agreements which provide for minimum rates of pay is a priority objective within the Labour Inspectorate.The primary objective of the Labour Inspectorate in cases where breaches of employment rights legislation have been detected is to seek redress for the individual or individuals concerned in terms of ensuring immediate compliance and rectification of any such breaches and, where these breaches have resulted in a financial loss to workers, to effect payment of any arrears due. In this regard almost €1.5 million in arrears was recovered in 2006 from employers arising from National Minimum Wage and other statutory minimum wage inspections by the Labour Inspectorate.  The Labour Inspectorate will also initiate prosecutions, where appropriate, in cases of failure to effect compliance or rectify breaches detected.In relation to the film production sector, I understand that Deputy Ó Snodaigh, during the course of the recent debate on the Irish Film Board (Amendment) Bill, made a statement to the effect that a post production company in Dublin was paying employees less that the statutory minimum provided for under the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000. While no formal complaint has been received by the Labour Inspectorate, I have asked the Inspectorate to contact Deputy Ó Snodaigh with a view to seekingfurther information in relation to these allegations.I urge anyone who has evidence of the mistreatment of workers to furnish all the relevant details and any related materials to the Inspectorate with a view to pursuing the matter.The Deputy should be aware that Rights Commissioners of the Labour Relations Commission — a body independent of the Department — also investigate complaints of breaches of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	608	The Competition Authority is the independent statutory agency responsible for the enforcement of competition law in the State.  Its mandate and functions are set out in the Competition Act 2002, as amended.The 2002 Act consolidated, reformed and modernised previous legislation relating to competition policy and merger control.  In essence the Act:increased the penalties for serious cartel activities, such as price fixing;enhanced the independence of the Competition Authority; andtransferred responsibility for controlling mergers and acquisitions from the Minister to the Competition Authority with the exception of media mergers where the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment retains a residual function.The Act was the culmination of a root and branch review of all aspects of competition law in the State which was undertaken by the Competition and Mergers Review Group.  The Review Group, which reported in 2000, comprised eminent lawyers, economists and representatives from right across the economic spectrum, including the Social Partners.The 2002 Act implemented many of the recommendations of the Review Group, and also anticipated developments at EU level.  In particular it provided a framework for the application of Regulation 1 of 2003 in the State whereby the Authority was enabled to fully apply the European Community competition rules.The 2002 Act became fully operational on 1 January 2003.  Therefore, it is a recent statute and forms the basis for one of the most modern competition regimes in the world.Nonetheless, during the course of 2007 my Department intends to commence a review of the operation of the Competition Act 2002.  The need to make changes to the powers and functions of the Competition Authority will be considered when this review is completed.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	609	There is no age discrimination in employment rights legislation and there are no provisions in Employment or Equality law that impose a compulsory retirement age in relation to employment.I would point out that the upper age limit of 66 years for bringing claims under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2005 was removed by the Equality Act 2004.  The effect of this is that a person who is over the age of 66 when dismissed may take a case under the Unfair Dismissals Acts unless he/she has already reached the normal retirement age for that employment, if one exists.The removal of the age cap of 66 for statutory redundancy is included in the recently published Protection of Employment (Exceptional Collective Redundancies and Related Matters) Bill 2007 which is designed to give effect to certain commitments arising from "Towards 2016".The Employment Equality Acts 1998 and 2004, administered by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, protect against discrimination on the ground of age and on other grounds, in relation to access to employment.  However, the Acts also permit an employer to decide on a retirement age in a particular employment. The purpose of such provisions is to give flexibility to employers and employees, having due regard to the nature of the work being performed. Such retirement age limits are not in breach of the Employment Equality Acts or the Unfair Dismissal Acts.Decisions in relation to retirement are influenced by a range of issues and the challenge is to give people the flexibility and choice to work past 65. Obstacles to people working at an older age include benefit and pension entitlements and this issue is being reviewed by the Department of Social and Family Affairs in consultation with the Pensions Board.Under the terms of the Social Partnership agreement "Towards 2016", the Government is committed to the continued participation of older people in the labour market which will be encouraged and facilitated to meet the challenge of an ageing society.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	613	State support for enterprise and job creation is channelled through the industrial development agencies. IDA Ireland has responsibility for marketing Ireland and its regions to overseas investors and Enterprise Ireland is concentrating on developing the indigenous sector. While I may give general policy directives to the agencies under the Industrial Development Acts, I am precluded from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.IDA Ireland's strategy for the South West region is to progress the development of a knowledge economy. The Agency is actively promoting the city of Cork and the greater Cork region, including the town of Fermoy, to prospective investors across the full range of IDA targeted sectors. Targeted sectors include Pharmaceuticals, Medical Technologies, Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) and Internationally Traded Services.  To support and enhance this marketing campaign they are also working in partnership with Local Authorities, utility companies, third level institutes and other relevant infrastructure and service providers in the region to develop the necessary critical mass needed in terms of population, skills and infrastructure.Job creation and job losses are a feature of economic development in all countries as various sectors expand and contract in response to market demand for goods and services, competitive forces, restructuring and technological change. The recent announcement of jobs losses in Cork, Fermoy and Youghal is very regrettable. Despite these losses, the region, and in particular the greater Cork area, is continuing to win new investment across a range of sectors. Employment in IDA supported companies in Cork has seen an increase of circa 11% since 2000, with 133 IDA assisted companies in County Cork employing in excess of 19,977 people.Just last week, VMware, one of the US software industry's fastest growing companies, which established its EMEA Technical Support Centre in Ballincollig less than two years ago, announced a major expansion involving the creation of up to 369 additional jobs. In December 2006, Eli Lilly and Company, a global leader in biopharmaceuticals, announced plans to invest up to €400m in establishing a Biopharmaceuticals Manufacturing facility at its existing site in Kinsale involving the creation of up to 200 additional jobs. This will bring Eli Lilly's total employment level in Kinsale to 600.In terms of job creation, Enterprise Ireland activity is focused on supporting entrepreneurs setting up new High Potential Start-Up Companies, the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies, and on enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional level through support for research in companies and third level institutions. The Agency provides a range of supports for high potential start up companies including, financial supports, business and marketing advice, mentoring, product development etc. as well as incubation space.In this regard Enterprise Ireland is pleased to be associated with recent developments in Cork based companies such as 1.2 Travel.Com Ltd., Ecom Interaction Services Ltd., Freefoam Plastics Ltd., Qumas Ltd., Dairygold plc., and new companies such as Sensl Technologies Ltd., and MP Stor Ltd. In 2006, Enterprise Ireland approved over €18m and made payments of almost €9m to client companies in County Cork.  This includes support for 14 HPSU (High Potential Start-Up) companies.  The agency is currently actively engaged with 687 client companies in County Cork who, at the end of 2006, employ a total of 19,078 people.I am satisfied that the policies being pursued by the agencies under the remit of my Department, together with the Government's commitment to regional development, as outlined in the new National Development Plan, will continue to bear fruit in terms of the creation of sustainable employment for the people of the South and South West generally.

The talks took place in several locations in Dublin, and in Kilkenny on Thursday 1st March 2007.  Staff were advised of and encouraged to attend these talks. Additional information regarding the Work Life Balance options available to them was also circulated to all staff.Work life balance is an issue that affects all of us, and is not just an issue for people with young children.  More and more, work-life balance options are becoming increasingly important for employees seeking to reconcile their various responsibilities outside the workplace with their work life.  In recognition of the importance of assisting staff to achieve a better balance between their work and family lives, the Work Options Unit has been established in my Department for a number of years now.  The Unit has direct responsibility for dealing with all work life balance initiatives and applications for the various leave schemes, listed below, that are currently available to staff members.One of the most recent changes is that of Maternity Leave.

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	615	I am confident that the current legislative base in regard to occupational safety and health sets a sound foundation for implementing occupational safety, health and welfare standards.The Oireachtas enacted the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act in 2005. This Act updates and amends the provisions of previous legislation and is a result of a major review of occupational health and safety legislation. The Act provides a modern legal framework to guarantee best international practice in regard to health and safety in the Irish workplace.  The primary focus in the Act is on prevention.  It sets out responsibilities for employers and workers alike and it provides also for significant fines and penalties.The administration and enforcement of occupational safety and health legislation, including the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and related Regulations, is a day to day matter for the Health and Safety Authority.  In this regard, the Authority has a range of enforcement measures available to it, to use as it deems appropriate and necessary, in accordance with the provisions of the 2005 Act.At the time of the drafting of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005, the Attorney General was of the opinion that there were much broader issues than safety, health and welfare at work which needed to be considered in regard to the matter of corporate manslaughter.  Legislating in the relatively confined area of occupational safety and health would have omitted other sectors where such an offence could be committed. Therefore it was decided that it was not appropriate to deal with the issue of corporate killing in legislation which was providing for the law and regulation of occupational safety, health and welfare.The Commission also recommended that there should be individual statutory liability for managers who were culpable in the causation of death. This is addressed in Section 80 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005 which provides for directors, managers or other similar officer of an undertaking to be held liable by the Courts for an offence that is attributable to connivance or neglect on their part.Consideration of the Law Reform Commission's Report and recommendations are a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the context of his main responsibilities for the criminal law system.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	617	I am aware that IDA Ireland has recently decided to conduct a study of the pharmaceutical sector.  The purpose is to give an overview on process development both locally and internationally.  The study should define what supports could be put in place by way of infrastructure or activities which would enable manufacturing operations to engage in process development activities and add value to their activities.  I understand that the agency expects that the necessary Consultant will be appointed by 30 March, 2007.The agency continues to work closely with the company in question to identify suitable players that may be interested in taking over the company's existing operations.  While it is the company's intention to close certain facilities over the next two years, I am encouraged by its track record whereby it has successfully sold on similar plants worldwide in the past.Overall, the pharmaceutical area continues to be very important for Ireland and there has been significant growth in recent years.  I am confident that despite intense worldwide competition, Ireland will continue to win significant projects in this sector.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	618	There are currently a total of seventeen Directives due to be transposed by my Department up to 2010. Four of these Directives are overdue and the following is the position with regard to implementation progress:1.

The outstanding issues concerning all but one of the Directives have been resolved satisfactorily. Proceedings are ongoing in the European Court of Justice in relation to a finding against Ireland for incorrect transposition of Directive 92/100/EC related to rental rights and lending rights in the field of intellectual property.  Corrective measures are being taken in the context of draft legislation to introduce a public lending right. I intend to publish this Bill shortly.

My Department encourages the use of Fair Trade products in these canteens and a large poster advertising Fair Trade products is on display for all staff to see.As regards the agencies under the control of my Department, the Deputy may wish to know that last June my Department wrote to all of the agencies involved drawing attention to the importance of supporting Fair Trade products and asking, on my behalf, that consideration be given to the enhanced sale of Fair Trade products in the canteens, cafeterias or restaurants of those agencies.  The replies received by my Department indicate support for this initiative and the majority of the agencies involved have indicated that they have introduced Fair Trade tea, coffee, sugar and other products for sale or were in the process of doing so.  The recent media publicity associated with Fair Trade fortnight should ensure that Fair Trade products will be availed of in the canteens, cafeterias and restaurants of the agencies under the control of my Department and in the two small canteens of my Department.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	620	The Social Partnership Agreement "Towards 2016” contains a commitment under Section 24 (Economic Migration Policy) that the employment of non-EEA students should be the subject of an employment permit application.  This is a complex area and my Department is currently consulting with stakeholders and the social partners regarding the procedures and format of this type of employment permit. In the meantime, access of students to the labour market is dependent on their immigration status. Students granted permission to remain by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to pursue a full-time course of studies of at least one year's duration leading to a qualification recognised by the Department of Education and Science are permitted to enter casual employment only (defined as 20 hours part-time work per week or full-time during normal vacation periods). Access to employment is not permitted to other students.A major package of measures has been agreed by the parties to Towards 2016, the new Social Partnership Agreement, to provide for enhanced public confidence in the system of compliance. New legislation will be published this year which will empower the Labour Inspectorate to join with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to work together in Joint Investigation Units. Such units will have a particular focus on the employment status of workers. The National Employment Rights Authority, which has already been established on an interim basis, is currently meeting with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners with a view to the early establishment and operation of Joint Investigation Units within existing legal and administrative frameworks.The Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners will have details of the number of bogus self-contractors identified in the context of their specific responsibilities. Complaints in relation to bogus self-employment should be referred to all or any of the following — the Labour Inspectorate of the National Employment Rights Authority, the Department of Social and Family Affairs or the Revenue Commissioners.In addition, the Revenue Commissioners, as part of its recently launched Construction Industry Project, will be reviewing the tax status of contractors and, in particular, whether individuals currently designated as self-employed should be regarded as employees and subject to PAYE and PRSI.  Monitoring of Relevant Contract Tax 1 (RCT1) declarations will also be strengthened.The legislation will also provide for enhanced employment rights measures including the establishment of the National Employment Rights Authority. Providing for greater clarity in the application of employment rights legislation to employees and the self-employed will be considered in the context of drawing up that legislation.The package of measures provided for under Towards 2016 will be supported by enhanced employment rights promotional and educational efforts. The Social Partners and other organisations such as the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners will be invited to bring their knowledge and networks to bear on the design and delivery of this education and awareness programme which, it is anticipated, will also address the issues associated with bogus self-employment."Towards 2016” includes a number of other specific commitments in relation to employment status and in relation to the “Hidden Economy”.  The Government and social partners have agreed under “Towards 2016” to review the existing Code of Practice on employee status with a view to more effective implementation.  My Department will be actively involved in that review.  In addition, the Government and the social partners agreed under “Towards 2016” to continue and expand the Hidden Economy Working Group.  The group, which comprises representatives of Office of the Revenue Commissioners, Department of Social and Family Affairs, ICTU, IBEC, SFA, CIF and, since the ratification of the Social Partnership Agreement, my own Department and the National Employment Rights Authority, has met on two occasions to date.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	621	A total of 69,000 persons commenced FÁS training courses in 2006 with roughly 35% of those attending training not in employment and 65% in employment.  In addition, 176,000 persons attended Safe Pass and Construction Skills training and a further 9,000 persons attended Evening Courses.  A training element was also included for 32,300 persons on Community Employment and Job Initiative schemes in 2006.  Statistics in relation to those in part-time employment who are participating in training are not specifically identified.Plans for FÁS in 2007 are to increase training numbers by roughly 5%.  FÁS has been granted additional funding to meet demand for apprenticeship training and increase capacity for in-company training.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	622	The management and location of overseas offices of the development agencies is a day-to-day operational matter for the agencies and not a matter in which I have a function.IDA Ireland is the statutory agency charged with the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to this country.  The agency established its first office in Shanghai, China during 2005.  To date there have been a number of visits from Chinese delegations to Ireland and IDA Ireland are hopeful that these will result in a number of projects in the future. IDA Ireland operates in a very competitive environment for FDI and it would not be appropriate for me to release details of activities or costs relating solely to the Shanghai office.  However, in 2006 an amount of slightly in excess €10m was spent by IDA Ireland as part of its marketing, promotions and advertising budget for all of its overseas offices including Shanghai.  It is expected that a similar figure will be spent by the Agency in 2007.  I understand from the Agency that, at present, it has no plans to open other offices in China.Enterprise Ireland is the agency which, in overseas markets, is tasked with assisting Irish companies in their efforts to increase exports. It has four offices in China — Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hong Kong.  These offices are located in the industrialized and wealthy parts of China — those areas that offer the most potential for Irish exports.  Enterprise Ireland does not envisage that other offices will be needed in China in the immediate future but the agency reviews the needs of client companies on an ongoing basis and will respond where necessary.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	623	State support specific to enterprise and job creation is channelled through the industrial development agencies.  IDA Ireland has responsibility for marketing Ireland and its regions for overseas investment and Enterprise Ireland is concentrating on developing the indigenous sector.  Shannon Development is responsible for regional economic development in the Mid West region whereas the County Enterprise Boards offer assistance to micro enterprises employing fewer than ten people.The overall mix of incentives vary from fiscal policies, such as the 12.5% corporation tax rate that all companies can avail of to targeted supports or incentives that are designed to stimulate specific types of business activity.  These incentives include funding for certain capital investment, job creation, R&D, training, marketing, and management development.The focus of Enterprise Ireland supports, in collaboration with the CEBs, will be on measures to promote high potential start-up companies, increase productivity, develop management and international sales capabilities, facilitate access to equity and finance and to support entrepreneurship and micro-enterprise.  IDA Ireland will concentrate on financial product and client service measures to support investments.  The Agency also provides a range of property solutions for prospective investors and Enterprise Ireland clients.Government supports to companies in Ireland must comply with the European State Aid Guidelines, which set out the type of companies and eligible activities that can be supported, as well as the maximum funding limits allowed.The type and level of support companies receive is not determined by whether or not a company is Irish or foreign owned. In agreeing on incentives or supports to eligible companies the main factors that determine supports include:The activities being undertaken by the company, with support limited to activities that are in line with European and national development objectives for example R & D, training, scaling or expansion of firms.  Furthermore, all activities supported must be new or additional to what the company is currently doing;The size of the company, with some supports available only to small and medium sized enterprises.  This is due to the various market failures and barriers to development associated with SMEs.   Examples of this include the Business Expansion Scheme, supports for trade fair participation etc.The Region the company is based in or proposes to locate to, with the level of support higher for companies in the BMW region.The return to the Economy on the Investment:  All major projects supported by the agencies are subject to a detailed Cost-Benefit analysis.  This analysis calculates the return to the State by calculating the impact of investments supported on employment taxes, corporation taxes, spend on goods and services in the economy etc.

However, Article 8 of the Directive permits individual Member States to introduce more favourable provisions than are contained in the Directive.I am informed that the Department has not had any representations from the sectoral interests concerned in this area but would be happy to consider any issues raised in this context.Questions arising in this area would, of course, also be appropriate for consideration in the context of the Review of the Transfer of Undertakings Directive which is currently being undertaken by the European Commission.  Ireland has already indicated to the Commission that the question of the exclusion of seagoing vessels could usefully be considered in this context.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	625	The Good Friday Agreement set out a new vision for the island of Ireland. As both North and South face the common challenges and opportunities of a globalised marketplace and continuing the transition to a knowledge economy where science, technology and innovation are vital to economic success, it is appropriate that we should jointly address those challenges and opportunities where there is mutual benefit to be achieved.  To be globally competitive we must exploit and realise the opportunities of all-island collaboration.There is ongoing co-operation between my Department and the Department of Enterprise Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland on enterprise issues.  Both Departments co-sponsor InterTradeIreland, the all-island trade and business development body established under the Good Friday Agreement.  Since 1999, InterTradeIreland has shown the benefits of all-island business collaboration.  It has promoted the development of the all-island economy to the mutual benefit of North and South and it is implementing significant initiatives to enhance the global competitiveness of the all-island economy.My Department provided significant input to a ‘Comprehensive Study on the All-Island Economy', which was commissioned by the British-Irish InterGovernmental Conference to identify areas for enhanced North/South co-operation. This blueprint for all-island economic co-operation was completed towards the end of last year and sets out the economic rationale for North/South collaboration, as well as concrete proposals for economic initiatives.  These initiatives include interventions to support research and development and the development of the knowledge economy; co-operation on trade and investment promotion; and enhanced co-operation in support of enterprise and business development.The proposals to enhance co-operation are currently being implemented, in the areas of trade and investment promotion, including the opening up of trade missions, whether sponsored by Enterprise Ireland or Invest Northern Ireland, to companies across the island. The services of the overseas offices of Enterprise Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland are being made available to companies from across the island. Furthermore, enhanced collaboration between IDA Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland is being taken forward with an initial focus on collaboration around the business-operating environment so as to enhance the attractiveness of the island for Foreign Direct Investment.Recently the Chief Executives of the enterprise development agencies on the island of Ireland attended the first All-Island Business Networks Forum in Farmleigh on 30 January. The Forum highlighted the potential business and economic benefits of business networks and was organised as a result of collaboration between my Department, the Department of Enterprise Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland and the enterprise development agencies on the island of Ireland.The new National Development Plan 2007-2013 sets out to give real meaning to the approach outlined in the ‘Comprehensive Study on the All-Island Economy'. The Irish Government has set out in the National Development Plan a detailed and specific agenda for progressing such co-operation. Our current hope and strong objective is to deliver these commitments in partnership with a new Northern Ireland Executive and under the auspices of the North/South Ministerial Council.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	627	I propose to take Questions Nos. 135 and 147 together.The Casual Trading Act, 1995 regulates casual trading which is defined as "selling goods at a place (including a public road) to which the public have access as of right".  The Act is operated by the 88 local authorities entitled to make bye laws under the Act.  The sale of videos, DVDs and other similar products in a public place would be covered by the Act.The Casual Trading Act 1995 was considered by the Competition Authority in 2002 and by the Consumer Strategy Group in 2005.  One of the main conclusions of both bodies was that there was a need for uniformity of approach in applying casual trading regulations.  The methodology suggested was the use of statutory guidelines by local authorities.I have accepted this proposal and incorporated a provision in the Consumer Protection Bill, 2007 which will give the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment the power to issue statutory guidelines to local authorities regarding their operation of the Act.  Pending enactment of the Bill my Department, in July 2006, issued voluntary guidelines to assist local authorities in carrying out their responsibilities under the Act.My Department was represented on the Interdepartmental Committee to Co-ordinate Measures to Tackle DVD Piracy, which has been meeting over recent months. It was established by the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure that the State's response to this form of crime was co-ordinated and effective across the board.I understand that the report of the Committee is now being finalised by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and that the Tánaiste intends to publish its recommendations in early course.  I will consider their implementation as appropriate.

An additional 5 Rights Commissioners with 7 support staff were agreed for the Labour Relations Commission; an additional 5 support staff were agreed for the Labour Court; and an additional 8 support staff were agreed for the Employment Appeals Tribunal.   Extra funding of a little over €10 million has been provided by the Exchequer in 2007 to cover the costs of increased staffing.To date the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) has been set up on an interim basis. Mr Ger Deering, the former Taxi Regulator, has taken up position as Director of this body and he has been assigned some support staff to enable the body to commence operations. Competitions have been held for the positions of Legal Adviser and Accountant for NERA and these appointments will be made shortly.Arrangements to increase the size of the Labour Inspectorate are in progress and it is hoped that assignments will commence in the second quarter of this year and that all assignments will be made by the end of the year.The provision of further staff to other employment rights bodies will be done as soon as possible.  It is not possible to give specific dates as the Government Decentralisation process and Public Appointments Service have a bearing on appointments.

FÁS is also in the process of developing English Language Courses for three specific work disciplines (Construction, Security and Hospitality).  FÁS is currently seeking FETAC validation for these courses, which when satisfactorily completed, will lead to a FETAC Special Purpose Award.Through the FÁS ‘Skills for Work programme', which aims to provide for the basic education needs of workers in low skilled employment, a technical English programme (Steps to Safety) is provided in order to improve communication, especially regarding the safety of workers in the workplace.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	630	I propose to take Questions Nos. 138, 150 and 156 together.          .The parties in the negotiations to T2016 recognised that the opening up of the Irish labour market arising from the decision to permit direct access by citizens of the new EU Member States has given rise to concerns about the possibility of the collective compulsory replacement of workers by lower paid workers from these States or elsewhere, either directly or through the use of other replacement workers within the jurisdiction.Under Section 18 of the Agreement, there is provision for a Redundancy Panel, which can request the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment to refer certain compulsory collective redundancies to the Labour Court for an Opinion as to whether or not they are genuine redundancies. If they are not, the Minister can refuse to pay the statutory redundancy rebate to the employer, with the employees being entitled to take an Unfair Dismissals case, with enhanced compensation under an amendment to Unfair Dismissals legislation.The text of the Protection of Employment (Exceptional Collective Redundancies and Related Matters) Bill 2007 has been finalised and it will be published as soon as possible.As discussions with the social partners are not yet concluded it is unlikely that the Heads of an Employment Agency Regulation Bill can be considered by the Government before end-March. The Bill will then be drafted as quickly as possible.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	631	I note the recent publication of the "Fourth European Working Conditions Survey" conducted by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions.The survey, which was conducted in 2005 covering nearly 30,000 workers in 31 countries, shows that bullying or harassment, violence or the threat of violence, and various forms of discrimination all contribute to psychological ill-health and stress.  Around 5% of workers across the EU reported having experienced some form of violence, bullying or harassment in the workplace in the previous 12 month period.In general, exposure to violence and threats of violence was greater in northern Europe, with higher than average levels reported in the Netherlands (10%), France and the UK (both9%) and Ireland (8%).Apart from the survey, I understand that 4% of accidents reported to the Health and Safety Authority in 2006 were triggered by ‘shock, fright, violence of others'.  Such incidents consistently feature in the top five accident triggers.The percentage of violent incidents is particularly high in some sectors, 17% of all accidents in the ‘Public Administration/Defence' and 16% in the ‘Health and Social Work' sectors respectively were triggered by ‘shock, fright, violence of others'. These sectors also reported the highest proportion of violent incidents in 2004 and 2005.The incident type statistics are also relevant.  Incidents categorised as ‘injured by person — violent' account for 4% of all reported accidents in 2006, with this figure rising to 22% of incidents in ‘Public Administration/Defence' and 12% in ‘Health and Social Work'. It is obvious from looking at these figures that violence to workers is a significant issue in the public sector.The figures from both the European survey and the Health and Safety Authority certainly give cause for concern. It would appear that an issue needing attention is the general attitude to increasing workplace violence. Prevention is the best policy and there is a way of addressing the problem in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.  If violence is a hazard in workplaces, employers are required to address how to deal with it and prepare a plan to implement any necessary preventive control measures when carrying out a risk assessment as part of the Safety Statement which is required by law.I understand that the National Workplace Health and Wellbeing Strategy, which is currently being reviewed by the Health and Safety Authority will recommend a more proactive role by employers in minimising the risk of violence to employees. The Health and Safety Authority will also carry out inspections in relation to violence in the healthcare sector in 2007.  Already, the Authority has published general guidance on the prevention of violence at work and specific guidance on the prevention of violence in healthcare as well as for the cash in transit industry.Also, I wish to add that a survey completed in Ireland in 2001, updating of which is almost completed by the ESRI, revealed that 7% of workers experienced bullying in the previous 6 month period. The emerging comparator figure on the updated research carried out in late 2006 and early this year is 7.9%.Finally, it must be remembered that violence to any person should not be tolerated, regardless of whether they are at work or not. It is a criminal matter and should be brought to the attention of An Garda Síochána.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	634	To reduce energy consumption in the Department and to ensure maximum energy efficiency and the minimum carbon footprint in its daily operations, my Department through its Green Team, which was established some years ago, has over the past few years initiated the following actions:Ensured that all lighting in the Department's eight buildings is switched off overnight;Ensured that the Office of Public Works, which looks after the replacement of electric light bulbs in my Department's buildings, uses energy efficient bulbs and long life bulbs wherever possible when electric light bulbs are being replaced;Ensured that the central heating arrangements for the Department's buildings are switched on and off to achieve optimum energy efficiency;Ensured that the staff in the Department have been exhorted to:1. switch off all their computer equipment (base units, monitors and peripheral devices) at the end of each working day;2. switch off their PC monitors at lunch time and while attending meetings etc; and3. ensure that the last person leaving each individual office switches off all electric lights, printers, photocopiers and heaters.My Department also operates a Travel Pass Scheme for interested members of staff in order to encourage staff to use public transport in lieu of car transport.  These initiatives have had no adverse cost implications for my Department and have resulted in energy cost savings, which would be impossible to quantify.My Department will continue to monitor its own energy consumption and will, where practicable, continue to implement steps to ensure maximum energy efficiency and the minimum carbon footprint in the daily activities of the Department.As regards the agencies of my Department, the Deputy will appreciate that ensuring maximum energy efficiency and minimum carbon footprint in their daily operations is an operational issue for the agencies concerned and the Deputy can rest assured that the agencies have taken similar actions to my Department over the past few years and will continue to do so.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	635	As indicated in my replies to Parliamentary Questions Number 84 of 15 November 2006 and 146, 154 and 168 of 31 January, 2007, the number of Labour Inspectors will be progressively increased from 31 at present to 90 by end-2007 with the expectation that assignments will be made from the second quarter of 2007. The necessary arrangements and selection processes to meet this objective are being progressed at present. Intensive and detailed training will be delivered to new inspectors both on assignment and following initial work experience.Towards 2016 provides for the regionalisation of the Labour Inspectorate. In this regard, my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Micheál Martin, announced on 11th February this year that regional offices for the Labour Inspectorate would be established in Dublin, Carlow, Cork, Shannon and Sligo.  These locations, and the numbers of labour inspectors and support staff to be assigned to each location, have been selected on the basis of, among other matters, population, labour force and the gateways designated under the National Spatial Strategy.  The locations have regard also to facilitating future joint investigation unit operations with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs, as provided under Towards 2016.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	636	The regulation of telecommunications, televisual and broadband service providers is one of the functions of the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) established under the Communications Regulation Act 2002 (No. 20 of 2002).  I understand that although ComReg regulates providers of electronic communications services and networks, including broadcasting transmission networks, it has no role in the regulation of the delivery of broadcasting services at retail level.  While Cable and Satellite operators must be authorised by ComReg to operate in Ireland, the EU Regulatory Framework for electronic communications (transposed in 2003) specifically excluded the regulation of retail broadcasting services, as distinct from the distribution network.The Communications Regulation Act 2002 is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  However, ComReg has statutory independence in the exercise of its functions.Notwithstanding, the foregoing, I am aware that the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs has received a considerable number of complaints in relation to the quality of service provided by a number of operators in the telecommunications sector.  In this regard, I am aware that both the ODCA and the NCA have been active in articulating customer concerns in the telecommunications area over the past twelve months.  I am advised that the ODCA and the NCA have had a number of meetings with ComReg in relation to these concerns and that they both played an active role in a colloquium organised by ComReg in November 2006 with the telecommunications service providers in raising awareness of their responsibilities under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, the Distance Selling Regulations and the Doorstep Selling Regulations.I am advised that the Director also held bilateral discussions with one leading telecommunications provider because of the number of complaints received by her office in relation to the level of service being provided to customers.  Arising from those discussions, I understand that the provider concerned has put in place a number of measures, including increasing the staffing numbers in its customer help call centres, to address the difficulties being experienced by customers.  The Director has informed me that her Office will continue to impress on telecommunications providers the need to ensure that customer support is an integral part of the service that they provide.The Deputy may be aware that the Consumer Protection Bill, which is currently at Committee Stage in the Dail, will establish the National Consumer Agency on a statutory basis. The Agency will be empowered under the Bill to enter into formal agreements with regulatory bodies such as ComReg for the purpose of facilitating co-operation between the Agency and the regulatory body in the performance of their respective functions in so far as they relate to issues of consumer protection and welfare. This provision will allow the Agency to formally bring issues of consumer concern such as those raised in the Deputy's question to the attention of bodies such as ComReg.The enactment of the Consumer Protection Bill will mark the first phase in a root and branch review of Ireland's consumer protection laws. The second phase of this review, which has already begun, will include a review of the law governing consumer contracts including, in particular, the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980.  Issues relating to service, standards of service and customer redress in relation to instances of poor service will feature prominently in the review.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	637	All personal injury claims, apart from medical negligence cases, must be referred to PIAB in the first instance.  Certain cases do not come within the remit of PIAB i.e. where liability is disputed, and other categories of cases must be released by PIAB, for example, those cases where the injury is wholly psychological by nature.  These cases are more appropriate to the court system. Many cases are settled following initial contact with PIAB and do not require to be progressed through the entire PIAB assessment process.I am pleased to report that the PIAB has delivered on its commitments. In 2006 the PIAB made over 5,500 assessments.  Since its establishment in mid-2004 the PIAB has made just under 8,000 assessments. Over 60% of these have been accepted to date.  Claimants who have accepted their awards will have done so on average three times faster than under the old system but without the trauma of a potential court case looming. Furthermore, they received the same level of compensation as they would have received through the courts.  A Cost Benefit Analysis of the PIAB that was published in January 2007 has confirmed that the PIAB awards the same amount but in a substantially quicker timeframe and for a much lower delivery cost.  The reduction in the delivery costs has coincided with a reduction in insurance premiums in this country.  CSO statistics show motor and home insurance costs have dropped to levels comparable with those which applied 7 and 4 years ago respectively.While the PIAB has released almost one-third of applications, a significant proportion of these cases are settled and do not require a court hearing. I understand that the PIAB are consulting with the insurance industry in order to better understand these settlements. I am pleased to confirm however that data from the Courts Service show a huge drop in the number of cases entering litigation since PIAB was established. In 2004, some 15,000 High Court writs were issued compared to just 750 in 2005.  In the Circuit Court, the 2004 level of approximately 20,000 Civil Bills issued dropped to approximately 3,000 in 2005.While all relevant cases must be referred to the PIAB in the first instance claimants have a choice as to whether to avail of the services of a solicitor or to deal with the PIAB directly at a reduced cost. Currently over 90% of claimants avail of the services of a solicitor. Subsequent to the High Court judgement in the case of O'Brien v PIAB, the PIAB is precluded from directly contacting such claimants. I understand however, that PIAB, through its awareness and information campaigns, is seeking to ensure that accident victims can make informed choices.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	638	I note the figures given by the Deputy.  It is too early yet to say whether or not they are indicative of a definite, sustained trend.A major package of measures has been agreed by the parties to Towards 2016, the new Social Partnership Agreement, to provide for enhanced public confidence in the system of compliance.  New legislation will be published this year which will empower the Labour Inspectorate to join with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to work together in Joint Investigation Units.  Such units will have a particular focus on the employment status of workers. The National Employment Rights Authority, which has already been established on an interim basis, is currently meeting with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners with a view to the early establishment and operation of Joint Investigation Units within existing legal and administrative frameworks.I am informed by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners that attention is paid by them to the matter of bogus self-employment in the course of their compliance activities and appropriate action taken. Complaints in relation to bogus self-employment should be referred to all or any of the following — the Labour Inspectorate of the National Employment Rights Authority, the Department of Social and Family Affairs or the Revenue Commissioners.New legislation will be published this year that will provide for enhanced employment rights measures including the establishment of the National Employment Rights Authority. Providing for greater clarity in the application of employment rights legislation to employees and the self-employed will be considered in the context of drawing up that legislation.The package of measures provided for under Towards 2016 will be supported by enhanced employment rights promotional and educational efforts. The Social Partners and other organisations such as the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners will be invited to bring their knowledge and networks to bear on the design and delivery of this education and awareness programme which, it is anticipated, will also address the issues associated with bogus self-employment.Towards 2016 also includes a number of other specific commitments in relation to employment status and in relation to the "Hidden Economy".  The Government and social partners have agreed under the Towards 2016 to review the application of the existing Code of Practice on employee status with a view to more effective implementation.  My Department will be actively involved in that review.  In addition, the Government and the social partners agreed under the Towards 2016 to continue and expand the Hidden Economy Working Group.  The group, which comprises representatives of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, ICTU, IBEC, SFA, CIF and, since the ratification of the Social Partnership Agreement, my own Department and the National Employment Rights Authority, has met on two occasions to date.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	639	I propose to take Questions Nos. 148 and 361 together.I presume that the questions posed by the Deputies refer to junior doctors, also known as non-consultant hospital doctors. By virtue of not being excluded by the terms of Section 17 of the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003, junior doctors are covered by the provisions of the 2003 Act. The inclusion of junior doctors under the terms of the 2003 Act was viewed at the time of the enactment of the legislation as being positive in regard to employment practices because non-consultant hospital contracts meant that such doctors were already covered by employment law and by specific employment contracts.In the circumstances, I do not propose to review the inclusion of junior doctors under the terms of the 2003 Act.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	641	At the end of January 2007 there were 3,337 cases with the PIAB in the 90-day "consent to process" period, that is, the PIAB has received a claim, issued formal notice to the responding party and is awaiting consent to process from that party.  There were a further 5,993 cases in the nine-month statutory assessment process where the responding party has indicated that liability is not contested and damages are being assessed.  Approximately 8,000 awards have been made to date, 6,500 of these having been issued by the end of 2006.  Of the awards issued, 4,212 have been accepted, 2,508 have been rejected and authorised to proceed to litigation, and responses are awaited on the balance.Some of the rejected awards will have been resolved since PIAB involvement and others will proceed to the Courts.  The PIAB would not be aware of the number of these cases which actually proceed to litigation, although it is believed that a significant proportion are settled outside of the courts once an authorisation issues from the PIAB.The Board currently employs 75 staff members (up from 53 in May 2006) and is in the process of recruiting to bring numbers towards the staffing level of 85 agreed with my Department.  There are no plans at this time to further review staffing levels in the PIAB.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	642	I published the Report of the Interdepartmental Group on Donegal on 26 July 2006. I established the Group at the request of the Government following a number of major job losses in the county in recent years. I  asked the Interdepartmental Group to focus on the progress being made on infrastructural requirements to make Donegal a more attractive location for enterprise creation, particularly as it makes the transition from traditional to more modern and higher value-added industries.The report showed that Donegal has no shortage of advantages and opportunities in so far as the promise of a brighter future for its inhabitants is concerned. There is a dynamic combination of State Development Agencies active in Donegal who are committed to enhancing the attractiveness of the County for business. These agencies have demonstrated the ability to provide a clear vision and focus for future economic development.  IDA Ireland will pursue more knowledge-based greenfield FDI for Donegal and convince existing IDA clients to transform their current operations to higher value activities.  Enterprise Ireland will encourage and assist more innovative, technology-led companies and promote a greater level of start-up activity. These actions are a recognition of the challenges facing traditional industry and both Agencies are responding, as is Údarás in the Gaeltacht.  The County Enterprise Board will continue to provide existing and new supports to micro enterprises complementing the work of both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.The provision of much needed infrastructure has been highlighted as an obstacle to job creation in Donegal over a number of years.  I was pleased to see that the Report identified a lot of good news in terms of developments underway or planned in the areas of roads, air, water supply and treatment, broadband, energy and education.  These have been solidified and strengthened in the National Development Plan 2007-2013 just launched.  Particular emphasis has also been placed in the NDP on North/South co-operation and developments which will be a direct benefit to Donegal. My Department is monitoring progress being made in Donegal and I have asked the State development agencies to advise me if any major difficulties arise in the context of improving the environment for job creation in the county.I also believe that what has already been achieved, in terms of job creation in the last year, is largely as a result of the ongoing commitment to Donegal of the State development agencies, the infrastructural developments recently completed and the commitment to ongoing and planned developments.  Recent major job announcements include Abbott, SITA, ZEUS, PowerBoard and AssetCo.I can assure the Deputy that this Government and the State development agencies are fully committed to fostering the environment  for job creation in Donegal.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	643	While this is an operational matter for Enterprise Ireland, I understand that Enterprise Ireland (EI) operates two direct financial support schemes that help Irish SMEs to increase awareness of and promote eco-efficiency in their operations. These are the Environmental Management System (EMS) Support Scheme and the Environmentally Superior Products (ESP) Support Scheme.(1) The Environmental Management System (EMS) Support Scheme.
This Scheme provides 50% funding (up to a total of €12,700 from EI) to help companies to install an Environmental Management System (EMS) that complies with the ISO 14001 Standard.  An EMS allows a company to proactively manage its environmental issues, including areas such as Waste Management, Energy Management, reduction in the use of Hazardous Chemicals, etc.  An EMS can help a company to reduce costs on waste disposal and energy usage. It is also particularly valuable as a marketing tool as it allows the company to clearly demonstrate its "green" credentials to the marketplace.The EMS Support Scheme has been in operation since late 1998 and since then 105 Irish SMEs have been approved for funding.  The total funds approved in that time have been €775,123. The actual drawdown of funds in that period has been €441,512.(2) The Environmentally Superior Products (ESP) Support Scheme.
This Scheme provides 50% funding (up to a total of €31,750 from EI) to help companies to develop an Environmentally Superior Product (ESP).  An ESP is an industrial product which has significant environmental benefits over a conventional product, for example, an electrical product designed to use the minimum amount of power, have no hazardous chemicals involved in either its manufacture or working life, be easy to disassemble at the end of life to facilitate recycling, etc.The ESP Support Scheme has been running since 1999 and has supported 40 Irish SMEs to date with total approvals over the life of the scheme to date being €1m.  Associated costs of the scheme are approx. €15k per annum covering mainly staff costs.As well as the two "hard" financial support schemes above, EI provides a range of "soft" supports:(a) The Envirocentre website; www.envirocentre.ie — this website provides up to date information on a range of environmental issues relevant to industry.(b) Regional Industrial Environmental Fora. These are regional seminars that cover relevant environmental issues for the SME sector, e.g. the new REACH Regulation.(c) Technical advice to Irish SMEs from a range of in-house experts in various environmental fields.

The Office of the Director of Employment Rights Compliance now to be known as the National Employment Rights Authority has been established on an interim basis.  The Director of NERA has been appointed and has taken up duty on 12 February 2007. The Director will be supported in his role by a management team and I am informed that most of the team members are already in place. The remaining management and administrative staff are being transferred to NERA on the basis of agreed decentralization arrangements.The new regional structure and the new locations of the Labour Inspectorate, now operating under the direction of NERA, have been announced and the resources necessary for the increase in the number of Labour Inspectors have been approved. The necessary arrangements and selection processes for Inspectorate recruitment are being progressed with a view to all assignments being made by end of 2007.Work on the preparation of the necessary legislation to give effect to the comprehensive package of measures concerning employment rights is being progressed as a matter of urgency.  Preparation of the Employment Law Compliance Bill is well advanced and the Minister is committed to publish the Bill in 2007.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	646	International benchmarking reports suggest that the regulatory burden in Ireland is relatively light.  The IMD (International Institute for Management Development) World Competitiveness Yearbook 2006 ranks Ireland 8th out of 61 countries surveyed for the extent to which bureaucracy does not hinder business activity.  The World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report 2006-07 ranks Ireland 17th out of 125 countries surveyed for having a low burden of government regulation.While it appears, therefore, that Ireland enjoys a relatively favourable position, it remains important that every effort be made to maintain and improve this position, that the concerns of business are addressed on an ongoing basis, and that the work currently being done by our European neighbours does not see Ireland falling behind in competitiveness.Towards that end, I established the Business Regulation Forum (BRF) in November 2005 to advise me on any changes necessary to ensure that existing or proposed regulations impacting on business meet the criteria set out in the White Paper "Regulating Better".During 2006 the Forum collected evidence of the burden of regulation on business in Ireland. The BRF invited submissions from interested parties and received forty responses. The Forum liaised with international experts who have been active in seeking to reduce the burden on business. Six case studies were completed, looking at the day-to-day regulations that businesses face.  In addition, a pilot study was carried out on ways of reducing the administrative cost to business of two specific regulations. The Forum has also reviewed the work on regulation by the Small Business Forum.  I expect to receive a report from the Business Regulation Forum shortly.In addition to the work of the Business Regulation Forum, and specifically relating to the small business sector, I recently enacted legislation to raise the audit exemption thresholds applying to small companies in respect of turnover and balance sheet to €7.3m and €3.65m. respectively.  (The previous thresholds were €1.5m and €1.9m.)  This will remove the compulsory annual audit costs from the very large number of companies qualifying from the enhanced exemption level.The Minister for Finance announced a package of measures in Budget 2007 aimed at:Reducing the Administrative Burden on Small Businesses in relation to the payment of Corporation Tax, Preliminary Tax and the requirement for a Tax Clearance Certificate, by increasing the current thresholds which trigger such requirements. In addition, the Revenue Commissioners have been asked to explore further opportunities to reduce the tax compliance burden on all firms, large and small.Increasing the VAT Cash Accounting and VAT Registration Turnover Thresholds from 1 March 2007 to simplify administration and reduce working capital requirements on small businesses.Finally, the Company Law Review Group (CLRG) has finalised its work on the preparation of the General Scheme of the Companies Consolidation and Reform Bill and I understand that it expects to report on its findings shortly.  The CLRG's proposals will bring the existing 13 Companies Acts into one and will make it easier for firms and practitioners to understand and comply with the law relating to the incorporation and operation of companies in Ireland.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	647	On the 26th of April 2006, the Labour Court made a recommendation regarding the redundancy terms for Irish Sugar workers at the Mallow plant.  The recommendation provided that redundancy should be 5 weeks' pay per year of service, where a week's pay would be defined as actual finishing salary, excluding overtime, plus statutory redundancy entitlement, plus a bonus payment for an orderly wind-down.The Court issued two clarifications in May and a third in October 2006, but these failed to achieve a resolution to the dispute.  Both sides returned to the Court on 19 February 2007 for informal talks.  The Labour Court continues to have informal discussions with the parties.To date Greencore has not received any payment under the EU scheme of aid for the restructuring of the sugar industry.  In July 2006, the company submitted an aid application to the Department of Agriculture, which, in accordance with the EU regulations, included a social plan detailing the actions planned by the company in particular with respect to re-training, redeployment and early retirement of the workforce.  The company indicated that the proposed redundancy payments were in accordance with the ruling of the Labour Court.  The aid application was approved in September 2006 subject to the outcome of the Judicial Review proceedings instituted by Greencore in respect of the Government decisions relating to the allocation of the aid.  In view of this legal action, which is due to come to trial on 1 May 2007, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further.  Under the EU regulations, the first instalment of aid would fall to be paid in June 2007.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	649	The European Commission published its Annual Progress Report for 2006 on implementation of the renewed Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs on 12 December 2006.   The overall assessment of Ireland's performance is that we are making very good progress in the implementation of our National Reform Programme (NRP), including the priority areas arising from the 2006 Spring European Council. The underpinning role of the social partnership process and the range of commitments agreed under Towards 2016 is also acknowledged.The Commission again places Ireland in the first tier of Member States with the strongest record and progress in pursuit of the Lisbon goals.  Ireland ranks amongst a handful of countries which has received no specific recommendations.As far as my own Department is concerned, in terms of rankings, Ireland scores very highly in terms of best enterprise environment due to the ease of starting a business, good access to capital and relatively low levels of administrative "red tape".Furthermore, the Commission identified key strengths of our National Reform Programme as:Recently adopted Science, Technology and Innovation Strategy 2007-2013 and the substantial increase of public investment in R&D;Recognition of the need to prioritise public investment in infrastructure and other growth-promoting expenditure; andMeasures to address early school leaving and enhance skills, such as the commitment to develop a long-term national skills strategy.In addition to the various measures outlined in the NRP progress report, submitted in October 2006, many of the initiatives and changes outlined in Budget 2007 are entirely consistent with our overall strategy to stimulate and sustain economic growth and employment.  The recently published National Development Plan 2007-2013 further demonstrates a level of investment and a range of measures across the policy spectrum which reinforce this strategy.  Building on these developments, we would expect to record strong progress in continuing to meet the Lisbon objectives.The Commission's Annual Progress Report will now form a key input to the Spring European Council meeting on 8th March 2007.

Furthermore, the number of unemployed people in the region has fallen over the same period but, while the rate of unemployment is down from 5.6% to 4.8%, it is still above the national average.While there have been job losses in the traditional sectors, there has been significant growth in other areas such as pharmaceuticals, medical technologies, financial services and software.  The State Training agency FÁS is committed to the development of the labour force skills in the region.  In 2006, the agency invested almost €100 million in the region.The economic development of the region is being advanced by IDA Ireland primarily through the gateway of Waterford City.  The agency's strategy is to progress the development of a knowledge-based economy so that the region can compete for foreign direct investment.  The agency continues to work with existing clients to broaden their mandate in Ireland.  The success of this overall strategy is reflected in projects by Genzyme, Abbott Vascular, Cordis Corporation, Bisys Hedge Funds Services, Servier and Merck Sharp & Dohme which have located in the region.Enterprise Ireland has forged strong links with the Waterford Institute of Technology and Carlow Institute of Technology, and has funded business incubation centres at the Institutes.  The agency has also funded the establishment of 17 Community Enterprise  Centres in the region since the first CEC Scheme in 1989, and since 2002, the agency has supported 24 new high potential start-up companies. A number of indigenous companies have embarked on significant research and development activities demonstrating a move toward higher-value activities.  In addition, the Waterford Institute of Technology's Telecoms Software and Systems Group has recently received research and development support through Science Foundation Ireland.In the context of balanced regional development, the State Development agencies will continue to pursue innovative initiatives, in cooperation with other local bodies, to further develop the region for industrial development and job creation.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	651	Irish employment rights law makes a distinction between a contract of service, which applies to an employer-employee relationship, and a contract for service, which applies in the case of an independent sub-contractor. In effect, employment rights legislation does not apply to independent sub-contractors with the exception of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989 and the Equality Act, 1998.In most cases it will be clear whether an individual is employed or self-employed. Where there is doubt in relation to the employment status of an individual the relevant Departments and Agencies will have regard to the Code of Practice for Determining Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals. This Code was drawn up and agreed in 2001 by the Revenue Commissioners, Department of Social and Family Affairs, Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Irish Business and Employers Federation.A number of criteria are set out in that Code for determining whether an individual is an employee or self-employed. These include whether the person is under the control or direction of another person, owns his/her own business, supplies labour only, receives a fixed wage, is exposed to financial risk, assumes responsibility for investment and management, supplies materials for the job, can sub-contract the work, works set hours or a given number of hours per week/month, etc.A major package of measures has been agreed by the parties to Towards 2016, the new Social Partnership Agreement, to provide for enhanced public confidence in the system of compliance. New legislation will be published this year to provide for enhanced employment rights measures including the establishment of the National Employment Rights Authority. Providing for greater clarity in the application of employment rights legislation to employees will be considered in the context of drawing up that legislation.Legislation, which will empower the Labour Inspectorate to join with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to work together in Joint Investigation Units, has been recently published.  Such units will have a particular focus on the employment status of workers. The National Employment Rights Authority, which has already been established on an interim basis, is currently meeting with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners with a view to the early establishment and operation of Joint Investigation Units, once the legislation has been enacted.The package of measures provided for under Towards 2016 will be supported by enhanced employment rights promotional and educational efforts. The Social partners and other organisations such as the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners will be invited to bring their knowledge and networks to bear on the design and delivery of this education and awareness programme which, it is anticipated, will also address the issues associated with bogus self-employment.The Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners will have details of the number of bogus self-contractors identified in 2006 in the context of their specific responsibilities. The Labour Inspectorate encountered a claim in 2006 by an employer that workers were engaged on a sub-contract basis and was not, therefore, subject to employment rights legislation. In this case the Scope Section of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, following consideration of all the relevant facts, decided that the workers involved were employees. This decision facilitated an Employment Appeals Tribunal award in favour of a number of former workers in that enterprise.

This measure was introduced in recognition of the fact that older participants may find it more difficult to progress into the open labour market.Currently, there are over 6,000 people over 55 years of age Community Employment Schemes. This represents 29% of those on Community Employment, a figure which has increased from 25% at year end 2005.In terms of the overall development of Community Employment, as part of its continuous improvement processes, FAS has introduced a new Individual Learner Plan approach to the Community Employment programme. This approach aimed at systematically supporting the progression of programme participants is currently being rolled out nationwide.In addition, FAS has developed three FETAC Major Awards, two at level 3 and one at level 4, designed to meet the training needs of learners participating on Community Services programmes. The flexible format of the awards will allow for the construction of a programme of learning, specifically designed to address the learning needs of the individual learner.

In Europe, the main focus of IDA's marketing is in the three largest economies, Germany, the United Kingdom and France.The majority of countries in Eastern Europe are in the early stages of their economic development and therefore do not represent appropriate targets for foreign direct investment for the Ireland of today.  Indeed for certain activities some locations in Eastern Europe are in fact competitor locations for Ireland and the work of the IDA.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	655	The national social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, recognises the role that public procurement can play in the maintenance of employment standards and norms, including in respect of wage levels, while also ensuring competitive tendering and value for money in public expenditure.   In this regard the agreement contains a number of provisions supporting employment standards through public procurement.In the first half of 2007 the National Public Procurement Policy Unit of the Department of Finance will commence consolidating and updating existing public procurement guidelines on supplies and service contracts.  It will consult with the Social Partners about strengthening the existing guideline provisions on the need to comply with legal requirements in regard to pay and employment conditions.  New standard contracts on construction projects contain strengthened provisions on the requirement for contractors to observe statutory agreements on pay and employment conditions when performing public contracts.With regard to the National Minimum Wage, under the Social Partnership Agreement Towards 2016, ICTU and IBEC agreed that the minimum wage should be adjusted with effect from 1 January, 2007.  However, as the social partners themselves were unable to reach agreement on a new rate as foreseen in the agreement, ICTU asked the Labour Court to consider the issue and to make a recommendation on a new rate.The Labour Court considered the matter, consulted with both employer and employee representative bodies and recommended increases to the National Minimum Wage.  I accepted the Labour Court recommendations and the minimum hourly rate of pay was  increased to €8.30 with effect from 1 January 2007 with a further increase to €8.65 taking effect from 1 July 2007.I am happy that, when taken in aggregate, these increases provide for a significant improvement in the earnings of workers on the minimum wage.  Our rate compares extremely favourably with the minimum wage rates in other EU member states.

No. 163 of 2006), which is an important element of the implementation of the National Disability Strategy initiated by the Government in 2004.  Just as the aim of the Strategy is to underpin the participation of people with disabilities in Irish society by building on existing policy and legislation, this code enhances disability policy by assisting public bodies to make services and information accessible to people with disabilities.The National Disability Authority (NDA) prepared this code, at my request, to guide public bodies in relation to compliance with regard to sections 26 (Access to services provided by a public body), 27 (Access to services supplied to a public body) and 28 (Access to information) of the Act.  The code provides practical guidance and examples of approaches and methods that could be employed to ensure that services by public bodies are accessible to people with disabilities where practicable and appropriate. It suggests that one of the ways that public bodies could make information more accessible to persons with hearing impairments is to provide sign language interpreters.The NDA provides support and assistance to public bodies in making their information and services accessible to people with disabilities.  In addition, the National Disability Authority Act, 1999 provides for a monitoring role for the Authority, in relation to the implementation of codes of practice, such as this code, developed by the Authority and approved by me.

She has remained in the State with her children, without permission, since this date.  On 28 February, 2006, the person concerned consented in writing to the making of a deportation order in respect of her and her children.  On 9 June, 2006 I signed consent deportation orders in respect of the person concerned and her three children, however, these have since expired and are no longer enforceable.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, she was informed by letter dated 23 November, 2006, that the Minister proposed to make deportation orders in respect of her and her children.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she and her children should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before orders are made or consenting to the making of deportation orders.This person's case file, including all representations submitted, will be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (Prohibition of Refoulement).  The person concerned is not entitled to take up gainful employment in the State as she has not been granted permission to remain in the State.

A person behaves in an anti-social manner if the person causes or, in the circumstances, is likely to cause, to one or more persons who are not of the same household as the person (a) harassment, (b) significant or persistent alarm, distress, fear or intimidation, or (c) significant or persistent impairment of their use or enjoyment of their property.The application by the Garda Síochána to the Courts for an order under the Act comes at the end of a process.The first step in the procedure set out in the Act is that a member of the Garda Síochána issues a behaviour warning to a person who has behaved in an anti-social manner. The behaviour warning will warn the person that failure to comply with this demand may result in an application to the courts for a civil order or that issuing of a subsequent behaviour order might also result in an application to the courts for a civil order.If a behaviour warning or a series of warnings does not result in the person changing his or her behaviour, the Garda Síochána may apply to the District Court for a civil order to prohibit the person from doing anything specified in the order.  Only a senior member of the Garda can make the court application, which means an officer not below the rank of superintendent.  An order will remain in force for a period specified in the order, which cannot be longer than two years.  If no period is specified, an order will remain in force for two years. The penalties for breach of an order will be a fine not exceeding €3,000 or a maximum of six months imprisonment or both.I commenced the provisions of Part 13 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 relating to anti-social behaviour by children on 1 March 2007. These provisions set out on incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by children from a warning from a member of An Garda Síochána to a good behaviour contract to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme to the making  of a behaviour order by the Children Court. Behaviour Orders are applied for by a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of Superintendent.I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are to date no behaviour warnings recorded for the Garda Districts of Lucan and Clondalkin.

It is an intelligence led policing initiative, the focus of which is the targeting of active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting their criminal activity through extensive additional overt patrolling and static check points by uniform, mobile and foot patrols, supported by armed plain clothes patrols.  The Operation remains in place and is on-going in the DMR.I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the amount of overtime worked by Gardaí in the Lucan and Clondalkin Garda Districts for the years 2005, 2006 and to date in 2007 under Operation Anvil are as set out in the table hereunder:YearClondalkinLucan2005 (from May)9,018 hrs12,842 hrs200613,100 hrs18,058 hrs2007 (to date)7,405 hrs10,705 hrs

The requirement to have a qualification in two languages, one of which must be Irish or English, was put in place in 2005 as part of a process to considerably widen eligibility for entry to the Garda Síochána.  The experience of these recent changes will be carefully monitored, and issues of the kind raised by the Deputy will be considered in that context.

This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training as at the 31 December 2006 was 14,068. Furthermore, I should say that in December 2006, as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of approximately 1100 new recruits per annum into the Garda College will continue until this target is met. The Garda Budget now stands at €1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and a 96% increase since 1997 in real terms.An Garda Síochána is committed to delivering a highly visible, high quality, community focused policing service to the public throughout the State.  An Garda Síochána deploy a variety of operational strategies in delivering this service. The strategies vary from place to place and from time to time on the basis of an analysis of the prevailing demands. Personnel are deployed in uniform or plain clothes, on foot, mobile, cycle, mounted, marine or aerial patrols. Matters such as patrol purpose, size and nature of patrol area, time, conditions, etc, are all factors that are considered when deciding on the appropriate strategies.Arising from the number and range of variables which can apply at any time, it is not possible to quantify an average number of foot patrols per District per month.Community Policing is a central feature of current policing policy and members of Community policing units are encouraged to engage with the local communities where they are assigned. Current policing policy is predicated on the prevention of public order offences; the prevention of crime including crimes of violence against persons and property and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of quality of life of the residents. This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of a quality policing service.  As additional resources become available more patrols by uniform and plain-clothes personnel will be part of future policing strategies.

The preparation of the strategy has involved a significant amount of research and consultation across all Government Departments and in consultation with the social partners in order to produce a comprehensive strategy that will resonate with all the women of Ireland.

I can confirm that the State has made an intervention to the Court in this case, to the effect that European law does not preclude national provisions laying down retirement ages. Moreover, the State contends that national courts do not have the option of disapplying national laws where they may be found to be contrary to the Directive in question as it cannot have direct effect.While in his recently published opinion, the Advocate General reaches broadly the same conclusions, this opinion of itself does not have legal effect. No decision has yet been made by the European Court of Justice in the case. In the event that the Court concurs with the opinion of the Advocate General, the judgment will have no implications for the State.

These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends and other operational policing needs. Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy. This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and that the best possible service is provided to the public.

I also stated that it is intended, as part of the new Immigration policy framework to provide a clear policy statement setting out how these cases will be managed once it is established that trafficking has taken place.  I would reiterate, however, that the lack of a specific legislative provision on the victims of trafficking has in no way reduced Ireland's commitment to dealing with cases sympathetically as they arise.As I informed the House on 31 January the Government approved the drafting of the Criminal Law (Trafficking in Persons and Sexual Offences) Bill 2006 last July. It is at present being drafted in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  The Bill is criminal law legislation which will implement the criminal law aspects of EU, UN and Council of Europe instruments on trafficking by creating offences of recruiting, transporting, transferring to another person, harbouring or knowingly arranging or facilitating—(a)  the entry into, travel within or departure from, the State of a person, or(b)  the provision of accommodation or employment in the State for that person, for the purpose of that person's exploitation. The term "exploitation" in the Bill is defined as meaning sexual or labour exploitation or the removal of a person's organs for the purpose of transplanting into another person.  A copy of the draft Bill as approved by Government is available on my Department's website.

A non-national who lands in the State in contravention of this provision shall be deemed to be refused permission and shall be guilty of an offence.  The most recent list of  approved ports is set out in the Immigration Act 2004 (Approved Ports) Regulations 2004.   These are:Carrickfinn AirportGalwayCobhGalway AirportConnaught AirportGreencastleCorkMovilleCork AirportRosslare HarbourDublinShannon AirportDublin AirportSligo AirportDún LaoghaireWaterfordFarranfore AirportWaterford Regional AirportThere is no distinction in Immigration legislation between privately and publicly owned ports nor between airports and seaports.   Apart from the general application of the criminal law and its enforcement by an Garda Síochána and such general legal provisions applicable to an airport in the same way as to any other location, my role as regards the operation of such ports is in relation to immigration matters only. I have no function as regards the general operation of an airport, including its licensing or the approval of traffic volumes or air safety. Such matters are appropriate to the Department of Transport and the Irish Aviation Authority. There is also a central role for local authorities in respect of planning.Applications for approved port status in respect of private or publicly owned airports will be considered in the context of overall government policy in the airport sector and generally will fall to be considered once these policy aspects in regard to any particularly area have been determined. I have an application at present in respect of Weston Aerodrome and this will be dealt with when appropriate within the policy framework I have outlined.

Details are set-out in the table beneath.It was never the intention that all Garda stations would be equipped to carry out audio/video recording of interviews. Indeed, most Garda stations are not used for detention and interviews.  Rather the intention was that a sufficient number of interview rooms in Garda stations across the country be equipped to provide a broad nationwide coverage.  Where a Garda station is not equipped with an audio/video system, a person to be interviewed in accordance with the Regulations will be taken to the nearest Garda station with such equipment.With regard to future and additional requirements I am advised by the Garda authorities that tenders for the provision of additional equipment are currently being evaluated.DivisionStationDivisionStationDMR NCStore St.Carlow/KildareCarlowBridewellAthyMountjoyNaasFitzgibbon StreetKildareDMR NClontarfNewbridgeCoolockCelbridgeSantryBaltinglassRahenyCavan/MonaghanMonaghanSwordsCavanBallymunCarrickmacrossMalahideCastleblaneyWhitehallBailieboroHowthBallyconnellDMR SCPearse St.ClareEnnisKevin St.ShannonDonnybrookEnnistymonHarcourt SquareKillaloeHarcourt TerraceKilrushKilmainhamCork CityAnglesea StDMR SouthCrumlinBridewellTallaghtMayfieldRathfarnhamWatercourseTerenureGurranabraherSundrive RdTogherRathminesCarrigalineDMR EastDún LaoghaireCork WestBandonShankillCastletownbereBlackrockKanturkDundrumMacroomBrayClonakiltyDMR WestBlanchardstownBantryFinglasCork NorthFermoyCabraMtchelstownLucanMallowBallyfermotCharlevilleClondalkinMidletonRonanstownCobhDonegalLetterkennyMayoCastlebarLiffordBelmulletMilfordSwinfordBurnfootWestportBalyshannonBallinaBuncranaClaremorrisGlentiesRoscommon/GalwayRoscommonGalway WestMill StBallinasloeSalthillTuamGortBoyleLoughreaCastlereaClifdenSligoSligoKerryTraleeManorhamiltonKillarneyCarrick-on-ShannonListowelBallymoteCaherciveenTipperaryThurlesKillorglinClonmelLaois/OffalyTullamoreCahirPortlaoiseNenaghAbbeyleixTemplemoreBirrTipperaryLimerickHenry St.Garda CollegeMayorstoneWaterford/KilkennyWaterfordRoxboroKilkennyAskeatonKilmacthomasBruffDungarvanNewcastlewestTramoreLongford/WestmeathMullingarCastlecomerLongfordThomastownAthloneWexfordEnniscorthyGranardArklowLouth/MeathDroghedaGoreyKellsWexfordNavanWicklowTrimNew RossBalbrigganAshbourneDundalk

In addition, I am informed that an additional Garda shall be assigned permanently to Adrigole Garda Station, which also polices the Beara area, this month.  I am further informed that the personnel strength (all ranks) of the Cork West Division on 31 December, 1997 and 2006 was 223 and 264, respectively. This represents an increase of 41 (or 18%) in the number of Garda personnel allocated to the Division during that period. In addition, the Cork West Division's resources are further augmented by a number of Garda National Units such as the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), other specialised units and the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB), all of which have had increased resources.The Deputy should appreciate that, as with any large organisation, on any given day, personnel strengths of individual stations and units may fluctuate due, for example, to promotions, retirements and transfers.  I should also add that Garda management state that it is the role of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/ her Division based on an assessment of the Policing needs of his/ her area of responsibility at any given time.

The current provision relating to remission is Rule 38 (1) of the Rules for the Government of Prisons, 1947, which states that:—A convicted prisoner sentenced to imprisonment, whether by one sentence or cumulative sentences, for a period exceeding one calendar month, shall be eligible, by industry and good conduct, to earn a remission of a portion of his imprisonment, not exceeding one-fourth of the whole sentence, provided that the remission so granted does not result in the prisoner being discharged before he has served one month.Under the statutory Rules, forfeiture of remission may only be imposed by the Prison Governor for a breach of prison discipline. The punishment allowed for any such one breach, in terms of forfeiture of remission, may not exceed fourteen days.  The Rules do not provide for differing applications of remission based solely on the nature of the offending behaviour which led to conviction and imprisonment.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	691	I propose to take Questions Nos. 204, 207 and 208 together.The Sex Offenders Act, 2001 which commenced on 27 September 2001 sets out the notification obligations on persons convicted of a range of sexual offences against both children and adults.  A convicted sex offender must notify his/her name(s), date of birth and current home address to the Garda Síochána within seven days of the conviction for the sexual offence concerned or, where the offender is sentenced to imprisonment, from the date of full release from prison.Thereafter, the offender must notify the Gardaí of any change of name or address within seven days of that change.  Notification of any address where the offender spends either as much as seven days or two or more periods amounting to seven days in any twelve month period must also be given to the Gardaí.  The provisions of the Act extend to any sex offenders entering this jurisdiction from abroad who have an obligation to register in their own countries or who have been convicted abroad of an offence comparable to one covered by the Act.Additional measures contained in the Sex Offenders Act, 2001 makes it mandatory for a convicted sex offender to inform their employer or future employer of their conviction if their job entails having unsupervised access to children.  The Act also allows for a Chief Superintendent of An Garda Síochána to request the Court to make a Sex Offender Order, whereby a sex offender can be prohibited from behaving in a particular way, where such behaviour is perceived by the Court as having a potential danger to the welfare of children.  It should be noted that Garda clearance is now required for potential employees in a number of occupations which entail access to, or authority over children.If the court imposed an order for post-release supervision, Part 5 of the 2001 Act obliges the convicted person to undergo supervision by the Probation Service for a specified period and to comply with such conditions that are specified therein.    Offenders who are subject to a post release supervision Order are managed on a one-to-one basis by a Probation Officer.   Should a sex offender fail to comply with  obligations as outlined in the Act, the offender is guilty of an offence and subject to a fine and / or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 12 months.I can advise the Deputy that my Department through the Probation Service provides  funding to a community based sex offender programme specifically for convicted sex offenders who abuse children.   I can further advise that the Probation Service has two officers directly involved in the delivery of adolescent sex offender programmes in both North and South Dublin.   In addition, the Service is involved in the management and organisation of a community based adolescent sex offender programme based in the west of Ireland.I also wish to advise the Deputy that in advance of release, there are three forms of direct therapeutic intervention available to prisoners serving sentences for sexual offences which assist in their personal rehabilitation and relapse prevention.   These are:- individual counselling from the Irish Prison Service's Psychology Service and from the Probation Service; the Sex Offender Programme which has been in operation since 1994; and one-to-one interventions by visiting psychiatrists who provide support to prisoners.  I am advised that therapeutic intervention by its very nature is of minimal value to a non-voluntary participant.Before an offender is released from prison, the Prison Service must inform him/her that they are subject to the notification requirement of the Act. Ten days before the date of release, the Prison Service must inform the Garda Síochána that s/he is being released.There is a system in place whereby Child Care Managers in the Health Service Executive are informed, by the Senior Probation Officer, of the impending release of sex offenders from prisons irrespective of whether the offence is against a child or adult.   The Child Care Manager is provided with the date of release, details of the offence committed and address of  the offender following release.  A ‘Protocol for the sharing of information on the management of sex offenders between the Probation Service and the Probation Board for Northern Ireland (PBNI)' was signed by the Heads of both Organisations in March, 2006.    That protocol established mutual arrangements for the management of sex offenders, subject to supervision by the respective Services.    This protocol facilitates best practice and effective case management of sex offenders between jurisdictions by enabling exchange of relevant information on a structured and agreed basis.  In addition, I also wish to advise the Deputy that on 27 November, 2006 I signed a  Memorandum of Understanding on information sharing arrangements between Ireland and the UK relating to sex offenders.The MOU was negotiated between my Department and the Home Office, with input from the Northern Ireland Office. It relates to information about persons travelling between Ireland and the UK and who are subject to sex offender notification requirements in their own jurisdiction.  This covers sex offenders travelling between any of the legal jurisdictions in these islands.  The rationale for the Memorandum is that such information will be shared between police forces for the purposes of protecting the public from the risks presented by sex offenders — whether paedophile or otherwise — and investigating serious sexual offences.  The transmission of any information necessary to achieve these purposes is covered.As a result of the MOU, the exchange of such information between the Garda Síochána and British police forces, which of course has already been taking place for some time, is now being put on a formal footing.  The information will now be shared as a matter of course.  This Memorandum of Understanding is another example of the close relationship between Ireland and the UK and in particular between the two parts of this island.  It is also the most recent example of the benefits which accrue to both sides through cooperation and coordination in the areas of criminal justice and law enforcement. As the MOU provides, its use and effectiveness will be kept under review, and I am confident that full use will be made of its potential by the police forces of all our jurisdictions.A Registered Sex Offender Advisory Group has been established consisting of representatives of An Garda Síochána, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Northern Ireland Office.  As part of its work, this Group evaluates the potential for sharing information, examining the registration criteria in both jurisdictions for sex offenders and identifying areas for further co-operation.  The provisions of the Sex Offenders Act 2001 are kept under constant review by my Department with a view to ensuring the Act is operating in an efficient and effective  manner.

Section 3 of the Act provides that each of the offences referred to in the Schedule to the Act shall, subject to subsections (2) and (3), be a sexual offence for the purposes of the Act.  The list in the Schedule is comprehensive, with the emphasis on those offences which are most applicable to the protection of children against sexual abuse.  Section 7 provides how the notification requirements set out in the Act will apply to all persons convicted of a qualifying sexual offence.A convicted sex offender must notify his/her name(s), date of birth and current home address to the Garda Síochána within seven days of the conviction for the sexual offence concerned or, where the offender is sentenced to imprisonment, from the date of full release from prison.   Thereafter, the offender must notify the Gardaí of any change of name or address within seven days of that change.  Notification of any address where the offender spends either as much as seven days or two or more periods amounting to seven days in any twelve month period must also be given to the Gardaí.If the offender intends to leave the State for a period of seven days or more s/he must inform the Gardaí of this fact and the address at which s/he intends to stay and also notify the Gardaí of his/her return. If s/he did not intend to stay away for more than seven days but did, s/he must inform the Gardaí within a further seven days.  The provisions of the Act extend to any sex offenders entering this jurisdiction from abroad who have an obligation to register in their own countries or who have been convicted abroad of an offence comparable to one covered by the Act.Part 4 of the Act provides that it is an offence for convicted sex offenders to apply for, or to accept, work or to offer services, a necessary and regular part of which consists mainly of unsupervised access to, or contact with, children or mentally impaired persons, without informing the employer or organisation of his/her conviction for a qualifying sexual offence.  It is an offence to fail to comply with the notification requirements. The penalty is imprisonment for up to 12 months or a fine of €1,900 or both.  The courts can also sentence an offender who has been found guilty of an offence under the schedule of offences in the Act to a period of statutory supervision under the Probation and Welfare Service on their release from prison.Before an offender is released from prison, the Prison Service must inform him/her that they are subject to the notification requirement of the Act. Ten days before the date of release, the Prison Service must inform the Garda Síochána that s/he is being released.  The Garda Síochána has in place a system for the monitoring of persons subject to these requirements. The Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Unit monitor and manage the notification provisions. The information on persons who are subject to the requirements of the Sex Offenders Act, 2001 is maintained at a central location.There are nominated Garda Inspectors in each Garda Division who are notified by the Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Unit when a sex offender, who is subject to the requirements of the Act, is resident in their Division. These inspectors are responsible as police officers for the monitoring of such offenders.  In this respect, the Garda Síochána liaise with other relevant State agencies.On 27 November, 2006 I signed a  Memorandum of Understanding on information sharing arrangements between Ireland and the UK relating to sex offenders.The MOU was negotiated between my Department and the Home Office, with input from the Northern Ireland Office. It relates to information about persons travelling between Ireland and the UK and who are subject to sex offender notification requirements in their own jurisdiction.

As part of its work, this Group evaluates the potential for sharing information, examining the registration criteria in both jurisdictions for sex offenders and identifying areas for further co-operation.  In exceptional circumstances, such as where the Garda authorities are aware of an immediate or serious threat from a particular individual subject to the reporting requirements of the Act, they may decide to disclose the name of that individual to persons on a strict need to know basis.The provisions of the Act are kept under constant review by my Department with a view to ensuring the Act is operating in an efficient and effective manner.  It is my intention that the Criminal Law (Trafficking in Persons and Sexual Offences) Bill, which is currently being drafted, will contain provision to strengthen the monitoring of registered sex offenders.

This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period.  The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training as at the 31 December 2006 was 14,068. Furthermore, I should say that in December, 2006 as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of approximately 1100 new recruits per annum into the Garda College will continue until this target is met. The Garda Budget now stands at €1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and a 96% increase since 1997 in real terms.I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength (all ranks) of Ballydesmond Garda Station on 31 January, 2007 was 1. The personnel strength (all ranks) of Knocknagree Garda Station on 31 January, 2007 was 1. Ballydesmond Garda Station and Knocknagree Garda Station form part of the Kanturk District in the Cork West Division. The personnel strength of the Kanturk District on 31 January, 2007 was 42 (all ranks). Ballydesmond Garda Station is open to the public from 6.30pm to 8.30pm, Monday to Saturday, subject to the rostered tour of duty of the member attached to Ballydesmond Garda Station. Knocknagree Garda Station is open to the public from 3pm to 5pm, Monday to Saturday, subject to the rostered tour of duty of the member attached to Knocknagree Garda Station. Outside of these hours, the call diversion system is in operation and linked to the District Headquarters at Kanturk Garda Station.Local Garda Management report that there has been no reduction in Garda coverage and policing of the Ballydesmond/Knocknagree area. Alternative arrangements have been put in place in relation to the use of a Garda Patrol car in the District to ensure improved visibility and enhance law enforcement capability in the area.  I should add that it is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions. These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends and other operational policing needs. Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy. This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and that the best possible service is provided to the public.The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available the needs of the Ballydesmond and Knocknagree areas will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.

Section 2 of that Act states that an authorisation to intercept may be granted only for the purpose of the investigation of serious crime or in the interests of the security of the State.  It is not the practice and it would be contrary to the public interest to reveal either the categories of person to whom authorisations to intercept relate and the number of such authorisations.

Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.In accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, she was informed by letter dated 31 October, 2003, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before the deportation order was made or consenting to the making of the deportation order.Representations were received on her behalf. On 20 February, 2006 as an exceptional measure, she was granted humanitarian leave to remain for one year.On 11 January, 2007 the person concerned submitted documentation to my Department. This application is receiving consideration and I expect a decision to issue to the individual concerned shortly.

The area referred to by the Deputy is not within the area covered by the proposed scheme.  It is not intended to extend the proposed scheme.However, I would like to point out to the Deputy that the area he is referring to has, since 1998, benefited from the Rural Renewal Scheme  which was much more extensive and generous than the current proposed Mid-Shannon Scheme. Following a major review of various property and area based tax incentive schemes I announced in Budget 2006 that various reliefs had either achieved the objectives set out for them or were no longer considered to be cost effective in terms of the objectives set out for them and were therefore being terminated subject to certain transitional provisions. The Rural Renewal scheme was included among these.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	702	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, under Section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, tax relief is allowable on health expenses incurred outside of the State on the same basis as health expenses incurred within the State,  provided that:(i) the medical practitioner is entitled, under the laws of the country in which the care is provided, to practise medicine or dentistry there; and/or(ii) the hospital or nursing home is approved of for the purposes of tax relief under the heading of health expenses by the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Minister for Health and Children.Where qualifying health care is, in relation to a specific health expense, obtainable only outside the State, reasonable expenses of travelling and accommodation for the patient may be allowed.  In such a case, the expenses of one person accompanying the patient may also be allowed where the condition of the patient requires it.  Where the patient is a child, the expenses of one parent may generally be allowed and, exceptionally, of both parents where it is clear that both have to be in attendance.Relief cannot be claimed for any expenditure that has been or will be reimbursed by a medical insurer or where a compensation payment is, or will be, made in respect of the expenditure.   In addition, health expenses relief is generally provided by way of repayment of tax paid and only to the extent that tax has been paid.  Where a person has paid for qualifying health expenses but has not paid tax in a year, it is not possible to provide relief under the scheme to him or her.   For claims for the tax year 2006 and previous tax years back to 2003, the first €125 of any medical expenses incurred in the tax year is borne by the taxpayer.  In the case of an individual claiming relief in respect of two or more persons, the taxpayer must bear the first €250 him/herself.If the Deputy has a particular case in mind, the Revenue Commissioners, on receipt of relevant details, are prepared to examine such case and give a view of the tax relief that may be available in that case.

There is no record of any employment since that date.There is no record of the taxpayer being registered for income tax as a self employed person and therefore no income tax returns are recorded as having been received.I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have no registration or record for the company named and that they can find no entry for this company with the Companies Registration Office.If the taxpayer has any further queries he should contact Mr. Sean McDonnell, Kildare Revenue District, Grattan House, Lower Mount Street, Dublin 2.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	706	A child dependant allowance can arise from a number of sources such as social welfare legislation, employments and occupational pension schemes.As regards the child dependant allowance payable by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the 1998 Supreme Court case of Ó Síocháin v. Neenan held, on interpretation of the relevant social welfare legislation, that the widow’s pension, including the child dependant element, is the beneficial entitlement of the widow.  The reason, therefore, that the child dependant allowances are taxable is that they form part of payments to parents that are treated as income for tax purposes.However, by virtue of specific statutory tax exemption, the child dependant allowance paid to individuals in receipt of either unemployment benefit or disability benefit is not taxable.  A further statutory tax exemption relieves Child Benefit from tax.In relation to the income tax treatment of maintenance payments in respect of children it is the case that they are not taxable in the hands of the children or the receiving spouse. However, in the case of both legally enforced and voluntary maintenance payments in respect of children, the position is that the payments are treated the same way as if the taxpayer was providing for the child out of his or her after-tax income. This is in line with the tax treatment of all other parents, where the cost of maintaining their children is not tax deductible.I do not propose to make any changes to these arrangements.

Mayo County Council intend to carry out these works over the coming months.  A joint study is being considered to determine the feasibility of a Flood Relief Scheme for Crossmolina.In relation to the development on the River Deel, the position is as notified to the House in my response of 13th December, 2006 (Question No. 139) namely that planning and development control is a matter for the appropriate planning authorities, in this case Mayo County Council, and not for the Office of Public Works.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	708	Public access to the Swiss cottage is by way of a bridge across the River Suir. In recent times the condition of this bridge has, on visual inspection, given cause for concern. In late 2006 a consultant engineer was appointed by the Office of Public Works to carry out an assessment of the bridge and to make recommendations as to its structural condition and the level of work required. Early in this assessment process the engineer reported that the bridge was in dangerous condition and recommended that access to it be limited pending his full inspection and report.When received at the beginning of 2007 the engineer's full report underlined the dangerous condition of the bridge, highlighted the ongoing erosion of its structural members, and recommended repair as a matter of urgency. Based on these recommendations the Office of Public Works acted swiftly to request the preparation of the necessary tender documents for the repair of the bridge.  These documents are scheduled to be complete by the week commencing 12 March, 2007. At that point tenders will be invited immediately with a view to the necessary repair work being commenced at the earliest possible date.The first step in the works programme will involve the removal of the deck of the bridge which is in an unstable condition.  With the necessity to remove the deck the closure of the bridge is absolutely essential. For both practical operational reasons and for health and safety, the removal of the deck must take place when the river is at its lowest. Unfortunately this period happens to coincide with when the site is normally open to the public as part of the Heritage Sites of Ireland programme operated by the Office of Public Works.In this context an alternative access to allow the Cottage to remain open was examined. The only alternative access on the cottage side of the river is a private road which is in poor condition. While the Office of Public Works have a right of way over this road for works purposes this does not extend to public access.This roadway is not suitable for cars and there are no parking facilities in the area close to the Cottage. In addition this roadway would also provide the only access to the site for emergency services should they be required. The advice available suggests this roadway would not be suitable for an ambulance. The question of providing an alternative temporary bridge was also considered but given the extent of the work required on either side of the river bank in repairing the existing bridge, it is felt that this option is not feasible from a health and safety perspective.I am very hopeful that all of the necessary work to repair the bridge at the Swiss Cottage can be completed during the course of 2007. It is unfortunate that such a magnificent site will not be available to the public this year but the dangerous condition of the only public access to the site means that there is no other choice but to close it to the public. I should say that the period of its closure will be used by the Office of Public Works to bring forward its plans to re-thatch the building, work originally pencilled in for 2008, thereby minimising further possible disruption in the future.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	709	I wish to advise the Deputy that there are no grants or financial incentives available for adapting diesel cars in order that they can use biofuels.As the Deputy will be aware, I introduced a provision in the Finance Act of 2006 which enables the Revenue Commissioners to grant a 50% vehicle registration tax (VRT) relief on the registration of flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs) in the State. The purpose of this scheme is to encourage the development of new technology that is used in the manufacture of vehicles that use engines and fuel systems that are capable of running on E85-bioethanol (a combination of ethanol and petrol) which benefits the environment by producing lower pollutant emissions than conventional vehicles fuelled exclusively by petrol or diesel.This measure complements the significant excise relief scheme for Biofuels also provided for in Finance Act 2006.The Scheme will:provide for excise relief on up to 163 million litres of biofuels per annum;cost over €200m over 5 years;result in CO2 savings of over 250,000 tonnes per annum;contribute towards meeting a target of 5.75% transport fuel market penetration by biofuels by 2009;help reduce our dependency on conventional fossil fuels, andstimulate activity in the agricultural sector.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	710	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a direct swap of land, in the circumstances outlined, may have implications for taxation under three separate taxheads; namely capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax and stamp duty.  I will look at each in turn.Capital Gains Tax (CGT)The exchange of land is a chargeable occasion for both parties involved.  The disposal proceeds are taken as the market value, at the date of exchange, of the lands disposed of.  The CGT payable is calculated by reference to the difference between the disposal proceeds and the cost of the land exchanged after allowable adjustments for inflation and the costs of acquisition and disposal. The first €1,270 of an individual's annual gains is exempt. The balance is chargeable at 20%.Relief from CGT is available where an individual, aged 55 years or over, disposes of all or part of his/her "qualifying assets". For the purposes of this relief "qualifying assets" include lands which have been owned by the individual for a period of not less than 10 years ending on the date of the disposal and have been used by the individual for the purposes of farming throughout the 10-year period ending with the disposal.  The relief applies to considerations up to the value of €750,000 but where land is disposed of to a child, there is no limit to the relief.Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT)Whether gift tax arises when two farmers make a direct swap of land and where no money is exchanged depends on the circumstances. Gift tax would not arise where the lands being swapped are of equal value. If the lands were not, however, of equal value, gift tax would arise on the difference in value. The person swapping the more valuable land (the disponer) would be treated as making a gift of the difference in the values. The beneficiary of the gift would be entitled to their tax-free CAT Group threshold, which depends on their relationship to the disponer, when calculating any gift tax liability.  The indexed group thresholds applying to a gift or inheritance for 2007 are set out in the following table.GroupRelationship to DisponerGroup Threshold 2007€ASon/Daughter496,824BParent/Brother/Sister/Niece/Nephew/Grandchild49,682CRelations other than Group A or B24,841Any other gifts/inheritance that might have been received within the same group by an individual since 5 December 1991 are also taken into account when applying the thresholds for the purposes of calculating CAT.  If the total value of all inheritances and gifts received since this date is above the relevant threshold, then a 20% CAT will apply on the difference.Stamp DutyIn the case of an exchange of lands, stamp duty is payable on the basis of the value of the lands being exchanged.  There is a relief from stamp duty in section 81B of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 for an exchange of farm land between two farmers for the purposes of consolidating each farmer's holding. The section provides that stamp duty will not be charged on an exchange of land where the lands exchanged are of equal value. In a case where the lands exchanged are not of equal value, stamp duty will be charged on the amount of the difference in the values of the land concerned.The main conditions which must be satisfied before the relief will be granted are that there must be a valid consolidation certificate issued by Teagasc in existence at the date of the exchange of the lands and that the farmers involved in the exchange of the lands must spend not less than 50% of their normal working time farming and must farm the lands exchanged for a period of at least 5 years from the date of the exchange.  A clawback of the relief arises where the land or part of the land included in the exchange is disposed of or partly disposed of before the end of the 5 year holding period.The relief under section 81B is due to expire on 30 June 2007. However, the Finance Bill 2007, as passed in Committee, contains a new section 81C to be inserted in the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 which will, if enacted, allow a farmer to claim relief where the farmer sells land and purchases land in order to consolidate that farmer's holding and both the sale and purchase occur within 18 months of each other. The relief will apply provided Teagasc has issued the farmer with a consolidation certificate in respect of the sale and purchase.  Under the proposed new section 81C, each farmer involved in a direct swap of lands as outlined by the Deputy, would be entitled to claim the relief on the land transferred to him or her where, as a result of the transfer, the farmer's holding has been consolidated and a consolidation certificate has been issued by Teagasc in respect of the transfer.  For the relief to apply, similar conditions in relation to the farming of the lands transferred and the retention of such lands, as referred to above in relation to section 81B, must be satisfied.  I would point out that the introduction of the new stamp duty relief for farm consolidation is dependent on EU State aid approval.

However, High/Scope Ireland is represented on the National Childcare Co-ordinating Committee (NCCC) which, inter alia, is tasked with the development of a co-ordinated national approach to childcare provision and is under the auspices of the OMC.  The teaching/care methods and approaches used in each childcare service is determined by the individual childcare provider.High/Scope Ireland works as an advocate for children and families in both the North and South of Ireland through the dissemination of the High/Scope approach to education and human development.  Over the lifetime of the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP) 2000-2006, funding was allocated to some childcare facilities where the High/Scope approach is used.  In addition, a once off allocation of almost €178,000 was awarded in March 2001, to High/Scope in staffing grant assistance, under the EOCP 2000-2006, to facilitate High/Scope training for childcare providers.The Incredible Years Programme is a universal parent, teacher and child education programme designed to prevent and treat emotional and behavioural difficulties in children aged 3-10 years.  I understand that Clondalkin Area Partnership launched the Incredible Years Programme on a pilot basis in March 2003 and that since then, the Programme has been replicated by Galway City Partnership.  The Health Service Executive (HSE) provided supports for the implementation of the Programme in the Partnership areas and I am also informed that Atlantic Philanthropies provided funding towards this Programme.  Regarding the HSE supports provided towards the Incredible Years Programme, I have asked the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the HSE, to provide the details of these supports directly to the Deputy.

Staffing grants under the EOCP have been extended to 31 December 2007 for all groups who are meeting the terms of their existing staffing grant contracts. A new programme of staffing grants under the NCIP is expected to be announced in 2007 and will be informed by the outcome of a Value for Money Review of the EOCP which is currently in progress. The Review is expected to be completed in the first half of 2007 following which the procedures and criteria governing the new grant scheme will be made available both generally and to existing staffing grant recipients.Under the EOCP staffing grant programme, it is a condition of funding that groups approved funding must develop a fee structure to provide a range of fees to reflect the varied incomes of parents accessing the service and this condition is included in the terms of the contracts issued to grant recipients by Pobal, which is engaged to administer the grants on behalf of my Office. I understand from enquiries I have made that Pobal has issued no general directive to groups recently regarding fee structures. It is the case however that individual groups may have received reminders from Pobal from time to time regarding the need to meet contractual obligations or to provide updates regarding the development of an appropriate fee structure.

These initial guidelines will support the establishment of a standardised approach across the delivery system in the assessment of charges to apply in each individual case.Phase 2: to develop a more comprehensive set of guidelines in line with best practice, having considered legal opinion and its implications in relation to complex cases.  Provision will also need to be made for appeals.Phase 1 of the Group's work was completed on target by the 28th July 2005 and the guidelines issued to the system on the 2nd August 2005.Phase 2 which was completed in June 2006, developed new National Guidelines which addressed the complex areas of community residences and related issues.The guidelines which were developed, support a standardised approach to the implementation of Health (Charges for In-Patient) Regulations 2005 and take account of the persons residing in community residences. The system was instructed to implement the guidelines with effect from 1st August 2006 with retrospection back to 14th July 2005 where charges had not been raised while awaiting the guidelines.  Clients in community residences were informed in July 2005 that they may be liable for charges under the new regulations.In regard to retrospection, charges were to be raised with effect from the 1st August 2006 based on the financial assessment for each of the clients.  Arrears of charges due from 14th July 2005 were to be calculated and advised to the client.  The clients were to be given the following options:1. Pay the arrears in full or in instalments2. Deduct the arrears from any moneys due under the repayment scheme where applicable.A Working Group on Rents and Charges in HSE Mental Health Services was established in December 2006.  The purpose of this Working Group is to develop and recommend a process for the collection of rents and charges in accordance with the statutory provisions outlined in Section 43 (2) (a) of the Health Act 1970 was amended by the Health (Amendment) Act 2005, Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005 S.I No 276 of 2005 specific to mental health services, that safeguards both the individual and the staff member and complies with financial probity and HSE governance requirements.A specific recommendation has been made by the group:Individuals who were in receipt of in-patient services (those persons with an intellectual, physical or mental disability, residing in community type residences where nursing or mental disability, residing in community type residence where nursing or medical care is provided) outlined in Section 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 above, from the commencement date of 14th July 2005 and any residents admitted after this date should immediately be assessed for charges (this is for instances where this has not already occurred due to lack of clarity on assessment procedures).  This assessment should be backdated to 14th July 2005 as residents were made aware of their potential liability for charges at the time.In cases where the residents do not have the ability to pay these charges in a lump sum, arrangements should be put in place whereby the amount due can be reclaimed by instalments at a nominal amount per week or deducted from monies claimed under the Repayment Scheme.  Where payment is being made in instalments, the nominated officer should ensure that the additional amount agreed to on a weekly basis does not result in the resident being left a personal allowance of under €35/€55 per week.To date the National Rents & Charges has met on four occasions and I understand a draft report with specific recommendations will be presented in the near future.

Before the establishment of the HSE the nature of the arrangements for chiropody and the level of service provided was a matter for individual health boards and so a degree of variation in practice developed over time.  Priority is usually given to certain groups of people, including people who are medical card holders aged 65 years and over.  In several regions the service is provided by private chiropodists by arrangement with the HSE.My Department is currently preparing legislation to clarify and update existing legislation on eligibility for health and personal social services.  The Bill will define specific health and personal services more clearly; define who should be eligible for what services; set out clear criteria for eligibility; establish when and in what circumstances charges may be made and provide for an appeals framework.As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for Primary Care services, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular matter raised by the Deputy.

This is reflected in the funding committed to services for older people in Budgets 2006 and 2007.  Last year, the Government funded the largest ever expansion in services for older people with a full year cost of €150m.  This year a full year package of €255m has been allocated for services for older people.  This gives a total of over €400m added to services for older people over two years.Government policy in relation to older people is to support people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and, where this is not possible, to support access to quality long-term residential care.  This policy approach is renewed and developed in the latest partnership agreement, Towards 2016.Among the areas where funding has been provided are day care and respite care which are an integral part of delivering a comprehensive community service for older people. Day care and respite care offer respite for family members and/or carers and provide social stimulation in a safe environment for older people with mild forms of dementia. The provision of an additional €9 million in 2006 allowed for 1,325 additional places per week in these centres together with additional programmes for specific needs such as activity therapy. It also means that many day care centres can increase the number of days per week they open. Additional funding of €3.5 million provided in Budget 2007 will cater for a further 1,100 day places per week in day care centres.Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services was assigned to the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.

In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card.  The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, child-care and travel to work costs.  In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards.  These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	740	As I mentioned in my closing statement at the Second Stage Debate in the Dáil on the Medical Practitioners Bill on 23rd February, the Medical Council is a public body established by statute.  It must inspire public confidence and this is greatest where there is a lay majority.  It is a question of reassuring patients and the public that the body that oversees the regulation of doctors is, above all else, concerned with the public interest and is not involved in the regulation of the profession by the profession.Systems of medical regulation are administered in differing ways throughout the EU.  In some Member States, regulation is undertaken in different regions by different authorities.  In others, professional bodies hold some responsibility and in others still, Government Ministries are responsible.  Member States differ in the way they undertake registration and fitness to practise functions.  In some, the fitness to practise, or disciplinary function is undertaken by a completely separate authority to that which registers doctors.It is therefore not possible to directly compare all EU Member States, as many do not have a Medical Council which undertakes a similar role to the functions assigned to the Medical Council in Ireland.The UK's General Medical Council is the authority which is most easily comparable to our own Medical Council.  At the present time, it has 40% lay representation on its Council.  However, I referred in my closing statement to a White Paper which was published last week in the United Kingdom by the Secretary of State for Health and the Chief Medical Officer.  The White Paper is entitled "Trust Assurance and Safety — The Regulation of Health Professionals in the 21st Century" and sets out the Government's plans to reform professional regulation.  The White Paper proposes that councils that regulate health professionals should have, as a minimum, parity of membership between lay and professional members, to ensure that purely professional concerns are not thought to dominate their work.

This includes responsibility for ensuring that arrangements are in place to ensure appropriate service delivery for General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme (medical card and GP visit card) patients.A person does not need to obtain a general practitioner's signature in order to apply for a medical card or GP visit card.  I understand that, where a patient is not successful in locating a GP who is in a position to accept additional patients on his/her GMS panel, the HSE will arrange to assign the patient to a GP in the area who holds a contract with the HSE.  Such assignments are reviewed by the HSE after a six-month period, where the GP so requests.

It specifies that non-consultant hospital doctors' (NCHDs') working hours should be reduced to a maximum of, on average, 48 hours per week from 2009.  In addition there are also provisions for minimum daily and weekly rest periods and for compensatory rest periods.In order to achieve compliance with the Directive the Task Force on Medical Staffing made a series of important recommendations including the changes required in NCHD work patterns; the need for a significant increase in the number of consultants; the need for a revised contract for medical consultants; reform of medical education and training; and the reorganisation of acute hospital services.Health Service employers have established a number of pilot groups — local implementation groups (LIGs) — throughout the country.  These groups include representatives from management, medical grades, nursing grades, the social care professions and the training bodies.  These pilot groups will examine local issues and develop plans for EWTD compliance.A National EWTD Implementation Group (NIG), chaired by Dr. Cillian Twomey, has been established to give guidance to the LIGs.  A Nursing and Midwifery Expert Group has also been established to interface with the NIG on the implications for nurses of any changes proposed.The LIGs have presented proposals to the NIG on options for the reduction of NCHD hours.  So far 16 pilots have begun and a further 3 have been formally approved.  When the work of these pilot sites is complete, by the end of this year, the outcomes will be evaluated by the NIG with a view to the broader application of similar arrangements.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	772	In August and September 2006 the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) undertook a public consultation on the DG Sanco discussion paper on the setting of maximum amounts for vitamins and minerals in foodstuffs. An Irish response which took account of stakeholder comments and of scientific input from the FSAI was forwarded to DG Sanco in November 2006.The FSAI input, in summary, advised the following positions which are included within the Irish response:setting maximum levels for as many vitamins and minerals as possible to enable protection of consumers against unknown effects of excessive consumption of nutrients — particularly among those who may be exposed to excessive intake levels over a long period of time.setting maximum limits at relatively high values where evidence of safe use exists: however, it was stressed that such evidence should be based on the highest level of scientific evidence.  Furthermore, this evidence should take account of sub-groups of the population who may be more vulnerable to adverse effects of over-consumption e.g. pregnant women and children.maximum levels, in the case of food supplements, should be set at the optimal intake levels based on Recommended Daily Allowances (RDA) or Reference Nutrient Intake (RNI covering 97% of the population).The FSAI advised there is no benefit in exceeding the optimal intake of nutrients: however, as mentioned above, there may be risk associated with long-term excessive intakes of some nutrients.  The FSAI has since reiterated this advice based on a report published in last month's issue of the Journal of the Medical Association where higher mortality rates were found in individuals consuming high intakes of antioxidant nutrients provided as supplements.  The doses of nutrients individuals were exposed to in this study were all above the levels commonly found in a balanced diet.It will be appreciated that the Irish position was developed having regard to the need to ensure a high level of consumer protection — which is my priority and which is the basis of current food legislation.

Products are considered for reimbursement on application by a supplier.Quinine is not currently reimbursable through the state schemes.  Any application by a supplier to have Quinine included on the common list will be considered in the usual way.The retail price of products approved for reimbursement under the community drugs schemes comprises the ingredient cost of the medicine, the retail mark-up on the ingredient cost (normally 50%), a standard dispensing fee and VAT where applicable.

The NCIP is an essential part of the broader National Childcare Strategy 2006-2010, also under my remit, which aims to further develop the childcare infrastructure to meet the needs of children and their parents for quality early childhood care. Other measures under the Strategy include improved Maternity and Adoptive Leave, the new Early Childcare Supplement and a new programme of educational opportunities for children and adults in areas of disadvantage.Under the NCIP, some €575 million has been allocated over 5 years, with a target to create 50,000 additional childcare places and with a greater focus on pre-school places for 3 to 4 year olds and school age childcare. Applications under the NCIP began being processed in April 2006. To date, 1190 places have been created under the programme and €2.7m has been reported as drawn down by grant recipients.While the present programme's predecessor, the EOCP, is no longer accepting new applications, funding allocated to the creation of childcare facilities under the EOCP continues to be drawn down. At end of December 2006, some 34,000 childcare places had been created under the EOCP and an additional 25,000 existing places were funded.  On the basis of approvals made under the Programme, it is estimated that a further 6,000 places will be created by the Programme, making the final total for new places created some 40,000.

The NCIP is an essential part of the broader National Childcare Strategy 2006-2010, also under my remit, which aims to further develop the childcare infrastructure to meet the needs of children and their parents for quality early childhood care. Other measures under the Strategy include improved Maternity and Adoptive Leave, the new Early Childcare Supplement and a new programme of educational opportunities for children and adults in areas of disadvantage.Under the NCIP, some €575 million has been allocated over 5 years, with a target to create 50,000 additional childcare places and with a greater focus on pre-school places for 3 to 4 year olds and school age childcare. Applications under the NCIP began being processed in April 2006. In relation to disadvantaged areas, 100 new childcare places have been created in CLÁR areas and 374 new childcare have been created in RAPID areas, representing almost 40% of all places created under the new Programme to date. The information sought by the Deputy concerning the allocation of NCIP funds to RAPID and CLÁR areas is currently being compiled and will be conveyed to the Deputy in due course.While the present programme's predecessor, the EOCP, is no longer accepting new applications, the funding committed to date under the EOCP includes the provision of almost €108.2 million towards childcare services operating in RAPID/ CLÁR areas specially designated for urban/rural regeneration.  In excess of 20% of beneficiaries under the Programme are now from designated RAPID and approximately 11% are from CLAR designated areas.  A total of 9,552 new childcare places, of which 3,549 are full time and 6,003 are part time, were created in RAPID/CLAR designated areas to end June 2006.  In addition 164 new facilities were built and 531 facilities upgraded in designated areas over the same period.  There are 1,163 childcare staff receiving support, of which 492 are full time and 671 are part time, under the Programme in services located RAPID/ CLÁR designated areas.

The group will monitor and assess progress on the implementation of all the recommendations including those which fall under the responsibility of the HSE, government departments and other relevant agencies. The Group is to submit its first annual report before mid 2007.Implementation of the individual recommendations of "A Vision for Change" is a matter primarily for the HSE.  The HSE established an implementation group in July 2006 to ensure that mental health services develop in a synchronised and consistent manner across the country and to guide and resource service managers and clinicians in making the recommendations in "A Vision for Change" a reality.  Both of these groups will play an important role in ensuring that the recommendations are implemented in a co-ordinated and timely manner.I have been informed by the HSE that they plan to publish a Progress Report and outline the proposed implementation programme over the life of "A Vision for Change" in the near future.In 2006, a sum of €26.2 million was provided for the development of our mental health services in line with "A Vision for Change".  A further sum of €25 million has been allocated for 2007. Developments in 2007 will include eight new child and adolescent mental health teams, up to 36 new in-patient beds for children and adolescents, specialist mental health services for older people, the homeless, persons with an intellectual disability and persons with an eating disorder, suicide prevention initiatives including a national positive mental health awareness programme and enhanced services and additional places at the Central Mental Hospital.

Four levels of action comprise the main body of the Strategy i.e. — general population approach; targeted approach; responding to suicide; and information research.There are just over 90 action points in Reach Out, and they are divided into 3 phases for implementation. Phase 1 covers 30 actions which are to be implemented over the next 3 years.Following the launch of the Strategy, the Health Service Executive (HSE) established the National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) to oversee the implementation of the Strategy and to coordinate suicide prevention activities across the State, consult widely in relation to the planning of future initiatives and ensure best practice in suicide prevention.In 2006, an additional €1.2 million was allocated to the Health Service Executive specifically for suicide prevention initiatives and research. A further €1.85 million was allocated in 2007 to develop and implement national training programmes and to complete the availability of self harm services through A&E Departments.  The funding will also be used to implement a national positive mental health awareness programme through the National Office for Suicide Prevention.Overall spending on mental health services in 2006 amounted to €984m.  This included an additional €26.2 million development funding which was allocated to the HSE for the further development of our mental health services in line with "A Vision for Change", the report of the expert group on mental health policy.   A further sum of €25 million has been allocated in 2007 to continue this development.The future funding for suicide prevention initiatives will be considered in the context of the estimates process in 2008 and beyond.

These are potentially life saving devices but, as with all implantable devices, they carry a degree of risk. The assessment of the risk against the benefits is made by the clinician or consultant responsible for the particular patient.The Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is the statutory body responsible for the regulation of medicinal products and medical devices in Ireland.  The IMB, in consultation with its European counterparts, has continuously monitored the safety of these products. At present, the European competent authorities are satisfied that the products are safe provided they are used correctly, in accordance with the manufacturers instructions and in line with the medical condition of the patient.The number of Irish patients who have undergone the procedure is not available and information given to patients on risks associated with the use of stents is a matter for their medical practitioner or consultant.The IMB and its European counterparts will continue to monitor the safety of drug coated stents licensed for use in Ireland; it will evaluate all new scientific data that emerge and will take any regulatory action necessary.

There was no specific training budget required.A specification entitled "Assessor Training Programmes for: Building Energy Rating (BER) of New Dwellings" was published by SEI in October 2006. This document is downloadable from www.sei.ie/epbd (training link).BER training may be provided by any training provider that successfully meets all elements of the BER training specification which includes the requirement that BER training programmes must be validated by a national accreditation body e.g. Further Education and Training Awards Council (FETAC) or Higher Education and Training Awards Council (FETAC).To date the following three training providers have developed training programmes that meet this training specification. These are:Cork Institute of Technology (CIT)Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT)Galway Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT).All three providers are now in a position to offer validated training programmes. The details of each programme including start dates and prequalification requirements can be accessed from SEI's website.

The Bass (Conservation of Stocks) Regulations 2006, which replaced the 1990 Bass (Conservation of Stocks) Order, and which prohibit the commercial fishing of sea bass by Irish sea fishing boats;2. The Bass (Restriction on Sale) Order, which prohibits the sale or offer for sale of bass (other than bass which has been imported into the State) from 1st day of July of each year to 30th day of June the next year;3. The Bass Fishing Conservation By Law, which imposes a bag limit on anglers — currently two bass in any one period of twenty four hours, and provides for a ban on angling for bass during the spawning season, usually 15th May to 15th June each year.The domestic conservation measures for sea bass are kept under review on an annual basis, in light of scientific assessments of the state of sea bass stocks by the Central Fisheries Board and the Marine Institute, as well as assessments of the impact of commercial fishing effort on sea bass stocks by other Member States.Before the expiry of the current provisions I will be seeking the relevant advice on the current state of the Bass stock and I will make a decision on the matter on the basis of that advice.

I have no function in the matter of the enabling of exchanges owned by private companies.However, it has been clear for some time that the sector has failed to invest at the level necessary to keep pace with the demand for broadband. My Department's regional broadband programme is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high-speed open access broadband networks, in association with the local and regional authorities, in the major towns and cities including the towns of Castleisland, Dingle, Kenmare, Killarney, Listowel and Tralee in Kerry.Furthermore, I am aware that, despite Government and private investment in broadband, there are areas of the country where the private sector is unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity. Accordingly, I have announced a new scheme, which will aim to provide a broadband service to these areas. This scheme will be confined to areas of the country that are not yet served by any broadband service provider, currently thought to be 10-15% of the population. This scheme will, when it is fully rolled out, ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband from houses and premises in these unserved areas are met. A Steering Group comprising representatives of my Department and ComReg is currently considering all elements of the proposed scheme and work on the design of an appropriate tender is under way.

On foot of the Government decision, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has been requested to proceed with a competition to select a developer to secure the design and construction of this interconnector by 2012 at the latest. The delivery of the project effectively and to the most aggressive timetable achievable, will be key considerations, together with price.Current cost estimates for the construction of the interconnector and the associated reinforcements of the land system are tentative both in terms of the associated incremental reinforcement works to the grids on both sides of the Irish Sea as well as those exclusively related to the interconnector. It will be only at or near the contract procurement stage that more concrete cost figures will emerge both in relation to capital costs and subsequent operational costs. Providing cost estimates at this stage would be premature as this could prejudice the competitive process.

The subject homes are identified by CBOs, often in consultation with other community welfare agencies.A typical house in receipt of energy efficiency measures under the Warmer Homes Scheme might be experiencing heat losses in one or more of the following areas:Roof: up to 20% of heat lost from a home is lost through the roof.Walls: as much as 25% of the heat lost from a house can be lost through the walls.Draughts: badly fitting windows and external doors can account for more than one-sixth of heat loss.Possible remedies to the above heat losses are provided by the CBOs through the installation of substantial measures including attic insulation, cavity wall insulation (in some areas, and where technically appropriate) and draught proofing of external windows and doors. The CBOs also implement lesser measures including the provision CFL bulbs and lagging jackets to each home addressed.The measures are installed based on the particular needs and construction of the individual house. A typical house in receipt of these measures is estimated to experience a energy savings of approximately 20% in energy costs. Houses that receive all measures will experience substantially higher energy savings of approximately 40%.SEI is currently involved in a project with a range of Government Departments and agencies, investigating the impact of energy efficiency improvements in low income households from the perspective of health, comfort, cost, environment and quality of life.There is no minimum standard of energy efficiency which must be achieved to be eligible for funding under the Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS). Funding is provided to the CBOs and the work undertaken based on their technical assessment of the needs of the individual house. Measures are installed based on the particular needs and construction of the individual house.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	806	The recently published Energy Policy Green Paper "Towards a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland" underlines the Government's commitment to deliver enhanced interconnection on the island of Ireland as well as with Britain, as a priority. This is also the way forward envisaged at European level.Since the Government decision of July 2006, which approved plans for the construction of a single 500 megawatt electricity interconnector between Ireland and Great Britain, work on the project has been progressing steadily. On foot of the Government decision, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has been requested to proceed with a competition to select a developer to secure the design and construction of this interconnector by 2012 at the latest.The CER has also been requested to arrange for EirGrid and ESB to expedite the technical work of route selection and necessary grid reinforcement works. The Government decision provides that the interconnector when completed will, as a key strategic asset, remain in public ownership and will be owned by EirGrid.While work is advancing rapidly on the route selection and technical specification of the interconnector, the CER is also finalising the competition structure, working on the associated competition documentation and related contractual arrangements with the aim of going to market as soon as possible.To underpin the development process, new arrangements have been put in place in respect of the construction and operation of future interconnectors in the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006. The Act provides that the CER may, with Ministerial consent, secure the construction of an interconnector by one or more means, including by competitive tender. Such consent will be contingent on final Government approval.In addition to this East/West interconnector, the Government, working together with the Northern Ireland authorities, will continue to progress electricity interconnection initiatives in the context of the All-Island Energy Market. In this regard, the two transmission system operators, Northern Ireland Electricity and EirGrid, are planning a second North-South electricity interconnector which will more than double the existing cross-border electricity transfer capacity to over 600MW with an expected completion date of 2012 at the latest.While it is too early to say precisely when these projects will be completed, the CER and EirGrid are committed to providing the new interconnections by the timeline the Government has set. In this regard, the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure Act) 2006, which provides for a streamlined planning process for strategic infrastructure developments, includes special provisions designed to expedite the planning process for electricity interconnector projects.

Payments from the hardship fund can only be made to licence holders. The scheme is available to all those who held a commercial salmon licence in 2006. The arrangements under which nominees may have fished on behalf of licence holders in the past are personal to those concerned and cannot be accommodated.Details of the scheme are available from BIM and the Regional Fisheries Boards who are jointly administering the scheme.

Self-regulation by the industry is preferable to statutory intervention.RegTel does not report to me as Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.The area of consumer protection within which RegTel operates falls mainly under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs. In addition, the Data Protection Commissioner has strong investigatory and prosecution powers with regard to unsolicited electronic communications.

ComReg is independent in the exercise of its functions.The Deputy will be aware that the Communications Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2007 which is currently before this House, will strengthen ComReg's enforcement powers so that it can better achieve one of its primary functions, which is the promotion of competition. A competitive electronic communications market offers benefits to consumers in terms of attractive and transparent pricing, a wide range of choice in terms of services and suppliers and high quality services and products.

Our Ambassador in Washington is extremely active, on an ongoing basis, in highlighting our concerns, as are officials of our Consulates across the United States. We, of course, maintain very close contact with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, which we are very happy to support financially.The present position is that Senator Kennedy and Senator McCain are expected to publish a new bill very shortly. This will revise and update their previous bill which lapsed with the end of the old Congress at the start of 2007 and, if enacted, would enable the vast majority of undocumented Irish to regularise their status. While the tabling of proposals will represent a most welcome development, securing majority support on this sensitive issue in both Houses of Congress remains a formidable challenge.The coming St. Patrick's Day period will provide the Taoiseach and myself with a particularly valuable and timely opportunity to convey again our strong views to key players in the Administration and on Capitol Hill, including President Bush. Our efforts in this regard will have the highest priority during our visit.I look forward to a further intensification of the Government's efforts on behalf of the undocumented in the critical period ahead.

My Department had no direct role in this proposal. The purpose of these meetings was to secure high level access in the UN system for the promoters of the project, and to address issues relating to the negative response of UNDPI to a feasibility study undertaken by the promoters.Subsequently, in May 2005, our Permanent Representative to the United Nations was advised by the promoters of the initiative that issues relating to the establishment of the channel were still unresolved. We have had no further contact from the promoters, or from UNDPI.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	818	I understand that the current estimate of Irish retail grocery sales held by multinational retailers is approximately 31.5%.  These retailers provide opportunities for Irish producers to supply not just Irish stores but also their overseas outlets.  This, of course, contributes to the growth of Irish food and drink exports.The largest foreign retail operator in Ireland contributes significantly to the Irish economy and to Irish food producers with its annual purchases.  This operator purchases approximately €1.5 billion worth of goods from Irish companies each year.Overall, the Irish retail grocery sector is worth over €7.5 billion and is growing at a rate of 5% each year.  The trend for Irish food processors is positive particularly as more recent chain store entrants to the Irish market are now increasing their take up of Irish produced foodstuffs.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	819	The Forfás Annual Employment Survey is the indicator used to record jobs gained in Enterprise Agency assisted companies (Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Shannon Development) in any one year. The survey collates data on employment at county level. The following tabular statements show the number of new full time jobs created in Enterprise Agency assisted companies over the period 1997 to 2006.  This data indicate that almost 295,000 new permanent full time jobs were created over the period. In addition over the same period the 35 County Enterprise Boards have assisted in the creation of 23,560 new jobs throughout the country.Jobs in client firms of the enterprise support agencies, however, is just one component of national employment. Latest data from the Central Statistics Office (Quarterly National Household Survey) show that in the period between Quarter 2 1998 and Quarter 2 2006 employment across the economy expanded from 1.494 million to 2.017 million — an increase of 523,000.One of my Department's main tasks is to ensure that Ireland remains an attractive place to do business, and to support the development of economic competencies higher up the value chain. In that regard, we continue to work to maintain and enhance our framework competitive conditions, including our general taxation package which incentivises both the wealth creating business community and those in, and preparing to enter the labour force. We are also working to promote new areas of competitive advantage, by for example developing our R&D base through the Strategy for Science Technology and Innovation.The enterprise agencies also aim to support sustainable, high value added enterprise in Ireland through the provision of mentoring and developmental supports, the enhancement of management capabilities and critical workforce skills in client companies, support for the creation and implementation of strategies for market entry, development and growth, and strong supports for innovation and for research and development. Furthermore, we are continuing to pursue policies to promote lifelong learning and up-skilling to improve labour market flexibility and, where necessary, ensure that appropriate training supports are provided for workers in sectors that are no longer competitive, and who may need to find alternative employment.1997199819992000200120022003200420052006Total

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	820	IDA Ireland is the statutory agency charged with the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to this country.  The agency has four offices in the United States — New York, Atlanta, Chicago and California, through which it continuously markets this country to potential investors for either first time or expansionary investment.In the past 12 months I have visited the United States four times in support of IDA Ireland's marketing campaign.  During 2006, I went to the West Coast in February, to New York in July, and to the Mid West in November.  Last month, I again visited New York.These visits involved meeting Chairs, CEOs and other senior executives of key companies in Pharmaceuticals, Medical Technologies, Information & Communications Technology and other leading sectors that IDA Ireland are targeting for new or expansion projects.Many of the companies visited already have substantial and valuable activities in Ireland while others are considering major investments here for the first time.The meetings confirmed the high standing in which Ireland is viewed as a business location by leading global companies and the importance of the steps being taken by Government to strengthen research, education capabilities and infrastructure, while retaining the flexibility and responsiveness of Ireland's operating environment and tax regime.At present there are 95,515 permanent jobs in US companies in Ireland.  Details of the number of new jobs created in U.S. companies in Ireland in each of the past 10 years are set out in the following tabular statement.Year1997199819992000200120022003200420052006Number of Permanent Jobs10,93010,77012,46817,2478,3527,1847,0737,5938,3758,313
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	821	The National Spatial Strategy (NSS) and the National development Plan (NDP) 2007-2013 are the principal mechanisms in place to facilitate and encourage regional development. Overall responsibility for the NSS rests with my colleague Mr. Dick Roche T.D. Minister for the Environment and Local Government and overall responsibility for the NDP rests with my colleague Mr. Brian Cowen T.D. Minister for Finance.In so far as the industrial development agencies under the aegis of my Department are concerned, their strategies are closely aligned with the NSS and they are actively working with a wide range of players at both county and regional levels to maximise the attractiveness of regional locations for new investment.  While Enterprise Ireland's role in encouraging and facilitating indigenous industry is demand-lead, IDA Ireland has a marketing role in relation to attracting foreign direct investment (FDI).   Shannon Development is responsible for regional economic development in the Mid-West region.Balanced regional development has been a major policy issue for Government for many years.  The objective of IDA's regional strategy has at all times been to facilitate the implementation of the goals and objectives of Government in this area.  The Agency's regional plans take account of the locational behaviour and requirements of the next generation of FDI projects, infrastructure capacities, the importance of building critical mass, and leveraging the advantages of existing sectoral clusters.  IDA Ireland's main focus will be to attract projects which, while they may be located close to larger urban areas e.g. the Gateways and Hubs, will make a positive contribution to the development of the surrounding rural communities.IDA has significantly raised the potential for regions to prosper by implementing a national programme of investment in the vital infrastructure of business park development and the provision of sites for major projects. The Agency has made significant investment in the development of strategic utility-intensive sites in Waterford, Cork, Galway and Louth. It is proposed that this initiative will be rolled out further under the new NDP.  The success of the Agency's strategy is evidenced, for example, by the fact that in 2006 alone there were 89 new investment projects, including 46 R&D investments, located outside of Dublin.IDA Ireland policy with regard to regional development and the management of its property programme has evolved over decades in response to the changing market demands of FDI.  In the 1970's the prevailing view was that advance factories should be available in a wide variety of locations throughout the country whereas the current approach involves closer alignment with the NSS.  The challenge for the Agency is to build on Ireland's reputation globally as a location for advanced manufacturing, sophisticated business services and, increasingly, for leading research and innovation.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	822	A more meaningful reflection of spending on research and development in the business sector (BERD) is arrived at by using expenditure comparisons to GNP rather than GDP.BERD expenditure in Ireland rose from €124 million in 1987 (0.52% of GNP) to €612 million in 1997 (1.03% of GNP). Latest data show that estimated BERD rose to €1,560 million in 2006 (1.05% of GNP), which represents a doubling in percentage terms of GNP on the 1987 figure. The recently published Government Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation 2006-2013 (SSTI) sets a target to grow BERD to €2.5 billion by 2013.Increased investment in Science, Technology and Innovation (STI), and in particular research and development (R&D), is a vital part of Ireland's plan to become a more knowledge-driven economy. Increasing international competition is creating pressure for improvements in efficiency, quality and productivity and a growing need to innovate. These pressures will increase and intensify. Increased and continuing investments in STI/R&D activities will be crucial to maintaining future economic stability, improving Ireland's competitive position on the international stage through higher productivity, and sustaining high levels of future employment.Over the lifetime of the current NDP 2007-2013, the State will invest €6.1 billion in STI, of which Enterprise STI will account for €1.29 billion. The SSTI, which is a principal pillar of the NDP, sets out a vision of an Ireland in 2013 being internationally renowned for the excellence of its research and at the forefront in generating and using new knowledge for economic and social progress, within an innovation driven culture. Increased investment in STI, and in particular R&D, will enable Ireland to better compete internationally in the face of ever increasing globalisation and greater demand for customised products and services.Developing new and better products and processes will be the drivers of future success for enterprise. R&D activity will help ensure high-value, knowledge intensive activities that will support high-value added jobs and prosperity in the future. Companies must undertake high quality, sophisticated R&D in order to internationalise into new markets efficiently and quickly. Enhanced R&D capacity is also essential to reinvigorating Ireland's attractiveness for Foreign Direct Investment.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	824	The thirty-five County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) were established in 1993 to provide support to small businesses with 10 employees or fewer.  Their function is to develop indigenous enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity at local level.  The CEBs support individuals, firms, community groups, provided that the projects have the capacity to achieve commercial viability. Priority must be given to manufacturing and internationally traded services companies which could develop into strong export entities.As of 31st December, 2006 there were 146 posts within the CEB network comprising of 141 full-time and 10 part-time employees working within the County and City (CEB) network.  Full details in respect of each Board are attached at Appendix 1.  I expect staffing levels in 2007 to remain at about this level.In 2007, a total of €31.856 million has been allocated to fund the thirty-five County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs). An additional €4m is also being made available in 2007 by way of capital carryover from 2006.  As my Department is currently in the process of finalising the individual 2007 budget allocations for each Board I am not in a position to furnish the Deputy with individualized budgets for each CEB.  However, I am satisfied that the funding will be sufficient to enable the CEBs to carry out their activities.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	827	I propose to take Questions Nos. 359 and 360 together.As a Member State of the European Union, Ireland is part of a wider EU labour market of some 200 million workers, including workers from the ten new Accession States who were admitted to the Irish labour market without restrictions on 1st May, 2004. Employers are therefore free to advertise in and recruit from within any part of the European Union. There is no obligation to advertise within a specific part of the European Union.I would point out that FÁS Employment Services provide a wide range of services and supports for Irish workers. These include career advice and guidance and information on job and training opportunities. FÁS Employment Services also provide information on suitable vacancies which may be available locally.I would also mention that under the principle of "Community Preference", firms must advertise all job vacancies throughout the EU to ascertain whether a suitable candidate can be obtained within the European Economic Area, before offering them to a third country national from outside this Area.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	828	It has been a key strategic objective for Enterprise Ireland (EI), since the agency was established in 1998, to bring all Dublin based staff, currently spread over four separate buildings across the city, together in one location.Having explored a number of possible solutions, the Board of Enterprise Ireland decided that the single site office solution offered in the East Point Business Park was the most appropriate from a number of perspectives, including value for money and flexibility.  In September of 2006, following the Board decision, Enterprise Ireland signed a lease on two units in East Point.  Enterprise Ireland will vacate the Glasnevin Site in the early part of 2008.Enterprise Ireland is currently establishing its National Regional Development Headquarters as well as the County Enterprise Support Unit in Shannon. In addition, the functions hitherto carried out by Shannon Development in relation to the development of indigenous industry in the Mid-West Region were transferred to EI with effect from 1 January 2007.  This transfer of function also involves the transfer of posts from Shannon Development to EI.  The necessary arrangements to give effect to these changes are in train and will be completed over the coming months.EI recently appointed a senior manager as Head of Regions and Entrepreneurship who will guide the transition and establishment of EI presence in the Mid-West Region. The CEO of EI, Mr Frank Ryan announced this appointment recently during a visit to the Region by the CEO and members of Enterprise Ireland's senior management team.EI is currently sourcing a building in Shannon Town to accommodate the new functions being located in the Region and the staff transferring from Shannon Development. A number of options are under consideration and it is expected that a decision will be made by the end of March.Progress on the full transfer of EI's HQ to Shannon, within the Government decentralisation programme, will be influenced by factors such as, the level of interest in the Shannon location expressed by CAF applicants and by progress made during discussions at a central level with regard to decentralisation.

The Revenue Commissioners as part of their function of collecting VAT returns also verify that the returns made by retailers accord with the provisions of the relevant tax code.It may be that the Deputy is concerned that some retailers might use the opportunity of the reduction in VAT to profiteer by increasing the price of goods to consumers. In such circumstances, I would strongly urge consumers to use the power of their own pockets by only giving their business to retailers who they are satisfied offer value for money.With regard to car booster seats, I understand that the reduction in VAT on these products brought about by the budget will take effect from 1st May. Consumers purchasing these products after that date may wish to query retailers as to whether the reductions in VAT have been passed on before satisfying themselves that the price being charged for the product represents a fair deal.I have brought the matter to the attention of the Director of Consumer Affairs and the National Consumer Agency and have asked them to consider whether they might play a role in this matter.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	834	I propose to take Questions Nos. 368 and 377 together.The following tabular statement sets out the position in relation to full time permanent jobs in manufacturing in  Enterprise Agency (Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland) assisted firms in Co. Kildare in the past eight years. In that period 8,112 new permanent jobs were created in manufacturing, while job losses amounted to 5,169 giving a net increase over the period of 2,943 permanent jobs. The total number of permanent manufacturing jobs in Co. Kildare in firms assisted by the Enterprise Agencies stood at 14,690 at end 2006.Today we have a predominantly modern manufacturing base which competes internationally in a range of growth sectors More attractive cost environments abroad will inevitably entice some firms to relocate. However where relocation has occurred to date, it has largely been confined to relatively low technology, labour-intensive activities. In the case of Co. Kildare over the past eight years there has been a net increase in permanent employment of 3,254 in all enterprise agency assisted firms.The enterprise development agencies are committed to promoting Kildare as a location for investment, as well as supporting and developing businesses already present in the county. Over the past 5 years, IDA Ireland's focused strategy for Kildare has been to promote the County as part of an integrated East Region, with access to a population base of 1.5 million people. IDA Ireland's strategy for County Kildare is to:Progress the development of a knowledge economy;Encourage increased co-operation between foreign direct investment companies and third level institutions in the county;Work with the existing client base in the county to expand its presence;Provide modern property solutions with supporting infrastructure;Work with Local Authorities and relevant infrastructure providers to influence the delivery of appropriate infrastructure to the county.To support this strategy, IDA Ireland is working closely with educational institutions in the County, to develop the skill sets necessary to attract high value added employment to the county. IDA Ireland is also working with FÁS to provide guidance in developing the skill sets needed by those already in the workforce who are interested in upskilling. Kildare has in recent years attracted some world class manufacturing companies such as Intel, Braun Oral B and Hewlett Packard. IDA Ireland is also working to attract the International Services, Software, Financial Services and Pharmaceuticals sectors.In terms of job creation, Enterprise Ireland activity is focussed on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs in manufacturing and internationally traded services companies who are setting up new High Potential Start-Up Companies, the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and in enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional levels through supporting research in companies and third level institutions. Since the beginning of 2003, EI has approved over €12m in support to companies in Kildare to help them grow their sales and exports and improve innovation and new product development in order that they can compete on world markets.New companies — now leaders in the consumer products market — have been established and have created new employment. The consumer foods sector in particular, has shown rapid growth over the last number of years, reflecting significant changes in eating habits and an increase in demand for convenience foods.  In the last two years we have seen significant investment by Green Isle Foods  and Dawn Farm Foods Ltd, both supported by Enterprise Ireland, leading to significant employment increase in both of these state of the art facilities.19992000200120022003200420052006TotalJob Gains1,0602,1436088828431,0207737838,112Job Losses-893-277-951-499-747-733-382-687-5,169Net1671,866-34338396287391962,943
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	835	I propose to take Questions Nos. 371 and 372 together.Since the abolition of the Groceries Order almost 12 months ago, I have regularly reviewed the Consumer Price Index, which is published monthly by the Central Statistics Office.  The CPI includes statistics on items previously covered and not covered by the Groceries Order.  Despite the implication in the question, I never predicted that price reductions would result from the removal of the Order nor did I predict any period of time over which such reductions might be expected to occur.  I am on record as saying that I expected prices to be lower in the future than they would otherwise be had the Groceries Order remained in force.  CSO figures are consistent with this view, particularly when grocery price inflation is compared with overall inflation.  The Consumer Price Index for January shows that the prices of products previously covered by the Groceries Order fell by 1.2% in the ten-month period from April 2006 to January 2007 while during the same period, prices of products not covered by the Groceries Order rose by 2.4%.  The overall impact on all groceries prices (Groceries Order and Non-Groceries Order items) is a decrease of 0.4% in the same period.  The real benefits however will be felt over time, as price competition re-emerges at retail level in the trade.Following the enactment of the legislation which abolished the Groceries Order, I asked the Competition Authority to review and monitor developments in the grocery sector in light of the new regulatory environment.  I am anxious to ensure that the benefits of removing the Order are not thwarted by the emergence of other anti-competitive practices.  That is why, for example, the Competition Act 2006 prohibits practices such as resale maintenance, which were institutionalised by the Order.  It would be damaging to consumer interests if such practices were to emerge within the grocery trade in another guise.  Since removal of the Order, the Competition Authority has received no complaints of anti-competitive behaviour in the sector, nor has it seen any evidence of such behaviour.  The Authority's monitoring of the sector is ongoing but I understand it believes it is too early to reach any conclusions.  Next month, one year's worth of data will be available for analysis and I understand the Authority intends to publish, later in the year, an analysis of developments in the grocery sector focusing on pricing trends, market structure and barriers to entry.  Thereafter further analyses will be published annually for as long as necessary.

This budget ensures that overall numbers on schemes are maintained at 2006 levels.  I am satisfied that this level of funding is more then adequate to support the ongoing requirements of FÁS in the delivery of its labour market programmes.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	837	My Department has been making good progress in the relocation of the required 250 posts to Carlow under the Government's Decentralisation Programme.  With regard to the property side of the Department's move, the Office of Public Works completed the purchase of a site in Carlow town centre late in 2005.  On 31st May 2006, the OPW commenced the tendering process by seeking expressions of interest from developers in relation to the design, build, finance and maintenance of new office accommodation and car parking for the Department in Carlow.  On completion of this stage, a shortlist of developers will be drawn up from whom tenders will be invited.  Following the tender evaluation process the preferred tenderer will be requested to seek suitable planning permission.  On obtaining this, the OPW will formally award the contract and construction will commence.  The OPW expects construction to be completed by the end of 2009.In order to accommodate staff who wish to move earlier than the projected building completion date, officials of my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the OPW, as well as decentralising staff and Business Units, are progressing an earlier move to Carlow.  The OPW have advised my Department that negotiations on the procurement of interim accommodation to facilitate an advance move are nearing completion.  I expect this advance move option to allow for the movement of approximately 100 decentralising staff to Carlow during the second quarter of 2007, on a voluntary basis.  In total, the number of posts in Business Units decentralising to Carlow, as at 5th March, is 288.  As at 5th March, my Department has 103 Carlow-bound applicants assigned within the Department, with a further 71 Carlow-bound applicants yet to be assigned to the Department.  It is hoped to have all decentralising posts filled in sufficient time to ensure that staff are adequately trained in advance of the move to Carlow.Under the current Government Decentralisation Programme, four of the Agencies under the aegis of my Department are due to decentralise.  FÁS is to move 383 posts to Birr, County Offaly.  Enterprise Ireland is to move 292 posts to Shannon.  The Health and Safety Authority is to move 110 posts to Thomastown, County Kilkenny.  The National Standards Authority of Ireland is to move 132 posts to Arklow, County Wicklow.  My Department continues to provide advice and support to each of the four Agencies in progressing their decentralisation programmes and there is a dedicated Agency Decentralisation Committee to drive the process forward.  In addition, I am satisfied that each Agency is fully engaged in the process and taking all of the relevant steps to advance their decentralisation plans.  In outlining the current Agency position on decentralisation, it must be remembered that data from the Central Applications Facility is based on "priority first preference" applications.Under the Government's decentralisation programme, FÁS is due to transfer its head office including some 383 posts to Birr, County Offaly, by 2009 and is actively putting measures in place to advance the process.  FÁS has two staff members physically located in Birr and another staff member has agreed to relocate, bringing the total to 3 staff members.  These FÁS staff members are currently in rented accommodation in the Birr Technology Centre.  It is anticipated that between 40 to 50 staff will be located in Birr by the end of the year.  Staff located in Birr will consist of volunteers and new recruits, who continue to have the decentralisation clause in their contracts.  To date, a total of 102 FÁS staff have expressed an interest in relocating to Birr.  26 FÁS staff have volunteered to move outside the Central Applications Facility.  6 FÁS staff have signed up through the facility.  34 New Entrants have signed contracts with the relocation clause.  36 promoted staff have signed contracts with the relocation clause; however following industrial action these cases are being examined by the parties and the matter has been referred to the Labour Court.  The negotiations for the purchase of a site in Birr are continuing.Enterprise Ireland is to move 292 posts to Shannon under the decentralisation programme.  Figures available to Enterprise Ireland indicate that 19 of its staff have applied for decentralisation to Shannon, of which 15 are based in Dublin and 4 are based outside Dublin.  I understand that the number of applications received from within the civil and public service, including my Department, amounts to 33, thus giving a total overall of 52 persons.  Enterprise Ireland is establishing its National Regional Development Headquarters as well as the County Enterprise Support Unit in Shannon.  In addition, the functions hitherto carried out by Shannon Development in relation to the development of indigenous industry in the Mid-West Region were transferred to Enterprise Ireland with effect from 1 January 2007.  This transfer of function also involves the transfer of posts from Shannon Development to Enterprise Ireland.  The necessary arrangements to give effect to these changes are in train and will be completed over the coming months.Enterprise Ireland recently appointed a senior manager as Head of Regions and Entrepreneurship who will guide the transition and establishment of its presence in the Mid-West Region.  The chief executive officer of Enterprise Ireland, Mr. Frank Ryan, announced this appointment recently during a visit to the Region by the chief executive officer and members of Enterprise Ireland's senior management team.  Enterprise Ireland is sourcing a building in Shannon Town to accommodate the new functions being located in the Region and the staff transferring from Shannon Development.  A number of options are under consideration and it is expected that a decision will be made by the end of March.  Progress on the full transfer of Enterprise Ireland's headquarters to Shannon, within the Government decentralisation programme, will be influenced by factors such as the level of interest in the Shannon location expressed by Central Applications Facility applicants and by progress made during discussions at a central level with regard to decentralisation.The Health and Safety Authority is required to move 110 posts to Thomastown, County Kilkenny as part of the Government's decentralisation programme.  To date a total of 62 people (11 HSA staff, 41 Civil Servants, 10 Public Servants) have expressed an interest through the Central Application Facility process in transferring to Thomastown.  In anticipation of the move to Thomastown, the Authority established an interim office in Kilkenny city in August 2006 — 17 staff have relocated to that office.  All staff who move in the interim to the Kilkenny office will transfer to Thomastown when the premises there are completed.  The Authority has been advised by Office of Public Works that as the site procurement process is in its final stages, the current estimated timeline for availability for occupancy is late 2008 or early 2009.  All newly recruited Dublin based staff are ultimately contracted to move to Thomastown.The National Standards Authority of Ireland, with a total of 132 staff, is to be relocated to Arklow.  The latest available figures from the Central Applications Facility show a total of 107 first preference priority applications for Arklow from the wider public sector subject to the decentralisation programme.  The number of staff from the authority who have, to date, applied for decentralisation is 11.  The total number required to be decentralised is 132 and none have been decentralised to date.  The authority is liaising with the OPW in identifying office accommodation in the Arklow area.  The authority's current implementation plan anticipates a target date of April 2009 as the completion date of its decentralisation programme.  However, this is dependent on the resolution of matters at central level.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	838	The relocation of businesses within particular types of industry, and with it a certain number of jobs, is a reality of modern global manufacturing for a highly developed economy such as Ireland.  The factors that influence a firm's decision to relocate are varied and complex.  In addition to relative wage rates and other cost factors, these may include business takeovers, consolidations and changes in product or market focus.  While offshoring can contribute to job losses for firms in some sectors, productivity gains achieved through offshoring some activities also represents an opportunity to develop higher-end manufacturing and related activities domestically.  The phenomenon of globalisation is changing the way economic production is organised the world over.  Lower barriers to trade and improvements in transport technology are increasing the specialisation of production, resulting in global supply chains.  Ireland experiences both benefits and costs resulting from globalisation.  The clearest demonstration of the benefits to Ireland from globalisation is illustrated by inward Foreign Direct Investment.  This has been one of the principle causes of the strong economic performance of Ireland over the last two decades.  However, as Ireland has gained from the mobility of modern production and supply chain models, competition from other locations for mobile FDI has intensified.This shift in the structure of international trade poses challenges to economic policy makers in all countries.  Ireland has so far been sufficiently flexible and adaptable to move to higher value added activities, providing quality sustainable jobs.  Almost 300,000 new permanent full-time jobs were created in enterprise agency assisted firms since 1997.  Furthermore, in large companies this process of transformation is often accommodated by a reallocation, retraining and upskilling of staff within the company, which leads to improved productivity.  Where relocation has occurred to date, it has mainly been confined to relatively low technology, labour intensive activities. We are continuing to pursue policies to promote lifelong learning and upskilling to improve labour market flexibility and, where necessary, ensure that appropriate training supports are provided for workers in sectors that are no longer competitive, if they need to find alternative employment.  The Government is committed to ensuring that Ireland continues to be an attractive place to do business and to helping to foster economic competencies higher up the value chain.  In that regard, it has made significant progress in working towards maintaining and enhancing framework competitive conditions and promoting new areas of competitive advantage by developing this country's research and development base, investing in critical physical and communications infrastructure and promoting tertiary education and lifelong learning.  Clearly the strategies set out in the new National Development Plan, which support the continued implementation of these policies, will play a crucial role in maintaining Ireland's attractiveness as an investment location.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	839	I propose to take Questions Nos. 378 to 380, inclusive, together.Economies throughout the developed world experience flows of capital as firms make adjustments to their operations and decide where to locate different aspects of their value chain.  In this context and with the extending influence of globalisation, every major economy of the European Union has seen plants and jobs relocate to other economies.  There will always be shifts in production units as companies react to market signals or changing circumstances in their individual product sectors.  Companies relocate activities from Ireland for many reasons.  Firms adjust their plant location and utilisation strategies to address matters such as accessing new markets, moving production nearer to customers, meeting firm or market specific customer relationship issues, accessing technology or other competitive considerations.  Our best response to the realities of globalisation is to ensure that Ireland remains attractive for investment and enterprise growth.  Enterprise support policies have consistently evolved to meet the needs of foreign direct investment and growth orientated indigenous firms. As a result Ireland is deeply connected with the global economy.  When new technologies, products and services emerge in global trading our policies change to ensure we win for Ireland the leading companies that are at the forefront of global products and services.  An increasing part of our economy is sophisticated, highly productive and value driven.  This will continue as enterprise policies reposition our ability to offer the skills, education, research and innovation capabilities that modern mobile and indigenous firms need to be competitive in world markets.  While Forfás undertakes an annual survey of employment in companies supported by the enterprise development agencies, no data is collected on the number of jobs that have relocated to other economies.  Neither is data collected on employment that is attracted here from other less competitive economies.What establishes the competitive credentials of the economy, however, is its ability to replace quality jobs with others of the same or higher skill level.  There is a sustained flow of investors who, having made rigorous assessments of the economy, decide to significantly invest in the country and the skills of our labour force.  Some of these investors have established plants here, know well the competitive benefits of doing business from Ireland and decide to reinvest and expand their operations.  In 2006, IDA Ireland won 71 new projects involving total investment of €2.6 billion.  These decisions are strategically important for investors.  They are not taken lightly in the board rooms of multinational companies and are not made in favour of unattractive economies.  Many of these investments are being won by regional locations where existing competitive strengths will be improved by economic infrastructure investment under the National Development Plan.  Others are in the Research and Innovation space where investment under the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation will increase research funding and stimulate advanced graduate output to underpin the needs of these innovation orientated and customer focussed projects.  Under my Department, Enterprise Ireland is making excellent progress in delivering its strategic ambition to invest and build the competitive strengths of indigenous firms in innovation, productivity, management development, technology acquisition and opening new markets in fast growing markets, globally.  For example, the latest initiative by Enterprise Ireland, announced at the start of the year will see the agency contribute almost €1.5 million in support of five industry networks who are undertaking collaborative projects under its Industry-Led Networks Pilot initiative.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	840	There is no specific employment rights legislation governing the payment of overtime. While the Organisation of Working time Act 1997 regulates rest breaks and maximum weekly working hours it does not cover overtime payment. Employees do not have a statutory right to overtime pay except in certain employments covered by employment regulation orders or registered employment agreements. Policy in relation to overtime pay may be decided by the employer and agreed as part of the employee's terms and conditions of employment or through collective agreements negotiated between employers and employee representatives.Terms and conditions of employment are determined in the main by a process of collective bargaining between the employers and employees or their representatives. Within this system parties are free to negotiate or not to negotiate. The State facilitates the bargaining process by providing a framework and institutions through which good industrial relations can prosper. Institutions have been established that can assist in the resolution of disputes between employers and workers such as the Labour Relations Commission, including its Rights Commissioner Service, and the Labour Court.A number of employment sectors have pay and conditions of employment regulated through the Joint Labour Committee system/Employment Regulation Orders (EROs) or through Registered Employment Agreements (REAs) that are legally binding in sectors to which they apply. Some of the EROs/REAs regulate overtime pay. Employment Regulation Orders or Registered Employment Agreements regulate overtime payment in the following sectors: Aerated Waters & Wholesale Bottling — Agriculture — Catering (Outside Dublin City and Dún Laoghaire) — Catering (Dublin City and Dún Laoghaire) — Construction — Retail Footwear & Drapery (Dublin only) — Electrical Contract — Wholesale Fruit and Veg (Dublin only) — Hairdressing (Dublin City and County, Bray, and Cork City only) — Handkerchief and Household Piece Goods — Hotels (Outside Dublin City, Dún Laoghaire and Cork City) — Law Clerks — Printing (Dublin Only) — Provender Milling — Retail Grocery — Security — Shirtmaking-Tailoring — Women's Clothing and Millinery.The Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994 provides that an employer is obliged to provide an employee with a written statement of terms of employment within 2 months of the commencement of employment. The written statement of terms must include information on any terms or conditions relating to hours of work including overtime, as well as information on the rate of pay of the employee or how the pay is calculated.An employee who is not paid in accordance with his/her terms of employment may refer a complaint to a Rights Commissioner under the Payment of Wages Act 1991.

Provision was also made to extend entitlement to the Constant Attendance Allowance to recipients of workmens compensation on a similar basis as applied to recipients of Disablement Pension.  In addition, entitlement to Disability Benefit was extended to recipients of Workmen's Compensation.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	845	A number of measures have been introduced in recent years to remove disincentives to taking up employment and to assist in the transition from welfare to work.   These measures include special means disregards and tapered withdrawal of benefits as earnings increase, and employment support schemes such as the back to work programme.In the case of one parent families and others who participate on community employment (CE) schemes or indeed in any form of part-time employment, up to €75 of weekly earnings are disregarded in the means test to ensure that a person is better off as a result of taking up the opportunity.In the particular case raised by the Deputy, the amount of rent supplement payable will be less when the person concerned takes up a CE place.  This is because her income will increase when she is on CE and rent supplements are subject to a means test.  However, she will still be €75 per week better off.In Budget 2007 I announced further improvements for those wishing to return to the workforce including improvements in the additional income disregards for those taking up employment or training. I also announced that any person who is on a local authority waiting list for accommodation under the Rental Accommodation Scheme (those with a long-term housing need), may now return to full-time employment and be considered for a rent supplement payment under the standard means test as outlined above.These measures provide for significant improvements to the rent supplement scheme both in terms of simplifying the current assessment process and in offering clear incentives to those returning to work.   The measures are being provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill which is currently before the House.

Previously the grant was only available to carers in receipt of carer's allowance or benefit. However, from June 2005, the respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full time care and attention to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income. Those persons in receipt of other social welfare payments, such as state pensions but excluding jobseeker's allowance and benefit, are entitled to this payment subject to meeting the full time care condition. From June 2007, the level of the grant will increase by €300 to €1,500 per year.In the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2007, which is currently before the Oireachtas, I have provided for new arrangements whereby people in receipt of a social welfare payment, who are also providing ful l time care and attention, will be able to retain their main welfare payment and receive another payment, depending on their means, the maximum of which will be equivalent to a half rate carer's allowance. A person currently in receipt of a carer's allowance, who may have an underlying entitlement to another social welfare payment, will be able to transfer to that payment and receive up to a half rate carer's allowance.These new arrangements will apply to almost all weekly social welfare payments including state pension contributory and non-contributory and to people in receipt of qualified adult allowances. Recipients of jobseeker's allowance or benefit will not be eligible for the new arrangements, given the nature of these payments. This is in line with the arrangements which currently apply to receipt of the respite care grant. It is estimated that approx imately 18,000 carers will benefit from this measure at cost of some €57 million in a full year."Towards 2016" commits the Government to continuing to review the scope for further development of the carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant. I am committed to working for, and with, carers to deliver increased benefits, supports, and services for them and their families.

This €13 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. In addition to the minimum contribution, applicants are required to contribute any assessable means which they have in excess of the appropriate SWA rate.The Executive has advised that it had suspended payment of rent supplement in this case following the assessment of an overpayment of €3,912.90 in respect of undisclosed earnings. The person concerned contacted the Executive and agreed to discharge the overpayment through agreed monthly deductions from her revised rent supplement entitlement of €124.90 per month.The Executive has further advised that as the one-parent family payment of the person concerned has now been reduced to take account of her part-time earnings, the entitlement to rent supplement will be re-assessed and that it will notify the person concerned of her revised entitlement to rent supplement shortly.

This preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were claiming other social welfare payments. There are currently 21,971 people in receipt of FIS. In Budget 2007, I have continued the re-focusing of income thresholds to include additional gains for larger families.Research undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute in 1997, which was based on the Living In Ireland Survey 1994, suggested that fewer than one in three eligible claimants were actually in receipt of the payment. Since those with a higher entitlement are more likely to avail of the scheme, the take-up in expenditure terms was estimated to be somewhat higher, at between 35% and 38% of potential expenditure.My Department is undertaking a specific research project to examine factors behind the level of take up for the scheme. Tenders to undertake this work have been received and these are being evaluated. I expect this process to be concluded shortly and the project to commence in the next few weeks.

Like the original NAPS, it has a 10-year timescale, 2007 to 2016, which also coincides with the timescale of the national partnership agreement, Towards 2016. It is closely linked to the new National Development Plan 2007-2013 and is the third and final element of the Government’s overall strategic framework for social inclusion, based on a new “lifecycle” approach. The plan is the outcome of a process that began in September 2005 with a consultation process in which the public and the various stakeholders were invited to make written submissions. A total of 81 submissions were received. This was supplemented by 6 regional consultations which 512 people in total attended. A detailed report on the overall consultation has been published entitled The Report on the Consultation for the National Action Plan
against Poverty and Social Exclusion.
The Office for Social Inclusion (OSI) is the Irish government office, located in my Department, with overall responsibility for coordinating the development Ireland's National Action Plan for Social Inclusion and monitoring its implementation. This included coordinating this consultation and working with the National Economic and Social Forum in organising the third NAPS Social Inclusion Forum.The specific purpose of this Forum was to afford participants an opportunity to input their views on the forthcoming National Action. Plans, including the social inclusion part of the National Report on Strategies for Social Protection and Social Inclusion submitted to the EU in September 2006. Up to 300 attended the Forum held in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham on 15th February, 2006. A detailed report on the proceedings was published subsequently.The culmination of this process was the completion and launch of the NAPinclusion on 21 February in the Government Press Centre by the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and myself. The event was attended by the media and was followed by a reception in Government Buildings with some 100 invited guests, including social partners, NGOs and officials of government departments and agencies who were closely involved in the development of the Plan.The design and printing costs of the report and other ancillary items, including translation and the launch amounted to approximately €66,000.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	853	According to the Population and Migration Estimates published by the Central Statistics Office in April 2006 there were 189,600 women in Ireland age 70 and over.  Information on the means and sources of income of this group is not generally available. However, it is estimated that, in relation to women of pension age generally, about 88% receive support through the social welfare system in their own right or as a qualified adult on the pension of their spouse or partner.The Government is anxious to ensure that as many people as possible should qualify for pensions in their right. In this regard qualifying conditions for contributory pensions have been eased and special pensions such as the pre-53 payment have been introduced. In the last two budgets a particular emphasis has been placed on the non-contributory pensions with significant improvements in the means test and a higher rate of increase being granted than that given on the contributory side. These improvements are of particular benefit to older women who make up the majority of recipients of non-contributory pensions.As the House is aware, the Government is preparing a Green Paper on pensions and it is expected that this will be finalised by the end of March and published as soon as possible thereafter.  The Green Paper will include a discussion of all aspects of our pension system including the position of people who do not qualify for social welfare pensions. Following the publication of the Green Paper a consultation process will then take place and the Government will respond to this by publishing a framework for future pensions policy.

In line with other social assistance schemes, a means test is applied to the carer's allowance so as to ensure that resources are directed to those in greatest need.  This means test which has been eased significantly over the years applies to all applicants for carer's allowance. Following Budget 2006, the earnings disregard for a couple was set at €580 per week, which is equivalent to gross average industrial earnings. In Budget 2007, I increased this to €640 per week for a couple from April 2007.  This increase means that, a couple with two children will be able to earn in the region of €36,000 per year and still qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance as well as the associated free travel and household benefits. This measure exceeds the commitment in Towards 2016 to ensure that those on average industrial earnings can continue to qualify for a full carer's allowance.From June 2005, the respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full time care and attention to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income. Those persons in receipt of other social welfare payments, excluding jobseeker's allowance and benefit, are entitled to this payment subject to meeting the full time care condition. From June 2007, the level of the grant will increase by €300 to €1,500 per year.I am committed to working for, and with, carers to deliver increased benefits, supports, and services for them and their families.

Fuel allowances are paid for 29 weeks from end-September to mid-April and are included in the recipient's weekly payment during this period.  The allowance represents a contribution towards a person's normal heating expenses. It is not intended to meet those costs in full.The fuel allowance is not a voucher system or fuel credit but is paid as part of a claimant's weekly welfare payment.  While the fuel allowance amount is intended as a supplement to heating expenses, it is a matter for each claimant to decide how they wish to utilise this allowance.The fuel allowance scheme has been improved and expanded over recent years.  The range of improvements made to the scheme in recent years include an easing of the means test, extending the duration of payment from 26 to 29 weeks and an increase of €5 in the rate of payment in the 2006 Budget.  In Budget 2007, I have provided for a number of further improvements in the fuel allowance scheme.  These comprise an increase in the weekly rate of fuel allowance of €4 from €14 to €18 (€21.90 in designated smokeless areas) and an increase in the income threshold for eligibility to fuel allowance by €49 from €51 to €100 above the state pension (contributory) rate.Some 274,000 people benefited from the fuel allowance in 2006 at an estimated annual cost of €125.1m.  As a consequence of the increase in rate and the increase in the income threshold for eligibility as announced in the recent Budget, annual expenditure on the scheme in 2007 will increase by an estimated €36.4 million.  The total annual cost in 2007 is estimated at €161.5m.Any further extensions or improvements to the fuel allowance scheme would have cost implications and would have to be considered in a Budget context and in the light of the resources available for improvements in social welfare generally.

The amount awarded is based on her average weekly earnings since the beginning of the year and other assessable income relative to the income limit for a family with two children.  The FIS payment is 60% of the difference between all assessable income and the income limit for the family size, rounded up to the nearest euro.Under social welfare legislation, decisions in relation to claims must be made by Deciding Officers or Appeals Officer.

Under the legislation governing the scheme, the Health Service Executive (HSE) may make an exceptional needs payment to people on social welfare or HSE payments. This is a once-off payment to meet an unforeseen or special need that cannot be met from a person's basic income.Assistance in the form of an Urgent Needs Payment (UNP) can be also made to persons who would not normally be entitled to SWA, to assist, for example in cases of flood damage, with immediate needs, such as food, clothing, fuel, household goods and perhaps shelter. Assistance can be provided in cash or in kind.My Department's role in response to any emergency event primarily involves supporting the community welfare service in the provision of ENP and UNP funding in the short term and other supports where applicable to cater for the long term. Any support given will relate to damage to a person's home or loss of essential items. This support does not extend to business or commercial loss and is intended to meet immediate personal needs and it is not compensation. My Department has no role in providing compensation for losses arising from such incidents.The question of safety concerns and possible damage to infrastructure in the aftermath of a landslide is essentially a matter for consideration by the local authority in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Local community welfare officers are available to provide assistance on an individual basis where that is warranted. If any person is experiencing hardship as a result of the landslide in Leenane, they should contact their local Community Welfare Officer in the first instance.

The Policy Statement reiterated the view that most of these harbours would best achieve their potential through their transfer to local authority ownership or, where this is not possible, through sale to the private sector.  In harbours where significant commercial traffic exists, consideration will be given to bringing them under the control of a port company.With regard to Bantry Bay, this harbour still has significant commercial traffic, in particular oil tankers using the Whiddy Island oil storage facilities.  However, the level of business associated with the harbour would not be such as to justify the establishment of a separate port company under the Harbours Act 1996.  In view of this, my Department believes that the best way forward for Bantry Bay Harbour is some form of amalgamation with the Port of Cork Company.  The precise details of the amalgamation will have to be worked out in conjunction with the various parties in due course and will not be finalised without first consulting further with local interests. Both I and Minister Cullen have met with delegations from the Commissioners over the past year.

This was a reference to a general unit load service which Iarnród Éireann operated up to Autumn 2005 which was supported by Norfolkline.  It consisted of a less than full train load service carrying single containers for multiple customers on the same train.  The service was not viable for Iarnród Éireann due to the high railhead operating costs and road shunt costs to/from these railheads incurred by Iarnród Éireann.  This particular service was discontinued in Autumn 2005.  However, Iarnród Éireann had discussions with Norfolkline about redesigning the business to improve its overall economics and since April 2006 Iarnród Éireann has been operating a very successful railfreight service for the company between Ballina and Waterford Port.  Iarnród Éireann has been providing two trains per week in each direction carrying tanks and containers and I understand that Iarnród Éireann are in a position to provide a third train in each direction.

The Memoranda set out requirements relating to a range of matters viz service quantity including number of passengers carried, service quality, financial and operational requirements and monitoring and reporting.While passenger numbers carried is a key performance indicator I believe that the annual payment to the CIE companies in respect of public transport public service obligations should, as in the current Memoranda, relate to a range of variables and not just passenger numbers carried. As part of the current process of agreeing the Memoranda my Department and the companies seek to refine and develop the provisions of the Memoranda relating to service levels and targets.

In particular, this legislation is necessary to support the introduction of free flow open road tolling on the M50 in mid 2008.The Bill was published on Friday 2 March 2007.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	868	The Metro North project is not a dedicated rail link to Dublin Airport in the way that the non-stop Heathrow Express is between that airport and central London. Metro North will terminate at Lissenhall north of Swords and will, when completed, provide a rapid, high capacity, high frequency link in the commuter rail network linking the north Dublin suburbs with the city centre.   Some 34 million passengers per year are expected to use Metro North which will serve several key interchanges and population centres along its route, one of which is Dublin Airport.As the Deputy will be aware, European financial assistance will, in future years, be targeted mainly towards the new, less-developed Member States and on measures designed to further enhance and deepen the integration of the European Union.The Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) is one of the instruments in the latter category.  In 2004, the EU Commission proposed a new TEN-T Programme which, in view of the expected doubling of traffic between Member States by 2020, is estimated to cost around €600 billion.   Given the scale of this investment, the Commission proposed that projects be prioritised for EU assistance under the Programme as not all Member State projects could be accommodated.   Accordingly, a series of 30 transnational axes were identified which were deemed to have European added value and which would contribute to the sustainable development of transport and the integration of the new Member States.   Of the 30 priority axes and projects across 25 Member States (now 27), Ireland succeeded in including two strategic projects, namely the Cork-Dublin-Belfast-Stranraer Railway axis and the Ireland/UK/continental Europe Railway/road axis. Ireland is also interesting in participating in Motorways of the Sea projects.  The Commission's proposals were formalised in Decision No. 884/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council in April 2004.  When the Commission was considering Ireland's outline TEN-T proposals, the projects deemed as having highest priority in terms of meeting their criteria were cross-border road and rail projects, as distinct from urban transport system.In identifying priority projects, Member States were not precluded from pursuing projects of trans-European significance either from their own resources or from other EU funding sources such as the Structural and Cohesion funds.  Cohesion funding is no longer available to Ireland and the amount of Structural Funds available for the period 2007-2013 is approximately €900 million.   As I pointed out in my reply to Question No. 1272 on 31 January 2007, this much reduced level of funding compared to previous years and its profile over the seven-year period will be factors in determining the type of programmes and projects that will be selected for co-financing and it is not currently envisaged that major infrastructural projects such as Metro North will feature in these funding proposals.   Niche programmes and targeted projects that will complement the new NDP and that have regard to the limited availability of EU Structural funding are likely to be the focus of co-financed infrastructural expenditure over the 2007-2013 period.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	873	This matter has been raised in the House before and I have indicated that Open Skies will be good for Irish tourism, aviation, business links and the economy generally. For Irish airlines, Open Skies will give them access to every city in the US, and enable them to negotiate with different airports to obtain the best commercial deals for new services. The additional access to the US as well as the increased numbers of US tourists into Ireland will greatly benefit Irish tourism, aviation, and business links generally in all parts of the country.A number of reports (the Brattle Report for the European Commission, the Report of the Tourism Policy Review Group to the Minister of Arts, Sport and Tourism, and the Air Transport Users Council (ATUC) of the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland Report into Open Skies) all support moving to open skies with the US, and emphasise the significant benefits to Ireland when this happens.The aviation industry has experienced dramatic change in recent years and the future development and growth of all international and regional airports in the State will depend largely on how each airport responds to the new challenges and the extent to which emerging opportunities, such as Open Skies, can be exploited.If Shannon Airport is to develop as a successful and sustainable business, it is clear that one of the issues that must be addressed in its business plan is the airport's uncompetitive cost base. When that obstacle is overcome the Airport has a real opportunity to develop new markets and to attract the airline customers that it needs for its commercial future, the area's tourism and other industry.With a view to assisting the airport, and the wider region, to adapt to the proposed new arrangements, my Department is currently finalising an Economic and Tourism Development Plan for Shannon, which was initiated in the context of the ongoing EU/US negotiations on Open Skies.  In preparing the Plan, my Department has consulted with the Department of Arts, Sports and Tourism, the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment and the Department of Finance.  A liaison group, established by the Mid West Regional Authority, has separately prepared a report on the future development of the Shannon region as an input to the Plan.I intend to bring the Economic and Tourism Development Plan to fruition in the context of the finalisation of the EU/US Open Skies negotiations, which will include transitional arrangements for Shannon.

The cost to the Department is €227,000 and provides for 75% of the cost of engine modification.Decisions about successful applications are being made in April with the view to obtaining a diverse mix of transport operators. It is expected that this scheme will be complementary to the Minerals Oil Tax Relief (MOTR) Scheme II, which aims to place 163 million litres of biofuels on the market at a cost of €200 million, and will help develop a sustainable indigenous network of localized PPO supply chains in Ireland.However, this scheme does not apply to private cars as it is targeted at hauliers or captive fleets maintained by local authorities or public organizations. In Budget 2006, the Minister for Finance provided for a 50% VRT relief on flexi-fuelled vehicles (FFV), which are capable of operating on 85% blend, for 2006 and 2007.In addition, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (DCMNR) announced obligatory 5% fuel blending by 2009, which will help to achieve the indicative target of 5.75% set out in the Biofuels Directive 2003/30/EC.

These operational cleaning duties include weed control (cutting and spraying), grass cutting, hedge cutting towpath/bank maintenance and litter collection. The litter collection and grass cutting work is generally undertaken on a continuous basis with each section being attended to on a rotating basis.I am satisfied that the canal is cleaned as regularly as possible having regard to current resources. However, I must point out that if people desisted from littering canal property it would reduce the cost of maintenance and free up resources for more productive purposes.I have brought the Deputy's point in relation to the success of clean up programmes in the other jurisdictions to the attention of Waterways Ireland.

Payment for access is not under discussion.  Development and maintenance of specific walks throughout the Country is what I have in mind and I am fully in agreement that there should be no cost burden on farmers from the maintenance of permissive ways open to the public at no charge.I have time and again made clear my view that a local community based approach is the way forward where issues of access to the countryside arise.  Where it is not possible to reach agreement, in a particular location, alternative routes should be explored and developed so that landowners' rights over access to their lands are not interfered with.To ensure that a number of legal issues regarding land access for recreational use are addressed as a matter of priority, I have established an expert group, comprising a Senior Counsel and officials from the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and my own Department.  This group met for the first time on Tuesday 20th February and I have asked them to report back to me by the end of April.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	887	The position is that under the Charter of Rights for Farmers, my Department is committed to ensuring the maximum level of integration of inspections across all areas including inspections under the Single Payment Scheme, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and the Rural Environment Protection Scheme. This integration means that control checks are carried out in relation to eligibility of land declared, identification and registration of animals on the holding, and compliance with the other 18 Statutory Management Requirements (SMRs) under cross-compliance in one farm visit. On this basis, the overall number of annual inspections associated with the Single will be in the region of 7,200. This is a very significant reduction from the 18,000 inspections annually under the old coupled regime.My Department is in regular contact with the European Commission with a view to simplification of Single Payment Scheme requirements with particular reference to the arrangements for cross-compliance inspections.  In this connection the European Commission is currently undertaking a full review of the cross-compliance regime and the results of that review will be presented to the Council of Ministers during April.   In tandem with this, my Department is carrying out a full review of inspection arrangements with a view to simplification where possible while, at the same time, ensuring compliance with the EU regulatory requirements and safeguarding animal funding of  €1.9 billion for Irish farmers under direct payment schemes.  The review of the inspection report forms together with the outcome of the Commission's review of the cross-compliance arrangements generally, will be fully discussed with the farming organisations before the inspections for 2007 get underway.I believe that the initiative by the Commission on simplification of the CAP and the review of cross-compliance, provides an opportunity for a fresh look at cross-compliance and other Single Payment Scheme issues.  I am certainly pressing for this both in direct contact with Commissioner Fischer Boel and the President of the Council, Minister Seehofer.  I raised the matter at the Council recently where several member States had similar problems to ours.  It is not surprising then that simplification of the CAP and the cross-compliance regime in particular are core issues for the current German Presidency of the EU. Only last weekend, during an official visit to Paris, I met with both Minister Seehofer and with the French Agriculture Minister on which occasion I raised again the issue of simplification of EU rules for on farm inspection.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	892	Throughout the negotiations on reform of the EU sugar regime, my primary objective was to seek to have the Commission's proposals modified so as to ensure the continuation of an efficient sugar processing sector in Ireland. I had several meetings with the Commissioner in that regard and Ireland played an active role in a group of eleven Member States who had common cause in seeking to modify the proposals. When it became evident at the final Council of Ministers meeting in November 2005 that there was not sufficient political support to adapt the proposals to the extent necessary, I focused my efforts on securing a very substantial compensation package for Irish stakeholders. The package, worth in excess of €310m, comprises three elements.The first element is the compensation for the beet price reduction. This has already been incorporated into the Single Payment Scheme with effect from 2006. It will be worth approximately €123 million to Irish farmers over seven years.The second element is the EU restructuring aid for the sugar industry, which is worth €145m approx. This has to be drawn down on the basis of an aid application, including a restructuring plan, submitted by Greencore. The plan incorporates a social plan detailing the actions planned by the company in particular with respect to re-training, redeployment and early retirement of the workforce concerned.  In July 2006, the Government made certain decisions regarding the implementation of this aid, in particular the percentage of aid to be reserved for beet growers and contractors. These decisions are currently the subject of judicial review proceedings instituted by Greencore in the High Court.The third element of the compensation package is the diversification aid worth almost €44m. A national restructuring programme has been prepared and submitted to the EU Commission, in accordance with the EU Regulations, with a view to drawing down this aid. The Regulations provide that payment would commence in September 2007. The main objectives are to minimise the loss to beet growers arising from the cessation of the sugar industry in Ireland by facilitating the development of alternative uses of land and, by enabling these farmers to earn a replacement income, to contribute to the viability of the wider rural economy of the former beet growing areas.Following the introduction of the Single Payment Scheme, farmers now have the freedom to choose whatever farming enterprise is most appropriate to their circumstances. Many are showing interest in the potential of energy crop cultivation for biofuel purposes. I recently announced details of new bioenergy initiatives to stimulate the production of energy crops. A new Bioenergy Scheme will provide establishment grants to farmers for up to 50% of the costs associated with establishing miscanthus and willow on set-aside land and on areas, which have been subject to an aid for the EU Premium of €45 per hectare. The scheme is being piloted in 2007 and will allow up to 1,400 hectares of willow and miscanthus to be grant aided in the first year. Under the Scheme, farmers can receive up to €1,450 per hectare towards establishment costs with the balance to be invested by the farmer.  Full details of the scheme are now available from my Department and the closing date for receipt of applications for pre-planting has been extended to 30 Mach 2007.  I have allocated  €8m to the scheme over the period 2007 to 2009.I also announced recently my intention to introduce a new top-up payment of €80 per hectare in 2007 to support the growing of energy crops. The €80 payment will be paid as a top-up to the existing EU Energy Crops premium of €45 per hectare, bringing the overall payment to €125 per hectare. It is intended that the €80 additional payment will apply for three years and will be subject to a maximum ceiling per producer over the three years. The current maximum area payable per producer over the three-year period is 37.5 hectares. EU approval to allow an increase in this ceiling is being pursued.  Willow and miscanthus are also eligible for this payment, subject to an application under the EU Energy Crops Scheme.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	893	As announced in Budget 2007, €14 million will be provided in the period 2007-2009 to incentivise farmers to grow energy crops. The measures include a new national payment of €80 per hectare to top-up the existing EU premium of €45 per hectare and increase the overall premium to €125 per hectare. The premium will be paid as part of the Single Payment. It is intended that the €80 payment will apply for three years and will be subject to a maximum ceiling per producer over the three years. The current maximum area per producer is 37.5 hectares. €6m has been allocated for this measure over the period 2007-2009.I have also announced a new Bioenergy Scheme to provide establishment grants to farmers for up to 50% of the costs associated with establishing miscanthus and willow on set-aside land and on areas, which have been subject to an application for the EU Premium of €45 per hectare. The scheme provides a maximum payment rate of up to €1,450 per hectare or €580 per acre. The minimum allowable area per applicant eligible for the establishment grant is 4 hectares and the maximum allowable area is 20 hectares. I have extended the deadline for receipt of applications for pre-planting approval to 30 March 2007 to provide every interested farmer with the opportunity to submit an application. All applications will be processed immediately when received in the Department to enable successful applicants commence planting without delay.The aid will be paid in two instalments:A maximum of 75% of the aid (€1,088 per hectare) will be paid when the crop is established.The remaining 25% of the aid  (€362 per hectare) will be paid one year after the payment of the 1st instalment grant, provided the applicant has adequately maintained and managed the crop, including the first year cut back.

Such cases require complex individual examination to ensure that any allocation from the National Reserve does not result in double benefit to the applicant.My Department is making every effort to have all outstanding National Reserve applications fully processed.  Indications to date suggest that in the vast majority of cases, an allocation from the National Reserve in anti-accumulation cases would in fact result in double benefit to the applicant.  However, as each individual case is processed applicants are being formally notified of the result and, if not satisfied with my Department's decision, have the right to have the case referred to the Independent Appeals Committee.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	897	In 2004 the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council requested the Scientific Advisory Committee on Animal Health and Welfare to evaluate the physical and psychological effects of electro-immobilisation on farm animals subjected to this procedure and to furnish a view. The Committee examined all aspects and recommended that the practice should be prohibited.  My Department sought the considered views of all relevant stakeholders on the recommendation. Having considered all of the views received, I decided to accept the recommendation of the Committee to prohibit the use of electro-immobilisation on live farm animals. The ban is due to come into effect on the 1st June 2007.   The stakeholders whose views had been sought have been notified of that decision.While I am aware of the possible risks to operators in the handling of large and difficult animals, I am in no doubt that the continued use of electro-immobilisation cannot be justified on animal welfare grounds for the purposes for which it has been used.   The ban was announced on the 13th April 2006 and is due to come into effect on the 1st June 2007, which allowed a period of time to deal with those animals where interventions might be necessary.  My Department has published notices in the farming press reminding farmers and veterinarians that this ban will take effect on the 1st June, 2007.  Further information has been sent directly to veterinarians which also emphasized the importance of promoting early intervention in relation to dehorning, debudding etc. of animals.  Similar information is currently being distributed to farmers.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	905	As the Deputy will be aware, Section 2 of the Official Languages Act 2003 states that "the official languages" of the State are (a) the Irish language (being the national language and the first official language) and (b) the English language (being a second official language) as specified in Article 8 of the Constitution.The Government has no plans at present to recognise Irish sign language as an official language of the State.  However, I wish to advise the Deputy that Irish sign language (ISL) has formal recognition in the Education Act, 1998. Under the Act, it is a function of the Minister for Education and Science to ensure, subject to the provisions of the Act, that there is made available to each person resident in the State, including a person with a disability or who has other special educational needs, support services and a level and quality of education appropriate to meeting the needs and abilities of that person. This includes provision for students learning through ISL.A number of initiatives which seek to promote, develop and implement ISL in order that it will achieve greater recognition and use in the education system are currently in place. These include: the special schools for the deaf in Cabra (Dublin) have been encouraged in relation to the use of sign language in class; funding is available for training of teachers in ISL; my Department has provided funding for an ISL weekly home tuition service whereby deaf tutors visit the homes of deaf pre-school children and deaf school-going pupils to provide training in ISL for the deaf children/pupils, their siblings and parents; and my Department through the Higher Education Authority (HEA) has established and fully funds a Centre for Deaf Studies in Trinity College, Dublin which provides diploma courses for ISL/English interpreters, deaf tutors and in deaf studies. The course modules deal with issues such as sign linguistics, bi-lingualism and socio-linguistics of sign language. The course is delivered in seminar sessions/group work and the award of the diploma is based on continued assessment and a project and course design.

There is no provision for leave with pay for the absence in this case.  All unpaid leave is non-pensionable as no pay issues and therefore no pension contributions are paid.  However, under the terms of Circular letter 129/2006, which revises the scheme providing for the purchase of notional service for superannuation purposes, the person in question may have the option to purchase any shortfall in pensionable service subject to a maximum of 40 years in total.  If contact is made with the Pensions Section of my Department, a quotation for the purchase of this service will be provided.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	907	My Department has not carried out a study of the type suggested by the Deputy.  However, Bus Éireann, which is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the School Transport Scheme on behalf of my Department, has advised that it proposes to undertake a limited survey of compliance rates.I see information and education as key factors influencing safety-conscious behaviour on school transport services.  To that end, a safety information campaign was launched in August, 2006 to make parents and children aware that it is now the law to wear seat belts on school buses, where provided, and to encourage children to behave in a safety-conscious manner on and in the vicinity of, school buses. These messages were conveyed by way of television, cinema and radio advertisements. In addition, a DVD and posters were distributed to all primary and post primary schools.  It is my intention that we should continue in this way to encourage positive pupil behaviour on school transport services.  The survey referred to above may help to indicate the focus such information campaigns should adopt.New school buses recently introduced into the school transport service are equipped with closed circuit television and I intend to consider the merits of installing such equipment more extensively on school buses as part of a general programme to enhance the safety of school transport operations.

All the schools approved for funding under the scheme will be contacted directly by the Building Unit of the Department with details of the grant aid being provided and instructions on how to proceed.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	910	I propose to take Questions Nos. 454 to 456, inclusive, together.Information in relation to class sizes is provided in the annual census of primary schools.  The census for the current school-year (2006/07) is currently being worked on. Details on class size in primary schools will be available for Counties. Major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years.  There are now 4,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002.  The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.  Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.  Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education.  Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.As you know all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children.  Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that — with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school.  Next September this will reduce to 27 children per classroom teacher.  School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment).  In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools.  For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year.  Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06.  The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.  But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers.  About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.  I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward.  We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.

On Monday, 5 March 2007, I announced details of the schools to receive funding under the Permanent Accommodation Scheme 2007.  However, this application was not successful, as the Department's evaluation of the project is that a major building project would be more appropriate to address the school's accommodation needs into the future.  In the light of an increase in the enrolments at the school in recent years, a reassessment of the long term projected enrolment, on which the school's accommodation needs are based is required.  This reassessment will take into account factors such as current and projected enrolment, and the likely impact of ongoing and proposed housing developments.  Once this reassessment is complete, a decision will be taken on how best to provide for the schools long term accommodation needs.  The project will be considered in the context of the multiannual School Building and Modernisation Programme.

The Special Rate of Maintenance Grant is available to students in receipt of the ordinary maintenance grant under each of my Department's four maintenance grant schemes, which includes the Higher Education Grant Scheme. In order to qualify for the special rate of maintenance (sometimes known as the ‘top-up' grant) a candidate must meet a number of conditions, including the following: 1.  An applicant must qualify for the ordinary maintenance grant. 2.  Total reckonable income in the relevant tax year must not exceed the lower income limits as set out in the relevant Maintenance Grant Schemes and, where applicable, net of Child Dependent Increase payments. 3.  As at the prescribed date — i.e. 31 December each year — the source of income must include one of the eligible long-term Social Welfare payments.  The prescribed income limit for the special rate of maintenance grant for the academic year 2006/2007 is €16,748.  While the number of dependants is not taken into account for the Special Rates of Maintenance Grant payments made in respect of dependants, i.e. the Child Dependent Increase, are excluded in the calculation of reckonable income.In addition, the following Social Welfare and Health Service Executive Payments are excluded in the calculation of reckonable income:—Child BenefitFamily Income SupplementDisability Allowance (where paid to the candidate)Blind Pension (where paid to the candidate)Means Tested One Parent Family PaymentsOrphan's PensionsBack to Education AllowanceFoster Care AllowanceDomiciliary Care Allowance andCarer's Allowance

Of these, 50 schools were identified to receive support as part of a phased roll-out of activity.The NBSS will give general support and advice to the 50 schools, and special behaviour support classrooms will be set up in the 30 worst cases. The special classrooms will act as cooling-off areas for students with severe discipline problems, where they will be taught acceptable behaviour before returning to the mainstream class.The decision to apply was a school based decision and the release of information on application numbers in set areas could lead to the release of information on schools without their permission.The NBSS recommends that schools should be contacted directly for information on NBSS application decisions.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	923	The specific information sought by the Deputy is not readily available. However, the Deputy can be assured that my Department fully recognises the key role of physical exercise within the school environment and continues to respond to the need to improve PE facilities for all pupils attending primary schools.PE facilities have been provided, where appropriate, as part of my Department's record school building programme which between the years 2000 to 2006 involved the delivery of over 7,800 projects with an investment of €2.6 billion. The budget for 2007 is the first year of the rollout of the new NDP which will involve an investment of over €4.5 billion in school buildings over the next 7 years, including €306m for primary schools this year alone. This multi-annual funding will enable my Department to continue to take a proactive approach to the provision of modern school accommodation including PE facilities.A special PE funding package, of €6.5 million, issued late last year to primary schools. Under the package, schools received €2,000 towards the cost of replacing and upgrading PE equipment. This grant was issued, as a once-off measure, to enable schools to replace older equipment such as goalposts, PE mats, benches etc. The modern equipment which can be purchased will help facilitate PE and sporting activities in schools, which everyone recognises is a very important aspect of school life. This funding package was made as part of this Government's continued commitment to modernise facilities in schools throughout the country.In addition, since 2000 my Department has provided in excess of €5.5m in grant-aid to primary schools to facilitate the provision of coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or to purchase resource materials associated with the provision of physical education.Under the furniture and equipment element of my Department's School Building and Modernisation Programme funding is available for the provision of additional equipment at developing schools or the replacement of outdated/damaged equipment.I increased the level of grant payable under the annual devolved grant scheme for minor works to national schools last November. All primary schools with full recognition receive a basic grant of €5,500 plus €18.50 per mainstream pupil and €74 per special needs pupil. This grant is intended to address works required to the physical infrastructure of the schools or on items of furniture and equipment for educational use, including PE and IT related equipment.Primary schools that establish a class for special needs pupils receive a once-off grant of €6,500 per class to purchase equipment, including physical education equipment, that they feel best meets the needs of the pupils attending the class.I would also point out that schools may use their general capitation funding to support the implementation of curricula including Physical Education. Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level has been increased from €57.14 per pupil to €163.58 from 1st January 2007.

In 2002, the school accepted an all-in grant towards the cost of two permanent classrooms in lieu of prefabricated units.The management authority at that time decided to build a third classroom and ancillary accommodation which was funded by the Board of Management and the Parent's Association. At no time did the Department approve this accommodation.In 2006 the school requested grant aid from the Department for the unsanctioned provision. However, this was refused as there is no provision in the capital budget for retrospective funding.The school applied for two additional classrooms under the Permanent Accommodation Scheme for 2007. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that this application was successful as announced yesterday. All the schools approved for funding under this initiative will be contacted directly by the Building Unit of the Department with details of the grant aid being provided and instructions on how to proceed.

One of these annual grants is for Adult Literacy and Community Education. The disbursement of funds for Adult Literacy and Community Education is a matter for each VEC, which, subject to its budget, decides the nature and extent of the Adult Literacy and Community Education services to be provided in its area and the manner in which funds for these services should be spent. The role of my Department is confined to paying the grants and receiving accounts of expenditure. Detailed records relating to the grant are compiled and retained by the VECs.The Department, as an exceptional measure, recently approved an application from City Waterford VEC to transfer an excess on its Adult Literacy Programme to offset a deficit that arose on its Community Education Programme at the end of 2006. This transfer of funds alleviated in full the deficit arising on the Community Education Programme last year. Furthermore, following a request in January, an advance of this year's funds was made to enable the VEC to continue to provide all its existing programme of classes in its Community Education Programme.The City of Waterford VEC has informed my Department, in response to an enquiry, that no classes have actually ceased on the pretext that they are not specifically aimed at target groups or due to funding issues.  The VEC will shortly be notified by my Department of its funding provision for this year.

The programme is 100% funded by my Department.All schools have been advised of the programme and where excess radon levels are located, funding is provided for the mitigation works.  Follow-up monitoring also takes place to ensure that the remediation action has been successful.Radon barriers are included in the design of all new school building projects.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	934	I can confirm that I have recently received correspondence on this issue from the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy and a response will issue shortly to the board from my Department.Primary schools' running costs have been traditionally met by my Department's scheme of capitation grants which are the main source of funding for the running costs of primary schools. The scheme of funding is flexible in nature and affords Boards of Management discretion as to how the funding is used in meeting schools' day-to-day running costs.  This has proved to be the most effective way of funding primary schools running costs to date.Capitation grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of national schools. The standard rate of capitation grant will have increased from €57.14 in 1997 to €163.58 with effect from 1st January, 2007.  This represents an increase of 186% over the period and should be of assistance to all primary schools in meeting their day-to-day running costs.Funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in new primary schools is provided under the Ancillary Services grant scheme. The standard rate of grant per pupil under the scheme was increased from €102 in 2002 to €145.50 per pupil with effect from 1st January 2007.The amount of grant paid to an individual school under both the capitation and ancillary services grant scheme is determined by the enrolment in the school, subject to a minimum grant in the case of a school with 60 pupils or less.  This however, does not preclude voluntary contributions by parents of pupils where schools choose to seek such voluntary contribution support particular activities.  However, voluntary contributions by parents, or charges for optional extras over and above what is provided for in the general school programme, are only permissible provided that it is made absolutely clear to parents that there is no question of compulsion to pay and that, in making a contribution, they are doing so of their own volition.This Government has shown a strong commitment to improving school funding in recent years and I will continue to prioritise this area in the context of available resources.

On 5 March 2007, I announced details of the schools to receive funding under this Scheme.   Due to the volume of applications received in the Department it was not possible to allocate funding to all proposed projects and the school referred to by the Deputy was not successful in this instance.  However, it is open to the school authority to apply for funding under the 2008 scheme, details of which will be announced later this year.

The institutions receive a block grant from the Higher Education Authority and it is a matter for each institution to determine how it is allocated internally.

The disbursement of adult literacy funds is a matter for each VEC, which, subject to its budget, decides the nature of the service to be provided in its area and the manner in which the funds should be spent. In addition to the standard service, some VECs use some of their funds to provide specially-targeted literacy programmes, including family literacy.An Action Plan for Educational Inclusion called "Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools" (DEIS) was launched in 2005.  Recognising the vital role of the intergenerational involvement of parents and other family members in children's literacy development, a new family literacy project has been initiated as part of the DEIS Action Plan. The project will build on previous experience in this area and will be implemented on a phased basis. It will be based on a partnership approach involving interested parties in the area of family literacy. A Working Group has been established to oversee this project. The operational details of the project are being formulated at present in my Department. The project will come into operation during the current academic year.Funding for the Family Literacy project under DEIS is as follows:Year€ Amount2006/07100,0002007/08200,0002008/09500,000
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	941	A key focus of the Government's education policy is to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk and to optimise access, participation and outcomes at every level of the system for disadvantaged groups.The wide variety of measures in place for tackling educational disadvantage and social exclusion reflect these concerns.  These measures range from pre-school interventions, supports for tackling children's literacy problems, reduced pupil teacher ratios, increased capitation grants, measures to tackle early school leaving and strengthen ties between the school, the family and the community.  In addition, there are interventions in support of youth, access to third-level and in providing "second chance education" for young people and adults.The total provision for educational inclusion programmes in 2006 was more than €640m across all levels of education.  The total provision for educational inclusion programmes in the 2007 is nearly €730 million across all levels of education.  This represents an increase of nearly €90 million on the comparable 2006 figure.  This includes additional funding for the implementation of measures under the DEIS action plan at pre-school, primary and second-level, additional funding for further education programmes and an increase in provision for third-level student support schemes.DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the new action plan for educational inclusion that I launched last year, will focus on addressing the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities, from pre-school through second-level education (3 to 18 years).The new action plan represents a shift in emphasis away from individual initiatives, each addressing a particular aspect of the problem, with the new plan adopting a multi-faceted and more integrated approach. This is the first time that an integrated educational inclusion strategy has been developed for 3-18 year olds in this country.The key principle of early intervention underpins both the early childhood education measure and many of the literacy and numeracy measures being adopted under the new action plan.  The plan will place a renewed emphasis on the involvement of parents and families in children's education in schools.The action plan will be implemented on a phased basis over five years and will involve an additional annual investment of some €40m on full implementation.  It will also involve the creation of about 300 additional posts across the education system.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	942	The Deputy will be aware that recently I announced the schools which are to benefit from the 200 extra language support posts provided for in the 2007 Estimates.  These extra 200 posts will bring the total number of language support teachers in our schools to 1,450.  These new resources are intended for schools with large numbers of pupils who do not have English as a first language.  Under the revised arrangements, depending on the number of eligible pupils enrolled, schools may now have up to six language support teachers.The additional 200 teachers are part of the Government's commitment in Towards 2016 to provide an extra 550 language support teachers by 2009 and to reform the limit of two teachers per school.  It is intended that a further 350 language support teachers will be provided between 2008 and 2009.  The estimated cost of providing these extra 550 language support teachers is of the order of €32 million.Under current arrangements, the additional language support to an individual pupil is generally given for a period of two years.  However, it is accepted that children have different levels of language and different levels of aptitude for language learning.In order to ensure that schools can accurately and objectively assess the language requirement of children, my Department will be sending to primary schools assessment materials which have been developed by Integrate Ireland Language and Training (IILT).  The assessment materials will enable schools to ensure that the specific language requirements of children needing support are met in a targeted way.  The IILT materials will also enable accurate initial and on-going assessment of the language proficiency of the child and his or her need for continued language support.

The appointment of teachers to posts within the approved quota is a matter for the authorities of the schools concerned.At primary level, Physical Education is one of the seven curriculum areas and is an intrinsic element of the Primary School Curriculum which was revised in 1999.  A minimum of one hour of physical education per week is recommended for all primary school pupils.  All qualified Primary teachers are qualified to teach the full spectrum of the Primary Curriculum including Physical Education.

This pay scale does not include a 10.75% Employers PRSI cost to my Department.  Additionally it is estimated that the cost of supporting each psychologist (accommodation, secretarial back-up, IT/ telecommunications, travel & subsistence, test materials, etc.) is in the region of €30,000 annually.

The Framework takes a life cycle perspective, as it addresses the economic challenges, and, in particular, the key social challenges that lie ahead.  It focuses on children, people of working age, older people and people with disabilities.Adult literacy and basic education have been the Government's top priority in Adult Education, as participation in any educational programme is impossible if one is unable to benefit from it because of poor literacy and numeracy skills.I am providing for an increase of €7.4 million, or 21%, in the funding for Adult Literacy and Community Education this year.  This additional funding, amongst other things, will allow for 3,000 additional literacy places in 2007 bringing the number of participants up to 38,000.Following on the "Towards 2016" Agreement, there will be 4,000 additional places available up to 2009, to bring the total to 42,000.  In addition, to increasing the numbers of participants in the general literacy services, the increase this year will allow for the special intensive literacy project that was initiated in 2006 to be offered on twice the scale in 2007.  Funding for this project will be €2 million this year.Adult and Further Education services are funded by my Department through annual grants to VECs.  The disbursement of adult literacy funds is a matter for each VEC who deliver the services locally.

Officers willing to relocate to Athlone have been identified for assignment to 94% of the posts involved, with 38% of these posts currently being held by officers who will relocate with their posts.  Further assignments of officers to decentralise with their posts will be made this year and the process will continue up to the date of relocation.  This is because a number of officers who will decentralise to Athlone are based outside of Dublin and every effort will be made to minimise the period of time they must spend in Dublin prior to relocating to Athlone.

Clause 3.2 of the PLC Scheme sets out the condition under which a candidate is deemed to be ineligible to apply for funding, it states that:—"Candidates are ineligible if they already hold a FETAC Level 5 qualification (formerly known as a FETAC (NCVA) Level 2 qualification), a FETAC Level 6 qualification (formerly known as a FETAC (NCVA) Level 3 qualification) or a third level qualification at Level 6 or higher.  However, notwithstanding this condition candidates who already hold a qualification no higher than FETAC Level 5 (formerly known as a FETAC (NCVA) Level 2) and are now pursuing a course that offers progression may be deemed eligible for grant aid."Under this provision, students holding a qualification no higher than a FETAC Level 5 (formally known as a FETAC (NCVA) Level 2 qualification) may receive grant assistance in respect of an approved PLC course which offers progression.I understand from officials in my Department that the candidate referred to by the Deputy has previously pursued a PLC course at FETAC level 5 in Ballinrobe Community School and is currently pursuing a second course at the same level at Temple Michael College, Co. Longford.  I regret that under the above provisions of the PLC Scheme the candidate in question is ineligible to receive any funding for the current course.

Teachers who complete a recognised primary degree and a recognised full-time post graduate course are awarded a second increment and are placed on the third point of the scale.The forum for dealing with claims for improvements to conditions of service for teachers is the Teachers Conciliation Council. At a recent meeting of the Council, agreement was reached in relation to the point on the salary scale on which graduates from the college referred to by the Deputy should be placed when they take up a teaching position in a primary school.I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, where appropriate, arrangements will be made by my Department to adjust the salaries of the teachers concerned and to pay any arrears due to them when the formal Agreed Report setting out the terms of the agreement is signed by the relevant parties.The current common basic scale for primary teachers (with effect from 01/12/2006) is provided below.(Schedule to Circular letter: — Pay 0145/2006)SCÁLAÍ LEASAITHE TUARASTAILRevised Salary ScalesPointí ar an Scála(Points on Scale)Ó (from) 1/12/2006€130,420231,497332,575433,657535,333636,421737,507840,241941,6071043,2391144,8641246,5001347,8681449,6791549,6791649,6791752,1771852,1771952,1772052,1772155,4782255,4782355,4782455,4782559,125

In considering these proposals, further information and clarifications have been sought from the school authority.  A response is awaited in this regard.  Any decision regarding the future development of the school is a matter ultimately for the Patron body and the Board of Management.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	952	I propose to take Questions Nos. 501 and 502 together.At primary level it is a matter for each Local Authority to provide a library service for schools in its area. While my Department has no involvement in the actual operation of this service, it does make a grant available to each Local Authority on an annual basis to enable Local Authority Librarians select, purchase, and deliver books to the primary schools in its area. The grant is based on the number of pupils enrolled in primary schools in each Local Authority area.I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the estimates provision in respect of library grants has been increased from €1.5 million in 2004 to €2.118 million in 2007, an increase of more then 40% since 2004.  At second level my Department provides a library of 100 metres squared in schools with an enrolment of 200-499 students while it provides 136 metres squared of accommodation for a library in schools with more than 500 students. Schools with enrolments below 200 are examined individually.Responsibility for the stocking of school libraries falls to be met by individual school authorities from within normal school budgets. In recent years two grants, amounting to some €6.60million, have issued to second level schools in the Free Education Scheme to assist them with the development of their library resource materials.  Schools were informed that the grants were to be used to improve the range and quality of library books and an information note offering advice on book purchases was issued.Under the terms of DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the Junior Certificate School Programme (JCSP) Demonstration Library Project was extended to 10 schools in the 2006/07 school year. These libraries were provided as a part of a whole-school approach to implement strategies to tackle the literacy difficulties experienced by many JCSP students. The funding provided for this project in 2006 was in the region of €1.7m.  The Demonstration Library Project will be extended to a further 10 schools in the 2007/08 school year.On 17 January last my Department invited applications under the Dormant Accounts (Educational Disadvantage) and RAPID Leverage Fund — Small Scale Capital Grant Scheme for Schools.  A total of €18 million has been made available to my Department from the Dormant Accounts Fund and the RAPID Leverage Fund to fund projects under the scheme that aim to counteract educational disadvantage. The scheme will provide capital grants for both the enhancement of existing and the provision of new outdoor play areas, school libraries, dining areas and parent rooms.  Eligible schools include schools participating in DEIS, schools in or serving RAPID areas and Special Schools.Having regard to the school libraries measure of the scheme, the measure primarily provides for the enhancement of school library facilities via either the upgrading of existing library facilities or the development of new school library facilities. Eligible activities include the provision of library stock, ICT equipment, fixtures and fittings and the construction and fit out of a new school library. Priority will be given to projects that enhance existing facilities rather than the construction of new facilities.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	953	The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year.  The number of mainstream posts is determined by reference to a staffing schedule. The schedule is set out in a circular which issues from my Department to all primary school Boards of Management.  Accordingly, all Boards are aware of the staffing position for their school in any school year.Major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years.  There are now 4,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.  Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.  All primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that — with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next September this will reduce to 27 children per classroom teacher.School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment). In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06.The school referred to by the Deputy had an enrolment on the 30th September 2005 of 90 pupils which warranted a staffing for the 2006/07 school year of a Principal and 3 mainstream teachers. The school also has the services of 1 Temporary Language Support teacher and 1 Permanent Learning Support/Resource teacher.  The Board of Management has submitted a report indicating that there were 112 pupils enrolled in the school on the 30th September 2006. The mainstream staffing of the school for the 2007/08 school year will be determined on that figure and by reference to the staffing schedule for the 2007/2008 school year which will issue to all primary schools before the end of March 2007.To ensure openness in the teacher allocation system at primary level, the Primary Staffing Appeal Board is now in place to decide on any appeals on mainstream staffing. This independent Appeal Board has been in place since August 2002.  The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.  But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers. About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	954	DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme. DEIS will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage.As a result of the identification and review process, 873 schools have been included under the DEIS action plan. These comprise 670 primary schools and 203 second-level schools.  In relation to schools that did not qualify for the new programme, including the two schools referred to by the Deputy, it is important to note that an independent review process was available to them. Additional schools were added to the programme as a result of making successful review applications. I am satisfied that all schools have been assessed on the basis of the best information available, have been ranked in terms of the right criteria and have been given a fair opportunity to appeal.Unsuccessful schools were advised at an early stage that they would be allowed to keep the supports that they have under pre-existing schemes for the current school year.  My Department is now in the process of informing these schools that they will retain additional teaching resources for the duration of the DEIS Action Plan. The effectiveness of these posts will be reviewed in line with the ongoing review process in place for DEIS schools. It will be a condition of the retention of such posts that schools comply with any reasonable requirements of the review process.Schools which presently participate in the Home School Community Liaison Scheme, will not be excluded from the scheme and will continue to avail of HSCL services for the duration of the DEIS Action Plan. The level of service will be commensurate with both the size of the school and its relative level of disadvantage to facilitate local HSCL coordinators working with families of disadvantaged children across both primary and second level.Many schools at present retain additional capitation from previous schemes which have now been subsumed into DEIS. From the beginning of the 2007/2008 school year this capitation will be offset against increases in the rate of general capitation. This process will take four years and will ensure that no school will experience a reduction in annual capitation as a result of this measure. Changes may of course arise from other factors such as enrolments.

The Service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the Exclusive Fishery Limits.In 2006 the Naval Service achieved an output of 1,658 patrol days, which represents an average of 207 patrol days per vessel.  In the course of these patrols, a total of 1,892 vessels were boarded, 19 were detained and 148 warnings were issued.  These outputs reveal a focused and committed Naval Service that is continuing to produce high levels of performance.The reorganisation of the Naval Service was designed to ensure that, when fully implemented, all personnel would spend alternate periods of two years in a shore-based appointment followed by a ship-based appointment.  While every effort is made to ensure that the two year rotation target is met there are occasions when as a result of shortages of key skilled personnel it is necessary for personnel to carry out ship-based duties more frequently.The number of personnel who spend more than two years in a ship-based appointment varies from time to time depending on current strengths, availability of personnel (e.g. medical issues), wastage rates and recruitment.  Currently there are four officers, which is 2.4% of the officer strength, serving onboard in excess of two years. Of these, one is extending his stay at sea at his own request and the remaining three will be posted ashore before the end of 2007. Of the enlisted personnel, eighteen are serving onboard ship in excess of two years.  This represents 2% of the enlisted personnel strength.  Of these eighteen, five have formally requested to extend their time at sea and the remaining thirteen have indicated that they have no objection to remaining at sea if required.  It is not unusual for personnel to request to remain in ship-based appointments in excess of the two years for such reasons as financial, domestic or career advancement.The impact of seagoing is well understood by Naval Personnel at all levels and the Naval Service endeavours to operate a planned approach to the sea/shore rotation of personnel.  As I stated previously I am very much aware of the report A Voyage of Discovery. On the 19th September 2006 I held discussions with a PDFORRA delegation and representatives of the Naval Service regarding the effects of patrol duties on personnel of the Naval Service.At our meeting agreement was reached on a process to examine this issue and find potential solutions.  A number of meetings took place between the Deputy Chief of Staff (Support), PDFORRA and Naval Service Command personnel.  Arising from these discussions, the Deputy Chief of Staff (Support) set up a Working Group consisting of members of PDFORRA and the Naval Service Command.  I am informed by the Military Authorities that the work of this Working Group is well advanced and is nearing completion.  I am monitoring progress in this area closely.It goes without saying that members of the naval service have to go to sea. At the same time both my Department and I are committed to ensuring that the Naval Service and the Defence Forces as a whole provides a challenging and rewarding career and a supportive working environment.

This plan which runs to 2009 set out an ambitious programme of reform and modernisation for the Reserve to enhance both Reserve Defence Force capabilities and Permanent Defence Force/Reserve Defence Force interoperability and is well on the way to implementation.Investment in new equipment, clothing and infrastructure for the Defence Forces is provided for under various Subheads of the Defence Vote.  All elements of the Defence Forces, the Army, Air Corps, Naval Service and the Reserve have benefited from this investment in new equipment over recent years.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	958	I am informed that the structure in question is on the Record of Protected Structures, which is maintained by each planning authority under the Planning and Development Act, 2000.  As such it is afforded statutory protection under the Act.In this regard, this Department funds a scheme of grants for the conservation of protected buildings, which is administered by the local authorities. It is a matter for each individual local authority to assess and prioritise applications and approve funding. The scheme is aimed at assisting owners and occupiers to carry out conservation works on structures of architectural significance in the Record of Protected Structures which the Local Authority has listed under the Planning and Development Act 2000. Enquiries about this scheme may be made direct to the relevant local authority.Under the National Development Plan 2007-2013, my Department will also administer a scheme of grants for the restoration and conservation of buildings of significant architectural heritage merit and which are in public ownership or open to the public generally.  The Heritage Council, which is funded by my Department, also runs a Buildings at Risk grant scheme. Details of this scheme are available directly from the Council.My Department does not intend to purchase the structure in question at present as resources are concentrated on maintaining heritage sites currently in State ownership or guardianship and to making grants available towards conservation of structures on the RPS.In July last year I announced the incorporation of The Irish Heritage Trust Limited, with the mandate of acquiring properties of significant heritage value where there is a risk to such value, so as to provide for their proper conservation, maintenance and presentation; their public enjoyment and appreciation; and public access to them in perpetuity.  The Irish Heritage Trust has been established as a charity (company limited by guarantee and not having a share capital) under the Companies Acts.  It provides an alternative to State acquisition of major important heritage properties where there is imminent risk to their heritage value.

These grants are paid to the county council which is the road authority for the area. The grants fund two-thirds of the cost of works, with county councils providing the balance. Roscommon County Council submitted 4 schemes in the Boyle Town Council area for consideration for funding in 2007, at a total cost of €136,455. The Council received a grant of €11,550 this year, representing two-thirds of the total cost of the first scheme prioritised by Boyle Town Council, for the provision of a new footpath at Plunkett Avenue.

The wastewater treatment plant for the town is being procured as part of the West Cork Grouped Design, Build and Operate (DBO) Scheme that also included Baltimore, Ballylickey, Dunmanway and Schull.  However, following notification from Cork County Council that Ballylickey is being removed from the grouped project because the Council has been unable to acquire the preferred site, my Department is now awaiting submission of revised Contract Documents for the treatment plants for the other locations.  The Council is advancing the collection systems as separate contracts in each case.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	965	The Electoral (Amendment) Act 2006, enacted in December 2006, provides for postal voting facilities for prisoners.Detailed guidance and application forms in this regard were issued by my Department to all registration authorities on 11 January 2007, including guidance on implementation of the statutory requirement on authorities to give public notice of the new facilities during the period from 19 to 26 January; as part of this process, application forms with accompanying explanatory notes have been made available in all prisons.  This material also issued to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for transmission to the Prison Service who are responsible for practical implementation of the new arrangements within the prisons, including the designation of relevant officials to perform specified functions in the registration and voting processes.  In addition, the new arrangements were widely publicised: prominent advertisements were placed in the main national newspapers on four dates in advance of the public notice period.The preparation of the register of electors is the responsibility of the registration authorities and the latest date for receipt of applications for inclusion on the 2007/2008 prisoners postal voters list was 14 February 2007.  Statistical information is compiled by my Department relating to the register of electors on a registration authority basis.  Preliminary figures from the registration authorities indicate that some 400 prisoners applied by the closing date of 14 February for inclusion on the 2007/2008 postal voters list.  The applications are currently being examined by the registration authorities who will notify prisoners of decisions on applications when they have been fully considered.  Details of the numbers of prisoners on the 2007/8 postal voters list will be available when this process is finalised.A prisoner from whom an application was not received by 14 February may apply for inclusion on the supplement to the 2007/2008 postal voters list.  Comprehensive guidance and other documentation relating to applications for inclusion in the supplement to the 2007/2008 postal voters list are currently being finalised by my Department and will issue to registration authorities shortly.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	966	The cutting of hedges between 1 March and 31 August is prohibited under Section 40 of the Wildlife Act 1976, as amended.  The Act does not make provision for any extension of the hedge cutting season.The reason for this provision of the Act is that hedgerows provide vital habitat for nesting birds during the breeding season.  Cutting of hedgerows during the breeding season causes disturbance of breeding birds and destruction of their nests and young.However, section 40 of the Act provides for exemptions in specified circumstances, notably for work carried out in the normal course of agriculture and for work carried out for reasons of public health or safety by a statutory authority.  Hedge cutting may, for example, be carried out by a local authority where necessary for road safety reasons.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	967	The administration of the various affordable housing schemes, including the allocation of affordable housing, is a matter for each local authority.  Local authorities are required to draw up a scheme of allocation priorities based on broad criteria set out in legislation.  As the making and amendment of such schemes is a reserved function of the local authority my Department has no role in the matter.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	968	From mid 2006 through to early 2007, special arrangements have been put in place by local authorities to deal with the accumulated backlog of farm plastics waste.  Designated facilities were provided on a temporary, once-off basis where farmers could deposit stockpiled farm film plastic and silage wrap.  These arrangements operated on a pilot basis in the first instance in counties Clare, Galway, Mayo, Offaly and Waterford during June and July of last year.  More recently further collections have been taking place in Carlow, Leitrim, Longford, North Tipperary, Roscommon and Wicklow.  This service was provided free to the farmer and funding to assist the local authorities is being made available from my Department through the Environment Fund to meet the costs associated with the operation of the scheme.The collections were well supported by farmers in the eleven counties that have participated in the two pilot phases held to date.  This has resulted in significant volumes of farm plastics being deposited at the designated sites for the purpose of onward transportation to dedicated reprocessing/recycling facilities.  A significant finding from the initial pilot was that it is not possible to operate collections in a large number of counties at the same time due to capacity constraints on the part of recovery operators and it is therefore necessary to roll out the scheme to other areas on a staggered basis.In the light of this finding, announcements regarding further extensions of collections to other areas, including South Tipperary, will follow a review of the second phase of the pilot scheme.

I have approved the contract documents for the grouped project and, under streamlined procedures I introduced last year to speed up the Programme, the Council may proceed with the new treatment plants as soon as a construction stage budget for the works has been approved by my Department.I understand that work on the collection systems, which were procured as separate contracts, is already in progress.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	973	It is estimated that over €70,000 has been spent on the translation of documents into the Irish language since the Department's Irish Language Scheme 2005-2008 came into effect in August 2005. As indicated in reply to Questions Nos 129 and 163 of 27 February 2007, more detailed information will be compiled later this year as part of the Department's annual progress report on implementation of the Irish language scheme.The information sought in relation to publication costs of bilingual documents is being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	974	I propose to take Questions Nos. 524 and 527 together.The Government decision to proceed with the movement of the electronic voting equipment to centralised premises was made taking into account a range of factors, including costs of current and centralised arrangements and the likely benefits to be realised.  In this regard, the Commission on Electronic Voting in its Second Report concluded that enhanced and more uniform security and greater economy of security costs could be achieved through the rationalisation of storage on a regional or centralised basis.  This was against the background that the current arrangements under which voting equipment is stored at 25 locations are likely to give rise to continuing variations in the implementation of security and related control measures.It is not possible to detail conclusively at this stage the total costs which will be associated with the centralised storage arrangements.  Arrangements have been made for the procurement of 48 metal storage containers and ancillary items for Gormanston Aerodrome at a cost of €112,750 (excluding VAT). Preparatory work was carried out on the hangar at a cost of some €7,000. The alarm and CCTV system protecting the hangar is an existing feature of the premises and has no additional cost implications; similarly, there are no additional staffing requirements.The work of the Cabinet Committee on Electronic Voting has not to date involved the incurring of specific costs.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	975	Under the Building Control Act 1990, enforcement of the building regulations is the responsibility of the 37 local building control authorities.  Each of the authorities has a designated Building Control Officer with appropriate staff to carry out building control functions.  Numbers vary depending on the size of the authority and the volume of construction activity; in addition, local authority fire services are involved in the administration of building regulations.  The Department does not collect statistics on the number of building inspectors who report to the Building Control Officer.  The local authority grade and pay of these officers varies from authority to authority.Staffing requirements in local authorities are a matter for the County/City Manager concerned.  However the County and City Managers Association has adopted the target, to be attained by local authorities generally, that at least 12% to 15% of buildings covered by valid commencement notices should be inspected by local authorities.  I understand that in the half-year ended 30 June 2006 (the latest period for which completed data is available) all local authorities were carrying out inspections and some 35, or 95%, of these had reached the target level.  A total of 10,600 inspections had been carried out of 9,800 buildings to ensure compliance with the building regulations.

In addition to local authority funding, grants are provided by my Department to assist in development of the service.  The Government has provided some €90.2 million, through my Department, towards the local authority public library service over the years 1997 to 2006. The provision in my Department's Vote in 2007 for this purpose is €14.675 million.The library service was the subject of a major review in 1997/1998, which resulted in the publication of Branching Out: A New Public Library Service in 1998. This report, which was approved by Government, put forward a series of recommendations designed to equip the public library service for the 21st Century. A full review of Branching Out, in the light of Ireland's current economic and social climate, is currently nearing completion. On the basis of this review, I will shortly be publishing an updated policy and vision for the public library service over the next 6 years.
