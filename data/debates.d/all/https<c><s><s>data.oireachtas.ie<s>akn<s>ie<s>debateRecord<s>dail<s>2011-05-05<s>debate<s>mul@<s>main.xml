On the revised memorandum of understanding, the suggestion is to bring forward legislation to increase the current rate of carbon tax.

          <p eId="para_38">Legislation on this matter has not been prepared or brought to Government.  When legislation is considered by the Government it will be introduced in the House.  The commitment on water charges is in the programme for Government, which makes clear that water metering will be introduced, but there will be a free household allowance.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is progressing those proposals and when they have been completed they will be brought before the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_156">I refer Deputies to the Fines Act 2010.  The purpose of the Act was to update the value of all existing fines that can be imposed on summary conviction to their value at the time of enactment or, where appropriate, when last updated in legislation.  Five classes of maxima have been created and placed in tables to avoid having to update individually each fine separately, which would not be practicable.  This amendment provides that the final conviction of an offence of up to €5,000 that had initially been included in this Bill, which was drafted before the Fines Bill 2010 was enacted, could now become a class A fine.  This will allow the amount to be updated as appropriate without an undue administrative burden in years to come.</p>

          <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Eamon Gilmore)</from>
          <p eId="para_158">I thank the House for its consideration of this Bill.  It is important to reflect on the significance and relevance of this legislation.  This Bill will strengthen implementation in domestic law of the State's international obligations, principally under the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, but also under the 1925 Geneva Protocol, as well as relevant elements of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 of 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">I am pleased to note that the Bill has received cross-party support on each of its Dáil Stages.  It is designed to prohibit the use, production, development, stockpiling and transfer of biological weapons and to prevent such weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of terrorist organisations and other non-state actors.  It creates specific offences relating to the use, production and possession of biological weapons.  When the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention was adopted in 1972, the principal concern it was intended to address was the possibility of the use of biological weapons by states.  The Bill's fundamental intention is to close a potential gap in the State's law that has come to light in recent times and in the context of a changed international situation.  It is the potential threat posed by non-state actors, in particular terrorist groups, which must be addressed now.  It is only right, therefore, that all states review their laws from time to time to ensure that they are adequate to the threat posed.  It is timely that this country has taken this opportunity to do so now.  The Bill shows this country's continuing commitment to ensuring that the objectives of the 1972 convention are met.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">To set the general context, the Bill will not affect in any way those engaged in work involving biological agents for legitimate purposes such as the production of vaccines.  The Bill is directed solely at those engaged in activities whose purpose is hostile.  There is no suggestion that this country is currently used as a location by terrorist groups for the production or development of biological agents or has been in the past.  The difficulties of weaponising biological agents and then of successfully deploying a biological weapon against a target are considerable.  That is true for states and more so for non-state actors.  Moreover, there are significant dangers of infection or poisoning for those who might try to develop a biological weapon.  It is partly for that reason that we have, thankfully, seen very few instances of biological weapons being used to date.  That is not to understate the danger presented to society by any attempt to make or use a biological weapon.  The fact that this country is not currently a location for groups seeking to develop or use those weapons does not mean that we should be unconcerned.  On the contrary, it is absolutely essential that we should be in a position to successfully prosecute anyone who attempts to develop a biological weapon in this country.  This requires the creation of clear and specific offences.  The continuing absence from the Statute Book of such specific offences could paradoxically attract those types of dangerous people to this country precisely because they may believe that there is no clear law on the matter.  Enactment of the Bill will ensure that this is not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">I thank Deputies for their contributions throughout the legislative process.  I very much appreciate the cross-party co-operation on the passage of the legislation through the House on this issue, as in all other areas under the broad heading of disarmament and non-proliferation.  Deputies will share the priority which successive Governments have attached to developing and maintaining this country's leadership role in the field.</p>

        <heading>EU-IMF Programme: Statements (Resumed)</heading>
        <speech by="#ThomasPringle" eId="spk_136">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle</from>
          <p eId="para_163">The revised memorandum that is before the House represents the further entrenchment of the IMF-EU deal and the handing over of sovereignty by the Government.  As has been mentioned frequently in the House in recent weeks, during the election campaign we heard about Labour's way, not Frankfurt's way.  We heard also that a Fine Gael member said not a cent more would go into the banks.  Through the publication of the document on the EU-IMF programme, we know that what was said during the election means nothing.  When the parties went into government they picked up the baton from Fianna Fáil and ran with its proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">In its dealings with the troika, the Government has made the EU-IMF deal its own through the programme.  The Government's statement refers to how the benefits of greater engagement have been demonstrated.  However, the deal is largely the same as the one Fianna Fáil agreed in November 2010.  It is the same deal that the troika, the IMF, EU and ECB, foisted on us at that time.  The Minister indicated that the conditions have been largely met, which confirms that it is the same deal.  The Government has rolled over.  Contrary to what was said during the election campaign, the Government parties have not been able to negotiate a deal with better terms.  The Government can no longer blame Fianna Fáil or the previous Administration as it has done many times in the Chamber in recent weeks in the context of the bailout, bank recapitalisation and austerity measures that were foisted on us in the deal.  The Government has made the deal its own through the publication of the programme.  I hope to see an end to the attribution of blame to the previous Administrations and that this Administration will take ownership and recognise that it is continuing with the failed policies of Fianna Fáil and the Green Party in the previous Administration.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">Under the terms of the deal the Government is making much of the fact that it has agreed to bring the minimum wage back up to €8.65 per hour.  The changes will be completely undone in budget 2012 and budget 2013 by changes in the tax bands and tax credit system for working people.  The effect of the increase in the minimum wage will be that people on lower wages will just pay extra taxes at the behest of the EU, IMF and the Fine Gael and Labour parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">The programme makes much of the changes in social welfare.  Other speakers referred yesterday to the fancy language used, but what it really means is that there will be cuts in social welfare rates which will affect the most dependent people in the country, those who have the most difficulty in surviving.  Their rates will be further reduced in the budget at the end of this year and in 2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">The programme is a continuation of the Fianna Fáil programme and the EU and IMF's punishment of this country for what they perceive we have done.  The programme does not accept any European responsibility for the situation in which we find ourselves in spite of the fact that the bubble was fuelled by European banks lending so much to our banks.  The programme of austerity has been firmly adopted by the Fine Gael and Labour parties and it will be foisted on the people in the coming years.  The programme is totally in the Government's ownership.  It has failed to renegotiate the deal.  Unfortunately, we will be facing further austerity, home repossessions and unemployment, all at the behest of the IMF and the EU.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#StephenDonnelly" eId="spk_137">
          <from>Deputy Stephen Donnelly</from>
          <p eId="para_168">Last December, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, then Opposition spokesperson for finance, said the deal was a downright obscenity.  I agree with him.  It represents a real loss of independence for the Irish people.  That independence has been ceded to a group of economists who, at best, have a shaky track record in helping countries to rebuild their economies.  Nearly half the money from the deal is being used to bail out unguaranteed bondholders.  Those loaning us the money are making significant profits by lending to us at a much higher interest rate than that at which they are borrowing the money.  It is an austerity-based approach, which from economic history we are aware does not work.  The deal represents a transfer of wealth from the most vulnerable people in society to the super rich around the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">One could ask where we are six months later.  Yesterday, the Minister indicated that we are meeting the targets, as nominally agreed by Fianna Fáil in the previous Government.  Let us look at what is happening in the real economy.  Government debt has been downgraded to one notch above junk status.  Bank debt has been downgraded to junk status.  Unemployment is due to rise by tens of thousands and the growth forecast, unsurprisingly, has been halved.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">What will happen next?  The Government states in the report that it will meet the 3% deficit target.  It has consistently said it will not raise taxes and over the past weekend, the Taoiseach said he would protect public sector pay at all costs.  With growth halved and with us still having to meet the 3% target, there are only two options left open to the Government.  It can cut social welfare and cut services.  Therefore, what we are saying is that in the coming months and years, we will take, yet again, from the most vulnerable people in our society.  We will take from education and will allow class sizes increase.  We will take from health  and will close wards and cancel operations.  However, we will continue to pay tens of billions of euro to private companies that invested in Irish banks.  We will continue to pour tens of billions of euro into these failed banks and will continue to pay millions to their failed leaders.  We will also continue to pay billions of euro in profit to those who are lending us the money to pay these bankers and lenders.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">I agree that when made in December this deal was — it still is — an obscenity and I have no doubt it hurts the Minister to have to come into the House and report on its progress.  The Government claims repeatedly to have a mandate, and it does.  It has a mandate to stand up to foreign powers and to fight for the Irish people and to regain our independence.  It has a mandate to stand up to powerful investors and bankers.  However, it does not have a mandate to continue to implement Fianna Fáil policy, nor does it have a mandate to do the opposite of what it said it would do during the general election campaign.  Many Government Deputies spoke in the House yesterday of the Government being in a straightjacket and of it having its hands tied by the failed policies of the previous Government.  This is true to a point, but there are options which are not being used.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">We can assemble a team and go out to Ireland and abroad and get some of the finest academic, economic and financial minds together to help the Minister.  We can get some of the finest negotiators and assemble a world class team rather than rely on the same policy advisers who advised the previous Government which got us into this position.  We can call the Europeans out on their threats.  If they insist that all senior bondholders must be paid so that the bond markets in Europe do not get spooked, we should say fine but insist that we all pay, because that will benefit everybody.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">Or we can be creative.  We can agree we will pay back the €35 billion, but not for ten years, because we do not have the money because the Irish people are bleeding and scared and there is no cash to pay.  If the Europeans threaten to increase the cost of funding to the banks should we not pay them back, which we understand from Professor Honohan they are doing, we can call them on that.  We can tell them to go ahead because we are prepared to let some of the banks fail.  The core European countries do not want any European banks to fail.  Therefore, we should all deal with the issue together.  We should not just leave it to the Irish people to deal with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">We can communicate with the French and German public.  They believe that they are bailing us out and their politicians are acting accordingly.  We can explain to them that the reverse is true and that it is the Irish people who are bailing out their investors and banks.  We can use debt for equity swaps to both stop the payments of our money to bondholders and to move the banks back into private ownership.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">I suggest the Government can do far more than it is doing currently.  It can be braver.  It should remember that sometimes we need to fight and incur short term pain to protect the interests of our people and our independence.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LiamTwomeyIND" eId="spk_138">
          <from>Deputy Liam Twomey</from>
          <p eId="para_176">Since September 2008, the people of Ireland have been suffering traumatic stress due to what is basically an economic war.  The stress, anxiety, fear and irrational thinking is not much different from what would be seen in a real war.  The big difference is that in a real war the anxieties are worse, the suffering is greater and the post traumatic stress remains forever.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">The first casualty of any war is the truth, and we are seeing that here.  The previous Minister for Finance finished his Budget Statement in December 2009 with the phrase, "We have turned the corner".  The truth, as a casualty of our economic war, hit a low point in the weeks preceding the arrival of the IMF in Ireland.  The Minister's denial of the arrival of the IMF was the lowest point reached.  However, it was clear to many of us there was something wrong.  At the time, the sudden conversion to consensus politics by the former Minister, John Gormley, was the first sign on the wind of this.  It was only on Fine Gael's first visit as a parliamentary party to the Department of Finance, led by the current Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, that we were informed that the budget adjustments required to be made a few weeks later would not save €3.5 billion, but €7 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">The arrival of Mr. Olli Rehn, the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, was the first public sign that Europe had lost confidence in the previous Government.  Things were so bad at that time that the people felt the IMF could do no worse than Fianna Fáil.  Many people on the streets were delighted the IMF was coming in because they had lost all confidence in the previous Government.  The awful mismanagement of our economy at that time is the reason for this debate on the IMF and the European Central Bank, two organisations people here knew little about a few short months ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">For the sake of the future of this country, we must regain self belief and confidence and believe that we can get out of this situation by working together.  When the Second World War ended, Germany was ruined both physically and economically.  However, within two decades, Germany was once again an economic powerhouse within Europe.  We have a job to do.  We must repair our battered reputation in Europe.  Everybody who understands European affairs, knows our reputation in Europe is in tatters.  We must also regain our international reputation.  For that reason, our Taoiseach and senior Ministers are travelling throughout Europe and the world.  They are trying to regain the reputation this country had just a few years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">We must also protect the most vulnerable people in society.  The decisions we make must ensure we can pay pensions, gardaí, nurses and teachers in five years' time.  We need the people to show the resilience and motivation the people of Europe showed in the aftermath of the Second World War.  Therefore, we must put a stop to the attitude that has become prevalent of not being responsible for causing the crisis and therefore having no responsibility to pay for it.  We are not shareholders in Ireland nor are we employees of Ireland.  We are citizens.  In Government, Fianna Fáil abused the trust of its citizens and we have been left with that legacy.  As the new Government, Fine Gael and the Labour Party, along with the people, will not default on their responsibilities to the country.  We must work together to put ourselves back on the path to recovery rather than blame each other for what has gone wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">Some Opposition Members have a constant chorus demanding we default on our obligations to repay our loans.  That surprises me, because it is the poor, the less well off and the most vulnerable who will be hardest hit if we default.  I cannot understand why Opposition Members continue with this demand.  They may lack understanding of what happens when countries default on their international obligations but history demonstrates what happens.  If Opposition Members can demonstrate clear outcomes resulting from taking the default path, they should explain to us the position of the people following default.  They should explain what happened in Argentina following default, when the numbers of less well off increased.  There was an increase in the number of people in a worse position and that situation lasted for a significant number of years.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">If that is the collateral damage the Opposition Members would like they should explain to the people that is how they want to go.  If we default in the future it will be the least well off in society who will suffer the most.  As it stands, paying for the legacy of Fianna Fáil's ruination of our reputation and our economy means that our schools, hospitals and social services will be receiving less funding for the next decade regardless of what we do.  Already people are suffering and we do not need to compound that with half-baked ideas about defaulting and walking away from our responsibilities as a nation.  We have taken that responsibility on ourselves and we should grow up and act like it.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">There is a high degree of uncertainty surrounding macroeconomic projections for Ireland.  Nobody quite knows what future growth will be.  Even the best economists have repeatedly got it wrong over the past decade.  We have a better idea of what tax receipts will be but again that is unpredictable and we need to work with the best knowledge available to us now.  Government spending is more predictable but is not fully predictable.  As we have seen, social welfare costs and other costs of supporting the less well off in our society will increase in times of recession and we are trying to protect these people.  What has happened for the new Government and the Minister, Deputy Noonan, in recent weeks?  The two parties that have been in power for less than 50 days are putting their shoulders to the wheel in trying to sort these things out.  We are getting control of the banking situation.  We are not out of the woods yet and we still have much to do.  We need to look at regulatory mechanisms within the banking sector and we will bring those forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">Next week we will have a jobs initiative.  We will do our best to get people back to work.  We will consider everything that will reduce the burden on the least well off and the lowest paid in our society.  In the next few months we will have a comprehensive spending review of every Department and we will reform how we frame budgets.  It would be more useful for the Opposition to take on the mentality that we are fighting our way out of an economic war, to work with the Government in putting forward proposals and to look at the Government proposals and see how they can work.  I sat on the Opposition benches for five years, two and a half of which I acted as Fine Gael spokesperson on health.  While it is much easier to give out about Government policy, I tried to be as constructive as I could when dealing with what I regarded as some of the most flawed health policies proposed by any government.  The Opposition needs to take up that kind off spirit.  It is easier to give out but if that is the role it takes, it will be ignored not just by Government but also by the people.</p>

        <speech by="#DaraCalleary" eId="spk_139">
          <from>Deputy Dara Calleary</from>
          <p eId="para_185">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the stability programme update.  It is nearly a year since the Greek deal, followed by our deal and this week the Portuguese deal.  Throughout that year regardless of our specific situation one gets the impression that there is no European-wide response to the contagion facing the eurozone.  There is a sense that the rules of the game are being made up as we go along.  Next week there will be a meeting of finance Ministers.  Given that we have Europe day on Monday and as it is now a year since the first bailout, I hope we start to draw a line under the confusion of policy there has been in the ECB and Commission response to this.  The sooner we can do that the sooner we can bring the stability Deputy Twomey mentioned to our national debate rather than what is happening at the moment whereby we are waiting for the possibility of the interest rate to be reduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">Regardless of how frequently the Government or any Minister reiterates the fact about our corporation tax, there is still a doubt over it.  There is considerable doubt and fear among multinationals here not so much about the corporation tax but about the common consolidated corporate tax base and the lack of any direct response from Government on the issue.  We need to draw a line under that issue and be absolutely clear in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">As has already been announced, the document published this week commits the Government to a comprehensive review of expenditure, which is welcome.  There was a discussion about committees on the Order of Business this morning.  This morning's excuse over the delay in setting up committees was that we had to wait until the Seanad elections were completed.  There is no more important committee to be established than the one on finance so that the comprehensive review of expenditure can be debated within and articulated through the committee structure.  I say to Deputy Twomey that if people have ideas, that is the forum within which they will be discussed.  A comprehensive review of expenditure in our current state should focus on those areas that create and sustain employment.  Those expenditure areas that can be linked to job-creation and infrastructural projects should be prioritised in the context of that review.  The Government will get support for such an initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">While I know it is the responsibility of the Minister, Deputy Howlin, perhaps the Minister for Finance might get an opportunity to outline the process for this expenditure review.  Will it be an entirely internal Government process?  Will it involve the Oireachtas committee system?  Will it seek the view of members of the public?  Many people have good ideas and as Deputy Donnelly said, now is the time to get everybody on board and put a good team together on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">The original programme committed to a review of a number of issues that are causing serious competitiveness problems in the economy.  I understand the Minister, Deputy Bruton, has received a copy of the report into joint labour committees and the various restrictions they place.  I had understood that the reform of joint labour committees and everything that goes with them was to have been part of next week's jobs initiative, but it now seems that will not happen.  I ask the Minister to update us on the matter.  The original stability programme made considerable commitments to the reform of the legal system and reform of many areas of the economy that are in need of reform and are anti-competitive.  There is a lack of detail as to when that will get under way.  I do not have as rosy a view of activity in this area in the so-called first 100 days as does Deputy Twomey.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">The Taoiseach has made several commitments to Dáil and constitutional reform to allow for an inquiry into the issues that led up to this.  If we are to have a constitutional referendum to reverse the Abbeylara judgment that process needs to get under way immediately so that the proposals can be teased out.  One presumes that if we are to have a referendum as soon as possible, the presidential election in October would present an ideal window of opportunity.  There are only a few months to do that, which is another reason to get the committees established as quickly as possible so that we can tease out the implications of the judgment and address them.  Once a referendum has been approved in terms of giving the powers back to this House, an inquiry into all the events surrounding this matter can get under way as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">Deputy Twomey is the latest in the chorus to claim we are constrained by the straitjacket left by the previous Government.  If the Deputy thought he could, he would probably try to pin responsibility for the kidnap of Shergar and several other incidents on the previous Government.  The zeal of some of his colleagues in their conversion to the deal is striking.  Yesterday the Minister, Deputy Burton, criticised Members of the Opposition for talking about default and for running down the country.  Those of us who have listened to her for the past four years — this is the lady who described Ireland as banjaxed — found it one conversion too many.  People have fears about the deal and not everybody fully understands why we are not burning bondholders.  It was a policy signed up to by members of the Government and was used as a rallying call during the general election campaign.  People now want to know why it is not possible.  We are not all financial experts but we need that information to be put forward as clearly as possible.  If Members of the Opposition want to ask questions or give views on that matter, they should be facilitated, at least in terms of the provision of information.  They should not be ballyragged for putting forward general policy reviews.  I agree with Deputy Twomey that default would be a disaster.  The people we are all committed to protecting in this House are those who feel the brunt of it in terms of services and welfare payments.  There is a need for intelligent, constructive discussion on our options for the stability programme.  It is impossible to have the discussion in this large Chamber.  The discussion should be held in committee whereby one could invite experts to make submissions and consider the options in a constructive, business-like manner.  A committee could point the way forward by providing answers for people's genuine questions on the stability programme update.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">Next week we will begin to see the colour of the Minister's money.  He has inherited a big burden, which I accept, but the jobs initiative, which started out as a jobs budget, became revenue neutral.  It will be the first chance for the Government to put its stamp on economic policy and to say what it feels.  From the leaks that have emerged thus far, I am not overly inspired.  It appears the Government is to get rid of the travel tax and do something on research and innovation.  There is a considerably large and superb budget for research and innovation and every cent of it is well spent.  However, what will it do for those in manufacturing and construction who are now looking for leadership and direction indicating they have a future in this country?  During the election campaign, they were told that the Government, within its first 100 days in office, would announce a big jobs budget.  The Taoiseach was rolling back from this yesterday and the five-point plan is now a five-point U-turn in terms of jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">The Minister for Finance is to make a statement next week.  The Minister responsible for jobs will not be involved in the delivery of that statement, or take questions thereon.  I hope that what is put on the table next Tuesday evening will offer some sort of direction and roadmap for those seeking employment, and not only for those who are lucky to have qualifications to be able to specialise in research and development.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">If we are to abolish the travel tax, let us get the airlines to commit to some sort of jobs initiative.  They are not necessarily the easiest organisations to deal with.  There is no sense in our cutting revenue off in the hope extra tourists will come to the country.  I do not envisage employment being created from the abolition of the travel tax but I look forward to seeing how it will work out.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">I genuinely wish the Minister for Finance well.  Both he and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, bring considerable experience to the Department of Finance.  Nobody in this House doubts that both have the best interests of the country at heart.  While I do not agree with Deputy Twomey's reference to an "economic war", we need all our weapons to be finely tuned.  We need our army to be fully trained.  The way the House is operating at present in the absence of a committee structure is disabling us in this regard.  The sooner we have a committee structure, the sooner we can have the required constructive debate.</p>

        <speech by="#AlexWhite" eId="spk_140">
          <from>Deputy Alex White</from>
          <p eId="para_196">I very much welcome what Deputy Calleary said.  I refer as much to the tone of what he has been saying as to the content.  Many of us in the House are savouring or waiting for the opportunity to participate in the new committees, be they finance committees or otherwise, to which they will be assigned.  There will be an opportunity for genuine debate on the issues that confront the country and for claim and counter-claim to be teased out.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">I detect from Deputy Calleary and some of his colleagues mounting frustration over the extent to which Members on the Government side and, perhaps, public commentators argue that policies promulgated by the previous Government are at the heart of our problems.  That argument is unanswerable.  I will not repeat it; suffice it to say it goes way beyond the normal rhetoric people somewhat cynically expect from any new Government, the kind in which every new Government allows itself to indulge for a few weeks or months.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">What happened over the past 12 to 15 months and also the past 12 to 15 years creates a legacy not only of incompetence but also of manifestly failed policies.  These were then matched with even worse failure in the attempt to reverse the effects of the decisions that were made.  We have discovered that every decision made from the guarantee onwards was not only substantially wrong in itself but actually had the effect of reducing the options the Government would have subsequently in rectifying what had been done.  This was the case right up the bailout.  Yesterday Deputy Michael McGrath said that before Christmas the then Opposition parties described the bailout as an obscenity and disaster and stated those parties are not saying that now they are in government.  It remains the case that what was done did constitute an obscenity and disaster.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">There is no use in criticising people for using the word "straitjacket", which is not a word discovered only after the election.  I distinctly remember the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, and myself using it prior to the election when assessing what had been done in respect of the bailout and agreement.  We stated the bailout would constitute an enormous constraint on the economic independence of the country for years.  Deputy Brian Lenihan, who was Minister for Finance, told me in the Seanad that he had written the next four budgets for this country.  He was revelling in this.  Let me quote him almost exactly <i>verbatim</i>: “I have written the budgets for the next four years in this country and you will depart from them at your peril.”  He did not tell us at that stage what he told us later, namely, that he was not actually holding the pen when writing those budgets, and that the budgets and economic decision-making were being done outside the country.  He had surrendered the economic independence of the country on key budgetary and economic issues in the course of the bailout he had entered into.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">The Government is criticised in the belief it has embraced the bailout and decided it is great.  This is not the case at all.  What the Government must do is live in the real world.  That is what it is doing in addition to setting up a track of renegotiation, pursuing changes in the agreement and seriously raising the question of burden-sharing.  It was told burden-sharing would not be countenanced by the European Central Bank, or our "Frankfurt masters" as Deputy O'Dea described it yesterday, but it pushed it in a robust way.  Whose fault is it that the phrase "Frankfurt masters" was used?  We will have to return to the issue of burden sharing because the level of debt is not sustainable in the medium to longer term.  This is my personal view from what I observe and read.  The debt will not be sustainable without serious concessions, be it through restructuring of the interest rate or the payback time.  Addressing this is the challenge the Government is confronting.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, is absolutely correct that it was never believed there would be a sprint and that renegotiation could take place in 24 hours, and that everything would be delivered.  It is a marathon not a sprint.  Deputy Donnelly made the fair point that we should put together a team and work together — we should get going on this — but prolonging engagement in the rhetoric that the Government parties are acquiescing in the bailout, as suggested by some Opposition parties, is not beneficial.  Living in the real world is what we are doing.  In addition to keeping gardaí, nurses and others paid and the State functioning, we are seeking to turn our attention to bringing about serious change and surmounting the problem we face.  I hope we will have an opportunity to tease out these issues at committee meetings.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">There are three broad areas we must address, which areas I do not want to over-simplify.  First, we must address how we reached the current position, be it through committees or the banking inquiry mentioned by Deputy Dara Calleary, on which the Government has started the ball rolling.  Second, how do we get out of this situation?  The Government is turning its attention to this question.  I heard two colleagues describe the jobs initiative to be introduced next week as a damp squib.  I could not describe anything I have not seen as a damp squib.  Deputy Willie O'Dea said he thought it would be, but, to be fair to him, he said he hoped it would not, which is something.  Let us wait and see.  The key element of what the Government must do is turning its attention to the jobs initiative.  That is the beginning of getting out of this position.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">The third issue is how to ensure we never return to this position.  That is a challenge for the Government which is also being addressed, whether it is through a change in the way the Houses operate and scrutinise business or constitutional change.  All of the areas the Government has indicated it intends to pursue will be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">The notion has been put forth by some Sinn Féin Members that the Government has comfortably slipped into the chair of governing and decided that this deal is wonderful and that it will just sit back.  That is not the position and I do not believe Deputy Pearse Doherty really believes it.  However, his position appears to be reduced to the following proposition, that if we remove Deputies Michael Noonan and Brendan Howlin, whom Deputy Dara Calleary has fairly indicated as very experienced people, from the negotiating table in Frankfurt and replace them with Deputies Pearse Doherty and Mary Lou McDonald or Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, their great negotiating skills will be of such strength and power that they will overwhelm the ECB and the European institutions and that when they return from Frankfurt 24 hours later, everything will be grand.  The proposition with which the Deputy has sought to persuade the House on more than one occasion is that the Government lacks negotiating skills and that its members should take a crash course from Sinn Féin on negotiating.  I thought he was joking, but his face was serious.</p>

          <p eId="para_207">This is serious business for serious people.  I acknowledge Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin is a serious contributor to the economic debate.  Let us have a serious debate instead of this nonsense, whereby people think we can wish something away.  Every time Deputy Mary Lou McDonald stands to speak, she seeks a vote on this issue.  Will voting make the problems go away?  She wants to see the Labour Party Members walk through the lobbies, the same lobbies her party's Members walked through to support the bank guarantee in September 2008.  They now say they had to do it to maintain money in the ATM machines.  It is a new found interest in ATM machines.  If we were to pursue the policies advocated by Sinn Féin in recent months, that we should turn our backs and tell the ECB to shove it, there would be nothing in ATM machines.</p>

          <p eId="para_210">It was certainly not as insightful as the speaker might have intended.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">I will start my short contribution by expressing deep disappointment not only on my own behalf and that of my parliamentary colleagues in Sinn Féin but also on behalf of the many thousands who will be bitterly disappointed with the document we are discussing.  As was pointed out by Deputies Pearse Doherty, Mary Lou McDonald and Peader Tóibín yesterday, the current draft of the EU-IMF support programme is in substance and spirit, despite claims to the contrary, the same document as that agreed by the Fianna Fáil and Green Party Government last December.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">I listened carefully to the speeches of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, yesterday and did not hear one substantive policy proposal or initiative indicating that the programme agreed by the last Government had been renegotiated in a meaningful way.  What I heard from the Minister for Finance was little more than a justification for reintroducing the same failed policies of a bank bailout and austerity measures promoted by the last Government.  He said he was happy with the flexibility shown by the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund which allowed the Government to introduce "important policy measures".  He proceeded to list these measures, including the reversal of the cut in the minimum wage, the comprehensive spending review, the jobs initiative and so-called important changes to banking policy.  However, when one examines the text of the EU-IMF programme, one realises none of these measures departs from the substance of the original Fianna Fáil and Green Party deal with the so-called Troika.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">The reversal of the cut in the minimum wage is undoubtedly welcome.  Sinn Féin campaigned with others against the original cut when it was imposed.  However, Fine Gael and the Labour Party have balanced this decision with a clear commitment to attack the wages of up to 300,000 low paid workers in the State.  The revised EU-IMF programme clearly indicates that significant changes to the wage rates set through the registered employment agreements and employment regulation orders are to be delivered this year.  Let there be no mistake that when changes are spoken about in this context, what is meant is cuts.  Such cuts will not only drive thousands of families deeper into debt and poverty, they will also further depress the economy, particularly local and regional economies, resulting in increasing levels of private sector unemployment.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">The revised EU-IMF programme also contains a commitment to reduce the public sector payroll either through cuts in the number of staff or cuts in wages.  Not only will these measures continue to undermine the ability of front-line public service providers to cope with increasing levels of demand in schools, hospitals and community services in general, they will also further depress the economy, particularly local economies, resulting in further job losses.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">The cuts do not stop there.  Yesterday the Minister lauded the introduction of the comprehensive spending review as a sign of the Troika's flexibility.  The spending review is about introducing further cuts in spending on public services, particularly health, education and social welfare.  None of this represents a departure in any shape or form from the parameters of the agreement reached by the previous Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">What is probably the single largest disappointment in the document is the paragraph on the so-called jobs initiative.  Throughout the general election campaign both Fine Gael and the Labour Party told the electorate that the only way to get the economy back on track was by creating jobs.  I agree that creating jobs is an essential element if we are to turn the economy around.  The Taoiseach had a five point plan to get Ireland back to work, while the Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, promised a strategic investment bank with substantial funds to invest in employment.  Despite these promises, the 41 page revised EU-IMF programme contains only a single sentence on job creation, promising that the now downgraded jobs initiative will be revenue neutral.  While we will not know the full detail of this initiative until next week, there is little doubt in my mind and in the minds of many other people that it will pale into insignificance when set alongside the hefty pre-election promises of the parties which form this new coalition Government.  That will be a bitter disappointment to the hundreds of thousands of men and women across the country who are unemployed, who are struggling to find work and who are waiting to see what the Government will do to assist them.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">The final matter to which I refer relates to the banks.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, suggested that the Government had secured significant changes in this area of policy.  However, the truth tells a very different story.  The banking policy contained in the revised programme continues the failed approach of the previous Government to pump billions of taxpayers' euros — including up to €10 billion from the National Pensions Reserve Fund — into toxic banks without any social or economic reward to the State or its people.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">Unfortunately, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, and his Government colleagues have neither the will nor the ability to secure the kind of change in policy they promised the electorate in the run-up to polling day on 25 February.  The simple reason for this is that they have never offered a real alternative.  There is no evidence of such an alternative.  Despite the rhetoric and the empty promises, those now in government were always committed to implementing the same failed policies of bailing out the banks, imposing public service cuts and promoting austerity pursued by those who preceded them in office, namely, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">I will comment on the remarks of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton.  The previous speaker also referred to the Minister's contribution.  Unable to respond directly to the criticisms levelled by my party colleagues, Deputy Burton again tried to deflect those criticisms by misrepresenting decisions taken by Sinn Féin in respect of the bank guarantee of September 2008.  The Minister is well aware — she was a Member at the time — that the version of events she recounted is neither accurate nor honest.  More significant is that while they opposed the guarantee when in opposition, the Minister and her Labour Party colleagues are not willing to reverse that guarantee now that they are in government.  The real test of a political party is not what is says in opposition but rather what it does in government.  On the basis of its ongoing support for the blanket guarantee, the Labour Party has clearly failed the test in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">I reiterate the views expressed by Deputies Doherty, McDonald and Tóibín to the effect that the revised EU-IMF programme presented to us yesterday by the Government represents nothing more than the same failed policies agreed by Fianna Fáil and the Green Party in 2010.  It will do nothing to address the social and economic problems the State faces; neither will it do anything to get people back to work, to reform our public services or to restructure our banking system in the interests of society and the economy.  It again demonstrates that the parties in government may be different in name than their predecessors but that, in substance, they are exactly the same.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</from>
          <p eId="para_221">Listening to Deputy Ó Caoláin reminds me of reading the Desperate Dan comic strip.  He offered no solutions and all he put forward was a criticism and a rejection of the programme.  I remind the members of Fianna Fáil that it was not the Fine Gael-Labour Government which capitulated on behalf of the Irish people, rather it was their party which surrendered our economic sovereignty.  It was also their party which abandoned the principles of good governance and which failed the test with regard to oversight and regulation of the banks.  It was Fianna Fáil which helped to propel us to the position in which we now find ourselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">There is no ambiguity on this side of the House with regard to corporation tax or seeking a lower interest rate from the EU and the IMF.  I agree with Deputy Calleary's assertion that we need a review of expenditure.  Said review must be carried out in a manner that is honest and transparent.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">Those opposite have commented on our dealings with the EU and the IMF.  There is no one in the House who wants this country to be beholden to others for financial support.  However, from where would the money we require come if it were not being provide by the EU and the IMF?  What does default actually mean?  How would those opposite make the necessary choices in respect of closing schools, not opening hospital wards, making gardaí redundant or not employing additional teachers?  What would they do?  It is not possible to traverse Europe waving one's flag and stating that one is for everything and against nothing.  Sinn Féin has served in government in the North.  Its members have made choices, negotiated and been responsible.  Its representatives in this House should also be responsible and should work with us.  They should assume the mantle of collective governance and work with the rest of us in the people's interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">I am becoming tired of those who sit in the uppermost tier of seats on the far side of the House stating that it is they who have the concerns of ordinary people at heart.  Those of us on this side are ordinary people.  Every day we meet individuals — family members, friends, neighbours, relations and constituents — who are experiencing financial difficulties.  You do not have a monopoly on care for the concerns of ordinary citizens.  We all have a responsibility for it, so stop preaching to us on this side of the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_230">I am for solutions, whereas those opposite have offered none.  Let us engage in a debate on that matter.  Those on the Opposition benches should show us the colour of their money.  How do they propose to bring about a renewal and a reform of our country?  We are all seeking a society where people will be employed, where their homes will be protected and where small and medium-sized enterprises and entrepreneurs will be rewarded so that they might renew their operations and take on additional staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">The measures the Government is implementing will lead to a period of recovery.  I was heartened by the Taoiseach's remarks this morning to the effect that any increase in our rate of corporation tax would be a breach of trust, particularly in the context of foreign direct investment from America.  He is right: there must be no capitulation regarding our corporation tax rate.  Within its first 100 days, the Government will have introduced a jobs initiative.  The latter is due to be unveiled on Tuesday next.  The Government has been in office for ten weeks.  It has already addressed the banking system, which was about to collapse under the previous regime, restored the minimum wage and will, as already stated, introduce a jobs initiative next Tuesday which will assist in the creation of employment and in placing a value on work.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">This Administration has also begun a process of reform across the entire structure of government.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, has courageously spoken about public sector reform.  I am a public servant and I will defend the public sector.  However, the Croke Park agreement must be implemented and it must be honoured by everyone in the public service because we must deliver value for money to the people.  I am confident that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the remainder of the Cabinet will engage with their European counterparts.  I am also confident that there will be reduction in the interest rate being charged by EU and the IMF, that our rate of corporation tax will be protected, and as the Taoiseach stated yesterday, that our economic sovereignty will be returned to us by 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">It is important that the Government should be honest with the people and that it should tell the electorate the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  While unpalatable, the deal with the EU and the IMF is necessary.  It will lead to the creation of a better Ireland where all citizens — be they involved in central or local government, those who work in the banks, developers or ordinary people — will be more prudent in the context of what they do.  There must be accountability in Irish life and this Government has brought it back.  There must be transparency and this Government is doing that.  There must be regulation and this Government is doing that.  I am looking forward to having a debate in two and a half years, at the midway point for this Government, when we will see a positive reflection of the Government's actions on behalf of the people.  If Members want to go back to the general election, we must remember that the people sought change.  They asked for a different type of government and a different style of governance.  They want to have the unemployed back at work.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">Job creation will be at the core of this Government's actions.  We have already seen the creation of two new pillar banks as an important plank of Government policy.  It is equally important that we protect the homeowner and the ordinary citizen.  The chosen few can no longer be allowed to dictate policy in this country.  The common good of our citizens must be at the heart of government.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">I am happy that the political reform announced by the Government and repeated yesterday by the Minister, Deputy Hogan, will demonstrate the leadership that is wanted by the people.  It is not just about the abolition of the Seanad or about the reduction in the number of Ministers or TDs, but about political reform and change in the structure of government.  We have seen it already and I hope it continues.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">Like many Members, I was at the 1916 commemoration mass in Arbour Hill yesterday.  I was struck by a paragraph in Archbishop Martin's very fine homily:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_237">The dream of 1916 was a Republic. A Republic is one where power is vested in the people. But a real republic is one, not just in which power is vested in the people, but one in which responsibility is assumed by the people. Just as in 1916, our modern day Republic requires leaders of vision, but it requires above all the tears and fears, the dreams and commitments of our citizens and families and communities who decide that they do not wish to belong to the disinterested or the distracted or the self centred.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">I am confident that following Tuesday's jobs budget, there will be a period of prosperity for our people.  The vision, the leadership and the responsibility of the Government are about ending emigration, creating jobs, protecting homeowners, rewarding entrepreneurs, and protecting the most vulnerable in society.  In doing that, it must be responsible.  The Members opposite have sometimes not been responsible.  They want to abandon everything and spend, spend and spend.  Where will that money come from?  If one spends €100 per week on the household budget but one does not have that, then what does one do?</p>
          <p eId="para_239">Let us recognise that we are not in an easy place.  A recovery will not be led by developers or bankers, but by all of us as citizens.  It will be led by the Government through rewarding entrepreneurship, through our export-led recovery, through tourism and through agriculture.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">Many people today are living on the edge.  They are barely surviving.  They do not want to be kept in the dark like they were under the previous Government.  If we are bringing in a reduction in spending and new taxes, let us be honest, fair and upright with the people.  I challenge the Members opposite to show me a better way than what we have at the moment.  Let them show me the colour of their money.</p>

        <speech by="#JoanCollins" eId="spk_153">
          <from>Deputy Joan Collins</from>
          <p eId="para_241">I would first like to refer to the extremely silly remarks made by the Minister, Deputy Burton, about the technical group voting for the bank guarantee.  The Minister knows very well that the composition of the technical group in this Dáil is different from that of the last Dáil.  There are very serious issues at stake and we could do without this type of silliness.  The five ULA Members opposed the guarantee, were in favour of the nationalisation of the banks and the establishment of a State banking system.  This is still our position.  The fact that the Labour Party voted against the bank guarantee is now irrelevant, given what it has signed up to in the coalition with the IMF, the ECB and the European Commission.  This is one coalition Government where the tail certainly will not wag the dog, as the Labour Party has quickly found out.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">It is quite insulting for the Minister for Finance to come into this House and present the most cosmetic of changes as something that has any significance.  We are being challenged by a number of Labour Party and Fine Gael Members to provide an alternative if we were not able to pay our gardaí, civil servants, hospital staff and so on.  However, the reality is that the current Government has just taken the purse from Fianna Fáil and has kept dipping into the same purse.  We are arguing that there is money outside of that purse in the hands of the very wealthy of this country and that this money has not been touched.  They are responsible for contributing to the economic crisis in this country, yet they have not been touched.  The Government is continuing with the same policy of going back into the pockets of ordinary people.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">The programme of austerity, which the Government intends to continue, has squeezed any prospect of growth out of the economy.  This is the key factor in why we are heading towards an inevitable sovereign default.  There have been cries that the minimum wage has been reversed, but that has not touched the coffers of this Government.  In the meantime, the Government is looking at making an impact on the lives of more than 250,000 low-paid workers in the hotel and catering industry, by attacking the EROs and discussing the JLCs.  While pay packets have been absolutely hammered by the introduction of the universal social charge, the Government has not reversed that decision.  It intends to bring in more taxes that will impact on the pockets of ordinary people.  This will curtail growth further, because when people do not have money to spend, that affects small local businesses and the jobs they provide, and it ends up impacting on the lives of ordinary people.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">There are to be cuts to our hospital services and our education system, with a cap on SNEs and other resource teachers.  What might happen in the event of a default is happening anyway.  It is like the slow strangulation of our economy.  The fact is that we are going to default.  Even the right wing economists are saying that there will be a default.  It is a question now of whether we default on our own terms or on the terms of the IMF and the EU.  We should default as soon as possible on our terms and discuss what we can do in that case.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">The Portuguese have already got a better deal than ourselves.  This came out over the last few days, but we will have to see the devil in the detail because they are going through an election and much of the detail will be withheld until afterwards.  We can look at a different deal for Ireland.  We can put in place alternatives that keep our economy and public sector ticking over.  We will continue to outline them.  We have called for the reorganisation of the banking system into a State banking sector.  We want to close budget deficits with wealth taxes and end tax exemptions.  We have seen a Minister, already a very wealthy man, avail of a tax exemption for stately homes and people like him line their own pockets.  There is around €11 billion in tax breaks at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">There should be caps on wages of anything earned over €100,000.  There should also be a tax on pensions over €100,000.  We do not have to renegotiate these contracts, we can bring in a tax of 95 cent on the euro to deal with this.  It can be applied to civil servants.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Collins</from>
          <p eId="para_248">Yes, everything over €100,000 at 95%.  That would bring a massive amount of money into the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">We are in a serious situation.  We are in a crisis situation and those who have the money should be putting into the economy what they need to over the next period of time rather than the Government coming back repeatedly to the blind, the disabled and the low-paid worker.  There should be higher taxes on higher incomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">We should take control of our natural resources and develop a national jobs plan for economic recovery.  In the 1940s and 1950s, the Government brought into play the ESB and Bord Gáis to redevelop the economy.  Every home and part of the country was supplied with electricity.  There is now an opportunity for every household and company to be retrofitted with water supplies, insulation and the like.  That can be done through a public jobs plan to get people back to work, to fix the water supplies and to build schools where children are still in pre-fabs for which the Government is paying large sums on rent every year.  We should be building proper schools for children for now and for the future.  All this can be done and the Government can play a key role in creating jobs in this regard and have a proper public jobs plan to be driven by it.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">There are alternatives and we have put them forward, time and again.  We are not preaching.  We are merely putting forward an alternative way to raise money.  That is not being cocky in any shape or form.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">These are the issues that people raised with us at the doorsteps when we canvassed during the general election campaign.  I am sure they are the issues that were raised with others who were elected as Deputies.  The last election should have been a referendum on the EU-IMF loan.  The message we must get out to Europe is that it is a loan, not a bailout.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Collins</from>
          <p eId="para_258">I stated that the changes were cosmetic.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DamienEnglishFG" eId="spk_162">
          <from>Deputy Damien English</from>
          <p eId="para_259">The Minister gave the facts, stating that there have been some benefits from greater engagement — nothing to get excited about — and that progress is being made.  All we will ever do when a review is undertaken is to make some progress.  Neither of the Government parties claimed that it would do any better than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">We, in Fine Gael, were clear from the outset in stating that we agreed with the targets and the aim to get the budget deficit down to 3% of GDP by 2015.  We wanted to reach it earlier and we were the first to say so.  We never veered from that in the course of the general election campaign.  However, we always stated there are different ways of reaching the targets and that remains the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">Built into this programme are many changes.  A major change is the comprehensive spending review, which, I am sure, the next Minister to speak will address.  That is key.  The more progress we make and solutions we find there, the less pain must be inflicted in other areas and the less money must be charged.  If there are more savings made and new practises brought in to save spending money, then the Government will have to raise less money off the backs of people through ways we outlined and which, unfortunately, will inflict pain.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">The figures can be changed in different areas once the end target is achieved.  That is what we must do.  It will be the work of the Government over the next four, five or six months and beyond.  It will involve every Deputy giving his or her ideas.  In this regard even the proposals made by Deputy Joan Collins should be considered.  Nothing will be ruled out because the Government has stated clearly we will review the programme and make changes where we can.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">There is no point in kidding ourselves here, expecting that the Government would change this entire document in its first six or seven weeks in office.  It does not work that way.  While we would wish it were otherwise we are stuck with the agreement, therefore, it wold be good if were able to change some of its terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">As a result of the failings of the past couple of Governments led by one party, Fianna Fáil, it is the case that, as they say, "We are where we are".  We are in serious debt.  Apart from the banking debt, to run this country for the next three or four years we need over €60 billion on top of the money we raise through taxes, etc.  Even if taxes on high earners were increased we would still need €50 billion or €60 billion.  It is why this support was accepted from the IMF.  We need the money to run the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">With respect, and I debated this with Deputy Adams after the election, Sinn Féin is not clear on where it would raise the €60 billion.  It has answers on how to raise the first €10 billion to €15 billion needed for the first year but there are three or four years involved.  If one defaults or does not take the support, one would need to raise such funding to run the country or else cut the deficit in the first year, which means being short almost €20 billion this year and each of the next two years.  That is where the problem lies.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">Our job in Government is to close that gap and get the deficit down.  No doubt we will do so but it will not happen overnight.  It will take time.  It will take everyone's efforts and ideas on all sides to get the deficit down through spending reductions, savings, bringing in new practises and applying common sense in terms of how we do our business.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">In the period 2001-08 expenditure was let go mad in nearly every Department, by up to 140% in most cases, 150% in others.  It was lunacy.  It should not have been let happen, but it did happen and now we must correct it.  While it is being corrected money must be borrowed and that is why we are stuck with this agreement.  Hopefully, every time we go back for a review we will get more changes and the pain will ease.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">There are some successes in this review, if one wants to call them that, which we had signalled before the election we had intended to implement.  There is to be some kind of jobs initiative.  The agreement and the last budget did little for jobs.  We have secured agreement to address that aspect and our initiative will be announced next week.  It will not solve everything but it will be a start in the right direction to restore confidence and give businesses a chance to employ more people.  All it will involve is a start, with small initiatives in different Departments to give us a chance.  Hopefully, we can do more in the budget at the end of the year and also next year.  It will only be a start but it is better than what was there previously and it will give some hope to people.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">The Government parties have stated they are committed to the targets and guidelines set out in the budget for 2011 and 2012, following which there will be a review to see how we can manage the other couple of years in the light of economic growth and other factors.  That was agreed in this review.  We now have agreement to review progress half way through the programme and to make changes as we proceed with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">The other important issues involve the proposed changes to NAMA.  I had a serious difficulty with NAMA when it was set up and I was one of the few to speak about it in this House.  NAMA was wrong from day one and it is still wrong.  However it, too, is now in place.  We gave a commitment that we would try to make it work better and more transparently and provide greater tax savings and we will do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">We also stated that we would make NAMA kick-start the property market or let it bottom out, by making NAMA sell assets.  If NAMA holds onto everything, everybody else is waiting before making a move because it is one of the major players in the market.  It is built into this document that NAMA must sell at least 25% of what is on its books by 2013.  That is another achievement in terms of getting the market moving again.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">We have also stopped the transfer of loans of €20 million or less into NAMA, which is a good idea.  Those loans should remain with the banks because they contain some assets that others might want to buy and they might be worth more than what NAMA would pay for them.  If they were to be transferred to NAMA they would crystalise more losses in the banks.  That is another small achievement.  These are not big measures but they are measures we stated we would take.  We did not promise we would turn the economy around in one day because one cannot do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">What is most important is that we used the review to try to regain some credibility.  Ireland's reputation is mud all over Europe because time after time Ministers came in here and issued figures and plans and spoke of hopes of turning the corner, etc., none of which was true.  Every time a Minister made a statement here that turned out to be untrue three or six months later, our reputation was further eroded.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">The Government has a major job to rebuild that reputation.  It will do it over a couple of years by negotiating, playing the game, meeting people and putting Ireland's case by explaining what we are trying to do as a new Government and how we will try to fix matters.  Over time, one rebuilds credibility and trust, which will give more opportunities to receive better reductions in interest rates and greater changes in restructuring debt, and to have even more change than is in the document to try to ease the pain for people who cannot take it.  Our job is to rebuild our credibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">Yesterday evening, I had to laugh when I heard Deputy Pearse Doherty speak about crack negotiating teams renegotiating this in a week.  Sinn Féin would be the first to admit that negotiations can take a long time and do not happen in eight weeks.  It takes years to effect real change.  We have made a small impact in a couple of weeks to put the banking situation on a sound footing and bring some clear direction by making decisions and taking action.  This will help us regain our credibility to negotiate further.  It is a joke for a member of Sinn Féin to speak about negotiating as if it were something one can do in a week.  It is expert in negotiations and I will admit it is good at it; it had different ways of doing it but it achieved results.  However that took a long time.  Likewise, this will take us a long time as it cannot be fixed overnight.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">It is essential that we approach it correctly and do what we stated we would do.  We are doing so and we did not misrepresent anything.  What is key is to find where money is being wasted in every Department and correct it.  To achieve what we stated we would achieve we must reduce the numbers employed by the State.  When the numbers increased in 2001 and 2008 so did employment, as more than 70,000 extra people were employed in the public service.  These people were given false hope by the previous Government through higher wages and lower tax.  This was wrong.  People borrowed money and got into debt because they were given false hope.  This is where the pain is.  As we close the gap and return to the spending and employment levels we should be at, people will suffer.  We must try to do this as best we can.  We know money is being wasted in every Department and that money can be spent better.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">We have to change our work practices and what we do, and effecting this change will be the job of Deputy Brendan Howlin.  This is how we will put the country back on a sound footing so that we can borrow from the markets as we should be able to do, be in control of our own affairs, be able to decide who we tax and what services will be reduced.  I do not like being told what to do either, but we must get ourselves in a position whereby we can take control of this.  This will happen only with honesty, credibility and action.  We cannot sit back and hope the problem will go away.  We must deal with it, which is what we have been discussing in recent days.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">I ask everyone on the other side of the House to be realistic and work with us on it.  We will have different policies when it comes to taxing people, but there are many areas on which we can agree.  We can debate whom to tax.  It is an issue that if the wealthy are taxed too much they will move their money.  We must have balance.  It is not as simple as whacking a large tax on people.  If pressed, they can move their assets and money.  We need to try to work this out.  However, it is correct to state that those who can pay should take more of the hit than those who cannot pay.  We have to try to achieve this.</p>

          <p eId="para_287">I am not disputing there is a huge amount of waste and that we need savings.  However, the savings in terms of the money that will be raised will be a pittance in comparison to the €60 billion or the €120 billion or whatever figure one takes.  Yes, savings will be made, but savings alone will not dig us out of a hole which was created by the previous Administration, and I accept that.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">I look forward to the introduction of a job stimulus package on Tuesday because we need one.  I do not think the Minister, Deputy Noonan, will go far enough.  More radical proposals need to come forward to get people back to work because unless our society gets back to work the black hole will deepen.  The austerity measures taken and the wages people will be on will not stimulate local economies or bring back retail, manufacturing or supplier jobs.  Next week, we will debate whatever is created on Tuesday and we will put forward proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">Major problems exist in our present situation and the alleged stability programme states on page 8, "The global economy recorded stronger than expected growth in the second half of 2010, and the expectation is world growth will continue to expand at a solid pace in the coming years."  This is to be accepted and I do not think anybody will dispute it.  Unfortunately, the problem is that this is not the case for Ireland because the State will continue to be dragged down by the unsustainable debt taken on by the taxpayer on behalf of the failed banking sector.  While exports are predicted to rise, the report admits — and this is key — that domestic demand is set to remain lacklustre for some time to come.  Not only will it be lacklustre but it will continue to recede.  The programme also states that disposable incomes are likely to decline in real terms and this is also a key issue.  Perhaps this is to be reasonably expected but one might ask who is benefiting from the increase in exports.  It is not the Irish taxpayer.</p>

I am stating that companies in Ireland are increasing their export levels which means their profits are increasing but no new jobs have been created in these fields.  I am not giving out about these companies; I welcome that fact.  What I am stating is that the workers in these companies are not benefiting additionally.  They are benefiting by the fact that they have a job but they are not benefiting additionally because they are not benefiting from increased wages in those companies.</p>

          <p eId="para_304">We have seen previous forecasts for growth rates last year and this year which were totally off the mark.  We might be advised to take the current forecast of modest growth in the economy in the coming years with a grain of salt.  Again, this will be determined by budgets and whatever proposal the Minister for Finance brings to the House on Tuesday.  I think that prediction of modest growth over the next few years is far off the mark.  There is a connection, of course, between the fact that people's incomes are in decline and a resulting decrease in domestic demand.  There is a continuing stagnation of local economies in many areas, with shops and factories closed and accompanying dereliction.  Except for the welcome increase in exports I do not see any proposals for getting local economies back to work.  If the Government continues with austerity measures there will be fewer pennies in people's pockets.  A drop in spending will result in local shops and companies being put into receivership.  To date, we have not seen evidence of the major steps which are required.  Some may be planned for the future but the urgency is not evident.  I acknowledge the Government has only been in place for a few months but some of its decisions thus far are not in tune with what I believe is required to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">One does not need to be a Nobel laureate in economics to realise that if billions of euro are taken out of people's pockets, the economy will be further depressed.  People must be encouraged to release their savings.  I do not blame people for saving their money but money must be spent for an economy to be active.  It is a scandalous fact that significant sums of money — I do not have the figure to hand but it may be two trillion or three trillion euro — in Irish pension and investment funds are invested abroad.</p>

          <p eId="para_307">There is a lot more than €75 billion being invested abroad by Irish pension and investment funds.  However, whatever the figure, it is unpatriotic at a time of crisis.  We must find a system to encourage Irish money to be invested in Ireland rather than being invested in Germany or elsewhere.  If such moneys are not invested in this country we must find a way to impose a levy so the Irish people can obtain a benefit from such moneys.  Levies have been imposed on Irish taxpayers and this would be another method of levying moneys which are floating outside this economy.  This is Irish money which needs to be invested in Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_311">I am pleased to have another opportunity to speak on this subject.  Any person observing our position from abroad would come to the conclusion that somewhere along the line we have missed something and we do not seem to have recognised the awkward and difficult situation in which we find ourselves.  I reiterate that this is a very difficult situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">I have great respect for the previous speaker, Deputy Ó Snodaigh, who has been a Member of the House for some time.  However, I am worried about his naivety as regards the situation.  A famous man once wrote that no man is an island.  Ireland is geographically an island but we have commitments elsewhere and we did not do the job we were supposed to do.  I am not attempting to blame previous Administrations but it is a fact that we are in this situation as a result of a variety of reasons.  Reference was made to the various information from the Department of Finance.  I do not intend to be disrespectful to any Department or anyone who negotiated on behalf of the country over the past ten years but whatever information was given and whatever action was taken, they were insufficient and unsoundly based and they did not have any beneficial effect on the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">Benefits for the people and the workers of this country will come from a strong economy and from employment.  This does not mean that those who were in a particular employment, whether in the public or private sector, should be rewarded.  Sadly, we are not in a position to reward ourselves at this time.  We all meet and know people who are really pushed to the wall.  They did not contribute to the country's downfall.  I agree they accepted whatever was going because everybody told them that we were the richest country in the world.  Where did we get that information?  Who told us?  It was all a farce and we were codding and deluding ourselves.</p>

          <p eId="para_315">People arrived from across the world to find out how we have come to this conclusion.  They were here almost every week wondering about the Celtic tiger — the myth of the Celtic tiger, as has been clearly illustrated.  They do not come anymore because they see that we were deluding ourselves.  We were living in a land of myth,leprechauns and fairies.  That is all over now and it is time that reality dawned upon us.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">It has been reported that property prices have now bottomed out but I disagree.  A European Union colleague referred to this country as being one of the most expensive countries with the highest wages in the eurozone but no reference was made to the fact that our high property prices were the highest in Europe for some considerable time, both inside and outside the eurozone.  I do not know how we came to the conclusion that this was sustainable.  Whether we like it or not, there is a gap of €20 billion which we must address.  It will mean hardship for every citizen and for a long time to come.  It does not make any difference what any economist says because we have to pick up this baton and run with it by ourselves.  It will be down to us and not down to any expert opinion or advice from any quarter.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">Having listened to what we were told over the past ten or 15 years, I am horrified that so much was taken for granted by people who should know better.  What happened over that period cannot be reversed in ten or 15 days or even in ten or 15 months but it has to be resolved.  The biggest single contribution we can make is to show those outside this country that we are capable of taking on this project because the alternative is political oblivion.  This may not be realised by people.  We will either sink or swim.  We will either prove we are ready for it and capable of delivering or we will succumb and be swamped.  It is very easy for the Opposition to say we have been in government for the past two or three months and we have not solved the problem.  I am tired of us being lectured by leaders of other countries.  I am also tired of lectures from potential leaders of this country as to what we should do.  We have arrived at a very difficult juncture and we are now paying the price.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">The banking system has been discussed on many occasions.  We all have experience of constituents at various levels of society who ran into difficulty with the banking system.  This applies to the small business sector in particular.  People ran businesses well and did not over borrow and ran their show as it should have been run.  However, when they applied for a renewal of their overdraft, they were told by the bank that it was time for the banks to look over their business.  The banks called in part of the overdraft and offered it as a term loan over a period.  That was the end of the discussion.  That is not how this is supposed to work.  A great deal of money has been provided to the banking system in this country and it is time for the banking system to prove it is capable of doing the job it has been given.  All of this happened while they were on watch.  The time has come for the banks to show they are capable of so doing their job, having particular regard to the fact they did not do a very good job over the past ten or 15 years.  They resented any attempt by anyone to suggest they might have been wrong.  What an appalling thing it was to suggest that ordinary human beings might be wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">We must address the situation, engage with it and overcome it.  If we do not do that, our position will get worse.  We must also engage with our European colleagues in the national parliaments of other member states because they think we are a bunch of delusionists who believe in magic.  They believe we have been avoiding the issue for several years.  They have listened to us carefully and they have come to a conclusion.  The time has come to address the issue, to stand up and be counted and to avoid saying popular and populist things.  We must address this difficult situation and, most important, we must not mislead the people.  We must not pretend there are easy options because there are none.  If we do our job, difficult as it may be, ultimately we will come through.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_320">The word "bailout" has been bothering me for some time so I looked up the meaning of the term.  The EU-IMF deal does not refer to a bailout.  In economic terms, a bailout is an act of loaning or giving capital to an entity in danger of failing, in an attempt to save it from bankruptcy, insolvency or total ruin, or to allow a failing entity to fail gracefully without spreading contagion.  I am not sure what we got but what we got practically guarantees we will fail.  There is very little prospect of doing so gracefully.  How can a country with almost 500,000 people unemployed and 1,000 of the brightest and best leaving every week pay a debt of the magnitude of the debt we face?  How can we do this when our so-called friends and partners impose an interest rate of 6% at the same time as they insist we take billions out of our economy, which means there is no prospect of reinflating the same economy?  The answer is that this cannot be done.  Does anyone believe it can be done?  I wonder whether the Government believes it can be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">At the time, the Labour Party was forceful about the situation facing Anglo Irish Bank.  It was a private entity and there was no obligation on the taxpayers of this country to put tens of billions of euro into the bank to save it.  What exactly were we saving it from?  Many of us sought to burn the bond holders and I do not mind what people call this.  It was not a sovereign debt, it was a bank debt.  What did it have to do with sovereign debt?  Who will pay the nurses, teachers and pensions in 2013?  After 2013, burden sharing will be imposed and it will be a requirement.  This will only take place after we have paid back the German, French and British bondholders.  We will have burned our bridges by that stage.  The ECB is the foremost authority on, and has ultimate responsibility for, the eurozone.  We are members of the eurozone.  It was not screaming from the rooftops about our AAA-rated banks before the collapse.  A single A rating is how the ECB defines the rating that underpins high credit standards.  Indeed, many of the ECB papers produced prior to 2008 used international rating agencies such as Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, which are hugely discredited and which attached the AAA rating to the Irish banks.  This included Anglo Irish Bank before the collapse.  The ECB were experts then and they are the experts now.  They told our then Minister for Finance not to allow Anglo Irish Bank or other Irish banks to fail.  Did the Minister know that saving the bank would be the exclusive responsibility of the Irish taxpayers?  If one is told that the banks cannot be allowed to fail and that they are not sovereign entities, the instruction brings with it an obligation to have some burden sharing at the very least.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">Over recent years there has been talk of a two-speed Europe.  People can look around and see countries such as Portugal and Greece in the same boat as ourselves and Spain, where unemployment is above 20%.  Like us, they are on the slow train to nowhere.  We have a two-speed Europe in the making.  The ECB interest rate policy was partly responsible for inflating the property bubble.  Now, when peripheral countries need a lower interest rate, the ECB imposes the very opposite.  Europe is unravelling at the edges.  It is like picking away at a garment.  The whole thing will come apart unless there is a comprehensive solution.  I do not want to see good countries like Spain having to seek EU, IMF and ECB support or bailout before a comprehensive solution is provided at European level.  It seems obvious that the European Council meetings are dominated by a monetary crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">The success of the euro is far from certain at this stage.  It is obvious that it lacks a political dimension.  How many Europeans would like to have more rather than less Europe at this stage?  Next week, we will debate a jobs initiative.  In addition to cutting out waste, growth and employment were advanced as the ways we would improve our fiscal situation.  Some €2 billion was to be put into a strategic investment bank.  Now we will have a jobs strategy that will be finance neutral.  How many jobs will it create?  I hope it will create jobs but I have my doubts when we do not have the other side, the strategic investment bank.  It is difficult to see how it would produce the numbers we need if democracy is to mean anything.  What is said at elections must mean something.  The citizens have had their revenge on Fianna Fáil, rightly so, but we are seeing a continuation of the policies for which they were punished.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">Next week we will have a debate on Europe.  Monday is Europe day.  We look forward to it but in the coming years we will commemorate the awful events of the Great War.  The Menin Gate lists the names of more than 50,000 men killed and buried without graves.  This was hardly constructed before the Second World War had started.  People were still mourning those who were killed and it was still in living memory when the Second World War started.  A. J.Cummings, an infantry man, wrote of the horror in the following words:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_325">Every yard of that featureless slab of landscape held the menace of death.  If you were not there, the war films would have told you what it was like.  If you were there, the war films would have made you laugh.  For those few miles of ground, north and south of the terrible road that runs from Ypres to Menin, bear lasting witness to the indestructible tendency of the human spirit.  After the nightmare of Passchendaele there is no conceivable cataclysm of war or nature which civilised man might not endure.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">The basis of the European Union grew out of those conflicts, yet what we are seeing is a retrenching back to narrow national interests and a movement away from a single Europe.  We must see what is occurring in the peripheral regions of Europe as a threat to the European Union.  The European Union has led to European stability.  We must recognise that the countries on the periphery of Europe are in serious trouble.  We should look beyond ourselves and ask what would happen if one or more of those countries fail.  Will we go from one bailout to another?  Will we continue to have European Council meetings dominated by crisis after crisis?  Will we see those countries impoverished?  I campaigned actively against both the Single European Act and the Maastricht treaty.  They were sold on the basis of Structural Funds and I do not believe the substance of those treaties was properly debated.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">We must recognise that Europe, not just Ireland, is at a crossroads.  It is in our interests and in the interests of Europe to look at the big picture and find political solutions because I cannot see where they are coming from, and I do not see where the leadership is coming from in Europe.  This is not just about Ireland.  This is not just about the bailout.</p>

          <p eId="para_332">——for the Irish Parliament, Dáil Éireann, a supposedly sovereign Parliament elected by the people of Ireland, and yet the document before us, the Programme of Financial Support for Ireland and the report on the first and second quarters, addressed to Jean-Claude Juncker, the Eurogroup President of the Financial Ministry, Olli Rehn, the Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Jean-Claude Trichet, the European Central Bank president, and others, could be the report of a consul in the ancient Roman empire sent to some far distant place to exact tribute, from the natives and then obliged to make regular reports on the rate of extraction of tribute, with the threat of force and the power of an empire behind him.  That is what this document reminds me of.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">There is great detail in this document with regard to the burden put on the Irish people to pay off the tens of billions of euro of bad gambling debts by European bankers, speculating with Irish bankers and developers in the Irish property bubble to reap massive profits when the going was good but then transferring that onto the shoulders of the Irish people by a treacherous decision of the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government, and an equally treacherous continuation of that decision by the Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition.  Page 15, however, is the nadir of the entire document and it is an issue that has not been commented on to any great extent.  This relates to the changes the Irish Government is proposing in the retirement age for social welfare pension purposes.  It states, humiliatingly, that we are taking proactive measures to reduce our long-term pension liabilities.  It further states that the next few months will see significant changes to pension terms put into law and that the most important of these changes is a three step increase in the retirement age for social welfare pensions from 65 to 68 over 2014 to 2028.  Page 28 of the document specifies further that under the national pension framework the age at which people will qualify for the social welfare pension will be increased to 66 years in 2014, 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">The struggle for the shorter working day, week and year, and shorter working years in the lives of workers, was a defining struggle of the organisations of the working class going back almost 150 years.  As a result of the heroic struggles of working men and women, tremendous progress had been made in that regard including the eight hour day, the 40 hour, five day week, etc., to allow people to have time for rest and recreation with their friends and families, and it became a norm of what we considered a civilised life.</p>

          <p eId="para_354">——both working and when they move out of work to retirement, if that is their wish.  It should be voluntary.  The problem is that the wealth is apportioned unequally in our society and that is the reason the Minister's Government, under the edict of the EU-IMF and the ECB, which are in turn under the edict of the financial markets, which are the real dictatorship, is dictating that working people will not be given retirement pensions because they do not want to commit sufficient wealth that is created to do that.  That wealth must instead go towards the profits of financial markets, the bankers and so forth.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">This alone shows the brutality of the system, but it also shows the extent of the betrayal involved, particularly by the Labour Party.  Just behind me there is a bust of that great man James Connolly.  What would he think now of the party he founded with Larkin and others to stand and fight for a socialist society where wealth would be democratically socialised and owned, so that it would be at the disposal of society and the people?  It would have created a much more humane and comfortable life.  Connolly would find it truly shameful that the party he founded is now lending itself to the programme dictated by financial markets, including unknown bankers, hedge-fund operators and speculators.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">There is a different way, of course, which is that those financial markets should be taken into public ownership, under democratic control and accountability.</p>

          <p eId="para_358">Yes, the hedge funds, big banks and major conglomerates should be taken into public ownership.  They should be put under the democratic control of the majority, thus using their resources to develop society and create further wealth.  That would advance solidarity and society, so we would have an entirely different situation.  We would not have an Irish Government humiliating itself in order to carry out the diktats of the markets, whose system has created the crisis with which our people are saddled and from which they are currently suffering.</p>

        <speech by="#MattieMcGrath" eId="spk_220">
          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_359">I am glad to get a chance to contribute to this debate.  In the last Dáil, I voted against the so-called bailout because I believed then, and still believe, that it will only worsen this country's financial problems.  That sad fact has been proven by every issue that has arisen since then concerning our inability to take action as a sovereign nation.  The EU has failed to make foreign bondholders take a hit on losses from toxic real estate loans.  That is the kernel of the problem in my humble opinion.  Irish taxpayers are instead being asked to pay the bill at a punitive interest rate of 5.8% to ensure that foreign creditors will get their money back, rather than face any losses.  This is totally inequitable, unfair and morally wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">I have been a small businessman since 1982 and the word "default" is anathema to me and to most right-thinking people.  This system is set up for default, however, because we just cannot pay it.  Thankfully, the IMF part of it is not as expensive as the part from our so-called EU friends.  We had a high standing in Europe where we punched above our weight.  I welcome the initiative of the Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, to travel around Europe and meet with our ambassadors and others in order to promote our good name again.  We are a race of good, honest people who can be trusted, but we cannot pay our debts when we have been blindfolded, with our hands tied behind our back, and are being beaten with a whip.  I do not want to use emotive language but that is how I see it.  We are being asked to do something, yet we have been put in a straitjacket and cannot do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">In my business, if I have a contract I must carry out the job by all reasonable means.  If so, I will be rewarded by being paid the agreed price.  This contract, however, was signed up to by the previous Government without consulting the people.  On two occasions during those discussions at the EU, I was in contact with the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  I pleaded with him not to sign the deal and to come home.  I felt bad when the deal was done.  These greedy, faceless people would have been back here on the first plane the next day because at that time the euro was unfortunately on the brink.  Everyone knows that now, but we were given very limited information at the time.  I was a Government backbencher then, as a member of the party without taking the Whip, and I always had a good relationship with the then Minister for Finance.  We were told that we had no choice and that we had nothing else.  I asked the then Minister afterwards "Who did this deal?  Who was out there on our behalf?"  We had the wrong people out there with him, including the Minister, because they had no understanding of business deals, or of the ability or inability to pay.  They were depending on public officials.  I am not condemning all public officials, but we need business people who understand the real world of money and how hard it is to repay.  It is a question of knowing whether one can or cannot repay debt, even with growth in the economy, not to mind the situation we are in now.  Unfortunately, a bad deal was done which also coerced us to dig into our National Pensions Reserve Fund.  It was always quoted as a €85 billion deal, but €17.5 billion of our own money was put in first.  We were forced to use up to €30 billion of our own money, so it is a clean-out and should never have been described as a bailout.  That terminology was used despite the fact that we used our hard-earned pension fund that was so badly needed for other matters.  It was a real bullying job, despite the fact that we voted for Lisbon 2.  I know what the Irish people will do with any further EU treaties because they were denied the opportunity to vote on this issue.  I cannot understand why that vote was denied because it would have strengthened the new Government's hand.  It got a huge mandate from the electorate and I supported it in the vote for Taoiseach and other posts.  I wished them well and still do, but they must utilise public support.  The Government claims the vote it received in the election was a mandate and so it was, but they did not use it.  They seem to be using the very same policies as before.  It seems that we are helpless in a straitjacket with our hands behind or back, blindfolded and the whip is out again.  They are telling us what we must do, but we are unable to do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">We have had debates on suicide prevention and financial institutions, but the lifeblood is being taken out of the economy.  People do not have the wherewithal to maintain their own standard of living.  We have also discussed residential mortgage debt, but many people cannot repay their home loans even though they are trying their best to do so.  In such circumstances, they cannot spend money on day-to-day expenses, such as putting food on the table, clothing their children and sending them to school.  We can see the result of it in shops and elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">It has been proven that the ECB pushed this situation onto us in order to protect the euro.  That currency had to be protected, but not at this cost to us.  The agreement had more to do with saving the euro project than it did with saving Ireland.  Current interest rates will saddle us with unsustainable debt, which will see our economic circumstances deteriorate further every year.  That situation is untenable and frightening for ordinary working people and the unemployed.  It is also frightening for small businesses, which are the lifeblood of the economy.  While we welcome the multinationals — there are a lot of them in my constituency — they come and go.  Many of them have shown that when tax reliefs go they will depart.  Given the competition from eastern Europe and elsewhere, the multinationals are voting with their feet and with their hands in their pockets.  That is the way it is.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">We are not allowed and we do not have the wherewithal to transact business.  I have a small business and I renewed my insurance in recent days, but insurance premia have gone through the roof.  It was a complete racket for a number of years but thanks to the action of various Governments, premia were reduced.  They have increased again and this is being blamed on inclement weather and so on.  It is not possible to get a loan to even finance the insurance payments and, even if one gets one, the cheapest interest rate is 7.5% because the banks do not want to give out money.  They do not have the credit.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">I was a member of a Government which promised 18 months ago that both AIB and Bank of Ireland would release €3 billion each into the economy to be aimed at businesses and, in particular, small business.  When their plans were eventually submitted to the Minister for Finance, they were returned because they were not good enough.  The issue was avoided and not a cent was provided to business.  Banks are lying through the teeth.  They do not have the money and they are not giving it out.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">Their loan statistics are total nonsense.  No account is taken of people such as myself who walk up to a bank counter or who telephone the bank manager only to be told not to bother coming in because there is no point and it would be a waste of time.  Others are called into the bank to discuss their overdraft and before they leave, the overdraft is taken from them and converted into a term loan and this is included in their statistics as a new loan.  They are taking away overdrafts from good business people who have built up credit over the years.  An overdraft facility is the lifeblood of any business.  Some people have worked for 25 years to build up their credit but when they are called in, it is wiped away and converted to a term loan, which is considered to be a business loan and a new transaction.  We are only fooling ourselves if we think we can continue like this.  We have to change.</p>

          <from>Minister without Portfolio (Deputy Brendan Howlin)</from>
          <p eId="para_370">I sincerely thank Deputy Murphy for getting me an audience.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  We need to have more discussion but it should be predicated on honesty.  Both Government parties said during the election campaign that they would tell the people the truth about our economic circumstances and that we would not give them false hope or pretend that there was an easy way to get ourselves out of the terrible economic mess into which we have been plunged over the past number of years.  That level of reality must be embraced by everybody who made contributions to the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">The principal issue raised by Opposition Members is that there is no substantial difference between the renegotiated programme and that negotiated by our predecessors.  Let me be blunt and honest about that.  A bad deal was negotiated last year but it was a solemn deal negotiated not by Fianna Fáil, but by the Government at the time and it was voted on by the Parliament and we are stuck with it.  A number of Opposition Members think we should tell the EU and the IMF to take a hike.  I have listened to, and debated with, Sinn Féin members on this because their view is simple.  They want us to tell the EU and the IMF, which are providing us with money to pay our bills this year, to take a hike and to keep their money, which they want to lend to us at 5.8%.  Their strategy is to use up our national treasury and the National Pensions Reserve Fund, but then what?  That will probably give us a little short of a year.  I raised this in a debate on radio during the election campaign with a Sinn Féin representative and the attitude was, "Then we'll go back to the markets".</p>
          <p eId="para_373">We will tell officials who are giving us money at an interest rate of 5.8% to take a hike and we will go back to the markets, which are charging an interest rate of more than 10%.  God knows what they will charge when our treasury is exhausted.  The only solution then would be to spend only the money we can generate from our own resources, which would mean cutting public expenditure next year by €20 billion.  Gardaí, nurses, and everyone else across the system would have to be annihilated to do that.  Let us be honest with the people in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">The programme before the House is not monumentally different from that which went before it but it is substantially different.  We have managed to renegotiate a number of aspects but this is the start of a process.  This is not the last time we will renegotiate and the stronger our economy becomes, the greater the leverage we will have to secure better deals.  In my negotiations and those of the Minister for Finance with the EU, IMF and ECB, they want us to succeed but they want to us to be in a fiscally strong enough position to pay our way and to get back to the markets within a specific timeframe.  They will give us flexibilities as long as we tell them the truth and part of our job is to restore acceptance that the word of the Government can be depended upon to deliver.  There are, therefore, substantial differences.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">Deputies opposite said the national minimum wage could not be restored but we will restore it as part of the jobs initiative to be announced next week.  This will not be an end in itself but it will be the first step in an incremental series to put jobs and job creation at the heart of all Government activity.  We will start that process next week.  We have the flexibility within the programme to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">The comprehensive spending review on which I have embarked is to look fundamentally at the way we deliver services here.  I spoke to every Secretary General and finance officer in every line Department yesterday.  It is not business as usual.  It is not the <i>status quo</i>.  It is not the old processes of interaction between the Department of Finance and line Departments; it is looking to see what is essential to deliver to maintain decent services and, as we discussed during the general election, a floor of decency, in this country, but on the basis of what we can afford.  We would love to continue to provide into the future what we are currently providing but we cannot do it for the next few years because we do not have the money.  These are substantial changes but, in essence, it is correct to say that the core of the document is what was negotiated.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">I will deal with one or two points made by the Deputies to whom I had the privilege of listening.  It is important for us to debate that.  The solution of Deputy Joan Collins, whom I believe is sincere, is to nationalise the banks.  We have already nationalised the banks.  The problem is that the previous Government nationalised their big debt and it is now on our backs.  That is not a panacea.  That is the problem.  The second leg of her strategy is to tax the very wealthy whom she describes as anyone earning more than €100,000.  She wants a tax levied on them at 95%.  Does she and the Deputies of the United Left Alliance believe that doctors, researchers or managers will work in the economy if, in effect, no one can earn more than €100,000?  That is not reality.  She is opposed to all other taxes.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">Deputy Ó Snodaigh's alternative is to tell the EU-IMF to take a hike.  That is just not a viable alternative.  The truth is that he knows it.</p>

We need the strategic investment bank and we are determined to have it.  Her attitude to Europe is correct.

        <heading>Suicide Prevention: Statements (Resumed)</heading>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_237">
          <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_395">Suicide is a silent killer.  In particular, it strikes many young men, so often without warning.  Twice as many people die from suicide as in road deaths here.  Combined, they are the two highest killers of young people.  It is a hugely important issue.  Road deaths have received enormous attention and were the subject of debate in the Chamber and in other fora.  Scarcely a year has gone by without another Bill passing through the House to improve road safety and reduce road traffic deaths.  I refer to permitted blood alcohol levels, speed cameras, road improvements and drug issues.  Young people are those most at risk on the roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">One could ask how often we have had a debate in the Chamber or in the public arena on deaths by suicide.  I recall the previous debate we had lasting approximately two hours, which was hardly adequate to address the issue although it results in double the number of road deaths here annually.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">I hope the debate that has been taking place for the past four weeks will change the situation and stimulate more activity in terms of the manner in which we approach the issue.  More intervention and preventative measures are required.  I hope also that we will bring to the attention of people the length and breadth of the country that there are voluntary and State facilities in terms of assistance and intervention.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">I received a letter only yesterday from 1life suicide helpline which referred to the effects of the debate.  It offered an update on the calls received over the Easter break in the light of the recent and forthcoming statements on suicide in the Dáil.  Some 705 callers rang the 1life suicide helpline over Easter week alone and some 56% of those callers presented with serious suicidal ideation.  Five calls were classed as ‘suicide in progress'.  Some 59% of the callers were female and 40% were male.  The number of male callers was much higher than the average for male callers, which is 20%.  Young men do not come out into the open on this issue and do not use the helplines in the same way as young women.  The number of female callers is quite high, at 59%, but young men are generally only one-third of that number.  That we are having a debate on this issue and that the issue is being raised in the public arena through the media will have a desirable and beneficial effect in the broader community where some young people are subject to depression, have suicidal tendencies or suffer some form of mental illness that drives them to take extreme measures.  While Dáil Deputies were enjoying the Easter break, calls to the helpline numbered more than 1,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">I hope this debate on the issue of suicide will bring ongoing benefits.  The debate reflects the fact that many new Members, particularly younger Members, have a great awareness of the issue and we have had no shortage of Members wishing to speak on it.  It is a growing concern that the largest increase in the number of suicides currently is among middle-aged men.  This is unexpected as suicide was mainly a youth issue.  There has been a sharp increase in the number of men in their 40s or 50s who die by suicide.  Anecdotal and other evidence suggest that this is related to the prolonged recession we have had here over the past three years.  Men who have been holding down stable, safe jobs and who have had a good career, now find themselves with mortgage difficulties and find it difficult to put bread on the table, educate their families and hold on to their jobs.  They see little prospect of improvement.  The result is enormous stress and trauma for people who did not have any problem with earning a living, rearing a family and buying a home.  Now all of these issues are causing problems which are often overwhelming.  Depression, stress, trauma and inability to cope are the result and these have given rise to the sharp increase in suicide in the middle-aged group.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">In my constituency, Dublin Central, we have seen a new phenomenon of grandparents burying grandchildren.  This has been going on for some time and is related to the scourge of drug addiction which has blighted so many young lives in the constituency and elsewhere.  It is also related to the hopelessness and lack of purpose in these young lives, the shortcomings and frustrations of their environment, the emasculation of young men by a society which provides few job opportunities, the inadequate education services, the lack of facilities and the lack of a meaningful role in an environment which is often ghettoised.  This environment undermines young people's self belief and many of them turn to drugs and drink.  This is the pattern in the deprived areas of the inner city of Dublin, other suburbs and other parts of the country.  It has been a particular feature of my constituency in the north inner city.  The fact that grandchildren are being buried by their grandparents is unnatural.  This should not happen in any civilised society.  It happens due to the stresses and trauma, particularly for young men, in an environment where they face hopelessness and lack purpose in their lives.  This is an issue we must address.  Suicide in this instance is a malaise of our lopsided and unequal society.  It results from the degree of poverty and ghettoisation in certain sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">A long-term solution to the problem will only be found in redressing these inequalities and in providing hope, self respect and equality of opportunity for all.  The Minister of State mentioned some good intervention and prevention policies in her address.  She mentioned what she intends to do and what the previous Minister of State, Mr. John Moloney, put in place.  The policies are there and much good work is being done by voluntary and State agencies throughout the country.  There has been a stigma attached to the issue of suicide at individual, family and neighbourhood level.  It is important the issue is more transparent and discussed more openly.  That is the reason for this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">Some €8.7 million is to be spent on suicide prevention this year.  This compares poorly with the amount of money being spent on road safety.  It is most unlikely the amount will be increased significantly because it would be difficult to put policies in place that would be able to avail of an amount anywhere close to what is being spent on road safety in a short space of time.  However, there should be a gradual increase in the amount allocated annually and that should be part and parcel of the policy to be adopted by the Minister of State for the duration of this Administration.  Policies must be researched and put in place over the next years and the increased funding should only be put in place when those policies and the necessary legislation are implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">I compliment the Minister of State on the priority she has given to this issue and on the commitment she has given to dealing with it.  I acknowledge that it is a priority issue for society, although it has been neglected for a variety of reasons, not all of which relate to the authorities.  It is time we came to grips with the issue.  I wish the Minister of State the best in the work she proposes to do to deal with the issue.  I suggest that she should institute a debate on the issue in the House each year during which she can report on progress in dealing with this awful scandal of suicide in society.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeCarey" eId="spk_238">
          <from>Deputy Joe Carey</from>
          <p eId="para_404">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  It is encouraging that a debate on suicide prevention is getting priority in the 31st Dáil, with contributions from so many Members in recent weeks.  I offer my congratulations to the new Minister of State with special responsibility for mental health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch and wish her well in her new role.  I also acknowledge the years of work my colleague, Deputy Dan Neville, has put into the subject of suicide.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">The tragic growth in the number of people taking their own lives is disturbing.    The 2009 statistics show that 527 people died by suicide, but experts believe the numbers were much higher.  There is little doubt there is a direct correlation between the increased number of people taking their own lives and the economic situation the country is facing.  The modern day pressures created by an economic situation with job opportunities hard to come by and increasing personal debt, in particular credit card debt and mortgage debt, are placing an enormous strain on people and, tragically, in some instances people are taking their own lives.  There is now a well documented crisis in the number of suicides in Ireland each year.  In reality the rate of suicide has been rising for many years prior to the economic downturn but the added pressures placed on individuals in recent years does not help.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">People presenting with depression and anxiety must be seen in a prompt and timely manner with proper access to relevant medical and psychological treatments where required.  There is not a town or village that has not been impacted by suicide.  It is a classless and seemingly non-age specific affliction that leaves more questions than it gives answers.  In some cases we do not know why people decide to take their own lives.  The most striking figure is the shocking number of young men who take their own lives.  Why is this the case and what strategy can be introduced to address this growing problem?</p>
          <p eId="para_407">It is clear that when it comes to suicide, young males are the most vulnerable section of society and policy on suicide prevention must reflect this fact.  In the second quarter of 2010, there were 127 recorded deaths by suicide in Ireland.  Of these 102 were male, which reflected a slight increase on the same period in the previous year.  In 2009, some 527 people took their own lives, which is significantly higher then the number of people killed on our roads in the same period.  We must divert the same level of resources and political action to the issue of suicide as is currently given to tackling road deaths.  We also need to try to understand why so many Irish people, particularly males, take their own lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">I commend a recent RTE television programme on the issue and I also commend Carl O'Brien of <i>The Irish Times</i> who wrote a series of articles on suicide.  He dealt with it very sensitively and candidly, and did a good job in raising awareness of suicide.  Creating awareness and highlighting the terrible emotional legacy it leaves are important for society.  We know that links between alcohol and drug abuse and suicide is quite high, and further studies of the area are needed to get a more comprehensive picture.  For too long issues such as suicide in Ireland have been taboo, to be contained within private grief and not for national discourse.  We need to change that in a sensitive way.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">I compliment the work of organisations such as the Samaritans and Living Links, which do tremendous work.  Support groups also play a very important role in offering vital counselling services to those who have been bereaved by suicide.  One such group, Solas, is based in Ennis in my constituency.  This group was established in 2005 and does very valuable work.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">If we are to make a dramatic reduction in the number of people we lose through suicide each year, the solution must lie in a community-led approach.  Local community groups, youth clubs, the GAA, soccer clubs and other organisations can play a key role.  Some of these clubs and organisations are already doing this in that they are rolling out different programmes.  There are outstanding people who are active members of these clubs and want to play a part in preventing suicide.  These clubs need resources and supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">The issue of suicide awareness and prevention is a complex and difficult one.  If a community-led approach to suicide prevention is to work, clubs will need help and encouragement to establish suicide awareness and prevention programmes that can be delivered through their clubs.  Funding for mental health issues needs to be protected and channelled through primary mental health care and communities.  Understanding suicidal behaviour is not enough if we as a society do not change and look at the issues behind suicide and in doing so develop the skills needed to deal with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, well in her new role and I hope she takes on board some of the positive proposals made my Members on all sides of the House during this very worthwhile debate.  I concur with Deputy Costello who proposed that we should have a debate on the issue every year and get an update from the Minister of State as to progress on the measures she hopes to introduce to reduce the number of people who die through suicide.</p>

          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_413">Cosúil le daoine eile, déanaim comhghairdeas leis an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Kathleen Lynch, as ucht an post nua atá faighte aici.  Ní bhfuair mé seans é sin a rá go dtí seo.  Tá a fhios agam, ón obair a rinne sí roimhe seo, gur duine maith í.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh sí in ann obair de réir a briathar nuair a bhí sí ar an taobh seo den Teach.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">Baineann an díospóireacht seo le ceist ríthábhachtach don tsochaí.  Níl an ghné seo gafa le polaitíocht páirtí, ach leis an bpolaitíocht agus leis an sochaí.  Ní chóir go mbeimid in adharca a chéile faoi.  Sa deireadh thiar thall, tá an díospóireacht seo níos tábhachtaí ná aon rud eile a tharlaíonn anseo.  Baineann an t-ábhar seo le beatha na ndaoine.  Mar a dúirt an dá Theachta a labhair romhaim, más féidir linn díriú isteach ar an ní seo uair sa bhliain, b'fhéidir go gcuideodh sé le duine éigin a shábháil ó fhéinmharú.  Measaim gur fiú é sin.  É sin ráite, caithfimid díriú isteach ar cén fáth ar tharla méadú chomh mór ar ráta féinmharaithe na tíre seo le blianta beaga anuas.  Ní leor a rá go bhfuil níos mó taifid á dhéanamh ar seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">It is not just that there is now greater recording of suicides than there was in the past.  That accounts for some of the increase in recent years, but it does not explain why our society is suffering the current level of suicide.  The previous speaker said that 527 suicides were recorded in 2009, which was a substantial increase on the previous year — that is not even the full figure.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">That gives a sense of the scale of the problem we have.  It is not a party political issue but is a political issue because we as a society must ensure that the appropriate resources are dedicated to addressing this issue.  The services and supports need to be in place, whether it is at a local community level or at a national level.  The HSE should give a greater priority to dealing with mental health issues than it has given in the past.  In our schools and clubs those who are mentors, leaders and teachers need to understand how to identify the signs.  Not everybody who has committed or attempted suicide projects the signs but quite a number of people do so.  I am no expert in this field but realise there are signs that need to be spotted and that people need to be listened to.  The problems need to be addressed in as comradely and helpful a fashion as possible.  It is partly a question of resources.  The various groups that help those who are suffering from distress or depression, or who are contemplating suicide, have set out in some detail the steps one can take.  We need to consider these.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">A harrowing statistic I read in recent months is that over 74% of citizens know somebody who has died by suicide.  This shows the scale of the problem.  It is only one step removed from us.  How many Members have attended funerals of suicide victims and noted the absolute grief of their bereaved families?  We have noted the harrowing scenes and distress.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">Families of suicide victims often feel guilty.  They ask whether the suicide would have happened had they taken a certain course of action.  They sometimes blame themselves not realising that the suicide might have happened in any case.  In many cases, families do not know the reason for the suicide, even years later.  "Why" is the big question for families.  Families and associates of victims often need help.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">Not so long ago I attended a funeral of a young man who had committed suicide.  I met his parents again last week and discovered they still ask why it happened.  There were no signals.  Perhaps the family will never know why it happened.  At the man's wake, there was considerable anger among his friends.  I could not figure out whom they were angry with.  Was it with themselves, society or the young victim?  I talked to some of the men and met some of them since in various locations, including the local club and pub, and noted the conversation always returns to the question of why the suicide occurred.  The anger of some of the men was associated with their belief that there is nothing for them and no hope.  Some asked why the victim had not talked to them.  I have had similar conversations at one or two other funerals I attended.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">Suicide does not affect just one group of people.  While it is most prevalent among young men, which in itself is scary, it is a problem right across society.  Quite successful people have committed or contemplated suicide because of a collapse of their business or relationship, for example.  Some have attempted suicide and have not been successful.  The problem arises right across society.  It is partly a question of education.  That we in the House are willing to talk about suicide is very important.  Twenty years ago, the Dáil would not have discussed suicide to the extent we have discussed it.  It was a taboo subject and people did not mention it, pretending it was not really happening.  We now have a more enlightened society and this alone will help dissuade some people from committing suicide and bereaving their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">The main step we need to take as a society is to listen a little more.  In the past ten or 15 years, we have become inward-looking.  We are too busy rushing here, there and everywhere and sometimes do not take the time to stop and listen to friends and those around us.  If this message, which is the same as that of some of the groups that offer tremendous support to the distressed, can be sent out, it will be of benefit.  I refer to suicide support groups such as Samaritans, Teen-Line and 1life.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">A group I met recently is involved in online counselling.  Not everybody wants to discuss problems over the telephone or on a face-to-face basis; some want to put their thoughts on paper.  We should support every organisation that can help people.  I congratulate all those who are involved in offering support.  In many ways, theirs is a thankless task.  Sometimes they come home distressed after having spent a few hours manning a telephone line.  Every Member of the House ought to praise those who give up their time voluntarily to help people they have never met, and we ought to praise everybody else involved also.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">There is a range of steps that the Government should take urgently.  There should be a properly resourced suicide prevention strategy, which strategy might involve determining whether the time of all the relevant organisations has been put to the most effective use.  There is a wide range of groups.  They should be properly resourced and should have the skills and staff required to deliver the services they are advertising, such that the services of Teen-Line and Samaritans, for example, would be available morning, noon and night.  Every group is struggling to raise money and to operate with existing resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">The modernisation of the mental health legislation in line with the new convention on the rights of persons with disabilities is required.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, will be able to introduce legislation in this regard in the near future.  I am not expecting it to be introduced in her first couple of days in office.  We need to promote a cross-departmental action group to combat social exclusion, prejudice and discrimination against people with mental health problems.  We should ring-fence a certain proportion of the budget of the Department of Health and Children for mental health services in line with the recommendations of the World Health Organisation.  The required child and adolescent community-based mental health service must be provided.  The placement of children in adult inpatient facilities must cease, which means facilities must be created that are more appropriate to children than the facilities that were made available heretofore.  It is disgraceful that some young people to whom I have spoken have ended up in inappropriate wards in hospitals and did not receive proper care because of a disconnect in the HSE over the years.  There has been a failure to address the issue of suicide attempts, particularly among young people with suicidal tendencies.  Many organisations are doing great work in the field of suicide prevention and counselling and they must be resourced properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">The week before Easter, a group contacted me with a view to abolishing the stigma that surrounds mental illness.  This is a useful goal.  The organisation outlined certain stigmatising words that should not be used and which can lead to isolation among those who are trying to deal with mental illness.  As a society, we are all responsible for the prevailing culture and need, as individuals, to make a conscious decision not to use certain words, such as "mad", "crazy", "bonkers", "psycho" and "schizo".  There is a range of such words.  I have heard my children and other children using them, albeit not understanding the consequences for those with mental health issues or those who may be struggling in life.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">First and foremost, we must save lives.  It is that simple.  We must seek to prevent suicide in whatever steps we take.  We do not wish to be attending funerals and consoling friends and families who have lost a loved one due to this society not being caring.  For many years Ireland was known as Ireland of the welcomes.  That welcome should not just extend to people from abroad but to everybody, including those with mental health problems.  That means taking the time and making the space in our lives to address it.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">I am a member of the Ballyfermot drugs task force and one of its initiatives is to train local people to spot the signs of possible suicide.  It is a cost-effective programme and now 200 people have the training to watch out for signs that people, particularly young people, are contemplating or actively planning suicide and to know what steps to take.  It is not that they interfere but they know where to direct the people concerned.  Many of the problems in our society are due to the huge change whereby alcohol and drugs have taken a greater role in people's lives, particularly in the case of young people.  That feeds into the national drugs strategy which will take on the alcohol issue when it is fully implemented and resourced.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">It is useful and correct to address this issue in the House.  As we give more attention to it hopefully the numbers will stabilise and start to reduce as quickly as possible.  Ultimately, we must have a society in which people who feel under pressure, particularly young people, know they can talk to somebody, be it a relative, friend or somebody anonymous through a helpline or website.  We should do whatever we can in this House.</p>

        <speech by="#RobertDowds" eId="spk_240">
          <from>Deputy Robert Dowds</from>
          <p eId="para_429">I wish to share time with Deputy Kenny.  I congratulate Deputy Kathleen Lynch on her appointment.  She is a very down-to-earth woman and I hope she has much success in her office.  I believe she will be on top of the issues with which she must deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">I am conscious of the huge sadness and trauma surrounding suicide and the terrible impact it has on the friends and families of the individuals concerned.  I wish to record my appreciation of the work done by many organisations and individuals who tackle the issue of suicide and the heroic efforts of priests and clergy who are in the difficult position of conducting the funerals of suicide victims.  I witnessed one priest manage to maintain the very fine balance between honouring the person who had taken their own life and ensuring that suicide was not painted in any type of glamorous way.  That was particularly difficult and the more people who can do it, the better when it comes to tackling this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">I will focus on the links between alcohol and suicide.  The data from the World Health Organisation regarding suicide are striking.  The 2009 figures show Ireland in a reasonably good light with 9.2 deaths per 100,000 people.  That puts Ireland close to the bottom of the table, in contrast with countries such as Estonia and Lithuania where the incidence is up to over 30 per 100,000.  However, when one examines the suicide figures for the 15 to 24 year old category, the situation is considerably different.  In that context Ireland's figure is 14.4 per 100,000 people, which puts it fourth from the top.  This contrasts with the rate for countries such as Portugal, with 3.7 per 100,000, and Greece, with 1.9 per 100,000.  This is a considerable contrast to the overall figure in Ireland.  While we must focus on the general issue of suicide, we must also examine why there is a higher incidence at that stage in life.  That incidence is not necessarily reflected in other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">I strongly believe that alcohol plays a considerable role in many suicides, most especially in those that occur in the 15 to 24 year old age group.  Although pure alcohol consumption reduced from a peak of 14.2 litres in 2002 to 12.4 litres in 2008, Ireland still has the third highest rate of alcohol consumption in Europe after Estonia and Austria according to European figures.  The starkness of these figures is worsened by the fact that the European Union survey indicates that one quarter of Irish people had not drunk alcohol in the previous year.  This means that those who are drinking are consuming considerable amounts.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">I recently asked the Oireachtas Library and Research Service to look into the research on this matter.  The evidence on the connection between alcohol and suicide is quite frightening.  A 2006 study of the emergency department at Cork University Hospital looked at patients who attended the emergency department during three periods between December 2002 and January 2004.  The study reported that 50% of people attending the emergency department with acute intoxication had also consumed large amounts of prescription medication and-or had over-medicated in an attempt to harm themselves.  Almost all the participants were young, male and from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.  The authors state that "the results of this study suggest that excessive alcohol consumption is closely related with suicide and deliberate self-harm".</p>
          <p eId="para_434">Another study, conducted by Bedford <i>et al</i> in 2006, reviewed coroners’ reports in Cavan, Monaghan and Louth in 2001 and 2002.  The study was undertaken to identify the blood alcohol concentrations, BACs, in persons who died as a result of accidental death or suicide.  All cases where the person died as a result of injury or suicide in 2001 and 2002 were included.  There were 129 deaths eligible for inclusion, of which the majority were male, at just over three quarters, and 113 were adults aged 18 years and over.  Blood alcohol concentration levels were tested for the majority, 105 or 81%, and 55% tested positive for alcohol.  The key findings were that 31 or 24% of the deaths were suicides, of which 90% were male.  Blood alcohol concentrations were recorded for 29 of these suicides and, of these, 16 or 56% had alcohol detected in their blood.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">Persons aged less than 30 years of age were significantly more likely to have alcohol in their blood.  Over half of those aged less than 30 years had blood alcohol concentrations in excess of 160 mg per 100 ml, twice the legal drinking limit.  The blood alcohol concentration findings in the study, particularly for the under 30s, are among the highest reported in the international literature.  From these findings the authors conclude that the high blood alcohol concentrations in those who died as a result of suicide or injury reflect the high level of alcohol consumption and binge drinking in Ireland.  Another study, which I will not have time to deal with in detail is the national report, "Suicide in Ireland: A National Study", in 2001.  It had somewhat similar findings.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">The World Health Organisation has estimated that the risk of suicide where a person is currently abusing alcohol is eight times greater than if he or she was not abusing alcohol.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">A report from the UK Mental Health Foundation also states that as many as 65% of suicides were related to excessive drinking and identifies alcohol problems as one of the highest risk factors for suicide.  This report also identifies a strong link between alcohol use and thoughts of suicide, suicide attempts and completed suicides among young people under the age of 24.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">These studies clearly outline a connection between alcohol and suicide.  It seems obvious that high alcohol consumption can induce depression, which might cause suicide or which might lead to someone with a suicidal intent drinking in order to gain the courage to commit suicide.  Groups such as Alcohol Action Ireland believe that the connection between alcohol and suicide is strong and argue that alcohol use can act as a factor in suicide.  This view is also supported by Ann Hope who, in a research report compiled for the HSE in 2008, argued that alcohol is an important contributory factor in suicide and concluded that "Alcohol can facilitate suicide by increasing impulsivity, changing mood and deepening depression".</p>
          <p eId="para_439">A problem which has also been highlighted is that there is insufficient evidence to examine whether a link exists between single vehicle road accidents and suicide.  Professor Denis Cusack made a call in respect of this matter and I wonder whether there have been any developments in this regard.  It would be useful if material relating to whether their is a link between such accidents and suicide could be made available because it would be of assistance in examining the overall position.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">I ask the Government to seriously consider banning advertising which relates to alcohol.  Such advertising always glamorises alcohol and usually links it with something such as sport.  While alcohol does have a positive function, if not used properly it can have hugely negative effects.  It would certainly be worthwhile for the Government actively to consider banning the type of advertising to which I refer.  I accept that such a move would probably lead to quite an aggressive debate.  However, I am of the view that it would ultimately be of major benefit, particularly in the context of allowing us to confront the issue of alcohol consumption.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">I appreciate that this debate primarily relates to suicide.  If, however, the advertising of alcohol was banned, this would have a positive impact not only in respect of alcohol consumption, but also in the context of suicide.  A ban on advertising might give rise to a situation where younger people might tend not to start drinking until they reach a more mature age.  This would certainly be beneficial in the context of the issue of suicide.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanKenny" eId="spk_241">
          <from>Deputy Seán Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_442">I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, on her appointment.  I wish her every success in her new position.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">Suicide is a global issue.  The WHO has indicated that it is a significant public health problem worldwide and that each year more people die as a result of suicide than die in armed conflict.  That fact places the matter in perspective.  It is possible for everyone, whether inside the House or outside it, to be in a position to take steps to prevent suicide and to inform others of those steps.  The key to preventing suicide is to take it seriously.  I wish to outline some of the steps to which I refer in the hope that the information I will provide will be of use.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">Suicidal behaviour is a cry for help.  Most people have suicidal thoughts or feelings at some point in their lives.  Almost all suicidal people suffer from conditions that will pass with time or with the assistance of a recovery programme.  There are modest steps we can take to improve our response to those who are suicidal and to make it easier for them to seek help.  It is a myth to state that people who talk about committing suicide do not do it.  However, studies have found that more than 75% of all those who commit suicide did things in the weeks or months prior to their deaths to indicate to others that they were in deep despair and in need of help.  Anyone who expresses suicidal feelings requires immediate attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">It is also a myth that individuals who attempt suicide are insane.  It has been stated only 10% of all suicidal people are psychotic or have delusional beliefs about reality.  Most suicidal people suffer from the recognised mental illness of depression but many depressed people adequately manage their daily affairs.  The absence of insanity does not mean the absence of suicide risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">On average, a single suicide intimately affects at least six people.  Sometimes people who know someone who ended their own life can say that the problems that person was experiencing were not enough to prompt him or her to commit suicide.  It is a mistake for people to assume that because they may feel something is not worth feeling suicidal about that others feel the same way.  It is not a matter of how bad is the problem, rather it is how badly it is hurting the person who is experiencing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">Another myth is the suggestion that nothing can stop a person from committing suicide once he or she has made a decision to do so.  An individual who is suicidal can be ambivalent.  In other words, there is a partial desire to live.  The other part of the person does not want death — it wants the pain to end but not necessarily to die.  It is the part of the individual that wishes to live which seeks to say to another person "I feel suicidal".  If a suicidal person turns to us it is likely that he or she believes that we are more caring or more informed in respect of coping with misfortune and are more willing to protect his or her confidentiality.  No matter how negative the manner and content of what such a person says, he or she is doing an extremely positive thing.  We should all be willing to give or receive help.  In addition, we should be prepared to do so sooner rather than later.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">The prevention of suicide is not something to be undertaken as a last minute activity.  Text books on depression indicate that it should be reached as soon as possible.  Unfortunately, individuals with suicidal tendencies can fear attempting to get help.  They are concerned that help may bring them more pain and result in their being informed that they are stupid, foolish, or manipulative.  These individuals may fear rejection, punishment, suspension from school or work or written records of their condition or their involuntary commitment to a psychiatric hospital being recorded.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">We must do everything in our power to reduce the pain experienced by a person who is feeling suicidal, rather than increasing or prolonging it.  We should give that person every opportunity to unburden himself or herself of his or her troubles and to ventilate his or her feelings.  Not much needs to be said and there are no magic solutions.  We should not judge people.  In addition, we should avoid arguments.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">Yet another myth is the idea that discussing suicide may give someone the idea of committing it.  Individuals at risk of suicide are already aware of the idea, particularly in light of the wide coverage relating to it in the media.  People already have the idea because suicide is constantly in the news.  Asking a person whether they feel suicidal is a good thing — we are showing that we care about him or her, that we take him or her seriously and that we are willing to share his or her pain and be of assistance.  Persistence and patience are needed in order to seek and pursue as many options as possible to ensure that a suicidal person is able to obtain the help he or she needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">I previously served as a member of the HSE Dublin north-east regional health forum and last year I was in attendance when Mr. Geoff Day, director of the National Office for Suicide Prevention, made a presentation to it.  Mr. Day identified solutions that work in the area of suicide prevention.  These include GP education, skills and problem-solving programmes, education of community gatekeepers, restriction on access to the means of suicide, treatment of mental illness, follow up after self-harm and responsible media reporting.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">There is a need for better and more rigorous controls in respect of the sale of non-prescription drugs.  Paracetamol is just one example of a non-prescription drug.  Such controls would provide a way to restricting access to the means of committing suicide.  Non-prescription drugs are freely available in shops and supermarkets and if they are mixed with alcohol they can cause accidental death, which can often be categorised as suicide.  It is possible to purchase these and other life-threatening drugs on the Internet, over which it is extremely difficult to exert control in the context of the sale of products.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">I will conclude by quoting comments by President McAleese at the world congress on suicide prevention in Killarney in 2007:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_454">Reducing suicide rates requires a collective, concerted effort from all groups in society: health, social services, other professionals, communities and community leaders, voluntary and statutory agencies and organisations, parents, friends, neighbours and individuals.  It also requires the careful nurturing of a culture in which people in psychological distress don't hesitate to seek help.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">I would like to express my gratitude to all the groups and organisations who help people to deal with suicide and its after effects.</p>

        <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_242">
          <from>Deputy Denis Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_456">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this debate today.  I wish the new Minister of State the best of luck in her role.  I know that she will do an excellent job because she has a great interest in this area.  I specifically want to acknowledge the tremendous work that has been done by my colleague, Deputy Neville, over a long number of years in both Houses.  We would not be debating this issue today but for the Trojan work he has done over a long period of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">The first thing we must acknowledge is the scale of suicide.  People do not talk about it.  They are afraid to talk about it and it has not received the same level of debate as issues such as road traffic accidents and road safety.  Deputy Neville's own organisation, the Irish Association of Suicidology, carried out a study which indicated that three out of four respondents in a survey knew somebody who had died by suicide.  Every one of us has personal experience of this.  I am aware of family members, friends and neighbours who have all died by suicide.  It is important that we talk about the issue, but it is also important that we deal with some of the myths on suicide and mental health.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">Huge stigma is associated with mental health in Ireland.  Addressing the perception of mental health will go a long way towards ensuring that people who have a risk of committing suicide get the help they need.  Between 80% and 90% of those who take their own lives are suffering from some type of psychiatric condition.  For those who are young people, it has often been unidentified depression.  We need to look at the stigma associated with mental health in this country.  It has been ingrained into us as a society.  Everybody will talk about someone who is diagnosed with cancer.  Somebody with cancer has no difficulty talking about their diagnosis and their treatment, be it in the pub, outside the church or in the local community.  However, if it is mental illness and somebody is on medication for it, that person closes down, the family closes down, and they try to ensure that nobody finds out about it.  That typifies the public perception and the attitude in society to mental health issues.  If we look at the number of people who have a diagnosed mental health issue and the number of people with an undiagnosed mental health issue, then a significant proportion of the population will be affected.  It will cross every single home in this country at some stage in everybody's life.  The concealment of depression and other mental health problems is a serious concern and is a significant part of the problem of addressing suicide in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">One in three people have experienced depression either personally or among family members.  In the vast majority of cases, that particular experience is concealed from immediate family members and from friends.  It is interesting to note that around 400,000 people suffer from depression, yet do not feel comfortable talking about it.  It was interesting to listen to Mary McEvoy on the television recently telling her own story about depression.  She finished up by saying that she had not beaten depression, but she was able to function in society, still suffering from depression and still on medication for the condition.  We need more people like that who are prepared to come out and talk about their own personal experiences of depression.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">We need more debates like this.  When I was doing research on this issue, I found out that 60,000 people attempt to take their own life every year.  I did not believe the figure and I had to double check it.  One person attempts to take his or her own life or do some form of self-harm every nine minutes in this country.  It is far greater than the statistics on road traffic accidents, yet it is being brushed under the carpet every day.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">Everything these days is about economics and mathematics.  We have to listen to the expert economists who tell us how to run our economy and what we should and should not do.  However, if we look at the economics of two mental health issues, about €3 billion per annum is being lost to Irish business due to bullying.  Another €1 billion per annum is lost due to suicide.  These two issues cost about €4 billion per annum, not to mind the impact on people who try to commit suicide or self-harm.  This is roughly the amount of money that the Government will have to save for the budget in 2012.  From a purely economic perspective, it makes sense to put further resources into mental health issues, as well as bringing in a change of attitude.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">We need to be able to talk openly about mental health.  There is much sympathy for people diagnosed with cancer.  The community rallies behind them and their families, yet people tend to steer clear of those diagnosed with something as common as depression.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">I want to raise the issue of school and work place bullying.  Anyone who saw the headlines in the newspapers today on Phoebe Prince would have to acknowledge that it is a massive issue both in the workplace and in schools.  No doubt it is a significant contributing factor in suicide rates.  As I pointed out purely from an economic point of view, €3 billion per annum is being lost to Irish business solely in the associated costs of workplace bullying.  We need to take it back a step and deal with this issue at school level.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">I am also conscious that we tend to try to dump everything on schools and on teachers and get them to solve everything.  It is important that we deal with this issue in terms of not only the victims of bullying, but the bullies themselves, both at primary school and at secondary school, and to eradicate the problem before it goes into wider society.  In many cases, the bullies themselves have other issues, including family issues, that need to be dealt with.  It is indicative of some other problem.  It is crucial that there are anti-bullying strategies within the school environment because they have been proven to work successfully.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">A proper co-ordinated national structure on the issue of anti-bullying strategies in the school system is needed because each of us has come across stories of parents who have encountered significant difficulties getting a bullying issue addressed in their local schools, either at primary or post-primary level.  There needs to be a far greater awareness of it within communities and the school setting so that it is nipped in the bud when it arises in the first place.  School-yard bullying cannot be tolerated in any circumstance.  If one can deal with the issue in the school setting, there will be not only the immediate impact, but also a longer term positive impact in cutting down workplace bullying and anti-social behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">Bullying has profoundly negative consequences, both short term and longer term, for the children concerned.  They become isolated and withdrawn and they suffer from anxiety and low self-esteem.  It has an impact on their school performance and, sadly, there are tragic incidents where it also leads to suicide.  The Phoebe Prince story highlights that.  It is happening in schools and communities and it is an issue we cannot continue to ignore.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">The final point I want to make relates to the economy.  When one turns on radio or television, news of the economy is all doom and gloom.  It is all negative.  Economic strain and personal financial crises for families precipitate events that can lead to deaths by suicide and problems with mental health, and we must look seriously at this issue.  It is worth noting that despite all the doom and gloom due to the problems of the banking crisis and the way the bankers have got away with blue murder, which is sickening and forms part of the problem of public perception, we have not ended up in difficulties such as those experienced by the Japanese due to the earthquake and the subsequent nuclear disaster in that we have not had any physical disaster in this country.  People do not have money and are in serious financial difficulty, but it is important that we put it in some sort of perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">It also is important that we start talking ourselves up because we, as a race, are good at knocking people and looking for the negative in everything.  It is about time we started looking at the positive.  Listening to the radio last week, I heard two good stories on "Morning Ireland" about communities that are starting to turn around the economy.  In a community in south Galway, the parishes are coming together to develop tourism by bringing second, third and fourth generation Americans back to Ireland to visit their ancestral roots.  This stimulates the local economy as a result.  In Longford, the business community has come together and put a fund of €1 million in place to invest in small businesses to get them off the ground.  There is much good news out there but the sad part is that it does not travel.  We, as public representatives, need to start selling the good news stories.  Leaving aside the political debate that we can have here on whether the Government is taking the right decisions, there is an onus on each of the 166 Members of this House and the 60 Members of the Upper House to start talking about some of the positive stories and to see how we can support those businesses.  It may not be a matter of providing funding but of providing advice or encouragement to individuals who do not believe that they have anything to look forward to.</p>

          <p eId="para_470">The position is not as bad as it is being spun at present.  We will get out of this recession.  In the past, we as a society have got out of difficulties far greater than the one we are in.  If we start picking ourselves up, dusting ourselves off, and looking to the positive and what we can do well in this country, then we can drive the economy forward and deal with some of the negative impacts of the recession.  One step that can be taken quickly, and which will not cost one cent, is to deal with that issue of perception of mental health and to start openly talking about it.  If we could even take that one small step forward as a society, it would have a significant impact on the rates of suicide and those seeking the professional help.  People do not have to suffer in silence.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatrickDeering" eId="spk_245">
          <from>Deputy Pat Deering</from>
          <p eId="para_471">Since this is my first opportunity to speak in this Chamber, I thank the people of Carlow-Kilkenny, particularly the people of Carlow, for entrusting their confidence in me to represent them in the 31st Dáil.  I thank my family, my party and my party workers for their help and support during the recent election campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">Like every other speaker, I am delighted to get the opportunity to make a few brief points in this important debate.  Suicide affects every town and village in this country.  Ironically, since this debate started three to four weeks ago, in my county four young people under the age of 25 have taken their own life.  Like previous speakers, I have found going to those funerals very difficult.  Suicide is an area that we need to tackle immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">A number of years ago, road safety was a big issue.  I do not mean to downgrade that important issue, but it was a national emergency over the past five or ten years and we tackled it strongly.  We need to go down the same road now to tackle this important issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">There are three main categories of which we all know.  There are young males, males in the 30 to 45 age bracket and then there are females, who are more affected than anybody else.  Two main areas should be looked at and bearing in mind the old adage that prevention is better than cure, education is the first step we should take.  Young males in the 15 to 20 age bracket are vulnerable.  Once somebody in that particular age bracket takes his or her own life, friends in the same age group might think they may be better off going down the same road.  We need to tackle this and ensure they are more aware of the better services that are available and that better options exist than taking one's life.  We need to have a structure in place at secondary school level, perhaps during transition year, to ensure they are more knowledgeable and not as vulnerable.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">Media campaigns are very important and have been very effective in road safety.  We spent a great deal of money on media campaigns in recent years and it was money well spent.  We need to go down this road with regard to suicide prevention to ensure we are successful.  While suicide will never become a thing of the past, the current figures are frightening.  We need to bring on board people who are looked up to by young people, such as sporting heroes and TV personalities, to make young people aware of the options that exist and the fact that taking one's life is not the way to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">Funding is also very important and we need to ring-fence a certain amount of money every year to try to reduce the figures.  In the past, we set targets for road safety and we should go down the same road for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">I thank my colleague, Deputy Neville, for his work over the years, for ensuring we have had this debate, and for ensuring this issue has come to the forefront rather than being kept in the dark as it was in the past.  As we know, suicide was something about which people did not want to speak but because of Deputy Neville's work, we are having a national debate on it.  It is something about which we should speak more openly.  I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, well in her new role.  I know she takes it very seriously and I wish her every success.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" as="#Acting_Chairman" eId="spk_246">
          <from>Acting Chairman (Deputy Thomas P. Broughan)</from>
          <p eId="para_478">I thank Deputy Deering and I congratulate him on his first speech in the Dáil.  As Acting Chairman, I wish to be associated with the remarks of commendation for Deputy Dan Neville on the heroic work he has done on this matter for many years.  I warmly commend him.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KathleenLynch" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_247">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Kathleen Lynch)</from>
          <p eId="para_479">I also wish to be associated with the remarks made about Deputy Dan Neville.  My first experience of Deputy Neville with regard to this issue was many years ago when someone who was unsuccessful in a suicide attempt came to Cork.  Deputy Neville contacted me and between the two of us we befriended the person and did a little socialisation.  Dan's record is not only with regard to prevention or public information, but it also stands with regards to people who are not successful in their attempt as he has talked many of them and their families through very difficult situations.  It is for this that we should be most grateful.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">It is also appropriate that I recognise the contribution made by my predecessor, John Moloney.  He was also very dedicated and put in place many of the initiatives on which we are now following through.  If we constantly state that if more women were involved in decision-making in society that things would be different, then it is incumbent on us as women to act differently when we get there, and acknowledging what others have done is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">I thank all of the Deputies who contributed in a very sincere manner.  Clearly, they know the subject, and I suppose this is on the basis of personal experience, which is a sad way to find out about something such as suicide.  It strikes me that according to the most recent statistics, the number of people who have taken their own lives would fill this Chamber more than three times over.  We need to keep this in mind always.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">We may attend an individual funeral or we hear about a cluster of three, four or five suicides in an area but it is very difficult to envisage the total of more than 500 people.  If one closes one's eyes, it is virtually a small village.  If that number of deaths happened as a single tragedy any year, our response would be far more immediate and urgent.  This is what we need to do; we need to keep in mind the number of people we are speaking about and the devastation each death leaves after it not only for the family, but for friends and the community, and also the terror it sends through each house in the immediate area.  What this is really about is this sense of terror, which perhaps makes us not want to speak about it because if we do not speak about it then somehow it will not happen again.  We know this is not true because it has gone on for so long.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">It was interesting to hear almost every speaker compare funding for suicide prevention with funding for the Road Safety Authority.  A comparison can be made on funding, but I am not certain a comparison can be made on the manner in which people die.  I must admit I am not into this; I can understand it is an easy argument to make but I do not think it is a comparison of like with like.  Every evening, on the six o'clock news one can see the carnage of road accidents but we do not see this with regard to suicide and I am not certain we want to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">People who decide to take their life by suicide do not make an immediate decision to do so; it is something they have thought about.  What is important is to say to those people who are listening and who are contemplating suicide that they should speak to someone.  The old adage that talk is good is vital.  If they cannot speak to someone nearby they should pick up the telephone.  They should speak to the various helplines or their GP.  They should speak to their sisters or brothers or someone, because it is important that we recognise that people who have taken this course of action need someone to talk to.  They need help and that help is there.  When that help is given, it can divert people away from this path and this is very important.  We are not speaking about strangers on the street; we are speaking about fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers and a beloved son.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">In the argument about where we are going with regard to mental health, the stigma attaching to mental health is probably the greatest preventer of people seeking help in the first instance.  Why is this stigma attached to mental health?  Surely it is no different from having cancer.  I remember a number of years ago one did not say the word "cancer" in public.  One would say "the big C" or "she has been diagnosed with the other thing".  We have got past this because we recognise that it is a disease, and one which not alone is preventable but curable and treatable.  So is mental illness and we need to get our heads around this.  We need to start saying it out loud and exploding the picture.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">Last night, I attended the launch of Make a Ripple, which is an excellent new Internet campaign for people feeling down and unwell with regard to their mental health.  They can go online and share their stories and read other people's stories.  Amazingly, one of the people headlining the Make a Ripple campaign is Alastair Campbell, someone with whom all of us here would have an affinity.  He is hugely successful in politics, writing and his contribution to society, and he suffers from depression.  He speaks about it.  Some days he feels very good, some days it is a little bit mild and other days he stares into the abyss.  He talks about it and we need to start doing the same.  We need people to come out and to start talking about the very bad days they have had but which they have left in the past.  I worry that we are not allowing young men and not so young men the opportunity to speak and the opportunity to tell us that they are feeling vulnerable.  I am a great believer in balance.  I have spent my life trying to achieve the type of balance necessary in society so that women can be treated equally.  Sometimes by creating balance in one area, something else is put out of kilter.  We need to start telling men, both young and middle aged, that they are not just valued as being providers but that they are valued as fathers, as brothers and as contributors to society.  They need to know we value them.  I can understand the type of humiliation men feel when they lose their jobs or businesses because they can no longer provide what they provided in the past.  I say to them that is not what we value in you but we value your contribution to your family, to society; we value you.  We need to get that message out there.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">Deputy Naughten told the House about the cost to the economy of the effects of depression and of suicide.  How do we judge whether a person has been successful in life?  I hope that not everything is judged in economic terms based on the size of a person's car or house.  We need to reconstruct how we regard people, how we value success and how we monitor that success.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">It is good that people will praise a man who is a good father and regard this as a very honourable role.  We need to start thinking outside the box about how we view people who take their own lives and people who suffer from depression.  We need to start speaking out about stigma and we need to tell people that it is not the shameful thing they think it is.  Around 75% of mental illness emerges during childhood and adolescence and early intervention is essential so that such illness does not bring with it a lifetime of pain and misery.  I refer to projects which provide such intervention and the very successful work of voluntary agencies such as Jigsaw and Headstrong.  Such projects must be rolled out in all parts of the country so people can access the assistance of individual people as well as agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">Deputy Dowds suggested a ban on alcohol advertising.  In my view, the day is fast approaching when alcohol needs to be included in the bundle of what we consider to be harmful drugs.  This needs to happen.  It is known that alcohol has the same destructive effect on health as do cigarettes, yet we still maintain that it is permissible to advertise alcohol.  However, any ban on advertising must be a European-wide ban.  It would be pointless for RTE to ban the advertising of alcohol if it is advertised on UTV and other stations.  We must put across the message that success in life is not automatically regarded in terms of economic success as success must be measured in how a person contributes to society.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">Children in primary school should be included in programmes which encourage them to talk about their feelings rather than about their mental health.  Very young children can very quickly identify and name a bully but as they get older they will not do so because it is considered less manly to do so at second and third level.  Just as in industry there is a Safe Pass system and legislation provides for health and safety instruction, we need a similar system for dealing with mental health and it should be provided for in legislation.  We need to start walking the walk and to start breaking the silence.  Safe Talk and Assist need to be part and parcel of induction courses in all employment.  It is only by adopting such a holistic approach to mental health and only when we all start to talk about it that people will feel safe and secure in approaching others.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">Neither the previous Government, this Government nor the next Government can do this work on its own.  It is a societal issue and society has to take ownership of it.  The Government must put the structures in place so people can approach a service and receive assistance.  We must all recognise the signs so that when someone feels threatened we can ask them how they are doing today.  We may be a friend, a neighbour or a family member but we can then help them.  If it is the case that according to the latest statistics this Chamber could be filled three times over with the number of people who have taken their own lives, then we need to deal with it.</p>

            <p eId="para_495">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 3 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_496">The programme for Government contains commitments to reverse the cut in the national minimum wage and to reform the joint labour committees and registered employment agreements.  We need to ensure statutory wage fixing mechanisms work effectively and efficiently and that they do not have a negative impact on economic performance and employment levels.  Any such mechanism in a modern economy must be responsive and fit for purpose in the context of the challenges being faced by employer and employee alike.</p>
            <p eId="para_497">An independent review of the statutory wage setting mechanisms was initiated on 8 February last and was undertaken jointly by Kevin Duffy, chairman of the Labour Court, acting in an <i>ad hoc</i> capacity, and Dr. Frank Walsh of the School of Economics, UCD, under specific terms of reference.  The review is a commitment under the EU-IMF programme, which provided not only for agreement with the European Commission services on the terms of reference but also for follow-up discussions on the programme of actions arising.</p>
            <p eId="para_498">The report of the independent review team has been completed and was received by me last Thursday, 28 April.  I am currently examining the report and it will be published and made available to Members of the Oireachtas, following consideration by the Government.  It is proposed to have early discussions with the European Commission services on the main findings of the review, in line with the provisions in the EU-IMF programme.  Arising from these discussions, I will present a time-bound comprehensive action plan to follow up on the report's recommendations, setting out proposals for any legislative action that may be necessary to give effect to reform measures.  Consultation with, and the co-operation of, relevant stakeholders will also be sought to ensure the required reforms can be progressed as a matter of urgency.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_499">I congratulate Deputy Bruton on his appointment, and his sidekick Deputy John Perry.  Their appointments are well deserved and I did not have the opportunity before now to congratulate them.  A number of questions arise from the Minister's reply.  When will the changes the Government decides to make be in place?  There was a great deal of urgency expressed by both Government parties in the lead-up to the election.  This was seen as central to improving competitiveness.  It is unfair that 250,000 people have the sword ofDamocles hanging over their heads for an indefinite period.  I would like to have a timescale on this.</p>
            <p eId="para_500">The programme for Government states that the examination of these agreements will include the rate of pay for atypical hours.  That can only mean one of two things, that the Government will abolish special arrangements for those with atypical hours or that it will reduce the rate of pay for those with atypical hours.  People in this category are, by and large, poorly paid, including those in the hospitality and tourism industry.  Will changes proposed by the Government cover existing employees or will it be confined, as it should be, to new entrants?</p>
            <p eId="para_501">High Court proceedings, on which a judgment is imminent, are challenging the JLCs.  Does the Minister have a contingency plan in the event of the challenge succeeding?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_251" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Innovation">
            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
            <p eId="para_502">I thank the Deputy for his generous words of congratulation and I look forward to a fruitful exchange with Deputy O'Dea.  He has immense experience and I am sure he will bring that to bear on our work at this important time.   Legislative proposals will be needed and the timescale hinges on getting the drafting done and getting the necessary legislative time.  That rules my ambition to get this through as quickly as possible.  I have an advantage in that the previous Government had some legislation prepared dealing with some elements prior to this review being initiated.  That is the vehicle that can be used with suitable amendments.  Hopefully it will shorten the period.</p>
            <p eId="para_503">The inconsistent approach to atypical hours has been raised as an issue.  The terms of reference were set by the previous Government and explicitly referred to anomalies, obsolete provisions and inflexibilities.  It also considered whether there was a need to move to a more streamlined approach in many of these areas.  There are proposals to make changes in these areas and we must make decisions on their implementation.  I will not be indicating these until I discuss it with my colleagues, publish a report and get reaction generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_504">Wherever there is change in respect of JLCs and REAs, it will apply generally rather than only to new entrants.  These tools set employment orders for an entire sector.  It does not follow that they would only apply to new entrants.  It is a way of making the system more flexible.  I am conscious of challenges to the system, and clearly some of the legislative proposals prepared were with a view to making it more robust.  There has been criticism of the way the system operates.  We must respond to any finding in the High Court appropriately.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
            <p eId="para_505">The joint labour committees and the registered employment agreements are the main mechanism through which the lowest paid workers are protected.  This affects 400,000 of the lowest paid workers in the State, who have already been hammered by child benefit cuts and the universal social charge.  They are really struggling.  Can the Minister give reassurance to those workers, who are deeply anxious about what the review means in terms of further attacks on their wages and conditions?  Does the Minister have the review, when will it be published and will there be a chance to debate it in the Chamber before the summer or as soon as possible so we can see what is proposed and the Minister's response and so the workers affected can have their say on it?  Can the Minister guarantee these workers they have no reason to fear the review of wages and conditions for the lowest paid being considered will result in an attack on the structures that allow some regulation in these sectors?  In many cases, these are casual or part-time workers in difficult employment circumstances and are contract cleaners, retail workers and people in the catering industry.  The anxiety is justified given that it is part of the conditions of the IMF-EU deal to examine these agreements.  Everything else from that deal has meant cuts, austerity and attacks on existing wages and conditions.  Can the Minister guarantee this will not result in attacks on wages and conditions of the lowest paid workers in the State?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_253" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Innovation">
            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
            <p eId="para_506">The first act of Government will be to restore the national minimum wage.  The most vulnerable workers on the lowest rate of pay will be protected by the action we propose.  That is a significant reversal of the position.  Wage setting mechanisms must be fit for purpose and must be sensitive to the conditions in these sectors.  The main sectors affected are retail, catering, hotels and construction.  In the past three years, we have seen a 60% loss of employment in construction, 15% in retail and wholesale and more than twice that in the lower paid occupations.  The figures are similar for hotel and catering, with over 20% of jobs lost.  We must be sensitive to the relationship between wage setting mechanisms that, as the terms of reference mention, have anomalies, obsolete provisions and inflexibility.  Against a background of such job attrition we must ensure the wage setting mechanisms are fit for purpose.  There will be changes in the way these systems work.  There is a call for reform coming from the report and reform proposals will be brought forward, but they will be designed to create more and better employment opportunities to give people more opportunity to work in these sectors against a background of huge attrition.  I am conscious that there is considerable pressure on employers in these sectors as well.  The pay rates here are much higher than north of the Border.  There are real pressures in these sectors and real job losses occurring, and the system of wage setting must be sensitive to those pressures also.</p>

            <p eId="para_512">Apologies.  I am slightly worried by the Minister's answer.  In so far as job losses are taking place in these areas, I and many reasonable people would argue it is the lack of demand in the economy that results in people's incomes being slashed.  What I and the workers in this sector are looking for is an assurance that while there may be anomalies, and the unions and so on involved recognise there are some anomalies, straightening out anomalies will not result in an attack on the pay, conditions or mechanism that guarantees the reasonable and basic minimum pay and condition standards for some of the lowest paid workers in the State who have already been hammered with cuts.  Can the Minister give that assurance and can he indicate when this legislation will be published——</p>

I accept we must be conscious of the needs of people who are on low pay, and that is the reason we have increased the national minimum wage, but we cannot have systems regarding, for example, varied approaches to overtime and Sunday working that are common across different regulations.  These create inflexibilities, and we must see greater order and standardisation in the approach in different areas.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation (Deputy John Perry)</from>
            <p eId="para_518">The setting of commercial rates is a matter for local authorities, which come under the remit of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes, in accordance with the details entered into the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation.  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  The annual rate on valuation, ARV, is applied to the valuation of each property to obtain the amount payable in rates.  The ARV is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget, and its determination is a reserved function of the local authority.  The issue of changing the basis on which rates are charged, from a flat rate to a progressive rate, would be a policy matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, in consultation with the local authorities and the Minister for Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_519">While we have not commissioned any reports into commercial rates charges, the Government is aware that the cost of commercial rates is often cited as an area of concern by business interests.  Preliminary results from a review carried out by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government on commercial rates for 2011 show that 32 of 88 local authorities have decreased their annual rate on valuation this year, while 53 kept the same rate as 2010.  This follows a similar pattern to last year, when 31 local authorities reduced their ARV and 55 maintained the same ARV as 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_520">The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has had detailed discussions with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government on how we can work together to maximise opportunity for local business development and to keep all costs which impact on business as low as possible.  This work will continue and will include the exploration of options for further reducing local authority charges to business, which the Minister is keen to develop.</p>

            <from>Deputy Peadar Tóibín</from>
            <p eId="para_521">It is important to remind ourselves that main street Ireland is closing down.  There has been a shocking trend in recent years of businesses being unable to function.  The Small Firms Association reckons that 62,000 businesses are in danger of closure and that 200,000 jobs are in danger of loss.  There is an urgency in those numbers that no one can ignore.  The major reasons for those closures is a shrinking of the amount of money within the system which I and many Members on this side of the House would say is because of the austerity measures being employed.  The deficit has increased from €7 billion to €9 billion this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_523">I have a question.  Also, there is a movement throughout the State to introduce some level of fairness into the rates system.  While local authorities develop the rates, the rates system under which they work is decided by the policy of the Minister's Government.  Sinn Féin is a promoter of progressive taxes no matter where they happen.  In other words, the more one earns the more one pays.  It is ridiculous that businesses——</p>

Will the Minister develop a rates base that purely takes into consideration the profitability of the business concerned and the value of that business to society, be it an exporting business, a business with substitute imports or a business with a research and development capacity?  There is a great deal of opportunity for the Minister's Government to incentivise the way business is structured in this society, and it is not good enough to say it will be reviewed.</p>

            <p eId="para_529">While no reports have been undertaken to date examining specifically the effects of local authority rates on business, Forfás compiled a report in 2008 on the cost of running retail operations in Ireland.  The report found that local authority rates constitute up to 4% of business costs on the retail sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_530">I take on board the Deputy's valid point on the costs associated with doing business and the number of vacant commercial properties.  We are conscious of that.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, has undertaken a review to study closely the cost of doing business and how best we can reduce the cost of doing business.  The implementation of a local government efficiency review is being taken on board now as well in terms of how we can ring-fence the costs of doing business in local authorities.  That is very much at the behest of the local authority members.  It is our intention to ensure the cost of maintaining a business and the percentage of the cost of retail sales should be reduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_531">We are also conscious of the huge amount of excess retail floor space currently closed in main street Ireland.  That is due to the boom and the unprecedented development of the tax incentives during the previous Administration which propelled a huge level of development way beyond the requirement.  It is all about getting cost competitiveness and reducing the cost.  We are focused on the impact of rates on the cost of doing business and it is our intention to move decisively to reduce those costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_532">The progressive nature of rates and the model of how rates are charged is a technical area.  It is not fully justified as to how that will create a benefit as against reducing the actual cost.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
            <p eId="para_536">For the current year 2011, a total allocation of just over €631 million has been provided in funding for the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and the county enterprise boards.  This allocation comprises both current and capital funds and is provided for ongoing agency activities, including the attraction of foreign direct investment, enterprise development and support programmes, the development of science and technology programmes and promotion activities of these enterprise agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_537">These enterprise agencies have a crucial role to play in supporting economic recovery and driving sustainable employment growth in the years ahead.  They will support the enterprise base from micro-scale enterprise to the largest multinational and help our enterprises build a competitive edge to compete in the global marketplace.</p>
            <p eId="para_538">I am determined to ensure that every euro spent by these agencies is achieving the maximum possible impact in pursuing the central Government objective of maximising employment opportunities.  I am examining all programmes and priorities to evaluate their performance in meeting this challenge.  The Exchequer allocations to the respective agencies cited by the Deputy in his question for 2011 are as follows: the IDA has been allocated €124.577 million, of which €86 million is capital and €38.577 million current funding; Enterprise Ireland is in receipt of €304.482 million from my Department, of which €203.89 million is capital and €100.589 million current funding; Science Foundation Ireland has a budget of €175.142 million, of which €160.8 million is capital and €14.342 million current funding; and county enterprise boards have been allocated €27.242 million, of which €15 million is capital and €12.242 million current funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_539">The Government has announced that it will undertake comprehensive spending reviews of existing capital and current spending in the months ahead and consequently allocation of funding for future years, 2012-15, will be considered as part of that process.  The purpose of the review is to find efficiencies, to undertake reforms and to align spending with the priorities set out in the programme for Government.  My Department will be fully engaged in that spending review.  The activity and expenditure of enterprise agencies will be examined by my Department in the context of the expenditure review and the findings will determine the level of future funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_540">It is my aim to provide the level of support necessary to enable the enterprise agencies deliver on their remit to help enterprise to flourish and provide sustainable jobs.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_541">I thank the Minister for his response.  He seems to be saying that these agencies will not be exempt from the general spending review, which I accept.  However, that would indicate that the rate of spending on those agencies is not going to increase, indeed it is possibly going to decrease.  How does the Government hope to achieve its optimistic job-creation plans if it is possibly reducing funding for the very agencies on which we depend to create jobs, including attracting foreign investment?</p>
            <p eId="para_542">The Minister will be aware that last year, for example, the IDA created only approximately 1,300 jobs in net terms.  The record over the last four years shows that these enterprise agencies lost about 50,000 jobs more than they created, so in net terms that was a job creation record of minus 50,000.  I am not underestimating the difficulties they have had nor the tremendous work they have done but nevertheless I fail to see how these agencies will do their job if neither funding nor resources are being increased.  The Minister wants them to do a better job but how can they do so with less?</p>
            <p eId="para_543">Today it was announced that there will be a €3,000 finder's fee for members of the diaspora who come up with ideas that will create jobs that last for at least two years.  Will that fee be included in the budget for those agencies and, if not, what budget will it come from?</p>

            <p eId="para_546">Therefore the need for a comprehensive spending review, including an examination of every programme, has not been created by this Government.  With the greatest respect, I must tell the Deputy that the policies pursued in recent years destroyed competitiveness in the economy.  The previous Government saw exporting market share fall consistently for six years in a row.  It built up unsustainable spending programmes on the basis of revenues that could not last and it undermined the competitiveness of businesses that we are now looking to rebuild our future.</p>
            <p eId="para_547">To focus on how much we spend on these agencies is part of the problem of the last Government.  We must now ensure that any spending gets maximum impact, which is my first priority.  Of course, I will be seeking to expand every programme that is delivering high performance.  My Government colleagues, who have set jobs as their top priority, will support that.  It does not mean, however, that every programme is immune from scrutiny just because it is under the rubric of an enterprise agency.  We must get the best value from them.  Perhaps there was not enough scrutiny of the performance of different programmes in the past, but we cannot afford that any more.</p>
            <p eId="para_548">The pilot scheme will have to be funded but, as the Deputy knows, these are normal IDA supports where the return is something like 14 to 1 in terms of the cost benefit.  It is a handsome return to the State.</p>

            <p eId="para_553">Export performance is improving, but it is effectively doing so on the back of superhuman efforts by companies that are competing in a market where the price of their exports is falling.  There has been substantial cost cutting and less is being paid for labour across the board.  People have become more competitive and more resourceful, but the contribution of Government policy is not the main feature.  There has been a common approach to developing export capacity.  Nonetheless, the previous Government was in office for 14 years and only 10% of our exports come from indigenous industry.  We have not made the breakthrough to having a sustainable business engine from indigenous sources.  We must closely examine how well we are doing in indigenous enterprises.  Some sectors are doing well but the aggregate suggests there are grounds for improvement.</p>

         the job creation projects he has in mind for the north side of Dublin.

          </question>
          <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_287" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Innovation">
            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
            <p eId="para_558">Maximising the opportunities for employment is central to the programme for national recovery drawn up by Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  Our Government plans to introduce a jobs initiative next week, which will be an important first step to restore confidence and support economic recovery.  These measures will be supportive of job opportunities on Dublin's northside and throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_559">I am currently reviewing our jobs strategy on a comprehensive basis to evaluate how programmes can be better focused to maximise their impact on employment.  I am examining the adequacy of policy support for business start-up and expansion, particularly into export markets.  I hope this will bring greater focus on sectoral opportunities in different regions and on the potential of small and medium enterprises.</p>
            <p eId="para_560">There are many worthwhile programmes that are already helping to develop job opportunities on the northside.  Dublin City Enterprise Board and Fingal County Enterprise Board are supporting enterprise start-up and development throughout the northside of Dublin, through the provision of both direct and indirect assistance.  These two boards currently support 113 companies that employ 3,077 people on a full-time basis and 859 on a contract or part-time basis.  I understand that the Dublin City and Fingal enterprise boards have already approved  €337,440.00 in grant assistance so far in 2011.  Enterprise Ireland has 1,055 client companies in Dublin City employing 22,235 people on a full-time basis with a further 4,187 people on a contract or part-time basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_561">The community enterprise centres, funded through Enterprise Ireland, are providing enterprise space to cater for micro-enterprises in Ballymun, Coolock and Darndale.  In 2005, Enterprise Ireland has earmarked €2.54 million in capital support for the construction of a campus business incubation centre at the new DIT campus at Grangegorman, as well as €158,000 towards the costs of a centre manager.</p>
            <p eId="para_562">The new centre will provide the first phase of incubation facilities on the campus and will be the first new building on the site.  During the lifetime of this five-year operational plan it is expected that 129 new businesses will be incubated, leading to the creation of up to 1,500 direct high-quality jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_563">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_564">In terms of attracting foreign direct investment, north Dublin now confidently hosts world-class companies such as Citibank, Hertz, eBay and PayPal, among many others, across a range of industrial parks.  Recent announcements include decisions by Citibank and PayPal to expand their Dublin-based operations, which have the potential to create 250 jobs at Citibank and 150 at PayPal.  I was also pleased recently to announce that Asset Control, a global provider of data technology for financial institutions, based in East Wall, is expanding its financial technology operation in Ireland with the creation of 50 new IDA-supported jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_565">I am determined that Dublin's northside will build on these strengths to become a strong base for emerging and innovative businesses.  I am impressed by the An Slí Glas initiative which I recently launched in Dublin City University, DCU.  This alliance of businesses, academic institutions and local authorities includes Ballymun Regeneration, Dublin Airport Authority, DCU, Dublin Institute of Technology, Fingal County Council, Dublin City Council and north Dublin chamber.  It is designed to be a centre of green innovation and enterprise which will link business to investors and develop trade partnerships with other major international green corridors.  I will ensure that my agencies effectively support this initiative.  DCU research clusters are also a major magnet for new business ideas and Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, has recently partnered with DCU to provide entrepreneurship training for post-doctoral researchers.</p>
            <p eId="para_566">I believe there are significant opportunities for new sectors, for example, in digital gaming, which can build on the talent and enterprises operating on the northside.  I recognise that very early stage companies can face difficulties in raising external financing, and we are determined to ensure that there is greater support for them to help them bridge this gap.  In March, I announced ten successful companies that have been awarded funding under Enterprise Ireland's new Internet and games competitive start fund.  Following the publication of the jobs initiative, I will continue to work with my colleagues in Government to take action that will stimulate the economy, facilitate enterprise and encourage job creation, including on thenorthside of Dublin.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
            <p eId="para_569">I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 20 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_570">A key objective of the programme for Government is to stimulate the economy and incentivise employment growth both in the short term and the medium to long term.  The programme outlines the actions which will be taken on a number of fronts to support jobs growth, including improving access to finance for enterprises; getting our cost base right; helping businesses to be more innovative and to win new markets, and developing strategies to capitalise on Ireland's potential in key sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_571">The forthcoming jobs initiative will be an important first step in delivering policy to meet the ambitions in the programme for Government and it will outline a range of measures which will be taken across Departments, including my own, to restore confidence in the economy, improve our competitiveness and facilitate job creation and retention.  Following the publication of the initiative, I will continue the work in my Department, along with the enterprise agencies and my colleagues in Government, to develop a medium-term jobs programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_572">We will develop policy on a number of fronts such as access to finance.  In this regard, my Department is working with the Department of Finance, the Credit Review Office, Enterprise Ireland and Forfás to address access to credit issues for viable SMEs, including the commitment in the programme for Government for the introduction of a temporary, partial credit guarantee scheme.  It includes a commitment to construct a €100 million microfinance start-up fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_573">Getting our cost base right is another major theme.  While Ireland has regained some of its cost competitiveness, the Government is committed to doing more to reduce the cost base for business in areas such as rents and energy costs.  There are also opportunities for reducing red tape and tackling barriers to entry must be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_574">There is also considerable scope to help businesses to be more innovative and to win new markets.  I will evaluate a range of enterprise programmes and policies with a view to maximising their impact on job opportunities in co-operation with Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock.  These programmes are focused on assisting companies to grow and export through a number of measures.  I plan, along with my colleagues in Government, to develop initiatives to target particular sectors where there is great opportunity for developments such as life sciences, cloud computing, the digital gaming industry, the green economy and the international education sector.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
            <p eId="para_578">An independent review of the statutory wage setting mechanisms was initiated on 8 February last and was undertaken jointly by Kevin Duffy, chairman of the Labour Court acting in an <i>ad hoc</i> capacity, and Dr. Frank Walsh, School of Economics, UCD, under specific terms of reference.  The report of the independent review team has been completed and was received by me last Thursday, 28 April.  I am currently examining the report and it will be published and made available to Members following consideration by the Government.  </p>
            <p eId="para_579">It is proposed to have early discussions with the European Commission services on the main findings of the review, in line with the provisions in the EU-IMF programme.  Arising from these discussions, I will present a time-bound comprehensive action plan to follow up on the report's recommendations, setting out proposals for any legislative action that may be necessary to give effect to reform measures.  Consultation with, and the co-operation of, relevant stakeholders will also be sought to ensure that the required reforms can be progressed as a matter of urgency.</p>

            <from>Deputy Peadar Tóibín</from>
            <p eId="para_580">One of the major problems people have with the review is they feel that a number of the terms used in it are euphemisms.  For example, there is a reference to wage rigidity which others would look on as the safeguarding of wages and standards of living.  There is also a reference to flexibility, which some people believe is a euphemism for downward pressure on wage rates.  Given organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul have made submissions, which indicate that the standard of living of 250,000 people could be lowered through this review, will the Minister do his best to safeguard the standards of living of the individuals governed by these agreements?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_293" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Innovation">
            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
            <p eId="para_581">As the terms of reference have made clear, the role of statutory wage setting mechanisms is to strike a balance between the need to protect employment and the need to protect working standards.  There are two sides to this and, as I pointed out to Deputy Boyd Barrett, there have been significant job losses in these sectors on a truly dramatic scale.  For example, 37% of low income jobs in retail and wholesale have been lost while more than 60% have been lost in construction.  A number of sectors have been acutely affected by the recession.  Other sectors face acute competition, particularly cross-Border competition.  We must be mindful that our wage levels are substantially higher than in the North.</p>
            <p eId="para_582">Some measures in these agreements have been inflexible in the way that have been applied and many have found that it is not just the pay levels but some of the conditions and the specific nature of requirements to be recorded, policed and honoured that need to be addressed.  We must consider whether this is a suitable, modern mechanism to respond to sectors in deep crisis.  That is the backdrop to this examination and that is why radical reform will be proposed in the review.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_583">The Minister has said on a number of occasions that he will protect those at the lower end of the scale by increasing the national minimum wage.  He, therefore, regards the two issues as inextricably linked.  The programme for Government states independent chairpersons will be appointed to these committees.  Does the Minister not regard the current chairpersons to be acting independently?</p>
            <p eId="para_584">With regard to his promise, which I welcome, to publish the Duffy report, will he undertake to do so before he refers to it to EU and IMF officials?</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Collins</from>
            <p eId="para_585">Does the Minister agree that the austerity programme his Government is pursuing will continue to have a negative impact on jobs and industry?  Will the Minister be straight with the House and the people that the reversal in policy on the national minimum wage is not a concession by the Government but it is linked integrally to the 250,000 people on the EROs?  Will he make clear that it is part of the EU-IMF programme and the Government is being directed by the EU to do this?  There should be a review to protect workers such as those who worked in Connolly Shoes, Dún Laoghaire, who were indiscriminately sacked after 38 years.  This is an area in which regulations and protection of workers should be tightened up.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_296" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Innovation">
            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
            <p eId="para_586">The change in the policy on the national minimum wage is a decision of the Government and it reverses the position adopted by the previous Government under the EU-IMF agreement.  This decision reverses the policy in place before the Government took office.  Legislation will have to be introduced to implement this because I cannot do this by order.  A Bill will have to be debated and voted on in the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_587">Deputy O'Dea asked whether the two Bills would be taken together.  That remains to be seen.  It depends on timing issues and the complexity of reforms whether they will be addressed in one Bill or separate Bills.  However, they are separate issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_588">I hope to publish this report soon but I will also convey its contents to the EU Commission, as was undertaken.  It played a role in commissioning the report and, therefore, there is no reason to hold it back.  I will make it available to the EU as well.  I am anxious to publish it, indicate the direction of change to avoid a long period of uncertainty, as Members have highlighted, and make the decisions that are appropriate.</p>

            <p eId="para_590">The indication in the programme for Government is that the independent chairperson is not to question the independence of those who are already in place but to indicate that the basic structure of the JLCs with independent chairpersons would remain.  Clearly, there will be radical reform.  There was no reflection on any individual.</p>

This entails setting out our stall not only on the 12.5% corporation tax rate and the research and development tax credit but also on our intellectual capital and other attractions and in restoring reputational damage in that regard also.</p>
            <p eId="para_597">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_598">Ireland's ongoing development as a centre for research excellence continues to be a crucial factor in the attraction of foreign direct investment and SFI serves as a magnet of attraction for FDI through its support of research expertise in ICT, biotechnology and energy, its 341 principal investigator teams, its partnership with FDI and Irish companies in the nine centres for science, engineering and technology, CSETs, and the 19 strategic research centres, SRCs.</p>
            <p eId="para_599">As the agency tasked with attracting industrial FDI to Ireland, IDA Ireland approved 126 investment projects for support in 2010, including 37 research, development and innovation projects, where IDA support underpinned total RDI investment of approximately €465 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_600">Given the small size of the Irish economy, increased sales will be largely achieved overseas through exporting.  Enterprise Ireland is therefore focused on every aspect of the exporting and trade development process and the promotion of Irish companies on overseas trade visits is a key part of this process.  Overseas visits present an opportunity to build awareness among the international community of the availability of sophisticated products and services emerging from innovation and research and development within indigenous industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_601">We have other strengths, complementary to our fiscal regime and intellectual capital.  The availability of qualified labour, a workforce noted among peers internationally for its flexibility and adaptability and falling costs in terms of property, workforce and energy.  Our task, working together with the relevant Departments and agencies, is to marshal all of these strengths to deliver a positive outcome.</p>

            <p eId="para_615">On the first part of the question, as the Deputy is well aware the Minister, Deputy Bruton, has already visited India and a further visit to the United States is envisaged some time during the summer.  The Deputy will also be aware that the President has visited The Netherlands.  Part of that process involved engaging on the European Space Agency, ESA, programme in which six Irish companies are already involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_616">An internal engagement in ongoing on the content services centre.  We do not have definitive timelines at this stage but there is a very clear direction within the programme for Government that we would build on the existing centres of excellence and create three additional competence centres.  That engagement is currently ongoing.  I am happy to engage with the Deputy on the matter, as I would be with any Member of the House, because it is in the national interest that we continue to ensure we can build on the €600 million that is invested in research and development in this country.</p>
            <p eId="para_617">The research and STI programme will be vital in order to ensure that companies already in this country which are based on the FDI model stay here and that we can build and add to what exists.

            <p eId="para_619">Payment terms in commercial transactions are determined by the parties concerned and the responsibility for the collection of those payments and general credit control rests with the selling enterprise, in the first instance.  The issue of late payment is covered by the European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2002, SI 388 of 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_620">Under these regulations, it is an implied term of every commercial transaction that where a purchaser does not pay for goods or services by the relevant payment date, the supplier shall be entitled to interest, "late payment interest", on the amount outstanding.</p>
            <p eId="para_621">In the absence of any agreed payment date between the parties specified in the contract, late payment interest falls due after 30 days has elapsed, provided the invoice is not subject to query.  Since 2009, Departments have been improving their respective payment times, so as to assist the cash flow of businesses, which is critical, and are now obliged to pay their suppliers within 15 days of receipt of a valid invoice.  This has been extended across all Departments.  The 15 day prompt payment rule was introduced to Departments on an administrative basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_622">Departments are required to report quarterly on their performance in meeting this target.  To date, six sets of quarterly returns have been published on the website <i>www.deti.ie</i>.  The ongoing publication of these returns by my Department provides clarity on the performance of individual Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_623">As part of the commitments in the EU-IMF programme the 15 day prompt payment rule is being extended beyond Departments and is being rolled out to the Health Service Executive, local authorities, State agencies and all other public sector bodies, excluding commercial semi-State bodies.</p>
            <p eId="para_624">Businesses experiencing any difficulties in securing payments should in the first instance approach the body concerned.  Any failure to comply with the initiative can be brought to the attention of the relevant Minister with responsibility for the body concerned.  This initiative, which is critical, should have a considerable impact on the cash flows of small companies.</p>

            <p eId="para_625">I worked with approximately 2,000 separate businesses in the past seven years in my previous job as a management consultant.  One of the major problems they had was getting paid on time.  On many occasions when they went to banks, banks did not wish to get on the wrong side of the chain of credit.</p>
            <p eId="para_626">I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  Because the system is voluntary the Minister of State indicated that a letter will be sent to the relevant Minister in an effort to come to a resolution.  Are there any incentives or penalties which can be levied on an offending organisation which has not adhered to the 15 day rule?</p>

            <from>Deputy John Perry</from>
            <p eId="para_627">A total of 60,666 payments totalling €1.7 billion have been paid.  Some 50,000 payments were paid within 15 days which indicates a high level of compliance on behalf of semi-State bodies in a system which is currently operated on an administrative basis.  I fully agree that cash flow is the backbone of any business.  Given the lack of credit to small companies it is critically important that payments are made within 15 days or at the very least within 30 days.  There is no sanction after the 15th day, but there is a sanction if payment is not made by the 30th day.</p>
            <p eId="para_628">Clearly, Departments are moving in the right direction and we hope that in the private sector and commercial world people will pay within 30 days.  In many cases, the bigger the company, the slower it can be in paying.  We encourage companies to pay on time because prompt payment is the life blood of a business.  We recommend that with the support of the banking sector, payment is made within 15 days.  It is encouraging that some €1.722 billion was paid within 15 days.</p>

            <p eId="para_630">Fourteen Departments have paid between 96% and 100% of their invoices within 30 days and this Department has paid 91% of invoices within 30 days.  I would be delighted if compliance with the 30-day rule was implemented in the private sector because that would be a great benefit for the viability of small companies.  That is not the case currently.  The Departments are setting a good example and I am pleased with how they are operating the rules currently.  It is clear they are taking the advice of the State and paying the invoices of small companies that are the backbone of our economy, the bulk of them within 30 days and quite a number within 15 days.  That is very encouraging.  Therefore, administrative sanctions would not be recommended currently, because there is significant compliance.</p>

            <p eId="para_632">Since becoming Minister, I have met and had discussions with the chairmen, chief executives and senior executives in key companies, both indigenous and foreign direct investors, across a range of sectors.  Many of the companies involved already have substantial and valuable activities in Ireland while others are considering major investments here for the first time.</p>
            <p eId="para_633">On 17 and 18 March last, accompanied by the CEOs of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, I travelled to Germany and undertook a business programme in Berlin, Dusseldorf and Cologne.  Part of that programme involved meeting with senior German executives of existing and target client companies of the IDA.  During April, on trade missions to India, Saudi and  London, I met senior executives from a wide range of multinational companies and had the opportunity to outline the recent positive developments in the Irish economy  and the attractions of doing business with us.</p>
            <p eId="para_634">It is my intention to travel to the United States next month in the company of senior officials from my Department and the IDA to meet with CEOs and senior executives of companies located on the west coast.  These meetings will provide me with an opportunity to speak directly to senior executives of companies about Ireland as a location for investment and will include existing and target companies.  They will also allow me to hear, at first hand, the issues which industry considers important if Ireland is to retain this standing, and I continue to work with my Government colleagues to address these issues in a positive fashion.</p>
            <p eId="para_635">I am confident that support from myself and Government colleagues will bolster ongoing contacts between the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development with a wide variety of potential investors and lead to the creation of a pipeline of new business and the creation of high quality jobs.</p>

Also, the Twitter organisation is currently considering a substantial investment, which seems to be down to a choice between Ireland and the United Kingdom, and I understand the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, has already met the executives of Twitter.  Has anybody met the Twitter executives on behalf of the Irish Government?</p>

            <p eId="para_638">I read the document Blueprint for Recovery as I was travelling from India to Saudi Arabia in the middle of the night and perhaps my recollection of it is not quite as sharp as it should be.  It did make valuable suggestions, but many of them were suggestions that had been in previous reports.  As I mentioned earlier, I am conducting a root and branch review of what we are doing in our agencies across all programmes and policies and I will look at the suggestions made to see whether they can be factored in to that.  We will consider any good suggestions.  The suggestion in the media today for a finder fee came from an individual with considerable international experience and is brilliant in a sense.  It is something that should be tried.  We are willing to try any good ideas and I will revise suggestions with a fine tooth comb to see what initiatives we can test.</p>

            <from>Deputy John Perry</from>
            <p eId="para_640">The county and city enterprise boards, CEBs, have been the principal deliverers of State support to the micro-enterprise sector since their establishment in 1993.  The CEBs support micro-enterprises employing up to ten people in the start-up and expansion phases and also promote economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.  The CEBs deliver a series of programmes to underpin their role and they can provide both financial and non-financial assistance to an eligible micro-enterprise.  The micro-enterprise sector is a key component of the indigenous small business sector and I am confident that it will be key to our economic recovery.</p>
            <p eId="para_641">I thank Deputy O'Dea for his words of acknowledgement on my appointment.  With regard to the restructuring of the CEBs, there is no doubt but that the county enterprise board model has served the micro-enterprise sector very well over the years but there is also no doubt that some restructuring of that model is now required.  There have been many changes to the social, economic and technological landscape of Ireland since the establishment of the boards in 1993 and it is timely to restructure.  However, any restructuring must not compromise the State's engagement with and support for our important micro-enterprise sector and in particular must not make it more difficult for the end-user to access the support services available for the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_642">As Minister of State with responsibility for small business, I want to ensure that there is a coherent and cohesive delivery of State support to the indigenous business sector, based on clear enterprise policy principles laid down by the Department and to ensure that any structural or institutional changes do not compromise the State's support for indigenous businesses.  There are a number of schools of thought on the best way forward on CEB restructuring.  All options are being considered at this stage and I am engaging with officials and other Government colleagues in order to determine the best way forward.</p>

            <p eId="para_648">The county enterprise boards are at the coal face of small enterprise development throughout the State.  They have a great knowledge of entrepreneurs living in their area and are extremely successful.  Their focus, ethos and accessibility would be reduced if they were amalgamated with the local authorities and I would urge the Minister not to become involved in that.  Instead, I urge him to reinforce investment in the county enterprise structure.</p>
            <p eId="para_649">We have a fine Deputy from Meath here today, but, unfortunately, Meath does not get the same level of investment from the IDA and Enterprise Ireland as other counties.  I urge the Minister to take that into consideration in future when developing policy with regard to these organisations.  Will the Minister of State consider implementing a State-wide programme for exporting for small businesses with under ten employees and include that in enterprise boards?</p>

            <from>Deputy John Perry</from>
            <p eId="para_650">The restructuring of the boards is long overdue, but they have operated successfully as a one-stop-shop facility.  As Deputy Bruton stated, we are looking at options that will ensure there will be a facility available for people who are setting up small companies in the innovation, research and development area or in the micro-enterprise area and the boards will certainly fund seed capital for larger companies.  I assure the Deputy that whatever the final decision taken on the restructuring, it will enhance the situation.  We have 35 enterprise boards to date, without duplication.  They do outstanding work and have been very successful with limited resources.  The backbone of this economy is small companies.  It is about encouraging enterprise by providing a one-stop-shop facility that will clearly preserve the ethos of the enterprise boards.  I acknowledge the critical role of the enterprise boards to date.  Some very successful companies in the State have started with the support of the enterprise boards and that certainly will not be lost in the restructuring.  As the Minister, Deputy Bruton, stated, it will encompass the best expertise and facilitation and will cut down on red tape with less duplication to ensure a person with an idea can go to a single location, an instant solution centre, that will satisfy his or her requirements in terms of initial seed capital, working capital or whatever the case may be to encourage that person to set up a company.  Our job will be ensuring that facility will be in place.</p>

            <p eId="para_654">I expect shortly to receive the report of the facilitator appointed to engage with the various stakeholders to explore the possibilities of agreeing a voluntary code of practice to regulate relationships and practices in the grocery goods sector.  As soon as I have considered the report, a decision will be made on publication of the report and on the detail of any legislation that might be introduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_655">As the Deputy is aware, the programme for Government contains a specific commitment to enact the fair trade legislation which will ban a number of unfair trading practices in the retail sector such as so-called hello money which suppliers have to pay to secure a place for their goods on supermarket shelves.  It is my intention to give effect to this commitment by including a specific enabling provision in legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_656">The Government is strongly committed to ensuring Ireland continues to have vibrant agrifood and retail sectors, especially given the importance of these sectors to the national economy.  The Government considers it important, therefore, that there is balance in the relationship between the various players in the grocery goods sector.  The introduction of a code of practice, as provided for in the programme for Government, is intended to achieve such a balance taking into account the interests of all stakeholders in the grocery goods sector, including the interests of the consumer and the need to ensure there is no impediment to passing on lower prices to consumers.</p>

            <p eId="para_658">We regularly meet representatives of various sectors.  There is a possibility of engaging directly with the sector to agree a voluntary code, but it appears unlikely that will happen.  I believe the likelihood is that there will be legislation.  Of course there is already legislation and if people came forward with evidence, activities such as demanding hello money would in theory be in conflict with competition legislation.  The difficulty is getting evidence to take a prosecution, which is why we need to get a code of practice and get more material published as routine in order that there would be the basis for checking whether there is compliance with the principles.  That, unfortunately, appears to be the way to go.  I have no great enthusiasm for this because it is another source of regulatory burden, but there needs to be fairness in the balance between the players in the sector.  If a voluntary agreement cannot be reached, we will need to take legislative action.  The enforcement of that would be down to the competition and consumer authorities.  I will probably try to introduce any such legislative proposals in conjunction with the legislation which is due before the House soon.</p>

            <p eId="para_660">The redundancy payments scheme, which is now operated by the Department of Social Protection, provides statutory redundancy entitlements to those who have lost their jobs.  In addition, the Department of Social Protection and FÁS offer supports to redundant workers, including assistance in identifying new employment opportunities as well as retraining and up-skilling to improve their employment prospects.</p>
            <p eId="para_661">I am advised that the level of redundancies in the economy in the first quarter of this year fell by 24% compared with the same period in 2010.  During the period January to March 2011, 13,404 redundancy claims were received by the State compared with 17,598 claims over the same period in 2010.  The Government's objective is that the number of redundancies will continue to decrease by putting in place the right policies to support job retention and encourage employment growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_662">The forthcoming jobs initiative will outline a range of measures which will be taken across all Departments, including my own, to support job retention and creation by improving the business environment, increasing competitiveness, increasing our exports and restoring confidence in the economy internationally and domestically.  The presentation of the jobs initiative will be the first step in the Government's plans to bring about economic recovery.  Following the publication of the jobs initiative, I will continue to work with my colleagues in Government to develop medium and longer-term strategies to incentivise job creation further.  In addition, my Department's enterprise agencies, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the county and city enterprise boards, will continue to work with their clients on an ongoing basis to support job creation and retention.</p>

            <p eId="para_663">Obviously the redundancy figures are shocking.  Each of these lost jobs costs the State at least €20,000.  It is very important that the State stands in solidarity with those individuals under threat and also the businesses which for business reasons feel forced to let those individuals go.  These are often very highly skilled individuals with great experience and knowledge who could act as a tremendous resource for new business generation.  Would the Minister consider a system whereby these individuals could act as mentors to start-up businesses either in a voluntary capacity or supported in some way through the enterprise development agencies?</p>

            <p eId="para_664">Many years of bad policies have led to the scale of these figures, which will not be reversed overnight.  We will do our level best to make jobs our priority and reverse those losses.</p>
            <p eId="para_665">I am very keen to provide more mentoring support and support generally to management capability in a broader range of companies than now receive support.  I would be keen to see ways developed that would result in more business-to-business support in the way the Deputy suggests.  That would include people who have experience but have been displaced from companies.  In the review I am undertaking, I would be keen to see whether we can do more in that area.  Unfortunately, we will be seeking to do more with less.  We will be looking to chambers of commerce, Plato groups and so on that have been successful in bringing a mix of talent to bear and helping companies to expand and develop.  It will be trying to promote self-help groups rather than the State being involved in funding and selecting.  I believe there is scope in this area, as the Deputy rightly says.</p>

            <p eId="para_667">The role of Government is not to create jobs directly but to put in place the environment where businesses can prosper and generate jobs.  In this context, the objective of the forthcoming jobs initiative will be to put policies in place to improve the business environment in Ireland, drive competitiveness, continue to increase our exports and restore confidence in the economy, both internationally and domestically.  The jobs initiative will support the maintenance of existing jobs as well as facilitating the creation of new ones.  The initiative will include a range of measures which will be taken across all Departments, including my own, to stimulate the economy and help get people back to work.</p>
            <p eId="para_668">It is likely that the impact of the jobs initiative on employment will be most visible from 2012 as economic activity picks up in response to the initiative and other Government measures.  The stability programme update published on 29 April foresees net employment creation of the order of 100,000 over the period from 2012 to 2015.  The presentation of the jobs initiative will be just the first step in the Government's plans to bring about economic recovery and incentivise employment.  Following the publication of the jobs initiative, I will continue to work, along with the enterprise agencies and my colleagues in the Government, to develop a medium-term jobs programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_669">We will develop policy on a number of fronts, such as improving access to finance for enterprises, getting our cost base right, helping businesses to be more innovative and to win new markets, and developing strategies to capitalise on Ireland's potential in key sectors such as life sciences, cloud computing, the digital gaming industry, the green economy and the international education sector.  As outlined in the programme for Government, the Government will also implement a number of sectoral initiatives in areas that will create employment in the domestic economy.  These include initiatives in the retail and SME sectors, ICT, agri-food, tourism, financial services, social enterprise, the green economy and education.  We will introduce a new national development plan that reflects Ireland's changed economic circumstances <i>, </i>covering the seven-year period 2012-19.</p>
            <p eId="para_670">As Minister with responsibility for enterprise, jobs and innovation, I will be monitoring closely the impact of the jobs initiative and subsequent strategies in the areas that fall under my remit.</p>

            <p eId="para_671">There is a major difference between the perspectives of each side of the floor.  The Government is locked into a deflationary policy that prevents major job-creation initiatives from being undertaken.  In the Nyberg report, we read about the herd mentality.  There is often a homogenous way of thinking when trying to solve these problems.  I urge the Government to break out of its current view if at all possible.  There are ways in which governments can create jobs, including capital investment projects.  In my county, schools, hospitals, rail lines and green projects need to be built.  The Government could also develop projects such as the IFSC, which created a large number of jobs in recent years.  Will the Government begin to initiate projects, as outlined in its manifesto prior to the election, that will actually create jobs rather than leave the task to the private sector?</p>

            <p eId="para_672">We certainly will.  The programme for Government, as the Deputy knows, contains a commitment to develop a State infrastructural bank and the concept of NewERA, by investing in key State-owned infrastructure.  We recognise there is an onus on the State to take the initiative in areas in which it can make a significant contribution.</p>
            <p eId="para_673">We must be honest about the fact that at a time when we are spending 40% more than we are raising in revenue, the emphasis must be on structural reform and micro-reform as opposed to big spending programmes of the traditional sort.  We will have to box clever with the money we have available rather than have big spending programmes.  I admit other economies that do not have debt levels at 100% can engage in the latter with some effect.  We must focus on the instruments available to us.  Much of the assessment of our economy recognises that structural reforms can have the greatest impact on long-term employment sustainability.  The focus of the Government's strategy is correct.</p>

            <p eId="para_675">At the forthcoming International Labour Conference to be held in Geneva in June 2011, the proposal for a draft convention on decent work for domestic workers is a significant and important agenda item.  In accordance with standard procedure in respect of the negotiation of any international labour instrument at the International Labour Organisation, it will be the subject of discussion on a tripartite basis involving Governments, employer representative bodies and worker representative bodies over a three-week period.  The possible adoption of any such international labour instrument will be subject to the outcome of these discussions at the conference in June.</p>
            <p eId="para_676">The Deputy will appreciate that in advance of the detailed discussion and negotiation on the text of any such international instrument, it would be inappropriate to anticipate our position on a draft convention, the final text of which is not yet settled.  However, it is worth pointing out that the full suite of employment rights that applies to workers in Ireland is equally applicable to domestic workers.  Ireland has been cited internationally as an example of good practice in this area, not least through the introduction of a voluntary code of practice entitled Code of Practice for Persons Employed in Other People's Homes in 2007.  During Ireland's tenure on the governing body of the International Labour Organisation, the Irish Government representative supported the inclusion of an ILO standard-setting instrument in this area on the agenda for consideration by the International Labour Conference.</p>
            <p eId="para_677">In the context of the forthcoming International Labour Conference in June, Ireland will continue to play a constructive and positive role in which it is hoped the ILO will be in a position to adopt a convention on decent work for domestic workers.</p>

            <p eId="para_678">I am sure the Minister is probably aware that one third of domestic workers in Ireland earn less than the minimum wage at present.  It is reckoned that 40% of them have no contracts.  Unfortunately, many of the domestic workers in Ireland are migrant workers and their immigration status is very often used against them.  Domestic workers do not have the rights of ordinary workers at present.  With a view to being fair, their rights are worth campaigning for.  The Government should be pushing very strongly in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_679">Under existing law, NERA inspectors can pursue the examination of employment records, either entering with the consent of the occupier or by warrant of the District Court.  As in all cases where NERA proposes to conduct an inspection of employment records, notice is provided by it either in writing or by telephone to advise the employer of the proposed inspection.  I am advised that, in cases where consent to enter a private residence is not given, NERA meets the employers in an alternative location to examine the relevant employment records, although this has arisen only in a very small percentage of cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_680">From what the Deputy says, domestic workers are very much part of the grey economy.  It is undoubtedly an issue of enforcement rather than conventions in that the full weight of existing domestic law applies.  From what the Deputy said, it is not being achieved in a substantial minority of cases.  I recognise this problem.  I will have to take advices on how it can be better handled.  The Deputy is probably correct that the problem is largely associated with incorrect immigration status.  It is quite a complex issue.  The enforcement of migration rules raises very significant difficulties also.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
            <p eId="para_685">I am pleased to have the opportunity to raise this important matter.  NAMA was established in May 2009 with the remit of transferring the loans on key developments and assets from the books of State-guaranteed banks in return for Government-guaranteed securities.  To date, it has accumulated €40 billion of loans on its books and, as such, has an obligation to the State to realise the maximum value on its sites.  While NAMA is not the titleholder, landowner or developer of the assets acquired, the assets are strongly influenced by NAMA.  This was witnessed in Dublin Central where we saw what happened to the Lighthouse Cinema on foot of upward-only rent reviews and the insistence by NAMA that the developers should extract the maximum possible commercial rent.  That resulted in a rent increasing from €100,000 to €200,000 and eventually to €500,000, which is quite extraordinary in these recessionary times.</p>
            <p eId="para_686">What is worse is that NAMA is operating under a veil of secrecy; it is a secret organisation.  There is no asset map of NAMA property and NAMA has stated that it does not intend to produce one.  NAMA considers itself to be subject to the same client-bank clauses of confidentiality.</p>
            <p eId="para_687">However, NAMA is much more than a bank or asset management agency.  It controls property with a value of almost one third of national GDP.  Whatever NAMA does with that property will impact hugely on the future development of our economy and will play a major role in its recovery or otherwise.  Nevertheless, NAMA's actions are shrouded in secrecy.  There is speculation about which lands and developers are in the control of NAMA but there is no definitive way of confirming its assets.  The public cannot get a proper picture of what the position is at a given time.</p>
            <p eId="para_688">Once a loan is acquired by NAMA the developer is obliged to submit a business plan within 30 days.  NAMA considers the plan, approves it and manages how it is to be implemented.  A business plan includes all of the developer's assets but is not necessarily subject to a development-by-development approach.  Again, the business plans and proposals are not subject to public scrutiny.  Even the local authorities have no statutory right to have an input or to scrutinise these plans.  Dublin City Council has been unable to meet the representatives of NAMA.  Its requests have been refused on three separate occasions.  There are no defined final dates or time limits imposed on business plan reviews.  Again, there is no transparency in monitoring how NAMA does its work.</p>
            <p eId="para_689">With such a vast land bank of assets throughout the country NAMA has the potential to plan strategically on a national basis and could play a major role in creating conditions for economic recovery.  Through strategic planning NAMA could maximise the potential of planned or existing infrastructure and thereby enhance the potential of certain NAMA lands.  While it is clear that it will take decades to emerge from the current economic crisis, NAMA appears to have no long-term strategic view.  It is noteworthy that no planners are employed by the agency.  Just as the boom was "developer-led", so too is the recession due to the developer-led approach of NAMA.</p>
            <p eId="para_690">The programme for Government contains a commitment to ensuring that NAMA can yield a social or cultural dividend.  Page 58 of the programme states: "We will seek to capture some public good from NAMA by identifying buildings that have no commercial potential, and which might be suitable as local facilities for art and culture".  To date, NAMA has failed to state how this can or will be achieved, and the lack of transparency and accountability in NAMA makes it impossible to pursue the matter.  The potential to realise a social, community or cultural dividend from NAMA is dependent on NAMA taking a long-term strategic view.  Indeed, as long as the remit of NAMA remains the creation of the maximum return on assets at all costs, it is likely that substantial opportunities in the public interest could be overlooked or simply not prioritised.</p>
            <p eId="para_691">The first essential step is a review of the freedom of information legislation to bring NAMA within its remit.  The argument that NAMA's dealings are commercially sensitive is spurious.  It should be possible to protect the more commercially sensitive information while at the same time ensuring that NAMA operates in a transparent, accountable manner, that it operates strategically in the national interest and that the public can see what NAMA is doing as the case arises.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Pat Rabbitte)</from>
            <p eId="para_692">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  I have a great deal of sympathy with the arguments he advances.  It is regrettable that when the NAMA legislation was enacted it was not possible for the House to agree that an oversight committee of the House should be established to monitor NAMA's affairs.  I advocated that argument at the time and it was debated.  Given the significance of this issue, an oversight committee of the House would have been very helpful both within and outside the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_693">If there were more openness about the transactions taking place, it would assist the re-emergence of a market.  Part of the difficulty we have been suffering for the last three years of stasis in the market following the effective collapse of the banking system is the absence of openness about the transactions that are taking place.  The view has been put to me, and I am inclined to believe it has merit, that if there was a requirement for notification of transactions taking place, be it with regard to commercial rents or the purchase of properties both domestic and commercial, it would assist in the re-emergence of a market.  People would know where they stand and this would help to establish a floor in the market.</p>
            <p eId="para_694">None of this is happening because, as Deputy Costello has argued, many of these transactions are effectively secret at present.  Apart from anything else, that encourages bad practices whereby estate agents are reverting to old bad habits by puffing and mystifying the terms of actual transactions.  All that is unhelpful.  I will counsel my colleagues that this ought to be examined carefully.  Deputy Costello is aware that my colleague, Deputy Howlin, the Minister with responsibility for public expenditure and reform is focused on these issues in the context of the Government's reform programme.  I can assure the Deputy that whether it is NAMA, the National Treasury Management Agency the Central Bank or other publicly-funded bodies in the banking and financial sector, the arguments he has raised will be given full consideration by my colleagues.</p>
            <p eId="para_695">The Government is committed to an elaborate reform programme in respect of legislation to restore the Freedom of Information Act and the extension of its remit to public bodies such as the Garda Síochána.  Obviously, it will not include the security dimensions of the Garda but it will be extended to the administrative side.  The Government will extend the Freedom of Information Act and the Ombudsman Act to ensure that all statutory bodies, and all bodies significantly funded from the public purse, are covered.  These are far-reaching reforms which are being spearheaded by the Minister, Deputy Howlin.  The programme set out for him in the programme for Government is significant.  He is consulting with other Ministers on the effective repeal of the 2003 amendment Act in its entirety, the inclusion of all statutory bodies including those under the aegis of the Department of Finance and the Department of Justice and Equality in particular and the identification of any other concerns that might exist regarding the impact of the Freedom of Information Acts on the discharge of Government business.</p>
            <p eId="para_696">The issues raised by Deputy Costello are very important and I believe my colleagues in Government share my opinion.  We are trying to get a handle on NAMA's position at present.  Everybody knows how the architecture of NAMA was created and came into being; there is no point in going back over the arguments.  It is in existence.  Questions of commercial sensitivity arise and also with regard to matters to do with confidentiality in its proper place, but that is not to say there ought not to be oversight, and ideally, parliamentary oversight.</p>
            <p eId="para_697">Questions of transparency ought to be dealt with.  I am sure that my colleague, the Minister with responsibility for public expenditure and reform, Deputy Howlin, will respond in due course.</p>

          <heading>Fuel Prices</heading>
          <speech by="#JohnOMahony" eId="spk_348">
            <from>Deputy John O’Mahony</from>
            <p eId="para_698">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter.  I also thank the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources for being present in the Chamber to hear what I have to say.</p>
            <p eId="para_699">Everyone is aware of the fact that fuel prices have been spiralling upwards.  This matter affects every citizen, business and industry, especially the haulage industry, in the State.  I am aware that there are no easy solutions in respect of the problem of rising fuel prices, especially as Ireland is powerless to influence international oil prices.  I am not, therefore, raising this matter from the point of view of having a go at someone.  I am, however, convinced that we have passed the point of diminishing returns so far as rising fuel prices are concerned.  This was confirmed yesterday by the Irish Petrol Retail Association which indicated that there has been a decrease of up to 10% in fuel sales.  This is because people are reducing their level of travel, which might be no bad thing in one sense.  We need, however, to stimulate businesses, including those of taxi drivers and hauliers, industry and our transport services.</p>
            <p eId="para_700">It should be noted that when fuel prices increase, the Exchequer takes an increased percentage.  A system was implemented in the UK under which, as prices increase, the percentage taken by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs is adjusted in order that Treasury would take in the same rather than a larger amount.</p>
            <p eId="para_701">I accept that resources are scarce.  In that context, I wish to raise another issue that has been brought to my attention by a number of legitimate oil distributors in recent weeks.  The latter have indicated to me that there has been a massive increase in the laundering of marked gas oil from the North which has found its way across the Border.  This issue has not been brought to the attention of many people but I have contacted various Ministers and the Revenue Commissioners in respect of it.  On 1 January last the specification used for off-road transportation was changed from 1,000 parts per million, ppm, of sulphur to 10 ppm.  In effect, this means that it is more difficult to detect diesel which has been washed.  As a result, this fuel can get through the system.</p>
            <p eId="para_702">Once the dye marker is removed, the relevant test will not show a fuel to be a marked product which is supposed to be sold with a duty rebate.  The type of product to which I refer is being sold through service stations that are leased on a short-term basis by the distributors who are purchasing it.  The duty difference is 37.84 cent per litre and this gives rise to a loss of €14,380 in excise duties on a standard truckload of fuel.  Most of this trade is conducted by subversive elements which are located in the Border area and which have a great deal of experience in chemistry.</p>
            <p eId="para_703">A simple and quick solution in respect of the matter to which I refer would be to require all oil distributors to leave marked gas oil with the dye intact and to require a separate registration for each distributor to claim back the rebate of duty.  Those who register would be obliged to meet certain criteria, such as the provision of tax clearance certificates, submission to inspections and the provision of information relating to gas oil sales.  Duty could be refunded weekly.  If the approach to which I refer were adopted, the problem that exists could be wiped out overnight.</p>
            <p eId="para_704">A solution such as that which I propose would not cause any reduction in revenue to the State.  It would, however, ease the burden on hard-pressed motorists, businesses and hauliers.  A jobs initiative is due to be announced in the House next week and we want to make it less costly for businesses to operate.  I am trying to be constructive with regard to that matter and, as a result, I suggest that there is a ready-made solution available in the context of adjusting fuel prices in so far as is possible, ensuring that all distributors are operating legitimately and obtaining the revenue that is due to the State.  I look forward with interest to the Minister's reply in respect of this matter.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_349" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_705">I thank Deputy O'Mahony for raising this important issue which is of considerable concern to me and my Government colleagues.  I did not anticipate the aspect of criminality to which the Deputy referred.  I am aware that the type of behaviour outlined is occurring and that the customs division of the Revenue is focused on dealing with it.  This is a matter of some significance which must be addressed and in respect of which vigilance is required, particularly in the context of the reported scale of the problem.  I understand an incident relating to this aspect of the matter is currently in the news.</p>
            <p eId="para_706">On the wider issue raised by Deputy O'Mahony, it must be acknowledged that Ireland is critically dependent on imported fossil fuels, especially oil and natural gas.  Global fuel prices have been trending upwards in recent months and Ireland, along with other countries, is a price taker in international commodity markets.  While active competition in retail energy markets will keep increases to a minimum, the reality is that increasing global fuel prices ultimately result in higher costs for Irish consumers, whether at the petrol pump or in electricity and gas bills.  I am keenly aware of the impact this has on consumers and I am, therefore, strongly focused on implementing the programme for Government actions aimed at reducing the impact of imported fossil fuel prices on householders and businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_707">The programme for Government sets out a range of commitments on energy efficiency and renewable energy programmes which are aimed at moving the economy away from reliance on imported carbon intensive fossil fuels, in respect of which there continues to be significant price volatility.  These ambitious measures will support energy affordability, enhance Ireland's competitiveness and develop new jobs and industries.  I am of the view that Ireland has the opportunity to become a global leader in the commercialisation of next generation bioenergy technologies, as well as a manufacturing hub for renewable and low-carbon technologies.</p>
            <p eId="para_708">The new retrofit programme will also support employment by seeking to increase significantly the pace of uptake in respect of energy efficiency measures and by changing radically the way householders are incentivised and supported.  One of the most commonly identified barriers to retrofitting is that the initial cost appears prohibitive.  Under the new proposals, energy efficiency measures will be more accessible by the provision of discounts up front rather than obliging people to wait for retrospective grant payments.  The new programme will entail the existing warmer homes scheme, the home energy saving scheme and the greener homes scheme being incorporated into the programme during the course of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_709">The warmer homes scheme is systematically addressing poor thermal efficiency performance of low income, privately owned housing.  It provides energy improvements at no cost to eligible households and brings benefits to recipients in the context of energy affordability, tangible health improvements and overall well-being.  The scheme is complemented by a similar retrofit programme which is delivered by local authorities on behalf of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  In addition, the fuel allowance provides many families with essential financial assistance in respect of the purchase of fuel.  More than 370,000 households received the fuel allowance in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_710">Grant aid to move to renewable heating is also being provided under the greener homes programme.  This is allowing householders, businesses and local enterprises to move away from oil fired heating towards more efficient and sustainable forms of heating such as those produced from solar, geothermal and biomass sources.</p>
            <p eId="para_711">In the transport sector, to which the Deputy referred, we are supporting a move away from imported oil through the successful introduction of bio-fuels into the fuel chain as well as an electric vehicle programme.  I launched the electric vehicle grant scheme, which will sustain and expand Ireland's leadership position with regard to this new and rapidly developing technology, earlier in the year.  Electric vehicles offer huge potential for Ireland not just because of their energy efficiency, but also because of the ability they provide to use cheap grid sourced electricity, an increasing amount of which will be sourced from renewable resources over the coming years.</p>
            <p eId="para_712">This will have obvious benefits in reducing our dependence on imported fossil fuels in the medium term, but our early and considerable involvement in the electric vehicle sector will also provide enterprise opportunities for Irish companies.  On foot of trial and pilot programmes, a number of Irish companies have already built charging systems and are involved in software design of the infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_713">The bio-fuel obligation scheme incentivises and enables the sustainable growth of the Irish bio-fuels market and supports indigenous bio-fuel producers, allowing for the displacement of traditional oil products in the transport sector.  In total, during the first obligation period, the obligation scheme was responsible for bringing a total volume of 98.5 million litres of bio-fuel into the motor fuel market in Ireland.  This equates to more than 4.25% of the transport fuel market in the State, up from practically zero in 2005.  The range and breadth of the actions set out in the programme for Government demonstrate the Government's commitment to reducing the impact of high fossil fuel prices, enhancing security of supply and ensuring competitiveness.</p>

          <heading>Emergency Services</heading>
          <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_350">
            <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty</from>
            <p eId="para_714">We are all glad at this stage that the fires that have raged across many counties are now under control.  However, we acknowledge the threat that many of them can re-ignite in the short term, as some of them are still smouldering in my own county of Donegal.  There is also a threat in the weeks and months ahead that these fires could take place again.</p>
            <p eId="para_715">The community response to these fires has been nothing short of inspiring.  Over the last week to ten days, ordinary men and women have been putting themselves in the line of fire, with the support of our fire fighters, army personnel and the Civil Defence.  There has been a major community mobilisation aimed at tackling these fires.</p>
            <p eId="para_716">There was real sense of emergency, with fires blazing for up to ten days.  Two houses in Donegal were burned out.  Some farmers' livelihoods have gone up in flames.  Miles and miles of fences have been destroyed.  Firemen and civilians were put into dangerous situations.  However, there seemed to be a lack of urgency from the State.  An interdepartmental group should be established on a permanent basis to deal with responses of this nature.  We had such a gripe following the big freeze and the flooding problems, and now we have issues with forest fires.  There needs to be an immediate interdepartmental response to events such as these, which could be made up of Departments and State agencies such as Met Éireann, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Department of Defence and the Department of Finance.  Such an interdepartmental response would make sure that we harness the resources of the State appropriately and that we have an active rapid response unit.</p>
            <p eId="para_717">I am sure the Minister saw the thousands of ordinary people out fighting fires.  None of them was prepared.  None of them knew the best protective clothing to wear or the best way to fight a fire.  These are simple things that could have been explained to them if an interdepartmental unit was set up and published the best advice possible to ordinary citizens in these areas.  I appeal to the Minister to set up such a unit.  I also would like the Minister to look at the need to compensate farmers whose livelihoods have gone up in flames, particularly with farm inspections coming up.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PadraigMacLochlainn" eId="spk_351">
            <from>Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn</from>
            <p eId="para_718">I am sure the Minister has been fully briefed on the devastating impact on farmers and on wildlife in the areas affected by the fires.  It is ironic because the farming community is constantly harassed about its responsibilities to wildlife, habitats and special areas of conservation by enthusiastic people with clipboards, yet this situation of widespread devastation could have been avoided with better approaches.  One such approach is related to the destocking of commonage that started in 1998.  The real experts on the environment in rural areas are our farmers.  Wherever there was stocking on land, wherever grazing had not been taking place, the impact was much less.  Wherever there was a shortage of stock, it was more profound.  That is a key issue.  I know it is not the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, but I would like him to speak to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to see if this can be reviewed.</p>
            <p eId="para_719">I join Deputy Doherty in commending the heroic actions of our firemen throughout the State, of the Defence Forces and, most importantly, local volunteers who would not have the skills required to do this job.  The enthusiasm and the determination to assist was clear throughout Donegal and across the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_720">There are also examples in some parts of the State of approaches taken by the emergency services that seemed to be more successful than approaches taken in other parts.  There needs to be a complete review by the relevant Departments of lessons learned from this.  Another point made is the impact of the frost, which created the circumstances that allowed the exceptional amount of gorse fires to continue.</p>
            <p eId="para_721">I endorse Deputy Doherty's call for a co-ordinated emergency response to be deployed to situations like these in the future, and to pre-empt them as much as possible.  We also need to deploy the same resources to the floods and to the frost.  As a county councillor at the time, I have to say we were deeply disappointed with the approach of the previous Government to the crisis in the freezing temperatures.  It was very slow and it took weeks to get off the ground.  It is important that this Government does not repeat those mistakes.  It has failed in its first test to co-ordinate the response nationally, and if it was not for local authorities, local firemen and local communities, this would have been much worse.  It needs to be dealt with in an authoritative fashion.  The Minister and his colleagues in the relevant Departments should sort this out.  I think they should send a letter of congratulations on behalf of the Government to the local authorities and fire services, thanking them for their heroic efforts and reassuring them that they will have the supports necessary to do their job, including water tankers for the fire services.  I also ask the Minister to consider the issue of destocking that has contributed to this and I remind him of the need for a better co-ordinated emergency response in the future.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Phil Hogan)</from>
            <p eId="para_722">I thank Deputies Doherty and Mac Lochlainn for raising this important matter.  I would like to join them at the outset to express sincere appreciation to our firefighters who have worked tirelessly to tackle the wildfires which have afflicted many parts of the country in recent days.  I am glad to place on record the Government's appreciation to all those agencies, including the Defence Forces, the Garda Síochána and Civil Defence, which have been working closely together to respond rapidly and appropriately to the situation as it has developed.  The worst affected region has been Donegal, but other seriously affected counties include Mayo, Galway, Cavan, Monaghan, Laois, Offaly, Westmeath, Meath and Louth.</p>
            <p eId="para_723">The unseasonal dry and hot weather since the Government took office has created the conditions for wild land fires——</p>

          <speech by="#PhilipHogan" eId="spk_354" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Community_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
            <p eId="para_725">——and it will cause problems.  Indeed, both wet and dry weather will equally cause problems.  Strong winds over the past weekend have led to a rapid spread of these fires which have damaged forests and threatened houses.  The nature of the soil and vegetation in upland areas is such that it is combustible and long-burning during periods of hot, dry weather.  Also, the recent cold winter has removed a considerable amount of vegetation and exposed the dry, peat-type vegetation to the sun.</p>
            <p eId="para_726">The response to the recent spate of grassland, forest, bog and other wildfires constitutes a significant drain on resources.  However, it is important that we look after the human dimension as well as all of the other aspects of the natural terrain in order to ensure that resources are not standing in the way of ensuring that people are protected.</p>
            <p eId="para_727">The fires have destroyed valuable forestry and impacted on habitats, flora and fauna and the economic cost of fires that spread across the north west and midlands is substantial.  It is estimated that up to 4,000 acres of timber on privately and State-owned woodland has been destroyed.</p>
            <p eId="para_728">The response also has been resource intensive.  Significant costs have been incurred at a time when resources are stretched.  It poses risks to personnel attending such incidents and I want to put on record my appreciation of the staff of the fire service and other services who on a daily basis put themselves in the line of fire as front-line service providers for whatever incident arises.  Worryingly, it diverts resources of the fire and emergency services away from responding to other incidents.  A fire appliance tackling a gorse fire may not be available to attend other life threatening incidents and there is a real possibility of tragic outcomes.</p>
            <p eId="para_729">Disturbingly, there is suspicion that many of the fires were started deliberately and maliciously.  Burning of vegetation by landowners is illegal between 1 March and 31 August of each year under the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000.  I echo the comments the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee.  I agree that it is completely unacceptable for a person to act so thoughtlessly as to set fire to vegetation and walk away from the consequences of that action, when those consequences could destroy the lives and livelihoods of their neighbours.  All rural dwellers, farmers, forest owners, landowners, especially those who own, rent, lease or manage commonage, should unite in their response against the unacceptable behaviour of a small minority of careless and reckless people.</p>
            <p eId="para_730">The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government's main role is to ensure that fire authorities are equipped and geared to respond promptly and effectively to tackle the worst effects of land and forest fires.  The provision of a fire service in its functional area and the assessment of fire cover needs having regard to the nature of the fire hazards and the probable incidence and extent of fires in its area is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under section 10 of the Fire Services Act 1981.</p>
            <p eId="para_731">The suggestion to have an integrated response has merit.  It has occurred in this case, and I take on board the suggestions that have been made about putting it on a more formal setting.  In order to tackle the problem of illegal and uncontrolled burning, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food established last year the land and forest fires working group.  The group comprised representatives from the emergency services, forest industry and State bodies, and issued ten recommendations earlier this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_732">The response has been an integrated one.  Each local authority has undertaken a risk assessment based on the activities and the weather patterns over the past two winters and all of the various agencies are feeding into the final report.  Each of the county and city councils already has effective crises management arrangements in place.  Fire authorities have been using these procedures which enable the principal response agencies together with the Defence Forces, Civil Defence and other voluntary agencies to make and co-ordinate the appropriate response to the outbreak of fires.</p>
            <p eId="para_733">The chief fire officers of the affected counties have enlisted the help of other response services to assist them in containing the fires.  The Defence Forces, the Garda Síochána and Civil Defence have been directly involved and their assistance to them is invaluable.  The Air Corps used helicopters to drop fresh water to bring the fires under control.  Coillte has also used helicopters to protect State forestry.  Forty soldiers supported fire crews in Donegal.  Further troops have been on standby around the country to assist local authorities if required.  This assistance provided was crucial to the main priority of the fire services, which is to protect life and property.</p>
            <p eId="para_734">While the weather in recent days, where it has rained, has greatly assisted attempts to bring the fires under control, all members of the public are asked to remain vigilant, as the Deputies have pointed out, and follow the instructions of the fire and emergency services until the danger has passed.</p>
            <p eId="para_735">I trust that these observations will be helpful.  I am aware of the need to bring together in a more co-ordinated way all of the emergency services to deal with whatever emergency, whether dry or wet weather patterns or frost, arises in the future in order to ensure that we protect landowners, householders and the environment, which we all aspire to hold in the highest possible regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_739">The Programme for Government contains a commitment to establish a network of Technology Research Centres that will accelerate the exploitation of new technologies and will bridge the gap between research and technology commercialisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_740">The development of a network of Technology Research Centres is an important strand in the strategy to develop a collaborative relationship between industry and research, ensuring that the research community can adapt its work more closely to the needs of industry in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_741">An existing infrastructure of Centres for Science Engineering and Technology (the CSETs), Strategic Research Centres, and Competence Centres, currently in place, are creating vital synergies between industry and the research function within third level institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_742">The intention of the Programme for Government is to build upon this infrastructure, to expand in a planned way on the facilities already in place, to develop a response to unmet needs and establish centres that will increase the collaboration between enterprise and our third level sector.  In this way we will improve the innovative capability of the companies involved and maximise the exploitation and the commercialisation of the research being undertaken.</p>

            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation (Deputy Richard Bruton)</from>
            <p eId="para_746">The Finance (No 2) Act 2008 introduced a scheme of relief from corporation tax for the first 3 years of operation for companies incorporated on and from 14 October 2008 that commence to carry on a new trade in 2009.  The relief is granted by reducing the corporation tax on the profits of the new trade and on the gains from disposal of assets used for the purpose of the new trade to nil.  Full relief is available where the corporation tax otherwise payable by the company in respect of any of its first 3 years is €40,000 or less.  There is marginal relief where the corporation tax liability is between €40,000 and €60,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_747">The scheme has since been extended in Finance Acts 2010 and 2011 to new companies commencing a new trade in 2010 and 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_748">The Finance Act 2011 also modified the existing relief so that the value of the relief will be linked to the amount of employers' PRSI paid by a company in an accounting period, subject to a maximum of €5,000 per employee and an overall limit of €40,000.  Credit is also given for any employers' PRSI exempted under the Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive Scheme in respect of a company's employees in determining the amount of corporation tax relief available to the company.  If the amount of qualifying employers' PRSI paid by a company in an accounting period is lower than the corporation tax payable in respect of the trade, relief will be based on this lower amount.</p>
            <p eId="para_749">This Finance Act 2011 change targets the relief at companies generating employment and applies in respect of accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2011.  A company does not have to employ a specified number of people to get corporation tax relief under the scheme.  The corporation tax relief is limited to the employer PRSI paid by the company subject to an overall maximum of €5,000 per employee and total corporation tax relief in any one year of €40,000 (the overall limit which applied under the scheme as introduced).</p>
            <p eId="para_750">An extension of the start-up relief to non-corporate trading entities is one of a range of tax issues worthy for consideration.  The factors of relevance to the specific issue of extending the start-up exemption to non-corporate trading entities include the following:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_751">Lower costs and administrative burdens are generally associated with setting-up and trading via a non-incorporated structure.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_752">The legal requirements associated with companies and directorships may be relatively onerous for the owners of many micro-businesses.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_753">Many professional advisors are inclined to advise small/micro business clients, for whom limited liability is not a priority, to initially set-up as a sole-trader or partnership and retain the option to later transfer the business to a company structure.  The tax reasons underlying this professional advice include, inter alia, that the tax advantages of trading profits being taxed at 12.5% only apply to profits retained within the business.  This approach also minimises the costs of setting up such businesses and reduces the costs and administrative burdens associated with closing down unsuccessful businesses.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_754">Any extension of the scope of the scheme to non-corporate entities would result in an increase in the overall cost of the scheme.  Specifically, if the scheme was extended in the form of a full exemption from income tax and other taxes on income, the cost of the scheme would include tax relief on trading profits otherwise taxable at marginal personal tax rates.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_755">The availability of the scheme to corporate entities, in effect targets the relief towards profits earned by the business. Funds withdrawn from companies by owner-directors as salary payments fall outside the scope of the scheme and are in fact subject to income tax in full.  The extension of the scheme to non-corporate entities would not automatically impose any requirement on non-corporate entities to reinvest profits within the business, thereby increasing the cost of the scheme and extending the scope of the scheme to include profits not reinvested.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_756">The availability of the scheme to companies focuses the benefit of the relief more towards the productive sectors of the economy.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_757">The current restriction of the scheme to new companies facilitates monitoring and controlling compliance with the requirement that only genuine new businesses avail of the scheme.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_758">The option exists for all new businesses to be conducted from within a new company and thereby potentially qualify for the start-up company relief.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_759">The existence of the start-up company exemption may result in a behavioural change as certain businesses are incorporated that would otherwise have not been incorporated.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_760">There are other non-tax policy options, such as various grant-aid and other supports available to persons setting up a new business from Enterprise Ireland and the County Enterprise Boards.  The role of the CEBs is specifically to provide support for the micro-enterprise sector in the start-up and expansion phases and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.</p>

            <p eId="para_762">While I do not have direct policy responsibility for the sectors referred to by the Deputy, I am keen to ensure that all costs which impact on businesses, including energy, telecommunications, waste management and transport, are kept as low as possible in order to enhance the competitiveness of enterprises in Ireland.  Improved competitiveness will help businesses to retain existing jobs, create new ones, and contribute to economic recovery.</p>
            <p eId="para_763">The National Competitiveness Council monitors and analyses costs and other competitiveness issues in the Irish economy through its suite of reports, including its annual "Benchmarking Ireland's Performance" report and reports on the "Costs of Doing Business in Ireland".  The most recent reports, published in July 2010, show that Ireland has regained some of its cost competitiveness in the last two years — for example through reductions in electricity and gas prices for businesses, and the reduction or freezing of Local Authority rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_764">However, this Government is committed to doing more to reduce the cost base for business.  A cross-Departmental approach is required and, in this context, I will be working with my Government colleagues over the coming weeks and months to identify actions that can be taken to further cut costs to business and remove obstacles to employment creation.</p>

            <p eId="para_770">The Regional Aid Guidelines govern the areas in which Member States may grant regional aid, more commonly known as investment aid.  Investment aid is intended to promote the economic development of certain disadvantaged areas within the European Union in order to redress regional disparities.  The Guidelines specify rules for the selection of regions which are eligible for regional aid and define the maximum permitted levels of this aid.  Under Ireland's current Regional Aid Map, regions covering 50% of the population are entitled to grant Regional Aid.  The current Guidelines are due to expire on 31 December 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_771">To launch the work on the new Guidelines beyond 2013, the European Commission hosted a workshop for Member States in Brussels last March.  The purpose of the workshop was to gather information on the operation of the current Guidelines and the experiences of Member States and to give Member States the opportunity to express preliminary views on the issues that should be reviewed in the future framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_772">After consulting with stakeholders, my Department made submissions to the Commission both in advance and after the workshop. These submissions were preliminary responses to the Commission's requests for views and were made against a background where there are as yet no proposals from the Commission on a future Regional Aid framework.  As these responses would form part of the negotiations with the European Commission, I do not intend to publish them.</p>
            <p eId="para_773">The next steps are that the Commission is to undertake an Impact Assessment, which will involve questionnaires to Member States.  Further multilateral meetings with Member States are due to be arranged in the last quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012.  The Commission anticipates the final report of the Impact Assessment in the third quarter of 2012, and the adoption of new Guidelines by end of 2012.  The process of notification of the new Regional Aid Maps for the Member States will continue throughout 2013, after which the new Regional Aid Guidelines will enter into force.  My Department will continue to liaise with stakeholders throughout the process.</p>

            <p eId="para_775">IDA's strategy for the period 2010 to 2014, entitled <i>“Horizon 2020</i>”, which was published in March 2010, sets out the following targets for job creation and investment for the period 2010 to 2014:  </p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_776">105,000 new jobs (of which 62,000 will be direct employment)</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_777">640 new Greenfield or Expansion Investments</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_778">50% of new FDI projects to be located outside of Dublin and Cork</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_779">20% of Greenfield investments to come from emerging high-growth markets</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_780">€1.7 billion investment in RD&amp;I per annum by client companies</p>
            <p eId="para_781">Despite the turbulent global economy and increased competition for foreign direct investment, progress on achieving these targets has been good.  IDA's 2010 end of year results show that:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_782">Almost 11,000 new jobs created, in IDA supported companies</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_783">A total of 126 foreign direct investments won</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_784">47 companies investing in Ireland for the first time, up 20% on 2009</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_785">Investment in Research, Development and Innovation (RD&amp;I) over €500million</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_786">62% of investments from existing companies</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_787">37% of investments locating outside Greater Dublin and Cork with 45% of jobs locating outside Greater Dublin and Cork.</p>
            <p eId="para_788">Another key element of the "Horizon 2020" Strategy is the transformation of IDA's existing client base.  IDA has developed a suite of support mechanisms to assist companies along this transformation agenda.  This encourages future business in areas which are compatible with our skills base and which are sustainable within our economy in the longer term.</p>
            <p eId="para_789">IDA has also established a new High Growth Markets Team to achieve 20% of Greenfield investments into Ireland by 2014 originating from these markets.  A team has also been established to target new high growth companies which are the seeds of tomorrow's multinationals.</p>
            <p eId="para_790">While it is clear that we are operating in a very difficult economic environment, there are still investment opportunities in global markets to be won and to date in 2011, there have been 17 announcements by IDA supported companies, with the potential to create 2,250 jobs.  Over 50% of the announcements by IDA to date in 2011 will be based outside of Dublin and Cork.</p>
            <p eId="para_791">I and my Government colleagues will support IDA to bolster ongoing contacts between IDA and a wide variety of potential investors leading to a pipeline of new investment and the creation of high quality jobs.</p>

            <p eId="para_793">As Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation one of my main priorities is to ensure that the manner in which State support for enterprise activity, entrepreneurship stimulation and job creation is delivered, is properly targeted and is effective and coherent.  I want to ensure that it is cost effective and that the resources available to the State are used to maximise business activity and sustainability across all sectors in order to drive economic recovery.</p>
            <p eId="para_794">The County and City Enterprise Boards have been the principal deliverers of State support to the micro-enterprise sector since their establishment in 1993.  The role of the CEBs is to support micro-enterprises employing up to 10 people in the start-up and expansion phases and to stimulate and promote economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.  The CEBs deliver a series of Programmes to underpin this role and they can provide both financial and non-financial assistance to an eligible micro-enterprise.  This sector is a key component of the indigenous small business sector.  The micro-enterprise sector will be key to our economic recovery.  Parallel to the work of the CEBs is, of course, the work of Enterprise Ireland whose remit includes the support of start-ups that have the potential to employ more than 10 and to achieve €1m in exports.  These are start-ups that are typically highly innovative and are in a position to sell globally from their earliest stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_795">The Programme for Government recognises that there is a multiplicity of enterprise and job support functions being carried out by local, regional and national agencies.  The Programme also recognises the need to streamline such functions, to increase shared knowledge capability and resources while saving on administration costs.  However a critical focus in achieving any such streamlining, is to ensure that we do not compromise on service delivery to the end user.  While unnecessary overlap or duplication between agencies and organisations must be eliminated, as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, it is my priority to ensure that above all else there is a coherent and cohesive delivery of State support to the indigenous business sector based on clear enterprise policy principles laid down by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_796">In relation to the CEBs, I think that their current structure is, in any event, in need of review and reform to move away from their current set up of 35 separate, legal entities with the resultant administrative overhead costs and inflexible staff deployment that this entails.  However, any changes to the CEB structure must not compromise the State's engagement with and support for our important micro-enterprise sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_797">As the Deputy is aware, the restructuring of the CEBs has been an issue in the public domain since the publication of the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes (the "McCarthy Report") in July 2009.  Subsequent to the publication of the McCarthy Report, previous Ministers and Departmental officials have had a variety of consultations and discussions with the main stakeholders involved, including CEB senior staff and Boards, Enterprise Ireland and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_798">I am now actively considering the future structure of the CEBs and, in seeking to finalise any decision on their future, I can assure the Deputy that all points of view and, in particular, the needs of the end-user of the services of the CEBs will be fully taken into account.</p>

            <p eId="para_803">As I outlined in a recent reply to a question put down by the Deputy (Question No. 51 of 29 March 2011, Ref. No. 5870/11), responsibility for public procurement policy is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  However, my Department has a particular interest in this area because of the potential for SMEs to win a share of the public procurement market which is valued in the region of €14 billion per annum in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_804">I explained that my Department had engaged with the National Procurement Service (NPS) — a Business Unit of the Office of Public Works — in relation to the availability of data on the number of contracts which are being competed for, and won by, SMEs.  This data is not currently captured on the NPS's public tendering website, but the NPS agreed to work with my Department to capture this type of data in future as part of a forthcoming upgrade to the portal.</p>
            <p eId="para_805">I understand that the NPS is currently evaluating tenders received for the replacement of the portal and that the upgraded website is expected to be operational in the third quarter of this year.

            <p eId="para_806">As part of its engagement with my Department, the NPS also agreed to carry out surveys in the coming months to further help to ascertain the success rate of SMEs which apply for public contracts, and to identify some of the issues which may be a barrier to them winning such contracts.</p>
            <p eId="para_807">My Department along with Enterprise Ireland will continue to work with the NPS over the coming months to provide an input to these surveys and to agree a suitable timeframe for their completion.

            <p eId="para_809">The Programme for Research in Third-Level Institutions (PRTLI) was launched in 1998 and comprehends funding for third level research infrastructure, national shared facilities, and structured PhD programmes.  The Programme is designed to facilitate Irish institutions to produce world-class research in humanities, science, technology and the social sciences, including business and law.</p>
            <p eId="para_810">There are very significant synergies between PRTLI and the Science Foundation Ireland human capital development activities which are, in turn, closely connected to industry and the work of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_811">There have been five cycles of awards under the PRTLI to date, which are summarised in the following table, and the funding includes both Exchequer and private contributions.</p>

            <p eId="para_844">Under Cycle 4 funding approved for buildings and equipment was €131.3m with €22.48m of this funding from private sources.

            <p eId="para_848">Funding approved for buildings and equipment was €259.4m.  Construction work under the Cycle 5 investment will provide more than 64,000 square metres of research space in new and refurbished buildings on our higher education campuses.</p>

            <p eId="para_857">The Capital Allocation for the 35 CEBs under the 2010 Estimates Process was €14.994 million for the provision of grants and soft supports to micro-enterprises in 2010.  In 2011 this provision has been maintained, with an allocation of €15 million and in view of the difficulties surrounding the public finances, this continued level of support to the micro-enterprise sector is very significant.  I fully recognise that the CEBs are under pressure to meet the increased level of demand for their supports, and while it is vital that CEBs continue to promote and support enterprise development, due to the finite nature of public finances, it is not always possible for a CEB to provide financial assistance to every eligible project that presents itself.  This is an operating reality with which all CEBs are already familiar. I am confident that CEBs will prioritise and manage available funding in a targeted and effective manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_858">Exchequer funding is allocated to individual CEBs by the Central Coordination Unit (CCU), based within Enterprise Ireland.  In determining these initial allocations a systematic approach is adopted by the CCU to ensure the maximum degree of objectivity and equity of treatment.  This approach involves the provision of funding on the basis of a standard allocation to each CEB as well as an extra allocation that is determined mainly by population but which also takes account of issues such as local unemployment trends, capacity to spend, existing commitments and regional spread.</p>
            <p eId="para_859">Under the initial allocations for the year Meath CEB  has been allocated an Exchequer Capital allocation of €460,907 for 2011 for direct support of micro-enterprise clients through grants and mentoring/training support programmes.  When compared with the initial allocation to Meath CEB for 2010 of €404,797, this represents an increase of €56,110.</p>
            <p eId="para_860">It is a matter in the first instance for individual CEBs to determine how they will use allocated funds, as well as funds available to them from repayable grants, in the most effective manner possible (subject to meeting the appropriate eligibility criteria and a number of limits and thresholds that are in place).  Some Boards may choose to commit all of their available funding as projects present themselves, even if this means that their funding is exhausted relatively early in the year, while others may choose to reserve some funding until later in the year so that they are in a position to support other high quality projects that emerge at that time.  This would explain why some Boards, including Meath, may have utilised their grant funding earlier in the year than other Boards.</p>
            <p eId="para_861">As part of the CCU's on-going management of available funding during the year, the Unit will continue to monitor CEB spending.  It has sometimes been the case that a number of Boards are not in a position to spend all of their annual allocations as not every project which is approved for funding may draw down that funding and CEBs factor this into their financial planning for the year. Should such surplus funding become available, this will be reallocated by the CCU to any Boards that are in a position to spend additional funds, subject to thorough assessment of the rationale and the justification for the level of funding being requested.  It will be in the context of this process that any additional funding requests from individual Boards will be considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_863">In a globalised economy, workers are increasingly mobile and migration, both inward and outward, has always been a feature of Ireland's labour force.  However, there is clearly a difference between voluntary migration where people choose to work abroad for various reasons, and the current situation where many people feel that they have to look elsewhere for work until such time as there are jobs available in the Irish economy and their skills are once more in demand.  This Government is committed to ensuring that emigration becomes an option as opposed to a necessity and to this end the Programme for Government has job creation at its core.</p>
            <p eId="para_864">The role of my Department is to ensure that we have the right policies in place that will support and grow our enterprise base in order to facilitate both job creation and job retention.  It is only by creating the right environment for businesses to expand that we will see new jobs coming on stream.  We must champion the cause of companies that can create good jobs in sustainable activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_865">To this end, this Government has committed to the creation of a Jobs Initiative, the details of which will be announced next Tuesday.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the detail of the Jobs Initiative in advance of its presentation to the House.  However, I anticipate that it will address a number of the commitments made in the Programme for Government to stimulate the economy and generate the conditions for businesses to sustain existing jobs and create new ones.</p>
            <p eId="para_866">The State Development agencies, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, and the County and City Enterprise Boards are continuing to drive and promote enterprise development, and consequently employment creation in our economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_867">In order to minimise the drift into long-term unemployment, four cohorts of the unemployed have been prioritised for support and assistance.  The four cohorts are; the low skilled; those under 35 years of age; those on the Live Register for longer than one year and those suffering from structural unemployment in the manufacturing, construction and retail sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_868">The training, work experience and education measures that are being implemented in 2011 are designed to help those who are unemployed gain valuable work experience, maintain close linkages with the labour market, improve their skills and education levels and ultimately to improve their career prospects.  My colleagues the Minister's for Education and Skills and Social Protection, Ruairi Quinn T.D. and Joan Burton T.D share dual responsibility for skills and activation measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_869">The Government is committed to ensuring that an appropriate mix of training, work experience and educational responses are in place to support the unemployed and to enhance their employability.</p>

            <p eId="para_871">International benchmarking statistics reveal that Ireland imposes a relatively low burden of regulation on business.  The Forfás Annual Competitiveness Report 2010 states that Ireland's regulatory environment is one of the least restrictive in the OECD in relation to product market regulation, the time taken to comply with tax payments is one of the lowest in the OECD across all categories and Ireland's employment framework is less rigid than the OECD average.</p>
            <p eId="para_872">The work to reduce administrative burdens on business in Ireland is being progressed on two fronts.  The High Level Group on Business Regulation works to fast-track simplifications to specific red tape issues identified by business; and an Inter-Departmental Group of officials from all Departments, having regulation affecting business, coordinates the measurement and reduction of administrative burdens in a systematic manner, based on the internationally recognized Standard Cost Model.</p>
            <p eId="para_873">To date the High Level Group has processed thirty specific red tape issues brought to its attention by business and continues to drive progress on a further thirty-eight items.  The Group continues to work with business interests to identify new opportunities for simplification. In addition, my Department is in the process of measuring other burden reductions achieved across Government.  The results of this measurement exercise are expected to be available in the second half of 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_874">As far as the 25% target is concerned, my Department has already reduced measured burdens by 22% (or 90% of the target to be achieved), an annual saving of almost €187 million for business.  (Details below.)  I expect that I will be in a position to announce the initiatives that will make up the remaining 3% before the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_875">I intend to initiate a project shortly to measure the burdens across all remaining Departments.  This is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2012.  Each relevant Department will then prepare Simplification Plans detailing how they will meet the 25% target within their areas of responsibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_876">At the same time, the Risk Based Enforcement Group, set up by my Department in 2008, continues to seek concrete ways for agencies to cooperate, to make their operations more efficient and effective, and reduce administrative burdens on business.  As part of this process, the Group is examining the potential of data sharing legislation to facilitate better risk analysis and enforcement.</p>
            <p eId="para_877">Administrative Burden Reduction in DETI</p>
            <p eId="para_878">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation has measured administrative burdens arising for business in three key areas of regulation: Company Law, Employment Law and Health &amp; Safety Law.  It was found that the burdens across these three areas amounted to some €831 million per annum for business.  The Government's 25% target to reduce these burdens dictates that no less than €208 million must be cut from these measured costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_879">As of May 2011, 90% of this target has already been reached.  This amounts to almost €187 million of business savings each year.</p>
            <p eId="para_880">Some of these reductions are as yet potential savings.  Making them real savings requires businesses to adopt these newer, more simplified approaches, that have been made available.  All firms are encouraged to ensure that they gain the full benefit of this work by reading the guidelines provided, and adopting the low cost options.  A list of these simplifications, and details of how businesses can benefit from them, are included below:</p>

That position will be based on proposals that I will bring to the Government, in conjunction with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I am concerned by initial indications from impact studies carried out by the EU Commission of the damaging impact on the agricultural sector.  The proposals that I will bring to the Government will be informed by the results of the full impact studies that we expect to receive from the EU Commission in the next few weeks, as well as by the results of our own studies carried out by Forfás and Teagasc.  I expect the EU Commission to await the full examination of the detailed impact studies before any offers are made.  The publication of any offers connected to these negotiations is a matter for the EU Commission.</p>

            <p eId="para_950">The setting of commercial rates is a matter for local authorities which come under the remit of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes, in accordance with the details entered into the valuation lists prepared by the independent commissioner of valuation.  The levying and collection of commercial rates are matters for each individual local authority.  The Annual Rate on Valuation is applied to the valuation of each property to obtain the amount payable in rates.  The rate is decided by the elected members of each local authority in their annual budgets, and its determination is a reserved function of the local authority.  The issue of adjusting the basis on which rates are charged, as suggested by the Deputy, would be a policy matter for consideration by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, in consultation with the local authorities and the Minister for Finance.  I have had detailed discussions with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government on how we can work together to maximise opportunity for local business development and to keep all costs which impact on business as low as possible.  This work will continue and will include the exploration of options for further reducing local authority charges to business, which the Minister is keen to develop.  Preliminary results from a review carried out by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on commercial rates for 2011 show that 32 of 88 local authorities have decreased their annual rate on valuation this year, while 53 kept the same rate as 2010.  This follows a similar pattern to last year, when 31 local authorities reduced their rate and 55 maintained the same rate as 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_952">My Department is proactive in ensuring that good performance on transposition of Directives is consistently maintained.  Transposition is monitored through a customised Intranet database which is used as a central management and information tool to track the implementation of Directives on an ongoing basis.  The Interdepartmental Co-ordinating Committee on EU Affairs, which is chaired by the Minister for European Affairs, also monitors Directives through its monthly meetings and the Department of the Taoiseach's EU Returns database.  My Department is constantly working to maintain our national reputation and position by maintaining a high level of commitment to the ongoing management and implementation of EU Directives to ensure the transposition deadlines are met.  Nine Directives require to be transposed by my Department up to 2012.  One of these — Directive 2009/125/EC on ecodesign requirements for energy-related products — is currently overdue.  However, I expect to sign a statutory instrument transposing this Directive in the coming days.  A full list of Directives to be transposed up to 2012 is provided on my Department's website, <i>www.deti.ie</i>.  In addition, my Department is dealing with the transposition of four codified Directives.  It should be noted that codification brings together previous legislation in a single new act.  There are no timelines required for the transposition of codified Directives.  While my Department is heavily engaged in supporting North-South enterprise development, in particular through the work of the North South Ministerial Council, transposition of EU Directives in Northern Ireland is a matter for the UK Government.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, there is continuing and extensive co-operation with Departments in Northern Ireland, including through the mechanism of the North-South Ministerial Council, on a wide range of issues which are of mutual concern and benefit.  EU related matters, including EU Directives and Regulations and their application, are discussed periodically.</p>

            <p eId="para_954">I understand this dispute resulted from a decision by the employer to cut the pay and working hours of the workers.  The issues in dispute were referred to the Labour Relations Commission by the workers.  Separate exploratory talks involving the conciliation service of the Labour Relations Commission and the employer and workers' representatives took place in June 2010, where all possibilities were explored with both parties in an effort to reach a mutually acceptable agreement to settle the dispute.  Unfortunately, the conciliation service determined that it was not in a position to assist the parties achieve a settlement of the issues in dispute.  I understand that the workers have referred claims regarding alleged breaches of their employment rights to the Rights Commissioner Service and to the Employment Appeals Tribunal and that these claims are being processed by those bodies.</p>

            <p eId="para_956">The Government is committed to ensuring the appropriate infrastructure is in place to facilitate an environment in which enterprise can flourish and sustainable jobs can be created.  Our programme for Government outlines the measures that will be explored to maximise enterprise development.  The establishment of business incubation centres on higher education campuses across Ireland is supported by capital investment from my Department's Vote, provided through Enterprise Ireland.  Such facilities are internationally recognised as an important element of public assistance for technology-intensive start-ups.  They differ from other types of space in the supportive environment in that they offer client companies services such as business mentoring from a dedicated centre manager and a local network of experts, the opportunity to leverage academic research and development expertise, access to specialised facilities that they could not themselves typically afford, student placements and recruitment and fostered networking with other start-ups in the centres and more widely.</p>
            <p eId="para_957">Enterprise Ireland has invested over €50 million in these facilities, which operate in nearly every Institute of Technology and university in the country.  They typically comprise a number of incubation units, some hot-desking space for prospective entrepreneurs as well as ancillary space, such as meeting rooms and networking areas.  There are currently 276 companies in the 21 facilities operational across Ireland, employing over 1,100 people and operating in a range of areas, including software, environmental technologies and digital media.  Enterprise Ireland has also rolled out four schemes to support communities to develop locally owned Community Enterprise Centres, (CECs) which have enabled entrepreneurs to establish, provide employment and to grow their businesses in their own locality, by providing a physical and human support network for emerging entrepreneurs and micro-industry.  Since the launch of this initiative, €61.4 million has been approved for the development of CECs across the country and this capital investment has facilitated the development of 134 centres, of which 108 have been completed with the balance either under construction or just recently approved.  Of the completed centres, the most recent data — from 2009 — shows that they house 901 companies providing employment for 4,870 people.  A further 760 companies employing approximately 2,900 people have graduated from the CECs since the first scheme in 1989 due to company expansion.  Some 56 of these companies have since become Enterprise Ireland clients and 79 were transferred to the County Enterprise Boards.</p>
            <p eId="para_958">Some €2.2 million of funding under the CEC initiative was also channelled towards supporting the work of the Digital Hub Development Agency, the aims of which are to promote and facilitate the development of the digital hub as a location for digital enterprises and related activities.  Additionally, support is provided through Enterprise Ireland for the part funding of Business Innovation Centres, which are regionally based support organisations for pre-start-up and start-up enterprises and innovative existing companies.  There are four Business Innovation Centres, located in Dublin, Galway, Cork and Waterford, all providing incubation space to assist fledgling businesses start, establish and then to move on, so that vacated space can be used for other new start-up businesses.  A key feature of space managed by the Business Innovation Centres is that the start-up company not only gets space, but often also gets free business advice and access to facilities such as meeting rooms with audio visual equipment and to shared services such as a receptionist/telephonist, shared photocopiers and printers.  In line with the Government focus on job creation, I will ensure there is a continual focus on the provision of adequate incubation space.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Eamon Gilmore)</from>
            <p eId="para_962">I am extremely concerned about the use of excessive force in Syria, including killings and detentions of unarmed protestors.  I call on the Syrian Government to immediately stop all violent action against its own people and to genuinely permit its citizens to assemble and protest peacefully.  Detained peaceful protestors and activists must be released without delay.  The Syrian Government must respond to the legitimate demands which have been made for meaningful political reforms and the launching of a process of genuinely inclusive national dialogue.  The EU has also clearly called for an end to violence against unarmed protestors in Syria and the immediate start of genuine dialogue.  I fully support the strong statements of EU High Representative Ashton on 29 and 23 April and the conclusions agreed by EU Foreign Affairs Ministers at their 12 April Council in Luxembourg in this regard.  In addition to these political statements, Ireland is working with its partners in the EU and the UN to persuade Syria to desist from its present violent and ultimately ruinous course of action.  The EU has taken, or will shortly take, a number of steps to increase the pressure on the Syrian Government.  It will implement an embargo on arms and equipment used for internal repression.  The EU will urgently consider further appropriate and targeted measures with the aim of achieving an immediate change of policy by the Syrian leadership.  The EU has decided not to take further steps with regard to taking forward its association agreement with Syria.  The EU will also review all aspects of its co-operation with the Syrian authorities including under the European Neighbourhood Policy Instrument.</p>
            <p eId="para_963">The UN has also been active and fully seized of this issue.  Ireland fully supports the unequivocal statements on Syria delivered by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on 22 April and the High Commissioner for Human Rights on 25 April.  On 28 April, the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva held a special session to discuss the situation in Syria at which the Irish Ambassador to the UN in Geneva delivered a statement condemning the recent violence.  The Human Rights Council agreed a strong resolution which condemned the violence against peaceful protestors, called for the immediate release of arbitrarily detained persons and stressed the need for a credible investigation by the Syrian authorities.  It also asked the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to urgently dispatch a mission to Syria to investigate recent violations of human rights law.  Ireland, together with its partners in the EU and the UN, will continue to closely follow events in Syria and to take appropriate action to ensure that the Syrian authorities take the steps that the international community demand.  I believe it is vitally important that the international community speaks out against the unacceptable violence against protestors in Syria with the same insistence as it does in relation to instances of violence and repression occurring elsewhere in the region.  Ireland will continue to support all those who aspire to democracy and human rights in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.</p>

The Joint Administrators announced last week the acquisition by Liberty Mutual Direct Insurance Company Limited (LMDI), which is a joint venture between Liberty Mutual and Anglo Irish Bank, of certain assets and liabilities of Quinn Insurance Limited.  A 12-14 week transition process will commence immediately during which time LMDI will obtain all the necessary regulatory consents from parties including the Central Bank of Ireland.  It should be noted that there is no State commitment which is specific to the LMDI preferred bid for the business of Quinn Insurance Limited in direct cash terms, guarantees or underwriting.  The Insurance Compensation Fund is available to cover the deficit which is expected to arise in the run-off of the remaining parts of Quinn Insurance Limited not purchased by LMDI.  In this regard, in my role as Minister for Finance, I may on the recommendation of the Central Bank advance to the compensation fund under Section 5 of the 1964 Insurance Act such sums as I think appropriate to enable payments out of the fund to be made expeditiously.  Any sums of this nature are recoupable over time through the placement by the Central Bank of a levy on the insurance industry.  I will consider such a request if it should arise in the same way that I would consider any request of this type no matter who the preferred bidder was.</p>

            <p eId="para_968">As Minister for Finance I have had no direct dealings with Liberty in relation to this transaction including the issue of the future of all existing job-holders.  However, I have been informed by the Joint Administrators that aside from the redundancies in Manchester all the 1570 in the QIL have been protected for at least two years.  Many of these jobs are in the border areas both north and south and their protection is important for the local economies in these communities.  The Joint Administrators have also advised that existing locations will be maintained aside from Navan.  I understand that the Navan jobs will be redeployed to Cavan and Blanchardstown.</p>
            <p eId="para_969">What is also reassuring is that the business has being purchased by a company which has an impressive track record in the insurance industry and which is also very conscious of the importance of ensuring competition in the Irish insurance market and appreciates its central role in providing employment and economic development in the border region and further afield.</p>

            <p eId="para_971">As there is no change in the position I set out in my response to Deputy Ó Caoláin (Question No. 41) on Tuesday last, 3 May 2011, the position remains the same.  The Joint Administrators announced last week the acquisition by Liberty Mutual Direct Insurance Company Ltd (LMDI), a joint venture between Liberty Mutual (LM) and Anglo Irish Bank, of certain assets and liabilities of Quinn Insurance Limited (in administration) (QIL).  They see this as the best option for the policy holders of QIL.  A twelve to fourteen week transition process will now commence, during which time LMDI will obtain all the necessary regulatory consents from parties, including the Central Bank.</p>
            <p eId="para_972">At the outset, it should be noted that, under the sales process of QIL neither I as Minister for Finance, nor the Government, had any role in assessing the Quinn Group proposals recently presented for the future of QIL, as this was a matter solely for the Joint Administrators, who were appointed by the High Court.  The Deputy will be aware that this sales process was conducted by Macquarie Bank on behalf of the administrators.</p>
            <p eId="para_973">The Joint Administrators have indicated to my Department that the Quinn proposal was only received recently, several months after the closing date for submission of interest.  They say that the proposal was highly conditional in nature as it depended amongst other things on the State intervening to facilitate the transfer of €2.8bn of debt from Anglo to one of the viable banks and to require that bank to provide a further €500m loan to the Quinn Group, as well as agreement with the bondholders.  As such they saw no likelihood for such a proposal being facilitated in the current economic climate, as the taking on of such loans by other banks was likely to compound their already difficult position and in addition would also be likely to contravene European State Aid rules.  They were also of the view that reaching agreement with the bondholders in relation to the releasing of the guarantees over QIL assets was going to be extremely difficult if not close to impossible.</p>
            <p eId="para_974">The decision in relation to the appointment of the Share Receiver by Anglo is very much a commercial one and I in my role as Minister for Finance had no input into this matter.  While I understand the concern being raised on whether this decision will have a negative impact on the trading of the Quinn manufacturing group following the removal of the Quinn family members and the senior managers from their employment, I am informed that other scenarios might well have prompted court action to put the Group into receivership with the potential for immediate significant job losses.  By comparison the appointment of a Share Receiver gives the Group grounds for considerable hope of a viable future.  This viable future however depends to a large degree on the willingness by everybody, particularly those engaged in several recent negative events, to engage wholeheartedly with the new ownership arrangements, because if this does not materialise then over time this is likely to negatively impact on the trading performance of the Group.</p>
            <p eId="para_975">Overall, I share the view that the recent steps taken to sell the QIL business to LMDI and to appoint a share receiver to the wider group as being positive and will do a lot to protect jobs in the border region — the protection of which is important for the state and for the local economies in these communities.  The proposal put forward by the Quinn Group was not in the economic or financial interests of the state.</p>

            <p eId="para_977">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the collection of tobacco products tax and for tackling the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco products that a survey commissioned by Revenue and the Office of Tobacco Control in 2009 estimated that 20% of cigarettes consumed in the State had not been taxed in this jurisdiction.  The 20% figure was further broken down as 14% illicit product and 6% legally imported by passengers arriving into the State from other jurisdictions.  Revenue and the Office of Tobacco Control commissioned a similar survey in the last quarter of 2010 and the preliminary results of this latest survey show a consistency with the 2009 figures i.e. 20% of all cigarettes consumed in the State were not taxed in the State with 14% again classified as illegal product and 6% classified as legal "non-Irish duty paid" product.  Based on an estimate of 14%, the loss of excise duty to the exchequer from illicit cigarette consumption during 2010 would be in the region of €200m.</p>
            <p eId="para_978">While these findings indicate that the level of consumption of illicit product is being contained, Revenue is determined to confront the illegal trade in tobacco products and to optimise levels of seizures of illicit tobacco product.  Revenue's strategy for tackling this illicit trade is multi-faceted.  It includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, an ongoing review of operational policies, development of analytics and deployment of detection technologies, optimum deployment of resources at point of importation and to intercept internally the contraband product and prosecute those involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_979">Revenue enforcement officers are deployed at all key ports and airports.  Personnel deployed at these locations are regularly supported by additional staff from other areas when specific operations are taking place.  Interception at the point of importation is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages.</p>
            <p eId="para_980">Revenue enforcement officers also target this illicit trade at post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations as well as random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.  Revenue and An Garda Síochána also carry out regular multi-agency operations, particularly in relation to large maritime importations and conducting checks at inland markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_981">The Revenue Commissioners have established a high level internal group, chaired at Commissioner level, to examine the risks related to tobacco products tax and to oversee and optimise the detection of counterfeit and contraband tobacco products.  This group has promoted a number of initiatives aimed at counteracting the illicit trade in tobacco.  These include improved profiling of passengers and freight to identify tobacco smugglers, national blitz-style operations and the establishment of a confidential tobacco hotline through which members of the public and the retail trade may report illicit trade.</p>
            <p eId="para_982">In July of last year Revenue launched a nationwide tobacco operation, which concentrated additional Revenue resources at ports, airports and at various retail points for the purpose of identifying illicit tobacco products.  This resulted in 561 seizures totalling 13.7 million cigarettes and 195 kgs of tobacco in the course of the two-week period of the operation.  Two subsequent 3-day operations during 2010 resulted in the seizure of over 1.76 million cigarettes and 175 kgs of tobacco.  In two similar operations carried out in 2011, a total of 580 seizures were made, comprising 7.4 million cigarettes and 167 kgs of tobacco.</p>
            <p eId="para_983">In terms of detection equipment, a second mobile X-ray container scanner, to augment the one first deployed in 2006, was commissioned by Revenue in January 2010 and is now fully operational. Smaller baggage/parcel scanners are deployed at all major ports, airports and postal depots.  In addition to the X-ray equipment, Revenue also uses a tobacco detection dog.</p>
            <p eId="para_984">This strategy has resulted in the seizure of a total of 178.3 million cigarettes with a retail value of approximately €75.3 million and 3,369 kgs of tobacco with a retail value of approximately €1.2 million during the period January to December 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_985">In addition, during the period January to April 2011, a total of 35 million cigarettes and 938 kgs of tobacco were seized by Revenue.</p>

            <p eId="para_994">I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 46 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_995">FÁS is responsible for the administration of the apprenticeship system nationally with funding provided by this Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_996">In the context of the economic downturn, FÁS has, in consultation with the relevant stakeholders, put in place a number of measures in recent years to enable registered redundant apprentices to progress in their apprenticeships.</p>
            <p eId="para_997">The Redundant Apprentice Placement Scheme 2011 was introduced this year to provide assistance to eligible redundant apprentices to complete the on-the-job training phases 3, 5 and 7 of their apprenticeship.</p>
            <p eId="para_998">The scheme was developed by FÁS based on discussions with representatives of trade unions and employers represented on the National Apprenticeship Advisory Committee.  FÁS also held discussions with representatives of local authorities, the OPW, ESB Networks and other organisations in the development and implementation of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_999">Employers in the private sector and, for the first time, the public sector, may participate in the scheme provided they meet the eligibility criteria.  The Redundant Apprentice Placement Scheme provides a weekly training allowance to eligible redundant workers of €260 at Phase 3, €350 at Phase 5 and €400 at Phase 7.</p>
            <p eId="para_1000">The scheme has a budget allocation of €7.3m in 2011.  As at 22 April 2011, 627 redundant apprentices were participating in the scheme and 35 redundant apprentices had completed their off-the-job training Phase.</p>
            <p eId="para_1001">Other initiatives taken by FÁS to assist redundant apprentices to progress in their apprenticeships include ‘Changes in Progression Rules' whereby redundant apprentices unable to complete their relevant on-the-job training phases are now permitted to progress to the next Off-the-Job training phase.</p>
            <p eId="para_1002">Under the ‘Phase 7 Equivalent Assessments Scheme', redundant construction trade apprentices unable to complete on-the-job Phase 7 Assessments at an employer may undertake Phase 7 Equivalent Assessments at a FÁS Training Centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_1003">The ‘Recognition of Prior Learning Scheme' allows redundant apprentices who have successfully completed all apprenticeship training Phases 1 to 7, but who have not completed the statutory four years in employment as an apprentice, to validate their competence by submitting a portfolio of evidence of trade related work experience gained at home and/or abroad and/or trade related training and education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1004">Under the ‘Fee Waiver Scheme', FÁS day and/or evening courses fees are waived for redundant apprentices.</p>
            <p eId="para_1005">Under the EU ‘Leonardo da Vinci Lifelong Learning Programme', 12 redundant apprentices commenced on-the-job training with employers in Germany in February 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1006">A number of new programmes for redundant apprentices and craftspersons are currently being developed or implemented by FÁS in conjunction with the Higher Education Authority and Institutes of Technology.  These programmes include a post-Phase 6 Certificate in Craft Transferable Skills, a special course in Advanced Skills for Redundant Plastering Craftspersons, a Certificate in Entrepreneurship for Redundant Craftspersons and short duration courses to prepare apprentices to repeat their outstanding assessments.</p>

            <p eId="para_1011">My Government believes that Ireland's economic recovery must be export led, and as such, is committed to taking the actions necessary to support that export growth to the maximum possible. We are also committed to promoting the long-term development of new markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1012">The Programme for Government has outlined the Government's commitment towards the progressive implementation of the recommendations in <i>Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy, </i>which was launched in September last.  We believe that the implementation of this Strategy will result in the sustained, concentrated and coordinated efforts of all the key Government Departments and agencies, including our embassies and consulates abroad, in support for Irish companies in overseas markets.  This is the first time that all of the relevant agencies and Departments involved in promoting overseas trade, tourism and investment have together come up with an integrated approach to achieving a set of agreed priorities and targets for both existing and new high growth potential markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1013">The targets agreed by these agencies — Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Bord Bia, Tourism Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland — are to be implemented through a suite of actions driven by a recently established Foreign Trade Council.  These actions are aimed at: strengthening Ireland's international image and brand; strengthening in-country presence and support; developing and internationalising our enterprise base; developing Ireland as a hub for global high-technology enterprises and clusters; aligning visa policy with priorities in the strategy; support for SMEs; continuing to develop international trade agreements; joint actions and partnerships with other countries; effective engagement with the business community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1014">As soon as the transfer of trade functions to the new Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as announced by the Taoiseach, has been effected, the nature, structure, future role and timelines of the proposed Export Trade Council will be considered as a matter of urgency.  The Government is conscious of the need to avoid establishing new groups and bodies unless absolutely necessary, and will therefore consider whether any amendments to the membership and terms of reference are needed to re-align the existing Foreign Trade Council with the objectives of this Government.</p>

I have also led two trade and economic missions — the first to Germany and most recently to India &amp; Saudi Arabia — where I had the opportunity to see and hear at first hand the importance of these key markets to trade and investments.  I met with many Irish companies operating in these markets, as well as with potential new investors in this economy and they too had interesting ideas and suggestions that could enhance our exports and investment performance.

            <p eId="para_1033">The EU Competitiveness Council recently endorsed a new European integrated industrial policy for the globalisation era which puts competitiveness and sustainability at centre stage.  This policy forms part of the seven Flagships launched under the European Union's new strategy for Jobs and Growth: Europe 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_1034">I fully support the core elements of the Europe 2020 strategy and its objectives to stimulate growth based on knowledge and innovation and a more sustainable and greener economy with high employment and social inclusion.  These objectives are also broadly consistent with the Government's own strategies as set out in the Programme for Government and with the National Recovery Plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1035">The industrial policy Flagship sets out a strategy that aims to boost growth and jobs by maintaining and supporting a strong, diversified and competitive industrial base in Europe.  The new approach also means looking at the whole value chain, from infrastructure and raw materials to after-sales service.  With the globalisation of markets and the changing nature of both manufacturing and services value chains, continued economic progress and growth will be driven by companies continually innovating to successfully add greater value at every point in their value chain.  Promoting the creation and growth of small and medium-sized enterprises is at the core of the EU industrial policy.  Moreover, the transition to a sustainable economy is recognised as an opportunity to be seized as a means of strengthening competitiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_1036">For the EU to be able to compete globally, it must establish the best framework conditions for business.  It must ensure that its firms can innovate, restructure and transform themselves quickly.  I believe that it is important, with the support of stronger EU-level co-ordination and supports, to facilitate timely and appropriate industrial restructuring and upgrading thus ensuring the renewal of EU industrial sectors and the necessary upgrading of worker skills and opportunities.  Supports such as the two Structural Funds, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) as well as the Cohesion Fund have contributed to regional competitiveness and employment objectives.  Cohesion Policy for 2007-2013 is explicitly linked to goals in Ireland's National Reform Programme under Europe 2020.  To this end our current forecast is that 90% of expenditure over the period will be on actions that are earmarked to support competitiveness and sustainable development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1037">In addition to the EU Structural Funds, Ireland receives significant European funding from the European Agriculture Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), the European Fisheries Fund (EFF), the Seventh Framework R&amp;D Programme (FP7).  The Government has also secured funding from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for a package of measures to retrain, upskill and offer further entrepreneurial and educational opportunities to workers affected by the closures of Dell, Waterford Crystal and SR Technics.  A number of relevant State agencies such as FÁS, Enterprise Ireland and the CEBs are involved in the distribution of these funds.</p>

            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation (Deputy Richard Bruton)</from>
            <p eId="para_1046">The use of technology and innovation has a crucial role to play in supporting economic recovery and in driving sustainable employment in the current environment.  A wide range of programmes are being delivered by the Enterprise Agencies — IDA Ireland  Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland, to promote innovation and cost efficiency and give Irish enterprise a competitive edge in the global market place.  It is my intention to provide adequate funds so as to ensure that these important supports continue to be available and to assist economic recovery.</p>
            <p eId="para_1047">The future for Irish companies and the Irish economy will be significantly determined by the ability to take advantage of global opportunities.  Because export led growth is identified as the spearhead of economic recovery, the nurturing of high-quality, innovative and internationally competitive Irish companies is clearly fundamental to Ireland's future prosperity.  The Irish economy will need to have sharp and adaptable business activity across a range of sectors so as to be in a position to compete effectively in the European and global markets and win export sales in order to create sustainable jobs in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1048">The competitive advantage created by the use of technology and innovation will be a key driver in achieving Irish economic recovery.  Companies that undertake Research and Development have shown a level of growth in trade and exports during the downturn that demonstrates the value of productive, high calibre research and innovation activity.  On an ongoing basis, Irish companies are winning and servicing global sales contracts across a range of modern growth industries and both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland work with Irish based companies to support this effort.  The supports include driving innovation and new product development, in addition to identifying, targeting and delivering on export sales throughout the world; addressing competitiveness issues and helping to raise finance.  All these supports are ultimately geared towards driving growth, sustainability, exports and job creation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1049">Numerous measures have been taken to help companies to achieve internationally high levels of innovation including:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1050">R&amp;D Funding through Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1051">Competence Centres established in strategically important sectoral areas like nanotechnology and bioenergy.  These €5m centres are designed to allow groups of multinational and indigenous firms to work together with academics to undertake cutting edge, industry led research.  Additional funding has been provided to increase the number of Competence Centres to 16 by 2015.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1052">Supports for new start-up companies with the potential to achieve significant exports — 80 new High Potential Start Ups were established in 2010.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1053">In 2010, over 49 pieces of commercially relevant technology were transferred from State Funded Research into industry.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1054">The Enterprise Ireland Technology Transfer System facilitated the creation of 31 spin-out companies in 2010.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1055">526 Innovation Vouchers were redeemed in 2010 worth over €2.5m, bringing the total number of Innovation Vouchers redeemed since the scheme opened to over 1,000.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1056">Collaboration between SFI funded researchers and industry has also increased significantly in recent years largely through the SFI Centres for Science Engineering Technology (CSETs), Strategic Research Clusters (SRCs) and the Principal Investigator (PI) teams.  At present SFI is supporting 29 top-class research centres (9 CSETs and 20 SRCs) and SFI funded researchers are collaborating with over 550 industry partners, both multinational and indigenous.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1057">Both in 2009 and  2010, IDA investments of over €500m were in research, development and innovation, and these investments are central to productivity and new business development in the multi-national sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1058">All these initiatives being delivered by the enterprise agencies are supporting enterprise to ensure that trade, exports and investment are positioned to retain sustainability and to ensure that emerging opportunities can be maximised as the global economy recovers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1059">The impact of Ireland's export orientated initiatives is best demonstrated by the growth in exports in the face of the current difficult economic climate.  Enterprise Ireland estimates that its client companies grew export sales in 2010, recovering in the region of 70% of the losses made in 2009.  These companies also reported an expansion in new export orders in every month in 2010 and this trend looks set to continue.  It is expected that new export sales from Enterprise Ireland clients in the order of €1 billion in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1060">There is a vibrant enterprise sector in Ireland that is world-class in its capacity and performance.  There is a dynamic export sector, which is underpinned by our rapidly evolving scientific, technological and innovation base.  Our competitiveness is based on merging these attributes with a commitment to sustained innovation that is unmatched in the markets in which we compete.  Our objective now is to build on the investment and achievement to date, and indeed the Programme for Government outlines a significant set of Innovation and Commercialisation strategies and goals which confirms that this area of productive investment is seen as one of the key drivers of Ireland's economic recovery.</p>

            <p eId="para_1062">There is widespread acceptance that small and medium enterprises are central to our economy.

         the fact that the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was ratified by Ireland in 1992, clearly states that Ireland’s children are entitled to a minimum standard of social protection, the reason parents are involved in the CITCAAT campaign seeking those same rights.

          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection" eId="spk_393">
            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
            <p eId="para_1069">The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child is a human rights treaty setting out the civil, political, economic, social, health and cultural rights of children.  Compliance is monitored by the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child.  Governments of countries that have ratified the Convention are required to report to, and appear before, this committee periodically to be examined on their progress with regards to the advancement of the implementation of the Convention and the status of child rights in their country.  Their reports and the committee's written views and concerns are widely available, including on the committee's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_1070">Ireland signed the Convention on the Rights of the Child on 30 September 1990, and ratified it, without reservation, on 21 September 1992.  The first National Report under the Convention was submitted in 1996.  Arising from the concluding observations of the Committee on the Rights of the Child issued in 1998, the then government established the office of Ombudsman for Children and drew up a national children's strategy.  The second National Report under the Convention was submitted in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1071">As part of the monitoring process interested NGOs are invited to submit their observations to the Committee on the Rights of the Child.  It is perfectly normal that individuals and groups such as CITCAAT will refer to the Convention in seeking to advance their position.  The purpose of human rights covenants and conventions is that they be used to measure the performance of States in promoting and defending human rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_1072">As regards this Department, the parents involved with the CITCAAT group are campaigning on behalf of autistic children and seeking support for autism sufferers.  While the Department of Social Protection has no responsibility for most of the issues raised, the domiciliary care allowance is of particular interest to this group.  In order to qualify for domiciliary care allowance a child must have a disability so severe that it requires the child needing care and attention and/or supervision substantially in excess of another child of the same age.  This care and attention must be given by another person, effectively full-time so that the child can deal with the activities of daily living.  The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_1073">In the period 1st January 2010 to 30th June 2010 a total of 220 applications with a medical condition of autism/autism spectrum disorder were fully processed by<b> </b>the Department’s Medical Assessors.  136 (62%) of these applications were deemed to satisfy the medical criteria and 84 were disallowed.  This compares with the current success rate on first application across all disabilities of approximately 40%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1074">I am confident that the supports for children provided by this Department fully meet our commitments under the Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>

         asked the

         her plans for the future of a national employment service; if she will review and enhance services available to the unemployed, which currently are provided by three separate services, namely, Department of Social Protection job facilitators, FÁS employment service officers and the contracted local employment service adult guidance service located in 25 areas; and if she will provide a one-stop shop service to optimise the use of resources and provide a more accessible service to persons who are unemployed and who seek employment and training opportunities.

          </question>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection" eId="spk_394">
            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
            <p eId="para_1076">The Programme for Government states that a new National Employment and Entitlements Service will be established under the management of the Department of Social Protection.  The objective is to integrate the employment support services currently provided directly by the Department of Social Protection with those currently provided by FÁS into a single service.  This service will also process payments in respect of employment related benefits and other benefits payable by the Department of Social Protection.  The integration of employment services and related benefit payment services within the Department of Social Protection will provide a ‘one stop shop' for people wishing to establish their benefit entitlements, seek employment and / or seek advice about their training options.  The focus will be very much on the individual, his / her rights to a payment, his / her access to an opportunity to engage in employment, training or upskilling, as appropriate and his / her responsibility to engage with such opportunities as they are provided.  This should improve a person's life chances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1077">It should be noted that responsibility for skills training undertaken by FÁS currently resides with the Department of Education and Skills.  The future development of the training and skills services of FÁS is a matter for the Minister for Education and Skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_1078">With regard to the timeline for the development of the National Employment and Entitlements Service, I am determined that this will be completed in the most expeditious manner possible and my officials are already actively engaged in a programme of work towards this end.  While this will be a multi-annual programme of work requiring the development of the new service, the assignment of functions to the Service and the development of its organisational processes and operational systems, many aspects of the new service will be delivered within the coming 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_1079">The administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme has already been transferred to the Department of Social Protection with the secondment of the Community Welfare Service from the Health Service Executive at the beginning of this year.  The intention is to have the staff fully transferred into the Department by the end of September this year.  This will enable us to integrate the payment of all benefits into one organisation simplifying customer processes.  Planning for the transfer and integration of the Employment Services and Community Employment Services of FÁS to the Department has already commenced and it is envisaged that the transfer of staff will commence later this year.  Again this will enable us to simplify and integrate the delivery of employment support services to customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1080">A key objective of the Government in relation to the new service is that it will offer users a high level of personalised employment support and prioritise the provision of more intensive support for those on the live register who are identified as being most at risk of long-term unemployment.  This will be achieved through the use of proactive approaches and modern case management systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_1081">A number of pilot projects have already commenced in relation to the development of case management, the identification of those who are most at risk of falling into long-term unemployment, and the provision of appropriately tailored responses to their needs.  These pilot projects will be completed and evaluated in the coming months after which approaches will be developed for their roll-out nationwide as part of the National Employment and Entitlements Service.</p>

            <p eId="para_1101">At the Government's request, EirGrid the State-owned transmission system operator is building the East West Interconnector between the electricity grids of Ireland and Britain.  The construction and operation of the East West Interconnector is the responsibility of EirGrid.  This national strategic project is on schedule and on budget for delivery by 2012.  The full cost of the Interconnector is underwritten by all electricity customers under the regulatory model implemented by the Commission for Energy Regulation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1102">The European Commission is giving particular strategic priority to strengthening electricity interconnection across Europe.  The strategic importance of the East West Interconnector project was recognised by the Commission with the granting of aid of €110m for the project in 2009 as part of the economy recovery support package for European interconnection and energy infrastructure.  The East West Interconnector will enable the import and export of electricity between Ireland and Britain.  It will underpin the progressive integration of the two electricity markets and will support the further integration of wind onto the Irish energy system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1103">The arrangements for the import and export of electricity are governed by European Union law — in particular Regulation (EC) 714/2009 on conditions for access to the network for cross-border exchanges in electricity and its annexed Congestion Management Guidelines.  These guidelines require market based trading arrangements on all interconnectors to ensure efficient cross border trade.</p>
            <p eId="para_1104">The specific trading and access arrangement for the East West Interconnector will be set out in the East West Access Rules that were recently consulted on by EirGrid and are subject to regulatory approval by the Commission for Energy Regulation in Ireland and Ofgem in Great Britain.  All electricity imported and/or exported across the East West Interconnector will be traded through the Single Electricity Market which determines the mandatory all-island wholesale electricity trading arrangements for Ireland and Northern Ireland that have been in place since November 2007.  In Great Britain, the requirements for the import and export of electricity are governed by the British Electricity Trading and Transmission Arrangements (BETTA).</p>

These changes have evolved from collaboration between the National Newborn Bloodspot Screening Laboratory, Children's University Hospital, Temple Street, the Department of Health and Children, the Data Protection Commissioner and the Health Service Executive.

            <p eId="para_1197">Government policy on mental health incorporates the recommendations of "A Vision for Change". The closure of the old psychiatric hospitals and the transfer of patients to more appropriate community-based settings is central to that policy and is a priority for this Government.  The evidence is overwhelming that a modern mental health service is best delivered in the community.  In these circumstances the Government is committed to developing community-based services and in that context will ring-fence €35 million annually from within the health budget to develop community mental health teams and services to ensure early access to more appropriate services and improved integration with primary care.</p>

            <p eId="para_1202">The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme was introduced in January 2010 as a universal programme to provide children with a free pre-school year, normally in the year before they commence primary school.</p>
            <p eId="para_1203">While some children with special needs are availing of the free pre-school year in specialist services, many are availing of it in mainstream settings, or a mixture of the two.  In February 2010, shortly after the introduction of the programme, to ensure a coherent approach to service provision and supports for children with special needs across both specialist and mainstream settings, the office asked the Office of Disability and Mental Health was asked to set up a working group to look at existing services and supports for pre-school children with special needs and the way in which these are allocated.  This group is expected to report shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1204">The ECCE programme includes a number of provisions for children with special needs.  These include an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification under the scheme where a child is developmentally delayed and would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the scheme for two days a week in the first year and for three days a week in the second year.  I regret to advise the Deputy that the programme does not provide for a second year of free pre-school.</p>

During 2010, the HSE and the Department progressed various improvements to home care provision, particularly relating to the standardisation and governance of services.  As part of these improvements, the HSE has initiated a procurement process for HSE home care recipients.</p>
            <p eId="para_1228">I wish to stress that this is not a policy of privatisation, but a more standardised approach to the existing process in order to regularise the procurement of services nationally.

I am advised that in drawing up the scheme originally, that it draws from similar experience in the UK where the Sustainable Travel Towns Programme was launched by the Department for Transport and ran from April 2004 to April 2009.  Following a competition, the programme was implemented in three towns: Darlington, Peterborough and Worcester.  The primary objective in all three areas was to encourage more use of non-car options- in particular bus use, cycling and walking- and less single-occupancy car use.  At the start of the Sustainable Travel Towns Programme, Darlington and Worcester had populations of roughly 100,000 people, while Peterborough had a population of about 137,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1236">An independent evaluation commissioned by the UK Department for Transport indicated that the programme was successful in reducing travel by car and went some way towards reducing congestion, and increasing the use of other modes of travel.

            <p eId="para_1255">The Road Safety Authority (RSA), which comes within the remit of my Department, is the national focal point for the Decade of Action for Road Safety in Ireland. Its role is to facilitate cooperation with regard to the Decade of Action in Ireland, to promote information about what is being organised throughout the country and to facilitate joint planning at national level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1256">The RSA will organise a national photo launch to announce the UN Decade of Action on the 11th May 2011. The launch will inform the public of what has happened in Ireland in terms of road safety for the past decade and will publicise activities which are being organised throughout the country by Local Authorities. It will also launch a long term campaign on road safety to run for the duration of the decade. This campaign will encourage people to continue their active support for road safety and road safety initiatives by making a public commitment to take meaningful actions in their own daily lives to make roads safer. The RSA will measure Irish progress during the Decade of Action from one year to the next by commissioning a major attitudinal and behavioural study of road user habits.</p>
            <p eId="para_1257">Information about events being organised throughout the country by Local Authorities will be uploaded on the RSA website www.rsa.ie and also on the World Health Organisation's website <i>www.who.int</i>. Information will also be published through national and local press releases.</p>
