#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I have received notice from Senator Henry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:The need for the Minister for Health and Children to defend the deal allowing for the free movement of medical practitioners within the European Union so they can practise their profession in any member state.I have also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to make a temporary preservation order on the land surrounding Carrickmines Castle under section 8 of the National Monuments Act, 1930.I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I wish to make an announcement regarding the panel of temporary chairpersons to which I nominate the following Members: Senators Ulick Burke, John Dardis, Michael Finucane, Mary Henry, Jim Higgins, Terry Leyden, Pascal Mooney, Kathleen O'Meara, Labhrás Ó Murchú and Jim Walsh. I thank them for agreeing to act as temporary chairpersons.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	2	The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re address by the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Pat Cox, MEP, to be taken without debate; No. 2, motion re restoration of Digital Hub Development Agency Bill, 2002, to the Order Paper, to be taken without debate; No. 3, motion re Order of Business, to be taken without debate; No. 4, motion re Seanad reform, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes; and No. 5, motion No. 3, Fine Gael Private Members' motion on education, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. The Government amendment to the motion has been supplied to Members.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	3	On No. 4, has time been allocated for other Senators?
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	4	No, it is 20 minutes or less.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	5	Will the Leader of the House consider amending No. 1 in order that, after the address and questions to the President of the European Parliament, the House will be given an opportunity to debate in a very concise way developments in Northern Ireland? She will no doubt agree that all Members wish the Taoiseach well tonight in his discussions with the British Prime Minister. Given the crisis ensuing in Northern Ireland, there is a need for a full debate in this House to take place tomorrow when we will have more knowledge available to us.When does the Leader intend to propose a specific section on the Order Paper to deal with the second interim report of the Flood tribunal? She is no doubt aware that it is listed at No. 10 under the non-statutory section of the Order Paper. Given the implications and conclusions reached, when does she intend to have a full debate on it?
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	6	There may be some confusion about this, but the Leader said the address tomorrow by Mr. Pat Cox will be taken without debate.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	7	No, I said the motion that we allow that address will be taken without debate.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I apologise, we will agree on speaking times. I thank the Leader for putting these debates on the Order Paper as requested the last time we met. It is a good indication of how we can look forward to doing business for the remainder of this term.I agree completely with the suggestions of Senator Hayes. With the publication of the Flood report and the extraordinary developments in Northern Ireland I am conscious that much has changed in the last month. We have always said we need to be careful about the statements we make on issues.One of the major issues that always arises when we discuss Seanad reform is that of relevancy. In order for the House to be relevant at present, it is essential that the Flood report is debated. Members on all sides of the House – no single grouping can hold the moral high ground on issues of this nature – should be able to put forward their views on the report. It is important that Members should be seen to place their views on the record. I am seeking a debate on this matter and time should be set aside either tomorrow afternoon, as Senator Hayes suggested, or on the next occasion the Seanad meets. I would like us to have time to digest the statements that will be made today and tomorrow in the Dáil in respect of the report and then engage in a debate of our own.The issue of Northern Ireland has been debated cogently and with great creativity and restraint in this House. It is both timely and important that we should have a debate on the situation in Northern Ireland in order that we can be brought up to date on developments and put forward our views. There is a great deal to be said on this matter. I ask that these two issues be debated as soon as possible.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I agree with the remarks made by other Members regarding Northern Ireland. It is important that we should debate both Northern Ireland and the interim report of the Flood tribunal at the earliest opportunity.Another issue which demands urgent attention is the impending decision of the United Nations. Ireland is in the pivotal position – one it has not held for some time – of having a vote at the Security Council. It is remarkable that so little public attention has been focused on what is being done in our name at the Security Council and it would be extremely useful if we had a debate on this matter and were granted the opportunity to hear the views of either the Minister for Foreign Affairs or his Minister of State.As the Cathaoirleach is aware, the Labour Party is concerned about the order in which Senators and groups represented in the House are called to speak. The Labour Party has the same number of Senators as the Independent group.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	10	Not for long.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I appreciate that discussions have taken place in respect of this matter and Senator Norris and I will have plenty of time to discuss it further.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I am just wondering—
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	13	As already stated, the Labour Party has the same number of Senators as the Independent group.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	14	This matter is not appropriate to the Order of Business.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	15	It is important that the Cathaoirleach should made a statement on this matter to the House because the Labour Party Senators, as members of a minority group, have rights, both as individuals and as members of that group. I wish to make it clear that the committee does not have the power to oppress a minority in circumstances which are clearly frivolous. It has been suggested that, because of their accumulated senility, Independent Members should have some priority. We do not accept that.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	16	Judging by the imbecility of the Senator's group, senility seems the preferable option.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	17	I am tempted to say that Senator Norris provides both with aplomb.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I will explain the position. As Senator McDowell may be aware, under Standing Order 32, the Chair has sole discretion in calling a Senator to speak. His choice of speaker is influenced by the numerical strength of the relevant Senator's group. The Independent group and Labour group each has five Members. In the absence of any direction in Standing Orders, I called Senator O'Toole to speak on the basis of the seniority of the Independent group which has been in existence since 1987. That is my ruling.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	19	I have no intention of being disruptive, but I wish to state that we do not accept that ruling. In addition, we do not accept the Cathaoirleach's entitlement to make what is, in effect, an illegal ruling.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	20	I have the power to make such a ruling under Standing Order 32.
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I wish to raise on the Adjournment of the House the current crisis in the beef industry. I wish to call on the Minister—
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	22	That is not a matter for the Order of Business.
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	23	It is a matter for the Adjournment.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	24	If the Senator wishes to raise a matter on the Adjournment, he must give prior notice.
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I request that the House consider, on the Order of Business, the issues relating to the crisis in the beef industry, including pricing arrangements. Beef producers are receiving very low prices for their product and the IFA is protesting. I call on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to have the issues investigated further by the Competition Authority.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	26	At our first sitting I requested a special debate on the economy. The situation was extremely bad at the time and has worsened considerably in the meantime. There is now a considerable shortfall in corporation and income tax revenue. The Minister for Finance has managed, magically, to turn a substantial surplus into a projected deficit of €750 million.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	27	Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	28	I ask for a special debate on that matter.There has been a very serious development today in the Supreme Court where a section of the 1996 Domestic Violence Act in relation to interim barring orders has been struck down as unconstitutional. There are approximately 1,000 interim barring currently outstanding and it is important that their status be established immediately. I ask the Leader of the House to seek immediate clarification. If amending legislation is required, it should be brought before the House as a matter of urgency.
#LabhrasOMurchu	unknown-#LabhrasOMurchu-party	unknown-#LabhrasOMurchu-dob	unknown-#LabhrasOMurchu-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	29	I wish to raise an urgent issue of human rights. I ask the Leader to convey my concerns to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in relation to the three Irishmen currently held in captivity and awaiting trial in Colombia. There are many questions with regard to their safety and whether they can receive a fair trial. There has been a great deal of judgmental commentary on the case which has been linked, in the first instance, to the peace process in Northern Ireland and the international campaign against terrorism. Having regard to past miscarriages of justice such as the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four, we need to ensure it does not take another ten or 12 years before another miscarriage of justice—
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	30	Is the Senator requesting a debate?
#LabhrasOMurchu	unknown-#LabhrasOMurchu-party	unknown-#LabhrasOMurchu-dob	unknown-#LabhrasOMurchu-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	31	Yes. I ask that the Minister for Foreign Affairs ensure there is Irish representation on a daily basis in Colombia. It would be very wrong if there were people out there with other agendas and if the three people concerned are ultimately found not guilty. I ask that the Minister monitor the situation.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	32	The report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals for 2001 has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. I ask the Leader of the House to arrange a debate on the matter at the earliest opportunity.
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	33	I echo Senator McDowell's request in relation to Ireland's membership of the Security Council of the United Nations. However, I also applaud the initiative of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen. When Ireland assumed that important role earlier this year, he immediately initiated a process whereby representatives of the Department of Foreign Affairs brief the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs on a monthly basis. The Minister came to the House on numerous occasions during the last term and I am sure he would welcome a further opportunity to do so. I ask the Leader to consider the possibility of arranging a debate on Ireland's membership of the United Nations to allow the Minister to give the House an update in that regard.In the context of current matters of concern, I ask the Leader to convey the concern of thousands of sports fans at the news that Sky Television will not broadcast as had been expected the Ireland-Switzerland game, either on Sky One or terrestrial television. I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, the real concern of many sports fans who will be deprived, simply as the result of considerations of money.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	34	Will the Leader request the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to come to the House to explain the decision by Cardinal Health to defer the commencement of its operation in Longford for at least two years? The reversal of the company's announcement, made in November 1999, is a cause of serious concern and disappointment for the people of County Longford. A positive statement is required from the Minister to boost the commercial life of the area.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	35	The Senator has requested a debate and made his point, but he cannot go into detail on the matter.
#PaulCoghlan	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-party	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-dob	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	36	I support and second Senator Hayes's call for a debate on Northern Ireland and the interim report of Mr. Justice Feargus Flood. Will the Leader inform the House of the Government's intentions regarding a possible amendment of the 20% social and affordable housing provision contained in the Planning and Development Act, 2000, and the withering rule regarding planning permissions? Will she also indicate the Government's intentions and proposals regarding libel law in the context of the report of the legal advisory group on defamation?
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	37	A number of Senators have raised foreign affairs issues and I hope the Cathaoirleach will shortly be in a position to advise us of when the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs will be established because many of these matters should be discussed in that forum.With regard to Senator Ó Murchú's point regarding the people in Colombia, I also supported the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four, but simply slapping a number after a name does not establish anyone's innocence. There are a number of murky circumstances regarding the men in Colombia which require a great deal of explanation. As there has been a great deal of prevarication, dishonesty and lying about the situation, simply describing the men as the Colombia Three does not establish their innocence.I support the calls for the Flood tribunal report to be discussed. I was abroad all summer and the report was the only item of Irish news which appeared on international television. It is disquieting and must be dealt with as quickly and efficiently as possible with a proper debate in the House.I welcome the visit of the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Cox, but ask for more information on the arrangements. As the Cathaoirleach and Leader know, when we have had distinguished visitors, they have often read out longwinded, factual, pre-prepared statements to the Seanad. They often took so long there was almost no time for questions other than those of the leaders. The essentially valuable ingredient of this system is that ordinary Members can question Mr. Cox. We know precisely what his position is, but, without being discourteous to such a distinguished person, I ask that he confine himself. We do not need to know the official position of the European Parliament – we already know what it is, it is coming out of our ears. I ask that we have as much time as possible for questions.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	38	In support of the comments made by my colleague in relation to the position of the Labour Party in the House—
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	39	That matter does not arise on the Order of Business. It has been dealt with.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	40	I ask the Cathaoirleach to clarify the basis on which he makes a decision. I do not question his—
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	41	I have clarified the matter.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	42	I do not for one moment question your power of discretion and you will agree that the Labour Party in this House in the past five years and during my time here has always co-operated with the Cathaoirleach. I simply ask you, therefore, to clarify—
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	43	I accept that and hope there will be co-operation. I sought co-operation rather than confrontation when I was elected, but I must make rulings.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	44	On what basis is seniority being used in terms of the Cathaoirleach's discretion?
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	45	I have explained that and I ask the Senator to desist. Does she have a question for the Leader?
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	46	I support the calls for a debate on Northern Ireland. We have had valuable debates on the issue at times of crisis before and I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Government that many in this House can make a valuable contribution, particularly people such as Senator Maurice Hayes who has a lot of experience. I also support calls for a full debate on the second interim report of the Flood tribunal.The issue of interim barring orders was raised by Senator Higgins. Will the Leader consider statements on how the issue of domestic violence is handled? Major problems have developed with this issue and Members would be able to give enlightened views which would be of interest to the Government.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	47	Under the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Bill, 1999, the Minister has power to schedule certain sporting and cultural events. The Minister announced a preliminary list going back to 17 July 2002. We are on the eve of an important match, yet it looks as if people will only have access to it through "Sky Sports". I understand the list is being presented to Cabinet today. Will the Leader take up the issue as a priority with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to ensure there is a satisfactory resolution and to make the match accessible to the many people who do not have access to "Sky Sports". This issue has gone on for three years and the Minister should put an end to procrastination and take action.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	48	I congratulate the Cathaoirleach on an excellent decision as regards the calling of speakers.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	49	Hear, hear.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	50	I want no bouquets. Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	51	In a short time the Cathaoirleach has justified the greatness thrust upon him. None of us anticipated that.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	52	A question for the Leader, please.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	53	I make a plea in regard to the Order Paper. Three items are to be taken without debate and I would not like this to set a precedent for the House. There is one item which is not contentious in the current atmosphere but it might be in other circumstances. That item concerns the decision to invite a speaker. As a norm the invitation of a speaker should be discussed in the House. It is not a matter which should be left to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. In certain circumstances, someone who is less, or more, controversial might be offensive to the House. Others might say that if the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Cox, was to be invited, and I look forward to hearing him, that someone from the other side of the Nice treaty debate should also be invited. This and other matters of the sort should not be without debate in the future. I am worried that this might set a precedent which would be referred to as the basis and the procedure by which we invite people. We would then get some very partisan people invited to address the House.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	54	The Senator invited Mother Teresa of Calcutta.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	56	Quite right too.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	57	I ask Senators to address the Chair please.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	58	I wish, without interruption from my colleagues, to mention another point about the European Parliament's President, Mr. Cox. I do not see the need for him to speak for more than about five minutes. We know his position. Could we request that he—
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	59	Give it to us on CD.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	61	The Chair has done very well so far and I ask him to allow me to finish. Could we ask President Cox to restrict his remarks so that many Senators, rather than just spokespersons and leaders, will be able to ask useful questions?
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	62	Hear, hear.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	63	The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, announced in 1999 that over 10,000 State jobs would be decentralised to areas that have not already benefited from decentralisation. Nothing has happened in that regard in the past three years. He invited submissions from each county council and Roscommon County Council, of which I am a member, eagerly awaits an announcement from him. I ask the Leader of the House to invite the Minister for Finance to come to this House to say when he intends to make a decision and to outline the nature of that decision.

Such a debate would be pertinent as it seems almost inevitable that a war will take place. I would appreciate if such a debate could be held as soon as possible.While I am on my feet, may I congratulate Senator Norris for enlivening my Saturday mornings with his recent regal performances?

#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	67	I ask the Leader of the House to arrange a debate with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Michael McDowell, about important issues such as the link between homelessness and crime. I would like to hear how the Minister intends to deal with homeless young offenders who are found in many cities.The Minister should outline how he intends to spend €8 million which has been allocated for special Garda projects. Does he intend to give funds to the BOND project in Blanchardstown, the Tower project in Tallaght and the Tivoli Training Centre in Dun Laoghaire? I would also like the Minister, when he comes to this House, to comment on proposed cutbacks in training and to clarify how this will affect the number of new recruits it is intended to accept.

#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	73	Several Opposition Senators have asked for a debate on Northern Ireland and it is important to state that their concerns are shared on this side of the House. The peace process is encountering difficulties and I am sure all Senators hope it will survive intact. Senators calling for a debate should bear in mind the nature of the crisis in the North as the future of the power-sharing Executive there will not become clear until next week.This House has a fine record of debates on Northern Ireland; we remember in particular those debates to which the late Gordon Wilson and Senator Maurice Hayes contributed. A degree of expertise and a restrained and responsible tone have always been evident in such debates. Given the present circumstances, it might be no harm if time could be found for a debate next week rather than tomorrow.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	74	Many of the 20 speakers on the Order of Business, including Senators Brian Hayes, O'Toole, McDowell, Mooney, Coghlan and O'Meara, spoke about the problems in the North and the issues surrounding the report of the Flood tribunal. Debates were requested on both issues.I thank the Deputy Leader for his knowledgeable contribution on Northern Ireland, with which I concur. Tonight the Taoiseach and Prime Minister will hold talks in London, the outcome of which will be elucidated in the morning, but it will take days for that to filter through. It is a time of intense activity in Northern Ireland and each of us must carefully monitor what we say because of the sensitivities involved. The House has a reputation for its sensitivity on various matters and on Northern Ireland in particular. We all hope there is a satisfactory outcome and I hope we will have debate the issue next week. Senator Hayes sought such a debate tomorrow afternoon following the adddress by the President of the European Parliament, Pat Cox, but it would be prudent to schedule such a debate next week.I also concur with the Senators who requested a debate on the Flood tribunal report. The Dáil is debating the report today and tomorrow and this House should also debate it. I will put the request to the Government Chief Whip and, subject to a meeting of the Whips, I hope the report will be debated next week.Senators Mooney, O'Toole and others raised the need for a debate on foreign policy, with particular reference to Iraq. This issue was raised when we last met and I spoke to the Minister in the interim. The Minister intimated that he would be glad to come to the House to discuss the matter and arrangements for the debate will be worked out by the Whips.Senator Bannon called on the Tánaiste to come to the House to discuss the decision by Cardinal Health to postpone building a plant in Longford. I will put that request to her but, in the meantime, the Senator could raise the issue on the Adjournment.Senator Coghlan raised the question of social and affordable housing, the withering rule and another matter. I will convey his comments to the Department of the Environment and Local Government.Senator Norris referred to tomorrow's debate with the President of the European Parliament, Pat Cox, and stated he would like ordinary Members to have an opportunity to contribute. I will not tell Mr. Cox that he can only speak for a set time as that would be rude. He is a pragmatic person. When I invited to the House he asked that plenty of time be made available for statements and questions and answers. He does not want to be subject to the withering rule as he wants to hear what we have to say.Senator Ross did not like the fact that the invitation to Mr. Cox to come to the House had become a matter for the Committee on Procedures and Privileges. However, I understand the invitation was subject to an earlier ruling that had been made following the Senator's proposal to invite somebody to the House which resulted in a bit of rí-rá.

I proposed that the person should come to the House. In this case a person has been invited to the House following acceptance by the Committee of Procedure and Privileges. It is a totally different issue.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	77	A ruling was made at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that if someone wished to introduce the idea of a person addressing the House, it should be raised at the committee, as was done in this case. It is on the Order Paper without debate today as an announcement made out of courtesy so all Members of the House would know that the committee agreed to the address. Senator Ross wanted to restrict Mr. Cox's speech to five minutes. I would not be that discourteous to anyone. He has intimated very strongly that he wants to hear the views of Senators.Senator Feighan would like to discuss decentralisation. I suggest that he raise the matter on the Adjournment. Senator Terry raised the issues of crime, young offenders, special projects and the retirement age of gardaí. Again, this could be discussed on the Adjournment or during her party's Private Members' time because the issue is so wide-ranging.Senator Leydon raised the crisis in the beef industry and the need for the Competition Authority to revisit the area while Senator Jim Higgins spoke about the economy. The Fine Gael Party has a debate on the matter scheduled on the Order Paper.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	78	We would like that to be taken in Government time.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	81	Senator O'Meara called for the amendment of legislation because of today's decision in the courts. I will bring that to the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform because this could lead to a serious situation in many domestic violence cases very quickly. Senator Henry mentioned the report of the Inspector of Mental Institutions and requested a debate. The Whips will try to agree time for such a debate.Senator Lydon called for a discussion on Iraq. That has been agreed and it is a matter of arranging time for the debate. The Minister has stated that he will readily come to the House to discuss it.Senator Finucane raised the importance of an upcoming sports event on Sky Television. This was discussed in Cabinet this morning so we will see what the Government is doing and then decide what we will do.Senator Ó Murchú raised the issue of the three Irish citizens being held in Colombia. I take the point that if a number is added, such as the Colombia this, the Birmingham that and the Guildford whatever, it could have the effect of creating a mystique around the issue because one or two cases were found to be sadly incorrect decisions. Senator Ó Murchú did not use the phrase "Colombia three", but asked that his comments be passed on to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I will do that.

There is permanent attention to that trial by the Government's consular representative. I am glad of this because she is a formidable woman. I met her once and can say that she will maintain a very strong watching brief on the matter. I will convey the concerns of Senators regarding the issue.I hope I have not left anyone out; if I did it was inadvertent. I have dealt as far as I can with the issues.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	91	I move:That Seanad Éireann agrees with the recommendation of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that, in accordance with the provisions for the address to Seanad Éireann by Distinguished Persons, Mr. Pat Cox, President of the European Parliament be invited to address Seanad Éireann on 10 October, 2002 and the following arrangements shall apply in relation to that day. The Seanad shall sit at 10.30 a.m. for the purpose of the address; the proceedings at such address shall consist of a speech by the Cathaoirleach welcoming President Cox, the address by President Cox at the conclusion of which he will reply to questions from Members and a speech of thanks by the Cathaoirleach for the address; the proceedings shall conclude no later than 12.45 p.m. whereupon the Seanad shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on 16 October 2002.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	92	I move:That, in pursuance of Standing Order No. 122 of the Standing Orders relative to Public Business, the Digital Hub Development Agency Bill, 2002 which had reached Order for Second Stage prior to the Seanad General Election July 2002, be restored to the Order Paper.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	93	I move:That the practice of calling the Leader of the House to reply to the Order of Business no later than 30 minutes after the proposal of the Order of Business shall be continued until the Christmas recess.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	94	I move:That Seanad Éireann, recognising the views expressed by Members of the 22nd Seanad concerning the issue of Seanad reform, instructs a sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to be established so that proposals can be brought forward.The Cathaoirleach indicates I may speak to the motion, but I intend to speak at a later date.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	95	I am delighted to second the motion. The Fine Gael Members of the Seanad very much support the motion originating from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges which calls for the establishment of a sub-committee on Seanad reform and we encourage other Members to do likewise. When the committee began to debate this issue we felt that the most appropriate way forward in dealing with the issue of Seanad reform was through the establishment of a sub-committee which could work on the matter over a period of time before reporting to the Seanad.There is one defect to the motion which I noticed only a week ago in that it describes no timeframe for reporting back to the Seanad. We need to look at that because if we establish this sub-committee without setting a timeframe the entire debate could take place over the next three to four years without any conclusion being reached. I ask the Leader and Members to consider that issue before we agree to the motion in its entirety.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	96	I understand the point the Senator is making and he is correct, but for the purposes of this debate we intend it to run for a few weeks, if that is all right. I know that is not what the Senator refers to.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	97	When the sub-committee is established it is vital that it be well staffed by a group of people who can work to its agenda alone. The officers of the House are inundated with work and it would be totally unfair to ask them to take on this additional burden. The Leader should do everything in her power to ensure that extra staff requirements are met before the establishment of this sub-committee.If we are serious about the issue of Seanad reform, it is important to show consensus. If one group of Senators, appointed by the Taoiseach, denigrates another group of Senators, elected by county councillors, which, in turn, denigrates the group of Senators elected by graduates, we will not get far. The only way success will be achieved is by consensus over a period of time. We must move the debate forward and provide for real reform. The debate should not become a point scoring exercise where one group of Senators attacks another group of Senators and questions the validity of its mandate. If we take that route, we will not find a positive solution.The Seanad is vitally important in the legislative framework of the Constitution. Its Members have made a huge contribution to politics and legislative debates. There is no doubt there is a need for a second Chamber which can review and update legislation and will ensure the Government of the day, regardless of its composition, is rapped across the knuckles from time to time. That requires an independence of mind and spirit. I am conscious of this having been a Member of the other House. People do not expect us to be as party political as we were in the other House.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	98	The Senator could have fooled me.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	99	I ask other colleagues to reflect on that. If the House has a definite function in our Constitution to review legislation, we must not be as party political as we were in the other House. The Seanad has been successful because of its independence.I have three problems with the current situation. The first, which all parties and Governments experience, is that there is too much legislation. Unfortunately, when a Minister decides to announce an initiative, it inevitably involves the introduction of legislation. The number of Bills proposed in the Houses of the Oireachtas in the past ten years outweighs the number proposed in the previous 50 years. That is a problem, not only in this House, but also in the other House. We must be able to quickly reflect what is happening in the country. That is the reason I raised urgent matters on the Order of Business today. If that facility is not available, the public will look cynically on the proceedings here.Legislation is not considered enough and too few people are involved. That is directly related to the fact that a party whip operates in the House. The worst thing for democracy was the establishment of the party whip. It gives power to 15 or 16 people in the Executive who initiate legislation. That is as much a problem for the Government as it is for the Opposition. We must try to abolish the party whip if we want to reform the Seanad. The party whip may be justified in the other House because the Government of the day wants to establish and implement its manifesto commitments which the people support. However, the operation of the party whip – I include my own party – is not necessary in the Seanad because parties do not have manifestos. We do not get our support from the people, unlike Members in the other House. We need to consider this when considering Seanad reform. Could we introduce a law to abolish the party whip in the Seanad and give people the independence to speak freely and take different positions from those of the Government and Opposition? If we are just a mirror of the Dáil, we will not get the best out of the 60 people elected to this House. This proposal was contained in a document entitled, The Democratic Revolution, first published only four years ago by my party colleagues, Deputies John Bruton and Jim Mitchell. It does not benefit Parliament to have very strong whipping arrangements.I have three sets of proposals covering changes to Standing Orders, which we can make fairly easily by addressing them at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, legislative changes to reform the Seanad and constitutional changes. I will briefly address each category.Some immediate reforms require small changes to Standing Orders. It is madness that in this day and age we must meet at 2.30 p.m. each Wednesday. I do not know where this rule in Standing Orders came from. The practice by which we sit for four, five or six hours on a day when most people are at work at 8 a.m. is archaic. Tomorrow, for instance, the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Pat Cox, will address us in the morning, after which we will ask him questions – I hope all Members will do so – and the business of the House will conclude at 12.45 p.m. That is ridiculous. We can change this overnight without much debate or the need for legislation. I ask that the sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges which is looking at this matter make these changes.There is a need for specific, well focused debates on key issues. This is an area in which the Seanad can connect with the public. If, instead of leaving urgent matters until the following week, we responded quickly to issues as they arose, put them on the Order Paper immediately and held short, focused debates with contributions of four or five minutes, as the European Parliament does, we would have much more credibility with the public. This could also be changed without difficulty.Every year thousands of reports appear on the Order Paper which are never debated or discussed. While I concede that some of these are best left to a committee of the House, in other cases we should hold a debate. For instance, an issue first raised in this House ten years ago by Senator O'Toole and others, namely, emigrant voting, arose again during the summer when the Minister for Foreign Affairs published an excellent report on support for emigrants. Given its party political nature and the kind of animal it is, the Dáil will never debate this report. This House has an opportunity to debate issues such as this in a very short, concise way. In this case, we should bring in the Minister to ensure a degree of accountability for the recommendations made in the report. As Senators, we can provide added value on these kinds of issues.I propose the introduction of Question Time. While I am aware that the new Standing Order 51 allows a Minister to make a statement and then take questions, a Question Time rota in which one or two Ministers would address the House together would be useful in terms of illuminating policy on a variety of issues.I propose that we abolish the speakers' list. These manufactured lists of speakers are one of the reasons so few Members attend the House to speak. It does not present a problem today as it contains ten or 15 Members – perhaps this is because Members are fascinated by what I have to say. The list means that if one is due to speak at 5 p.m., for example, one does not come into the House until 4.45 p.m. The Cathaoirleach should have discretion to call speakers from those present in the Chamber as it would ensure more Members come into the House and make contributions.I wish to take up an issue raised by one of my colleagues. We should have no scripts in the House.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	101	It is not a good sign that Members cannot make a contribution without a script. I ask the Cathaoirleach to enforce this rule. It is better to make a short contribution than to read from a prepared script. I accept, however, that there are times, on sensitive matters such as Northern Ireland—
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	102	Or money issues.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	103	—when Members will want to place certain facts on the record. There may well be a number of well defined areas where this could be established. Scripts are bad for Parliament. Watching Members read from scripts when the proceedings are broadcast is awful. I ask that it be changed.My next proposal is that this side of the House needs more Government time. As the Fianna Fáil Party has 30 Members in this House, in effect, half the total number of Senators, it gets 50% of Private Members' time. There should be greater latitude in this area to ensure that the Opposition, who, by its nature, will try to hold the Government to account, is given more Private Members' time. That is something we could also change in Standing Orders.Regarding the scrutiny of EU legislation, as the Leader of the House is aware, the European Union Scrutiny Bill, 2001, which was first proposed by the Labour Party, is on Committee Stage and I understand that Report Stage of that Bill will be taken in the Dáil next week. This Bill has the potential to be the most important legislation the House has discussed in a generation. It is the first time elected Members of the Seanad and the Dáil can be involved in the decisions our Ministers ultimately make at Councils of Ministers meetings. I ask the Leader to examine how exactly we will play a role in that. If we make this work, it will have a major significance for Members in terms of contributing to debates prior to Council of Ministers meetings. That would be significant.I ask the Leader and the sub-committee that will be established ultimately to examine the issue of resourcing for Members and their offices. This is a point of contention for many Members on both sides of the House. There is a need for the preparation of special reports that the Seanad could sanction. One of the best improvements in the committee system in recent years has been that a rapporteur can be appointed to report on a issue and that issue is then presented by one or two Members, frequently from different parties. The Seanad could implement such a measure.Regarding the issue of changes where legislation would be required for a number of proposals, MEPs should be allowed to attend and speak in the Seanad. I am aware of the changes to Standing Order 52, which provides that MEPs can be invited to this House. I do not propose that they should be Members of this House, but they should be able to attend and speak here if they wish. I ask the Leader to consider that proposal.I propose that the Seanad should travel outside Dublin once or twice a year. There is a constitutional requirement that the Houses of the Oireachtas meet in Dublin, but my proposal would be a good development. The Government has done this in recent years. The Front Bench of my party has also done this. The Seanad should visit a region once or twice a year.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	106	Yes, certainly. It is in the centre of the country. I am sure we should get a great welcome from the Leader.The electoral college for the vocational panels should be expanded to include all city and town councillors and MEPs. In the case where people are elected to councils and given a vote for the Seanad, all town councillors should be entitled to vote in such circumstances. Voting should not be restricted only to those who are members of county councils or the three or four significant city councils.If we retain the specific graduate entitlement to vote, graduates from all third level institutions should be entitled to vote. We should not distinguish between graduates. One six seat constituency rather than the existing two three seat constituencies would make more sense.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	107	Yes, it would.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	108	Other Members will have other views on that and no doubt we will debate this in further detail.Former Cabinet Ministers should be entitled to attend and speak in the Seanad, although not as Members. People who have just left or are at the margins of politics have a wealth of experience. Such people should not be given a salary but a daily rate of payment, as is the practice in the House of Lords. The same type practice should exist here for former Cabinet Ministers of perhaps ten years' standing.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	113	If a Member of this House is elected to the other House or resigns, it is most unfair if the party of which he or she is a member is not able fill the seat vacated by that person.A question arises on the fundamental issue of constitutional change, the third item on the list, which is whether the job description of the Seanad in the Constitution is right. I believe that, by and large, it is right. It provides that, first, we can amend or delay legislation; second, we are not responsible for money Bills, which is right as we do not have a mandate from the people; third, that the Seanad is not a mirror of the Dáil, even though in recent years we have become such, but that is not particularly healthy; and fourth, that we can initiate Bills, an area on which we need to spend more time. Many good suggestions for Private Members' Bills by Members of this House could be taken up by Government if we had a more structured time for that business.On the question of whether we have too many or too few Senators, I think 60 is about right. For the size of this country, I would not propose changing that number. There is justification for the appointment of the Taoiseach's nominees. It is only right that the Government of the day should be able to have a working majority in the House. However, we should establish in law various groups from which the Taoiseach of the day could pick Senators. For instance, there should a gender quota because of the low number of women in the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Taoiseach should pick a nominee who would represent Irish emigrants abroad. He should also pick nominees who represent the social partners. Such groups could be established in law, if there is the intention to do that.The university Senators have done the State some service. I would not propose abolishing the election of Independent Senators. They have made a major contribution to the House. However, we need to work at a system to ensure that electorate is a fair indication of the number of graduates within the country at a given time. The distinction between TCD and the National University of Ireland existed in the 1930s because of the Protestant minorities and the need to have that voice respected and reflected in the Houses. That is no longer the case because the vast majority of persons who go to Trinity College, Dublin are Catholics.

Depending on the percentage they get at the general election, Members could be appointed from that list. Nominations for the Seanad and Dáil should be held on the same day. This would allow people who have purely legislative interests and requirements to be elected to the Seanad and not to the Dáil. By doing that, we would be able to reform the Seanad.These are my personal views. This will be a wide-ranging debate, which I welcome. I hope that at the end of it we will have a consensus on how we can go forward rather than the endless reports we have had on this subject for the past 30 years.
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	119	I support the motion that a sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges should be established so that proposals on the reform of the Seanad can be brought forward and discussed.While many are selected for nomination to the Seanad, it is a great honour to be a Member of this House. I was nominated by the Irish Conference of Professional and Service Associations. This organisation represents the Irish Bank Officials' Association, the Irish Distillers Staff Association, the Garda Representative Association, the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, the Association of Garda Superintendents, RACO, the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, PDFORRA – the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association – the Dublin Institute of Technology Staff Association and Citibank Staff Association on the Labour Panel. I have a mandate from that organisation to articulate its views on many issues raised in this House. I will also represent to the best of my ability – as do all Senators – the views and policies of those Deputies, Senators and councillors who elected me to this House. I believe such a nominating body has a great deal of merit. I was nominated to the Labour Panel and am a trade union member. I am also a member of other associations.The system of nomination may, at times, be criticised, but it is quite a healthy way of selecting candidates to represent different panels. It is very difficult to gain election to this House and we are all very honoured to be here, not least you, a Chathaoirligh, one of its longest serving Members.The Seanad provides us with an opportunity to examine our political system and institutions. I compliment the Leader of the House and the Opposition spokesperson on initiating this debate. Every organisation should review its workings and structures from time to time. People quite often say if something is not broken then there is no need to fix it.During my term of office as Minister of State with responsibility for trade and marketing I brought many Bills before this House and was always impressed by Senators' contributions. My sentiments in that regard on the record of the House. Senators made a major contribution to the shaping and formation of legislation. When I could, I accepted Senators' amendments in the best interests of providing proper legislation. Members of this House have provided a great service to this State in ensuring our legislation is scrutinised, one of the most important aspects of its work. That work has been carried out with great distinction by Members of the Seanad.We have before us a great opportunity for calm deliberations and deep analysis of the national issues many speakers raised on the Order of Business today. This House is a platform where major legislation, national and European, can be examined and discussed. This will be particularly important when we have an opportunity of discussing European legislation in great detail. I have served on the Council of Ministers in Europe. Many issues agreed at that level require detailed examination here. During my involvement in the negotiations on the Single European Act we had to make very speedy decisions on many issues. It would be of enormous benefit to have the advice and assistance of the Dáil and Seanad in this regard.There are other areas in which the Seanad could function. The role of Seanad Éireann as a consultative body with knowledge, expertise and judgment over the spectrum of public affairs should be strengthened. The Seanad should present an opportunity for MEPs to engage in discussions in this House though, as stated earlier, not permanently because they would not have the time to do so. When issues regarding Europe arise we should provide MEPs with a platform on which to discuss these issues.The President of the European Parliament, Mr. Pat Cox, will attend this House tomorrow. I thank him, in advance, for agreeing to come here and be questioned on the workings of the European Union. We will have an opportunity to invite Commissioners to this House to discuss the issues and policies they are pursuing. It is an environment in which social partnership can flourish, where organisations nominate speakers to discuss recent development in various industries. Let us provide a forum where representatives can speak from the inside out rather than from the outside in. We have a tremendous forum whereby representatives of national organisations can put their ideas to us as elected members of Seanad Éireann. That is one of the areas we should examine within the current structures.Many of the suggestions I put forward can be carried out within existing structures and rules. We should use current structures to the maximum extent instead of waiting for a report from a committee outside this House. Such a committee should be formed by representatives of this House. The advice of former Members such as Brian Mullooly, who provided tremendous assistance to this House, could be sought by such a committee. The role of Senators should be enhanced. The hard work and dedication of those honoured and privileged to serve as members of Seanad Éireann since 1937 have been immeasurable. The wealth of experience and the cross section of society represented by Members have played a major role in the quality of legislation passed by the Oireachtas. Let us draw on this experience and knowledge and use it to serve our country.Senators should be used as spokespersons by Departments. As a former Minister of State I understand how difficult it is for Ministers to leave the jurisdiction at the head of trade delegations to seek industrial investment for this country. As the Government spokesperson on trade, enterprise and employment I would be particularly interested to work with the IDA and Enterprise Ireland in pursuit of their policies and in attracting industry to the BMW region which is supposed to get 40% of all investment from abroad.In 1982, I had the honour of launching a James Joyce stand in Paris on Bloomsday. It would be admirable if Senator Norris whose knowledge of James Joyce is far greater than mine were given such an opportunity.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	120	The idea was ours but we were very happy to support the Government.
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	121	Yes. What could be better than having Senator Norris representing the State as a guest speaker at a tourism venue in New York on that momentous day? The James Joyce industry is major in areas as far away as Japan. The same can be said for any Senator who is experienced in a particular profession or business. The Government should avail of the services of Members of this House in the interests of industry, tourism or agriculture.Having praised Senator Norris, I now come to an issue which some say we should not discuss, namely the representation of the universities. It is a difficult issue. The Second and Seventh Progress Reports of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution insist that university representatives continue to play a distinctive and valuable role in the working of the Seanad. I salute that work. I know that some of the university representatives are members of parties and contest the Seanad as members of their party, though they are not always successful. I have certain concerns regarding the election process for the six university seats. It is proposed by the committee to allow graduates of all third level institutions to cast a vote. I wholeheartedly support this proposal.One of the most obvious and tremendous developments since we joined the European Union has been the rise of the institutes of technology. Surely students of these institutes should have the same rights as those of the universities. A referendum was held in 1979 in which over 90% of those who voted supported this initiative. I now call on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to introduce a Bill to legislate for such changes. I do not think that there has been any precedent where the result of a referendum passed by 90% of those who voted was not implemented by the Oireachtas. That this was left aside is rather strange on the part of all Administrations. I would respect and welcome the views in this area of the university Senators. As someone who sought their support in the election to this House, I appreciate that they might not be very happy with the views I express, but I am doing it because the people have spoken and they must be listened to. I am reflecting how I, and I suspect the majority of the House, voted in that referendum.I agree with the proposal that there be regional meetings of the Seanad. Perhaps clarification can be given later in the debate on the points raised as no representative of the Government is present. From my knowledge of the Seanad and Constitution, I am not sure if we can hold plenary sessions in regional areas. For example, the Border, midlands and western regional headquarters are located in Ballaghadereen, County Roscommon. The Cabinet has met at Ballaghadereen and in other regions. The first place this Seanad should meet is Ballaghadereen, next door to the home of the well-known former legislator James Dillon.

It is a great privilege for them. I do not want to see reform as I am quite happy with their right and privilege to vote in Seanad elections. Having been an unsuccessful candidate on two previous occasions I would still prefer the vote of councillors rather than a list system. I am not in favour of a list system, not because I am afraid that I might not get on it, but because many who might deserve to be here might not get on it. Councillors, Deputies and Senators made a decision to put us here. The Taoiseach has the right to nominate 11 Senators, a right included in the Constitution by Éamon de Valera.

We do not want to see this House rejecting legislation and precipitating a general election. That would not be healthy. The quality of appointed Senators since the Constitution was enacted in 1937 has been remarkably high. They have played a very important role in this House. It is a wonderful opportunity for those who have tremendous experience to be nominated rather than having to go through the selection and election process. It is an admirable approach.I am sorry if I have been selective about the universities. Senators should remember that if we were to seek an amendment to the Constitution, the public would not be particularly interested in Seanad reform. Some might prefer abolition as it is easier to abolish things. The result of the 1979 referendum which approved an amendment to the Constitution should be honoured. I hope the university Senators understand that is the democratic right of the people. It would be impractical to review the 1937 Constitution to enact other reforms. We should be able to have reform within our institution under the Constitution. I do not recall distinguished speakers being brought to address the House when the Seanad was first formed. This is a recent innovation.I express my deep respect for the Upper House of the Oireachtas of which I am proud to have served as a Member for a short period in 1992-93. I will endeavour to fulfil my role as a Member of the Seanad. Since its birth in 1937, the Seanad has played a vital role in our political system. I am loath to make any major changes to a system that is working very well.

I am delighted with the enthusiasm of the Fianna Fáil Front Bench for the reform of the Seanad. When I listen closely, I realise it is the reform of the university constituencies about which they are concerned. I first stood for election in the early 1980s. At that time I proposed that every graduate of a third level college should have a vote in the Seanad elections. I was elected in 1987, 1989, 1992, 1997 and this year. On each occasion I have made the same proposal. Every single Member of the university panel whom I have sat with in this House has been in favour of what Senator Leyden proposed. If we are to make the House meaningful to our guests and anyone else, let us give them a vote. The difference between the university Senators and Senator Leyden is that we are prepared and want to extend the franchise to each graduate of every third level college on this island. That is our position.We want greater participation on our panel. I guarantee the Senator that no Member on his side of the House will state that the franchise on their panels should be extended. The reason is that 900 county councillors, various local authority representatives, Senators and Deputies elect 43 Members to the House. If I am correct, I have seven votes in a Seanad election. Why should I have seven votes when most members of the population have none? That is disgraceful and it is not something we should countenance.As it stands, this House is unrepresentative and undemocratic. My comments are not to be seen in any way—
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	140	It is not undemocratic.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	141	It is undemocratic because if 900 people in Albania were entitled to elect three quarters of the Members of a House of Parliament there, we would condemn such behaviour as totalitarianism – whether it arose under a dictatorship or a communist regime – and we would be right to do so.If the Senator believes my comments are focused in any way on local authority members he is wrong. Others will inform him that I defend them all the time and I am of the opinion that they do excellent work. I am utterly supportive of local authority members. I believe they are treated badly, are not afforded enough respect and are not given enough authority or adequate budgets.Let us consider the position of Senators Mansergh and Ó Murchú who were elected from the Agricultural and Cultural and Educational panels, respectively. There are two ways to be nominated to those panels, one of which, as in the case of Senator Ó Murchú, is to have one's name put forward by bodies such as Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann. I am in favour of this, but there is another way to gain entry to the panel, namely, to be nominated by four Members of this House or the Lower House. There are, therefore, two groups of people who can be nominated to the Cultural and Educational Panel. Why would it not be possible to have those nominated by Members of the Oireachtas elected by members of county councils, as is currently the case? A total of 50% of the Members of the panel would, therefore, be elected by the local authorities and there would be what I term the "distillation" of democracy which could be justified because the other 50% would be elected by properly registered members of the various nominating bodies such as Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann. In the case of the Agricultural Panel, people who were not nominated by Oireachtas Members but were put forward by the various nominating bodies would be elected by the registered members of those bodies.If we followed the approach I advocate, we would involve a huge number of ordinary people and, as a result, every fisherman or farmer would have a vote on the Agricultural Panel, every trade unionist would have a vote on the Labour Panel, etc. This would ensure that people throughout the country would be involved in electing the membership of the Seanad.Unlike many of my colleagues, I support the idea of Taoiseach's nominees. I do not want us to have, as is the case in Washington, a second House which can run into gridlock or one which can subvert the will of the people as articulated in the Lower House. The Seanad's role is one of modification, consolidation, of dealing with topical issues and of providing added value.It is important that we should extend the franchise. Everyone on the Independent benches is in favour of extending the franchise on the Universities Panel. There is no argument about that. If all that emerges from this debate is consensus about that single point I will not be surprised but I will be disappointed. I do not believe there will be any changes other than that which I have outlined.I wish to highlight a point missed by the previous speaker but which I hope others will bear in mind. It is true that it took a constitutional amendment to facilitate what I and Senator Leyden have proposed. The constitutional amendment of 1979 gave the Government power to extend the voting franchise on the Universities Panel to other colleges or universities. The position is, therefore, that what we are proposing can now be done. By couching matters in those terms, it appears we are saying that there were no constitutional amendments in respect of the other suggestions I have put forward. There is a good reason for that, namely, that constitutional amendments are not required in this regard. All that is required to extend the vote is a change in the law. Voting on to the other panels is not restricted by the Constitution in the same way it was on our panel. That is why a constitutional amendment has never been required.We are talking about giving the House relevance by extending the franchise. There are many other steps we could take, but I believe we should listen to what people have to say. It has been stated that we should seek more power or influence for the House. That is not necessary because the constitution of this House, should we choose to use it, contains enough power and influence. Any Member who wants to make a point can do so – an individual, a member of a party an Independent representative or whoever. It would be wrong for this debate to become lost in attempts to increase levels of power and authority, because they are not needed.It is correct to state that as long as people are not able to vote to elect Members of this House, they will not have the same interest in its affairs as they do in those of the Dáil. The Cultural and Educational Panel, the Agricultural Panel, the Industrial and Commercial Panel, the Administrative Panel and the Labour Panel are all representative of Irish life. Should one wish to do so, one could extend the voting franchise to every member of the population in some form or another under one of those categories. Even if one did not wish to do so and wanted to preserve the vocational nature of the electoral process by restricting it to the registered members of the nominating bodies, a huge number of people would be entitled to vote. In terms of the Labour Panel, 750,000 people would be enfranchised if the approach I have outlined was adopted. There is no difficulty in extending the franchise. It would give new life to the House and I request that it should be done.I would love to see a situation arise where farmers and fishermen would be entitled to vote on the Agricultural Panel, where musicians and teachers could vote on the Cultural and Educational Panel, etc. So much could be done, while maintaining the importance of local authority members by allowing them to elect people on the inside panel. Of the 43 elected Members of the House to whom I referred earlier, 21 or 22 would, therefore, be elected by one or other of the methods to which I refer and a further six Members would still be elected by the universities. The number of people on the register of the National University of Ireland is well over 100,000, while there are almost 50,000 people on the Trinity College register. There are approximately 150,000 people who are entitled to vote on the Universities Panel, which is quite an extensive franchise.In my opinion, it is wrong and elitist and helps to preserve a sort of cadre in society to see university graduates as being above and beyond and more important and special than other members of the population. It is open to any Member to state blithely – they are in a position to do so because they know they will not be affected – that the vote should be extended to every third level graduate. However, this merely maintains the environment of exclusivity. Why can people state so easily that the vote should be given to people who have graduated from a third level college or university, but that it should not be given to anyone else? The case must be made that there are people in every walk of life who may not have attended university but who should have an input into what we are doing in this House. I ask Members to give serious consideration to this matter. I would like to see the Seanad electoral process develop in the way I have outlined.Should the people be asked to voice their opinions on this matter? I believe they should. The Leader of the House will have to play an important role in trying to raise the stature of the House in terms of its relevancy because we are somewhat behind the game in that regard. This House was never intended to be a place where one could deal immediately with issues that might arise on a particular day. There is a difference between issues of the day and topical issues. General issues of the day should be discussed here, not issues which may arise on the morning of a sitting. That is an extremely important point.It is a special feature of this House that, although Members are divided, in the main, into party groupings, there is a less confrontational approach. There is no argument against extending the franchise in the university sector. Equally, there is no argument against widening the franchise to those who are not university graduates or Members of the Dáil or Seanad or members of local authorities. That should be taken on board in moving forward and looking at a different form of election in which the people would have an involvement and the House a greater relevance.There are other points I would like to make, but I am conscious of my time limit and have concentrated on the core issues. By extending the franchise we would also raise the involvement and interest of ordinary people. We would do ourselves a huge favour, even if this Seanad did nothing more than bring about that change. I ask for an open debate on the matter. As an indication of credibility, I suggest that Senators begin by considering what changes are appropriate in their respective electoral panels. Those who focus on one particular panel are simply taking the easy way out.

While I welcome the establishment of the sub-committee, I do not expect that very much will happen as a result. This issue has been discussed throughout the entire period of my membership of the Seanad. The same discussion takes place after every election, but nothing ever happens. There is really very little to add to what has been said, but perhaps I can make it a little more explicit. It is obviously unrealistic to expect huge changes. First, there is an element of political patronage involved. The parties dictate who will be elected, quite apart from the Taoiseach's right to nominate. We should be perfectly honest about this. It is common knowledge that the political parties issue blank nomination papers which are signed and filled in subsequently. This is freely admitted by members of political parties and a violation of democracy.

It is illegal, but members of the Senator's party have told me it happened in the last election. For example, Senator Manning was denied the opportunity to stand for re-election to this House at the behest of a non-elected cabal within the Fine Gael Party. A former Cathaoirleach who had been an unsuccessful candidate in elections for the Dáil and European Parliament was subsequently nominated to the Seanad. A Leader of the House who stood for election to the Seanad and was rejected was then nominated to this House.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	148	Yes – historically. The issues to which I have referred need to be addressed. I agree there is no argument against extending the university panels. I have previously suggested that Dublin City University and Dublin Institute of Technology should be included in the Trinity College Dublin panel and that the NUI panel should also be extended to include other relevant institutions. That would preserve the trite difference between them in so far as Trinity College has traditionally been a Dublin centred constituency and the NUI has been a somewhat more broadly based constituency. If they were all rolled into one mega-constituency of six seats and graduates of all third level institutions are enfranchised, that would involve an electorate of at least 500,000. In practical terms, how would one electioneer in that situation? Even now, there is an electorate of about 40,000 in my constituency and 120,000 in the NUI. It is very difficult to maintain contact with one's electorate, particularly in view of the extent to which people are dispersed. It is dangerous for representatives to be too far removed from their roots. I welcome the suggestion of coinciding the dates of elections.My views are not as extreme as they once were. I sometimes described this House as a retirement home for disabled politicians. However, it can be extremely useful to have the benefit of the wisdom and experience of those who have served in Cabinet. The present Leader of the House, who has had a very distinguished career, is a classic example. The House will benefit from her presence.I agree with the mechanism brought forward by Senator O'Toole in relation to the Oireachtas sub-panels, whereby 50% of the places would be filled by the more partisan vote of county councils rather than the less enfranchised members of the nominating bodies. As I have said repeatedly, the system in relation to the university seats works reasonably well because the ordinary members of the nominating bodies are enfranchised. I recall an occasion when the president of the Royal Irish Academy was nominated by the academy but did not receive a single vote. The seat was taken by a person whose claim to fame on the Cultural Panel was that he was a modest exponent of the saxophone. Such situations hold the system up to ridicule, as do the electioneering practices in which candidates have to engage.I have great friendships with colleagues in all parties and my heart bleeds for them at Seanad election time when they are sent up hill and down dale in a dreadfully demeaning search for votes. There can also be considerable danger involved, especially when elections take place in winter and candidates have to drive all over the country in a desperate effort to reach as many county councillors as possible. This is a serious concern. Senators will recall that a former Cathaoirleach of the Seanad was killed in a car accident. Having travelled in his professionally driven State car from one funeral to another, he ended up tragically at his own. That was a shocking situation. Candidates are being exposed to real hardship and danger in an electioneering system which is not based on real issues. That is regrettable.With regard to the attendance of MEPs in the House, it should be by invitation only. On the question of initiating Money Bills, I disagree with Senator Hayes. In our different ways, we are elected by the people and I do not share the Senator's hesitation. It has certain crucial effects, not just in terms of getting amendments accepted. Even when Ministers agree that amendments are good, they are still ruled out of order. I am also concerned at the exclusion of Senators from certain Oireachtas committees. I am a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, but, as a Senator, I am excluded from participation in certain matters dealt with by the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs. I regard it as a great weakness in the system.The Government should be much more flexible in accepting legislation from sources other than the Government benches. If this House is to be seen as a legislative body, it should receive proposed legislation from the Opposition parties and the Independents. I and several of my colleagues, including Senator Henry, have put legislative proposals before the House. I have clear proposals in the area of the recognition of domestic partnerships and it would be helpful, in terms of the Government's programme, if that legislation came from this House, not least from a practical point of view.In terms of the dignity of this House, it is necessary to accept legislation from sources other than the Government benches. In order to facilitate this, there should be some sifting mechanism so that the House can decide at an early stage that it is presented with a serious Bill which addresses a significant issue. Once the legislative proposal passes that hurdle, expertise should be made available to the person or group wishing to produce the Bill. As it stands, we do not have access to draftspersons and we should have such access. If we have serious proposals, we should be allowed to put them in a professional form so they can be placed before the House with some hope of success.I wish the committee well and I am glad it has been established, but I do not expect too much from it. As Senator O' Toole said, the real signal of its success will be if, instead of merely looking at the university seats which are in need of change – we are happy to run with that change – it looks at the entire system honestly and preserves what is best in it and increases its impact in all areas.

#LabhrasOMurchu	unknown-#LabhrasOMurchu-party	unknown-#LabhrasOMurchu-dob	unknown-#LabhrasOMurchu-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	151	I will come to that in a moment – this has come from Committee on Procedure and Privileges. Most importantly, it has been brought forward for early discussion. It puts down a marker for all of us to avail of the opportunity not to engage in point scoring or waste time justifying our own existence. We know there is a gap between perception and reality and we can deal with that in a positive manner. There has been an element of that in today's animated discussion but the Official Report will show that most of the time was spent on the method of election. That is important, but the question of reform is more fundamental. As far as the public is concerned, the justification for our existence is whether we have looked at the bigger picture and put the Seanad in a contemporary context rather than that of when it was first established.We must put it in the context of recapturing the character of the body politic. If there is a feeling abroad that there is something rotten in the state of politics, we must genuinely confront it in a methodical, open and radical manner. I do not accept that everything can be achieved within the current constitutional framework – we may need to be more radical. For example, I raised an issue on the Order of Business about three Irish citizens in a foreign country, in captivity and pilloried by a large section of the media. There are times that may not seem politically correct but should we always be politically correct? Are there not times when we should at least endeavour to reflect concerns, even if those concerns do not seem fashionable?I referred earlier to the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four and an Opposition Senator suggested I said something other than I did. I was saying that, as a country with a sovereign Government, we have a responsibility to our citizens when they are still regarded as innocent until proved guilty and this is a fundamental aspect of sovereignty. We saw what happened in cases I mentioned, such as the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four, the Winchester Three and the man from Clonmel who was found innocent and released three months ago having serving 27 years. His life was ruined. In another case, a young jockey is in prison in England and I have grave doubts about the trial. The view that pertained in the past that a particular justice system could not be wrong to such an extent has proved incorrect.I raised that matter on the Order of Business by coming up with a formula of words which circumvented the rules of the House. The House must address those issues on an on-going, daily basis and the regimental strait-jacket which has been handed down in an archaic fashion from one generation to the next must be shaken and the cobwebs removed.In the meantime, because we do not have the methodology or structures to enable us to respond quickly to those types of issues, we create a vacuum for the media, which fills it with sensational headlines, often with no substance. Stories gather legs and, by the time we are able to respond and react, it becomes difficult to correct the situation. That is not good for the body politic, the morale of the country or the country's interests.I could have raised many other matters on the Order of Business. I raised one regarding a terrible tragedy some years ago when a young woman was murdered and her two children drowned in a particular part of the country. Within two days, before those people were laid to rest, sections of the media speculated on the relationship between the husband and the wife. It was outrageous sensationalism. We should have been able to have informed debate to bring stability and sensitivity back into such a case. We can do that.When I first came into this House I had my own perception of what the Seanad was like. That perception has changed radically. The standard of debate, the humanity, the compassion and the lack of personality assassination have impressed me. I do not take from the Dáil but the make up of this House has enabled us to focus on the issues rather than the personalities. "Oireachtas Report" and other sections of the media have often depended on this House to bring balance back into debate. We should focus on that and with a sense of urgency assert that position by restructuring where necessary so that we can address the issues relevant to the lives of the people.On the Order of Business we discussed the need for debate on Northern Ireland. We have had numerous debates on that issue, each of which was worthwhile. I believe we made a contribution to the peace process, the fulfilment of the Good Friday Agreement and to the promotion of harmony among the different traditions of this island. We should go a step further and not just have debate in isolation from the situation in the North. When I watch debate in the Northern Ireland Assembly on television it seems like another world and I am sure that when they watch "Oireachtas Report" it must seem another world to them. Never the twain shall meet, but why not? Although it might seem anathema to us at the moment, I see no reason why there should not be regular attendance here by elected representatives from the north of Ireland to participate in discussions where we have a joint interest.We have cross-Border bodies and they work exceptionally well. For instance when the first cases of mad cow disease happened here I remember John Taylor and the Reverend Ian Paisley saying they should not be subject to the same restrictions as Britain because the cattle were Irish cattle. On numerous occasions they have gone to John Hume and MEPs from here to help and support them in the European Parliament. Why can they not come here? We are all Irish people, Republicans, Nationalists and Unionists. They should come to this House and see the incisive debate and the vision which exists for the island. They would see different views showing democracy working as it should. This is the place for them. They should not have to depend on little snatches of debate on television or in the letters column of a newspaper. Let us be radical and show them we want to be open. They could then say whatever they wish to us and we could respond. It would be done in a gentlemanly or ladylike manner. That is the opportunity we have. It is not about who elects this House but about the potential we have at our disposal.In the Nice debate 16% of people said they understood what the treaty was about. That same 16% will tell us they know nothing about the institutions of Europe. Why is that the case? Just as in the case of the North, if people see snatches about the institutions on Sky or RTE television from time to time it is like another world to them and it is left to others to look after it. When it comes to making a choice people have difficulty because all they are normally fed is some juicy gossip from Europe. Except for fundamental legislation which is changing the lives of this generation, what opportunities are there?I welcome the address to be made by President Cox, who is an excellent speaker. We will have a civilised debate here tomorrow but we need more than that. I see nothing wrong with giving MEPs the opportunity to come into the House to discuss with us what is happening in Europe. People may throw up their hands and say that is another institution but why not be radical and bring about change?We have the same situation in regard to where we stand in the world. At the first sitting of this Seanad I asked for debate on Iraq and I thank the Leader for her response on that occasion. I feel helpless and vulnerable when I hear the drums of war being beaten. I know those drums will find an echo in this country. I am not happy with the way the situation is developing, that veiled threats are being made to the United Nations by the United States, although I am pro America. I cannot be otherwise because we are like sister nations as a result of the number of Irish there. There is much more at stake however. When Madeline Albright was asked on television if she could justify the deaths of children in Iraq she said she could. Nobody can justify the unnecessary death of 500,000 children if all the outlets and opportunities of diplomacy have not been used. The United Nations has been playing on the basis of diplomacy but America has been playing on the basis of armed conflict. We need to discuss that. One might say it is the case of The Skibbereen Eagle lecturing the Tsar but it is not.An echo of what we say will always be found on the world stage. We should be saying it here and should not try to push it under the Order of Business. We should be able to debate new developments on a regular basis. We should also be able to reflect Government policy where we would have a bilateral approach. We must be able to show that the address the Minister for Foreign Affairs gave to the United Nations General Assembly on 13 September is what we believe. It was one of the best addresses I have read and it proved conclusively that we are a neutral sovereign country and that, for all the good relationship we have with America and the role we want to play among world nations, we remain sovereign. We should be able to back up the Minister's address here the same day it is given in the United Nations. On both sides of the House people would have informative contributions to make. Because that opportunity does not exist we keep an eye on the Cathaoirleach, come up with a formula of words and rush through ten sentences. The media will pick up just two of those sentences afterwards.The same is happening in regard to the Middle East. What is being done to the Palestinian State is outrageous. We have made our position as a sovereign nation clear and our Minister has done an excellent job. We should be able to back him up, particularly in this House, and take a stand on behalf of the Palestinians. At the moment we are all receiving correspondence from the Red Cross looking for contributions to alleviate suffering in what is a disaster zone. We are not able to talk about it or express ourselves because time will not be given until three weeks or two months down the road.There is a crisis in Africa, where a nation is threatened by famine and millions of people suffer from AIDS. Owners of patents for medical products will not allow them to be used to alleviate the pain of AIDS sufferers. Although we are a lucky and supposedly civilised nation, we seem prepared to stand by as millions of children and adults die.Regardless of whether we represent the Labour Party, Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil, we should stand together to address these issues. It is possible for us to revitalise and rehabilitate the body politic in this country by doing so. We could receive a level of acceptance from an increasingly cynical public, including many idealistic young people who march against globalisation. This House can give young people the guidance they seek, as no other forum seems capable of leading the way. It is in our hands.This debate should not focus on the issue of who elects whom, as greater issues are at stake. We have many opportunities at our disposal and our response is being watched. It is not a matter of justifying ourselves, but of doing what is right by the people of Ireland.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	152	I move amendment No. 1:After "brought forward" to add "and that the sub-committee first of all makes proposals which ensure that Seanad Éireann in its structures and procedures observes both the letter and the spirit of equal status legislation particularly but not exclusively with regard to discrimination on grounds of age."This amendment is being moved on behalf of Senators Ryan, O'Meara, McCarthy, McDowell and me. Senator O'Meara will speak on my amendment when she seconds it.I agree with those who mentioned the valuable role of councillors in Seanad elections, as I feel councillors are closer to the people than other public representatives. The link between the Seanad and local government is valuable and should be strengthened and used more often. The contribution of councillors from all parts of Ireland in Seanad elections gives Senators a national mandate which is important, instead of a geographical constituency base.As someone who has been elected to this House for the first time, it worked out for the best that I was unsuccessful in my attempts to be elected to the Dáil. I am pleased to have run for the Seanad and to have been elected to make a contribution to this House. It was enriching and worthwhile to meet public representatives throughout the country. All Senators fought to be elected and it is up to us to fight equally hard to be effective in the Chamber.It is important that this House is seen to be different from the Dáil. We should have a broader scope, for example. This has to be borne in mind when we consider reform, which I accept is needed. Nobody is apolitical or non-partisan. This is different from being a non-party or Independent Member. I value the role of Independent Deputies and Senators in the system. A large percentage of county councillors are not aligned to the main parties and their votes are important during Seanad elections. Reform is needed to ensure that as many people as possible are involved in electing Senators, and involved in the work of the Oireachtas. It is important to ensure that the vocational aspect of the Seanad is strengthened.Discrimination in university panels should be removed by involving institutes of technology and other educational establishments. Those who have received diplomas and certificates at third level should have the same voting rights as university graduates. Seanad reform should ensure that people cannot have two votes in Seanad elections, as local representatives and as graduates. It is unfair to allow people to vote in the same election in two different capacities.I agree with those who have argued that the role of Senators is as important as the means of election to this House. Our powers as Senators should be pushed to their limit when we reform the House, even if that requires a constitutional amendment. It is important that we have fair play in a genuinely democratic Seanad.The amendment I have proposed is intended to address the preferential treatment received in this House by the Independent group on the basis of accumulated seniority. I believe that such preferment discriminates against Senators on age grounds and is entirely contrary to the spirit of Seanad reform, which advocates new blood and wider representation. This ageist mechanism means that new Senators cannot participate as fully as more senior Senators. If such logic were extended to the Dáil, we would not have any new or young Ministers. Discrimination on the ground of age is wrong, regardless of whether it is against younger or older people.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	153	I second amendment No. 1 to this motion. I support Senator Tuffy's articulate comments and there is not much I can add to them. I hope our views will be taken on board and that our reasonable amendment will be accepted. I ask that the matter raised in the amendment be discussed by the sub-committee which is to be established by this House. I do not believe it to be an unreasonable suggestion.It strikes me as interesting that we are talking about reform of the Seanad at an early stage of the life of the new Seanad. Criticism of this House, such as that directed to its electoral process, is most often heard during Seanad elections, when an increasingly cynical media spotlight focuses on it. I hope the media's ideas will not drive the reform process to be undertaken by the sub-committee. Both new and experienced Members of this House should examine proposals for reform in an honest and open manner. I do not wish to repeat the findings of the all-party committee which examined Seanad reform, as they were discussed by the last Seanad. I urge the sub-committee, however, to examine carefully the findings of the report. A great deal of work went into the report which contains many valuable suggestions, not all of which gained the approval of Senators.One could not argue against the extension of the franchise, particularly on the university panels, as the current election process does not stand up to scrutiny in an era of widely available third level education. It is not right to exclude those who attend institutes of technology rather than universities and the rules must be changed. As there appears to be a consensus on this matter, it should be placed at the top of the agenda so it may be dealt with speedily.The extension of the franchise to graduates who have moved abroad should also be examined. While the economy has performed well in recent years, during the 1980s the vast majority of graduates emigrated, a significant number of whom have not been fortunate enough to return to Ireland. A friend of mine has resided in London for the past ten years and when I spoke to him during the summer, he considered it unreasonable that he could not vote in Seanad elections. He should have a vote, but he is no longer on the register. He also felt work needed to be done in regard to the register for the University Panel. For example, until this year, my own vote was sent to an address at which I have not resided for more than 20 years.The relevance of the vocational panels to modern society – a delicate matter – must also be examined. The panels, as constituted in the 1930s, went out of date quickly and at this remove in the new century must be examined in terms of reform. The sub-committee should examine this issue as a matter of urgency.I agree with my colleague, Senator Tuffy, in regard to the role of county councillors. The views of councillors are reflected in the House in that the Members elected by them genuinely reflect their wishes. We know from our own experience of travelling around Ireland that councillors will make their own decisions about who they want to represent them in the House.It is often remarked upon that the Seanad is used by aspiring Deputies on their way to the Dáil and retiring Deputies on their way out of the Dáil. That is a reflection of the electoral system and our political culture. Whether it is right or wrong, it is a product of our electoral system and if anything needs to be changed, it is the electoral system. The people do not wish to change the system of proportional representation in multi-seat constituencies.

I fully accept the provisions for the formation of the Seanad under the Constitution. Reform of the University Panel should also take into account graduates of the University of Limerick who are not eligible to vote. The Taoiseach's nominations should also be examined. I would like our friends in Northern Ireland to participate in the House because that is important. When the sub-committee examines reform of the House, it should take on board all the views expressed in the debate. Just as local government was reformed in the past two years, there is no doubt the Seanad should be reformed over the next five.

Usually when Seanad elections are held, certain commentators ask whether the House should be abolished. A number of journalists, for example, believe it is undemocratic, but the opposite is the case. The primary criticism regularly levelled at the House is that its Members are not directly elected by the public. I, with many other Members, was elected by county councillors who, after all, are elected by the people. Therefore, the public indirectly has a say through local authority representatives.One would often think that the Oireachtas is unique in that it comprises two Houses, but at least nine EU member states have two Houses in their legislatures and in five of them one House is not directly elected by the people. Ireland is not unique in that respect. When Éamon de Valera established the Oireachtas in 1937, he had double vision regarding the Seanad as he looked upon it as both a legislative examiner and an advisory body. Many of us will be Members for a short time and we should try to effect change in the House. I hope something tangible and concrete results from the debate on Seanad reform.Many look upon Senators as representatives of those who elect them. For example, I was elected to the Labour Panel. However, we are also expected to reflect the views of our constituents. In responding satisfactorily to our constituents we can avail of the Order of Business and the Adjournment debate, but I would like Senators to be in a position to table written questions similar to their counterparts in the Dáil on specific issues in order that we can respond effectively to our constituency duties.I was a Member of the Dáil for 13 years before I was elected to the Seanad and can compare my experience in both Houses. I was in a position to assess debates in the House when I was in the Dáil and there was a great deal of spontaneity involved. There were many good contributions. That happened because there was an absence of scripts. When I was in the Dáil, many speakers made contributions using prepared scripts lasting 20 minutes which they had not written. I regularly expected a Member to finish his or her contribution by saying "ENDS". All that mattered was the quantity, not the quality of the speech. Analysis of Dáil contributions is carried out by a Sunday newspaper every Christmas and if one was in the top ten in terms of words uttered, it looked good, but the quality of the contributions was not reflected. I agree with Deputy Deasy's comments on this issue.When the people elect an individual to Dáil Éireann, they expect him or her to be able to make a speech on the basis of notes. Many Members seek debates in the House that go on for weeks, but when one analyses the content of the debate, they contain a great deal of huffing and puffing. Contributions in the Seanad are more meaningful and spontaneous. The profile of the House would be enhanced if scripts were abolished. There may be certain circumstances in which scripts would be allowed, but the abolition of the use of scripts would be a positive step.Other aspects of the running of the House could be improved. Deputy Hayes wondered why proceedings should commence at 2.30 p.m. today while tomorrow's proceedings will conclude at 2.30 p.m. As the House normally sits two days each week, maximum use should be made of that time.The Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution made proposals it felt would improve the Seanad. Let us look at those proposals and make the Seanad a meaningful Chamber. Often Senators are disappointed when journalists call for the Seanad to be scrapped. When one considers the contributions made in this House and the interest in the media in what is happening here, it is unfair to call for its abolition without even studying its operation or content.There is merit in the Seanad as it is currently composed and, having spent 13 years in the other House, I look forward to enjoying my time here and doing my best to enhance the profile of the House and the constituency that I represent. The Seanad has a meaningful place in politics and has stood the test of time. There is nothing, however, to stop us from assessing areas in which improvements can be made.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	158	The motion calls for the establishment a sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to make proposals on Seanad reform and we have already heard many laudable suggestions in this debate. Many commentators talk about reforming the Seanad when there is not much other news. It would be presumptuous of me, as a new Senator, to speak at length about reform when I am still trying to learn the procedures followed in the House but I compliment Senator Hayes on the large number of proposals he has made.This House must respond in a relevant fashion to outside events. We must hold debates dealing with the issues of the day on a more regular basis. This debate should not degenerate into a slagging match about who was elected by councillors or by graduates; it would be regrettable if reforms dealt only with these areas.There were suggestions that the House should meet outside Dublin and if that is practical it should be done. Ballaghadereen, the headquarters of the BMW region, has been mentioned as a venue. If that were to happen, we would have to meet in Waterford, the headquarters of the south-east region.Senator O'Toole suggested that councillors should vote on the Oireachtas panels and those on the nominating bodies should vote for people working in those areas. That is worth consideration. My nominating body is the Irish Conference of Service and Professional Associations, which covers a wide range of business, service and representative associations.The level of debate in this House is very high. I have enjoyed the contributions of every Member since my election. The House has much to offer and its Members have a relevance in the State. I agree that we should establish a sub-committee and that it should report as soon as possible. The House should be reformed in some areas.

The promotion of awareness is important. Many county councillors and candidates for the Seanad were unaware of the functions of this House. If candidates do not know, what does the man in the street think are the duties of the Seanad? We must raise awareness throughout the country and we should meet in other venues. I welcome the fact that Roscommon has been mentioned as a venue.Graduates of the institutes of technology who have been left out of the franchise should have a meaningful role in the system. This is a good forum for raising issues. Today I raised decentralisation and Senator Ó Murchú raised the issue of the three Irish citizens in Colombia.One of the greatest experiences of my life was to go on a Seanad campaign. I may have had to travel 10,000 miles but I met some great people from all parties who have a sense of duty and loyalty. To discuss the meaning of politics over apple tart in a kitchen late at night was fascinating. Until the campaign I did not realise that there is a republican wing in Fine Gael.

If we cannot allow our immigrants to vote in general elections, there should be a forum in which they could be represented. I intend the Seanad to be relevant to all people and will speak on every occasion where I feel it appropriate. I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate.

I compliment the Leader of the House for initiating this debate which raises many important issues. The All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, chaired by the Leader's nephew, has produced a report which needs to be worked through, and I will talk about one or two of the matters raised.I compliment the leader of the Opposition, Senator Hayes, on an excellent speech and, though I do not agree with every single point in it, I agree with the spirit in which it was made. Within the broad framework of the party system, this House needs to be a reflective and independent voice. Irrespective of rule changes or reforms, this House will be primarily what we on all sides make it. We have people of good calibre all around and a great opportunity, and there is absolutely no shortage of great work to be done if we decide that we are going to do it.I would not go so far as to think it is practical to remove the party whip, which is of course always a seductive suggestion, when made from the Opposition benches. The party system in Ireland goes back to Parnell, and the reason it was instituted was to get things done. To achieve that you need discipline, system and organisation. The other system was tried. Isaac Butt had 40 or 50 independents each speaking their mind and voting in all directions, but it was not a very effective method.

In wishing to be relevant, we should concentrate on being thoughtful and reflective rather than go for the instant soundbites that are going to hit the "Six-one". We have a role we can exercise in depth and I see that as the priority. It is curious that there is no system of questions in this House, which is very unusual in the second houses of other legislatures. I can well imagine, as I am sure the Leader can, that, looked at from the perspective of Ministers, questions in this House are needed like a hole in the head, but it is a gap and one day a week would be quite sufficient and enable us to put down written questions. It is a serious piece missing from our armoury that we cannot do that now.There has been some discussion about the composition of the House and methods of election. The way I put it after trekking around the country and having been fortunate and honoured to get elected is that we 43 Senators from the panels are elected by the people whom the people elect. I do not accept for one instant that it is not a democratic method. It is not a direct democratic method; it is an indirect democratic method.There is much to be said for bringing in the councillors who are not included as the basis for discriminating between different sets of them is not obvious to me. I enjoyed going around the country talking to people, I was impressed by them and there is no cause whatsoever for some of the supercilious tones used here when referring to certain classes of elected representatives. We have high calibre local representatives who are very far from the caricature. They are on the ball and extraordinarily well informed.A particular reform in relation to the universities was mentioned and it is important to remember that of the people who were elected as Senators, we did not fire the first shot on this. The person who temporarily occupied the Cathaoirleach's chair at the beginning of this session let loose on the subject. A reform has been passed by the people and it is inexcusable that it has not been implemented. Without prejudice to anything else we do, I fully agree with suggestions that people from all third level institutions should be among the electorate and I pay full tribute to the contribution that has been made over the years.The point of my intervening in this debate is that there is an important section in the report referring to Northern representation in the Seanad, which in a way connects with what I have been saying about the universities. Undoubtedly, in 1937 university representation was a method perhaps more needed then than now of giving a minority a voice and my sister's godfather, Senator W.B. Stanford, fulfilled that role very well over a 25 year period.On the Order of Business the question of having a debate on Northern Ireland was raised and this is the House where we should have an institutionalised Northern voice. There have been some very good Northern voices here over the years. One thinks of people like Senators Seamus Mallon, John Ross, Gordon Wilson, Maurice Hayes, Bríd Rodgers and more besides, going back to Denis Ireland. There are many pressures on every Taoiseach, particularly in these days of coalition. It may or may not be possible for the Taoiseach to nominate individuals, which is a case for having up to four representatives from the North who are full Members of this House. I will not debate how that should be done as it is a matter for discussion in committee.The report says that the role of the Dáil and the Seanad is primarily to represent the State and its people, but there is a distinction in our Constitution between "the State" and "the Nation" and if anything it was perhaps widened in the referendum on Articles 2 and 3. In addition to representing the State we could have a role in relation to the Nation, since it is not within our power to overturn the will of the directly elected assembly of the people. In the scenario we have now where it looks as if the Northern institutions are going to break down – I hope it is not for too long – this is one formula to put forward. The ideal thing would be to have a North-South forum, but by definition if the Assembly is not sitting the basis for that forum falls away.

#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	167	It is only my third day in the Seanad, but I want to give my reaction to the proceedings. I concur with the views expressed by Senator Brian Hayes on the overuse of prepared scripts. Many of the presentations during the Nice debate lasted 15 minutes but were repetitive. People who were not here at the beginning of the debate came in and repeated what had already been said. That is disorientating. I want to make a relevant contribution. We should consider the question of lengthy prepared scripts and Members should be told not to repeat what has already been said, particularly on issues such as Nice.As an observer of the proceedings in the other House and in the Seanad on television, I do not understand why few Deputies are in the other House when the Taoiseach speaks. I am also surprised at the number of eloquent speeches here. Every speaker makes a brilliant contribution. I am a novice at public speaking, therefore I am nervous.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	168	Not a bit.
#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	169	I am an action woman rather than a public speaker. I am amazed that few people listen to one another speaking.I would have loved a full discussion today on the current crisis in Northern Ireland. Nationalists and republicans in Northern Ireland look to us to represent them. I do not agree that we cannot speak on this sensitive issue until the discussions are complete. Many of us could articulate our views about what is happening, such as the antics of the Ulster Unionist Party and the feuding among loyalists.There should be a forum where politicians and parliamentarians can give their opinions about what is happening to the Nationalist population. The Ulster Unionists demeaned the Nationalist population in Northern Ireland when they walked out last Saturday week. I was at the all-Ireland football final between Armagh and Kerry and I was amazed that David Trimble was not there. It would have been a great display of leadership if he had attended, given that his constituency includes Portadown in County Armagh.The Seanad has been in existence for the past 65 years and I am sure changes have been made during that time. However, it must be difficult to reform an institution from within. Will outside consultants be employed to consider how it should be reformed? Can people reform themselves? If one wants to become more aggressive in business, one must bring in outside people to look unemotionally at what is being done. Reform is needed. During the election campaign, some people said that the Seanad is not relevant. If people think that, it must be reformed. However, we need an international consultancy group to examine how it and its democratic representation can be improved.I do not agree with Senator Norris's flippant comments about county councillors. I loved every minute of the Seanad campaign. I loved meeting the county councillors on every boreen and road. It was a fabulous experience.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	170	I have been advised by Senator White that I should not be repetitive. I was here for most of the debate as I was in the Chair. It is worthwhile pointing out that we can watch the debate on the monitors in our offices. That gives us the opportunity to shout abuse at whoever is speaking if we do not agree with what they are saying.It is worth repeating the few points which have been made about scripts. The Standing Orders of both Houses state that Members should not speak from scripts. It was delightful to hear everyone speaking today without scripts. Scripts are a bore because I often think of better things I should have included. When I deviate from them, I usually cannot find my place again. It is better not to have them.There was great concentration on the university Senators, who everyone agreed are a delightful bunch. We have made a tremendous contribution to the House. The franchise should be extended, as provided for in the 1979 referendum, to all third level graduates. However, one problem is that if constituencies get too big, it will be impossible for Independents to service them and they could be taken over by the political parties. That would be a pity.Senator O'Toole's comments about allowing members of the nominating bodies to elect some of those on the panels are worth considering. That would not be difficult to do. Senator Ó Murchú, who spoke in Irish, said he was optimistic about the fact that we would introduce some reform. My Irish is not great but that is what I understood him to say. However, I am not quite as optimistic. Nevertheless, it is good to have a good discussion on the subject.As regards the university seats, a complaint was made about addresses not being up to date. That is the person's own fault. Each person must update his or her address with the university and ensure he or she is on the general electoral roll. One is told to check the notices in the newspapers before every election. The same applies to the university seats.I brought up on the Order of Business an issue which is dear to my heart. Reports are laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, but not a blind bit of notice is taken of them. I asked on the Order of Business that the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals be discussed. These reports have been compiled at considerable expense, time and effort since the early 1970s. Until I managed to have that report discussed here in 1995, it had not been discussed in either House of the Oireachtas.Some 30,000 people are admitted to mental hospitals every year, of whom between 2,000 and 3,000 are admitted involuntarily. It is not difficult to understand that this is an extremely important part of the health service. I do not know how many people have read the reports, but they are extremely good. Each year since then I have had to use my one Private Members' time to get the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals discussed in the House. The only exception was when Fine Gael gave me one of its slots. It has not been discussed yet in the other House. That shows how shabbily reports which are laid before both Houses are treated.I am not asking the Leader to go through the various reports of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and household budget surveys, although those could be interesting. What about the forum on fluoridation? Why can we not choose some of the important reports which have not been discussed in either House and make them the business of the House? If we do not speak for more than half an hour or everyone says they are boring, that is fine. However, perhaps they will be important issues.I would like the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals to be discussed in Government time this year before it becomes an historic document. It is a serious document. We introduced a new Mental Health Act last year, but it has not been implemented, apart from the establishment of the commission a year after the Act was passed. This is a serious area. Such reports could be discussed in the House in a non-party and non-confrontational manner. There is not a party political atmosphere in the Seanad and that is useful. Senator Finucane mentioned the different atmosphere during debates in this House. This is one of the elements I would like to see and it does not require reform. It will be necessary that we take notice, read the contents of the Order Paper and decide among ourselves which matters are important. We could then allocate 30 minutes, an hour or whatever is required to discuss them.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	171	Bhí mé ag éisteacht leis an díospóireacht, agus leis an méid a bhí le rá ag an tSeanadóir Ó Murchú, ach go háirithe. Aontaím leis. Speaking about the electoral aspect of the issue is easier than speaking about real reform and what the agenda of the House should be. Undoubtedly the Seanad is a very good forum for the scrutiny of legislation. During my first term, which was in the previous Seanad, the debates were far less partisan than they tend to be in the Dáil. As a consequence, legislation gets better and perhaps more objective scrutiny than is the case in the other House.For some time I have felt that the composition of the House needed reform. Like any institution in place for many years, the Seanad needs periodic review. As noted by Senator White, self-appraisal may not be the best route to reform. While I accept the process should start in-house, others who hold views which would enhance the deliberations of the sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges should be recruited.I assume the recent Seanad election campaign is still fresh in people's minds. It would be useful to examine aspects of that campaign. For example, the vocational panels, which no doubt served a very useful purpose in 1937, are nowhere near as relevant today as they were when the House was first established. Travelling 26 counties in the pursuit of votes may not be the most productive focus for candidates. If one abolished the panels, one could usefully examine regionalisation and I suggest the committee should consider that possibility.I do not favour completely disenfranchising councillors. Senator Brian Hayes's proposal to extend the vote in Seanad elections to town councillors as well as city and county councillors could be considered on a regional basis. I propose that some 24 Senators be elected in this fashion.I also suggest that the nominating bodies be refined, given that some of them do not exercise their right to make nominations. These bodies, rather than the Oireachtas sub-panels, should be the conduit through which people put themselves before groups of councillors. The role of the Oireachtas sub-panels in that regard should, therefore, be abolished and assumed by nominating bodies. This could correct the current position in that the various external bodies, all of which have a major contribution to make to society through their various roles, would still have a say in the composition of the membership of the House.I am reluctant to get involved in the debate on the universities as I am aware of how proprietorial Senators feel about their role. It is indefensible, however, that all graduates do not have a vote in the election of the Seanad. To some people, this may seem to reflect an element of elitism. However, over the years the contribution of the university Senators has been such that it warrants the protection and continuation of this feature of the system. I suggest we increase the number of seats on the university panel to eight and that all university graduates, including graduates of the institutes of technology, should be given the vote. I am not certain whether there should be a single panel or one which is subdivided. While I accept the truth of Senator Hayes's comment that there has been a change in the composition of the student population of Trinity College Dublin, nonetheless I am attracted to the partial retention of this feature of the system.These proposals would give us 32 Members. In addition, at least eight Senators from Northern Ireland should be elected. They should not be selected at the behest of the Taoiseach of the day or anybody else, but instead should be in the House as of right. Despite the political difficulties my proposal may present, I suggest establishing a system in Northern Ireland akin to the one we have here. This would entail local councillors in Northern Ireland electing Senators or the creation of a list system to be voted on at the time of the Assembly elections.From discussions with many unionist councillors and Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly, I am aware that for obvious political reasons they would be reluctant to expose themselves to joining the Seanad as a single unionist representative or with just one or two other members of their community. I am reasonably confident, however, that if there were sufficient numbers from the unionist tradition, say four or five, we would be successful. All of that is essential to the maturing of politics on the island as a whole. While I would obviously prefer some reciprocity in this regard, I would be inclined to facilitate the election of a certain number of Senators from Northern Ireland – perhaps eight – as of right, irrespective of whether a reciprocal arrangement was introduced in the Assembly. They have a contribution to make.Incidentally, I also propose that the 24 Members elected by local councillors, the eight from Northern Ireland and the eight from the universities serve for a fixed, five year term. I do not see any reason for the Seanad to fall when the Dáil falls. This proposal would provide a degree of continuity. The balance of Senators would then be elected at the same time as the election to the Dáil. I am putting a figure on each proposal purely to flush it out and give it a level of reality. While the figures are obviously open to change, it is important that the principle be accepted.I deny and contradict the charge often made that we are not representative of the people as a whole. Our connection with the wider public is that people who elect us have a mandate from the public. Electing 12 Members at the same time as the Dáil election would probably assist in giving the Government an in-built majority which is essential if legislation is not to be thwarted.I propose reducing the number of Taoiseach's nominees from 11 to eight. Acceptance of my proposal to have some form of direct election from Northern Ireland would make 11 nominees unnecessary. This would still leave the House with 60 Senators which is, as other Members have stated, about right. The Government would also retain its working majority.Undoubtedly, the Seanad is primarily a legislative assembly. We saw fine examples of this during my last term in the House. I have no doubt, given the level of debate both on the Nice treaty referendum and during today's debate, that we will be proud of this Seanad at the end of its term. I hope it, too, will last for five years.

#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	174	As well as its role as a legislative assembly, it is important, as many others have pointed out, to make some connection with Europe. The Seanad could play a much stronger role in scrutinising not only regulations and legislation emanating from there but the activities of the EU. I would not exclude from that Council of Ministers meetings, Commissioners' activities or the European Parliament. The Seanad could have a role whereby MEPs, as a right, would have an audience before this assembly on a regular, scheduled basis. That is important in order that parliaments not only in Ireland but in other EU countries keep themselves fully au fait  with what is happening at European Commission level.There is a deficit of information flow. In part, much of the current debate in this country is as a consequence of that. That needs to be addressed across the Union and not only in Ireland. We could be an important component of achieving that.Making contacts with other countries within the European Union is important. This will be particularly important as the Union enlarges to include 25 to 27 countries. The Leader of the House will be aware from her experience that Ministers cultivate and develop personal friendships which, in turn, translate into benefits nationally, but the Parliament could play a role in that regard. Perhaps the Seanad could on, say, a monthly basis invite a member of another European Union parliament to address it on EU issues of concern to that parliament or to us or on internal matters. If such debates were properly reported in the media, they would bridge the information deficit in this area that currently exists. That would make the structure of the European Union, which often seems remote, more relevant to people. Many people talk about Europe as if it is over there rather than appreciating that we are part of it. That type of mental approach needs to be tackled.I mentioned that we should have Senators from Northern Ireland. There should also be some formal arrangement, if possible, between the Seanad and the Northern Ireland Assembly which would enable us to have exchanges and interaction with the members of that Assembly and freely debate issues of common importance to both parts of this island.Debates on relevant issues of public importance generally arise on the Order of Business as a result of Senators having studied the headlines in the newspaper. That is not the best way to decide to the agenda for the day, but it is a great way of getting publicity, and, to an extent, we are in the business of getting that. Perhaps the statements and motions that are before the House periodically give us an opportunity to debate issues of public importance, but the Leader and the proposed sub-committee could productively examine a structured way of dealing with issues of national importance. I am not saying the headlines in the morning papers reflect the issues of national importance; often they may not bear any relevance to what is in the national interest but are designed to sell newspapers. Rather than react, we should act and lead in certain areas. That is a role we could usefully play.A hobby horse of mine is a belief that the Oireachtas should participate in inquiries to an greater extent than it does. The decision on Abbeylara is probably a setback in that regard, but we should not be deterred. The matters before the Flood tribunal needed to go through the full legal process and to be the subject of a public inquiry by way of a properly conducted tribunal. There are many other areas that effectively could be inquired into by these Houses. We could examine how that is done to good effect in other countries.There is Question Time in the Dáil, but the business of this House is structured differently. When one raises a matter of national or local importance on the Adjournment, regardless of specific points one might make in putting forward the matter, the relevant Minister gives a set reply. That almost makes the exercise useless from the point of view of extracting any information other than what it is decided should be given when the motion is tabled. That practice should be examined with a view to making the debate more meaningful. One may make pertinent points on an issue when putting forward a case, but they may not be responded to. The response given often does not answer the matter raised. The Leader and the proposed sub-committee might address that matter.The proposed sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges should consider taking on outside expertise. The former Senator Manning's name has been bandied about. He impressed during the last Seanad. There are also other people with valuable expertise.I agree with Senator White's point that self-appraisal is important to a point, but we all become a little subjective and we need to broaden the structure. We should examine best practice in other countries. If one is making a decision in business, one examines best practice elsewhere, one does not try to reinvent the wheel. We should examine best practice elsewhere and source one or two people from overseas parliaments who have done this type of reform to good effect within their jurisdiction and from whom we could usefully learn.Senator Norris and some other speakers said that we have talked about reform but have never embarked on meaningful reform. Whether one is a member of the local GAA club, soccer club or the Seanad, one should try to make a contribution to enhance the organisation of which one is a member. It falls to us as a body to do that during this term. I would like to think that we will make serious, meaningful and beneficial reforms in respect of the business activities of this House.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	175	We are off to a good start. While I have not been present in the Chamber for all the debate, I have listened to most of it. It is obvious there is a collective determination that at long last we will do our business collectively and in a consensual way, as Senator Hayes said, and that we will see Seanad reform take place during the lifetime of this Seanad, hopefully at an early stage. The fact that many people have been avidly awaiting an opportunity to contribute is an indication of the determination of all and sundry that now is the hour and this is the moment for such reform.This Chamber has a long and distinguished history. Its role is legislative and deliberative. We should not imitate the other Chamber because we have been distinctive in many ways. We have been distinctive in terms of our composition, our  modus operandi and our results. The Seanad has acquitted itself with considerable distinction over the years.I note the point made about the tyranny of the script, but any Member of this House or the other House will testify that unless one produces a script one will often not get a mention or a syllable in any of the national newspapers. That leads to another question. Why are the media not here today? I pay tribute to The Irish Times, the only newspaper which covers, albeit in a very truncated fashion, the deliberations of this House. We should seek more publicity and try to meet with editors to secure more meaningful, comprehensive and fair coverage of the deliberations of this House.The issue of panels has been raised. The qualification requirements for the panels is that one must have knowledge of and experience of agriculture; knowledge of and experience of administration; knowledge of and experience of industry and commerce; knowledge of and experience of culture and education; knowledge of and practical experience of labour. Many would testify, following scrutiny of the qualifications, that there are people on all panels who do not necessarily meet the spirit of the initial legislation as drafted. Many people do not have knowledge of or practical experience of the particular vocational sector they represent. A good example is the Labour Panel where, up to now, the rigors for qualification were quite stringent. In the wake of the general election, there was a court challenge by Kathryn Sinnott regarding her qualifications for the Labour Panel. I do not wish in any way to disparage or denigrate her qualifications but looking at the court judgment in the context of the rigorous scrutiny of qualifications for the Labour Panel up to then, it is obvious the Labour Panel has been thrown wide open. We need to look, in committee, at the vocational sectors we are supposed to represent.I have advocated the opening up of the university seats for a considerable time. When we spoke about reform during our first day back in session I was amused by a university Senator, who shall remain nameless – he is a former member of our party – who was extremely open-minded and receptive to the idea of opening up the university panels. I distinctly remember, as education spokesperson, drafting a short Private Members' Bill in that regard. The Senator in question took considerable umbrage at the fact that we seemed to be taking away, opening up or making more democratic the university panels.

Let us take Dublin City University and Limerick City University as an example. They are two top universities, formerly NIHEs, which hit the ground running and set such a standard that traditional universities were left floundering in their wake and had to change the manner in which they conducted their affairs. Limerick City University, DCU and the Sligo Institute of Technology should be included.I concur with the role of councillors and the acknowledgement by everybody here of that role. We do not do so to curry favour with them. They play a very valuable and completely under-estimated and under-rated role. Their superb work is largely unrecognised and was, until recently, financially unrewarded. I pay tribute to the previous Minister for the Environment and Local Government for acknowledging the role of councillors. The issue of providing pensions for councillors has been raised. Why not? These people are filling a very valuable democratic role at local level. All politics is local and should be acknowledged in tangible terms.One of the hang-ups I have is the failure by some committees to acknowledge this Chamber. The Committee of Public Accounts does tremendously valuable work in holding to account the various institutions of the State regarding efficiency of public spending. Members of this House should be appointed to that committee and the foreign affairs committee. Senators serve on the Council of Europe, which consists of over 40 states, many of which are potential EU accession countries. Others will never accede to the EU. The Council is at least a forum where people are pooling their ideas on an international basis. Often it debates unrecognised but important topics. Only two weeks ago, the Council of Europe held a very invigorating debate on Iraq. Why should not Members of this House, serving on the Council of Europe, be automatically ex officio members of the foreign affairs and European affairs committees?Senator Browne touched on the issue of questions. Senator O'Rourke can testify to the fact that Question Time can be very taxing. I am not suggesting that we haul Ministers in here to answer questions. The sub-committee on Seanad reform should look at the possibility of introducing a system whereby Senators could raise matters by way of written questions. I availed of the procedure for written questions on a regular basis. It can be a very valuable device for prising out information and using it.It is right that the discussion on how we go about our business should commence in this House. It will finish in this House also because whatever report eventually emanates will come back here for final ratification. I agree with Senator Browne that we will not be able to do this on our own. We should bring in outside expertise. I would go further and suggest we hold public hearings. We should advertise our existence and our purpose and invite in various interest groups who might feel they are not represented by a particular panel.

Successive Taoisigh have, generally speaking, used their 11 nominations discerningly in terms of bringing together both sides of the community in Northern Ireland – people with particular cultural and artistic backgrounds – in order to infuse different viewpoints and degrees of expertise to the debates here. I am at a loss to know why all Taoisigh have failed to recognise the existence of Irish communities overseas.

#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	184	I move:That Seanad Éireann, conscious of the promises made by Government parties in the general election campaign that no cutbacks in public services were planned, condemns the Minister for Education and Science for increasing third level registration fees by 70%; slashing by €11 million initiatives to tackle school drop out rates; reducing by €6 million information technology development; reducing the teacher training budget by €6 million; failing properly to fund existing policy in the area of adult education; and, in view of the confusion surrounding recent comments made by the Minister on the future of free third level fees, calls on the Government to support unequivocally the principle of free tuition fees in primary, secondary and third level education.I welcome the Minister on his first formal visit to the Seanad. The amendment proposed by the Government side in no way gives a clear and unequivocal guarantee that we will have free primary, secondary and third level education in the future.The Minister made many hasty decisions in his previous ministry during the term of the last Government. I suppose he regretted them afterwards when he had time to mull over them. In five months the Minister has outdone his predecessor, whose record was fairly dismal regarding education. He was passive and lackadaisical. As Minister, Deputy Woods brought parents of seriously physically handicapped children through the courts in order to deny them their entitlements to educational services and the right to further their education. Is it not odd that today in Limerick there is a 13 year old autistic boy retained in an adult psychiatric unit? It is an indictment on the Minister that he cannot provide a full-time place for that boy where he will be looked after and provided with the proper facilities to which he is entitled.The former Minister, Deputy Woods, destroyed the morale of secondary level teachers, particularly members of the ASTI. That litany goes on and on. The current Minister has, in five months, surpassed what Deputy Woods did. His first strike was to increase college registration fees to €670. That came immediately prior to admission and many students had in no way prepared themselves for such a shock, nor had their parents. It is an unfair burden to ask any parent to bear. Many of them are at their wits end in trying to provide funding for their children's college education. The Government had not shown that it intended to increase the maintenance grant by such a derisory amount – 4% on a previously totally inadequate grant.With the aid and assistance of his spin doctors, the Minister said he would be the pioneer for people who were denied access to third level education because of their disadvantaged status. What did he do? In one fell swoop he substantially reduced the funding that had been made available to provide that access. It was another U-turn, a deceitful move by the Government, consistent with what it has done since it was returned to office.The Minister said that we will have a full review of the reintroduction of third level fees. He cynically said that hours after the media carried a statement from the heads of third level institutions on the origins of many of their students. That was a misleading article. The statistics, and the deductions made from them, were latched on to by the Minister in a way which misrepresented the truth. It is odd the Minister has allies in the president of UCD, Dr. Cosgrove, the provost of Trinity College and the president of NUI Maynooth. Why have they allied themselves with the Minister's notion? The Taoiseach and Tánaiste recently disowned this – the Minister is going one way while they are going another. One wonders if it is a decoy intended to soften public outrage. The Minister has experienced public outrage, which was unfortunate and unsightly to say the least. He brought it on himself through his indecision and his U-turns.Does this Government have an educational policy? Does it have any targets, goals or sense of direction about where it is going? The Minister has often said that we value education. If that is the way he values education I shudder to think what is down the road and what students, parents and the disadvantaged will have to encounter under his stewardship.We claim to be one of the richest countries in the world, but we have one of the lowest rates of investment in education in the OECD. How can the Minister reconcile that? He can, of course, call in the spin doctors to assist him but, unfortunately, they may also get him into a troublesome situation from which he would find it difficult to extricate himself.I ask the Minister to exercise more caution and move with less haste. As Minister for the Environment and Local Government, he walked away from various muddles he created in terms of the waste strategy and in the area of planning. It emerged today that the social housing scheme he put in place in the Department of the Environment and Local Government is to be dispensed with. Will the decisions he is making now in respect of education be dispensed with in the future? The area of education cannot afford that luxury because we are dependent upon it to provide members of the workforce, on which we pride ourselves so much. If the Minister moved with less haste, he might not be undermined as often as has been the case heretofore and by no lesser persons than the Taoiseach and Tánaiste.The Minister's record to date shows that he has constantly been bushwhacked by his superiors. I therefore appeal to him to clarify this evening his intentions with regard to the reintroduction of third level fees, access for the disadvantaged – which he has crucially and cruelly reduced – the level of compensation he intends to provide to hard-pressed students in respect of the €670 registration fee and the inadequacy of maintenance grants.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	185	I thank the Minister for being in attendance because there are a few pertinent points I wish to make and I have a number of questions which he might answer.Before dealing with the substance of the motion – I thank Senator Ulick Burke for introducing it – I wish to discuss my experiences in the field of pedagogy. I had the opportunity to work in both the formal and non-formal sectors of education. I worked in a secondary school and as a community development worker and I believe I can empathise with the people who work in these areas.We must consider the holistic aspects of education before we attempt to make decisions. As Senator Burke stated, we must exercise caution and take time in this regard. We must look at the bedrock of the education system which, on a positive note, rests in the area of family support. This is a non-tangible aspect of the education system and comes in the form of parents who help their children with homework, who take time out to serve on boards of management and who volunteer to help with sporting organisations. In addition, there are teachers who voluntarily involve themselves in extracurricular activities. The assistance these people provide is a massive and positive component of the education system.Problems have arisen in education in the past ten years and I wish to refer to a number of them. Income limits for receipt of grants are far too low. I will provide an example of this. A mother with whom I am familiar is a teacher – sometimes when we categorise teachers we forget many of them are also parents – who job shares and she is not allowed to obtain a grant for both of her children who are attending courses in Northern Ireland because of her income limit. In addition, she will not receive compensation for registration fees because they are attending colleges in the North. We are talking here about a parent, who is also a teacher, being discriminated against because she happens to be in the PAYE middle income category. I suggest that net rather than gross income should be taken into consideration.As a representative from Donegal, I believe the people in my county are being discriminated against. I am familiar with a great institution called Magee College in Derry. In my view the Government is not providing incentives to subsidise students from Donegal who want to attend third level institutions in the North, be it Jordanstown or Queen's in Belfast or Magee College in Derry. If we are wholeheartedly committed to the idea of North-South co-operation and fostering an atmosphere of unity between people on this island, we must give greater consideration to using our education system to build bridges between Northern Ireland and the Republic.At present, applicants cannot be assessed on their own income until they are 23 years of age. That is disgraceful. Young independent mothers aged between 18 and 21 years who may have two or three children are still means tested on the basis of their parents' income. These young female adults may have been independent from the age of 16 and there is something wrong with the way they are being treated.Grants are not payable in respect of post graduate study outside the Irish Republic or Northern Ireland. The level of these grants is too low. For people living in Donegal or other Border counties, the position is made worse by the rate of exchange vis-à-vis sterling. In addition, applicants are of the opinion that the grant application process is in no way user-friendly.I have highlighted the positive and negative aspects of the system and I will now deal with the substance of the motion. Confidence in the education system is being eroded and parents and teachers, who motivate our young people, will withdraw their voluntary services if this continues. Senator Ulick Burke referred to morale among teachers and if one visits any school staff room in Ireland, one will be presented with the same theme, namely, we were let down by the ASTI which did not do its homework. I believe that is letting the Government off the hook.We must consider the position in which teachers and parents find themselves and also look at the state of the education system. Increasing third level registration fees by 70% and slashing by €11 million initiatives to tackle school drop out rates will undermine the work that has been done in the area of education during the past 30 to 40 years. As a citizen, a representative from Donegal and a person who has worked in both the formal and non-formal sectors of education, I believe teachers, parents and students have been let down to a great degree and I beg the Minister to exercise caution and take heed because we need to examine this matter in a constructive and comprehensive manner.

Tá mé lán cinnte go n-éireoidh go geal leis sna deacrachtaí agus dúshláin atá os a chomhair.Over the past five years, there has been a spectacular increase in education provision, as the following figures will illustrate. Gross funding has almost doubled in the education sector – the actual increase is 87%. In the same period, capital expenditure has increased almost fourfold. Those are spectacular achievements by any yardstick and provide an irrefutable statement of the Government's commitment to the vital role of education in the development of our economy and the welfare of our people. The education landscape has been transformed over that period in all areas and at all levels. I realise that such facts are not very palatable for people who do not wish to hear them.

I take on board some of the points made by Senator Burke and I welcome some of Senator McHugh's sentiments, which indicate a clear understanding of the huge anomalies in the area of grants and maintenance funding for third level education. In relation to Senator Burke's comments, the outstanding legacy of this Minister is one of substance, not of spin. I am happy to acknowledge this on his first visit to Seanad Éireann as Minister for Education and Science.I wish to explode the myth of cutbacks in education. There are no cutbacks, on any honest assessment based on the simplest arithmetic. Those who do not wish to use plain, simple arithmetic may wish to seek help elsewhere. The expenditure by this Minister, following on from what has been achieved over the last five years, will not be one cent less than was allocated at the start of the year. If there are individual interpretations of cutbacks, I respectfully refer those concerned to the Oxford dictionary or its equivalent in the economic sciences.

The expenditure will also include €320 million in third level student support.The Government is committed to tackling disadvantage and has a proud record of achievement in that regard over the last five years. I know this Minister will be very happy to be judged on his record when he leaves office in five years time.Between 1997 and 2002, nearly 19,000 additional student places were created. That may not be very significant to some people but it is very significant to the 19,000 people who secured those places in full-time third level education and enrolment for part-time study, which increased by 41%. There was increased support for third level access, an issue which has been the subject of misguided and inaccurate comment in the media in recent weeks. The figure increased from €500,000 to €24 million in the current budget, an increase of 4,700%. A top-up maintenance grant for disadvantaged students was introduced, with a higher rate of grant set at €4,000 in 2002, and the income threshold was increased by 32%.In isolation, that is not enough as the Minister would be the first to acknowledge. Maintenance grants for PLC students were introduced at a cost of over €12 million this year. Over 6,000 teacher training places have been created and the Government has brought the pupil-teacher ratio down to 19:1 at primary level and, effectively, 14:1 at secondary level, although in the latter case it may be 16:1 or 17:1 at recruitment level. That is the single most important criterion used by educationalists over many decades as a measure of equality of opportunity in education. We are very proud of the significant progress in that area.In the area of disadvantage, to which Senator Burke asked me to refer, the programmes are so wide, multi-faceted and holistic in their approach that I can only sketch them briefly in the limited time available to me. We have targeted an extensive programme of initiatives which have been funded and put in place for early school leavers. The establishment of the Education Welfare Board has been a landmark development which is particularly appreciated by those of us who practised in education in the 1960s and 1970s and observed the inadequate system of school attendance officers then in place. The current holistic approach in this matter is backed up by many other initiatives.In relation to technology, there have been many plaudits over the past five years from the captains of industry and the heads of universities.

I always found him to be a bright, honourable and courageous Minister and admired some the decisions he made in the last Government, many of which he was not allowed to implement. On this occasion however, he is making a grave mistake.The Government's planned multi-million euro savaging of the Department of Education and Science's budget can be generalised in one term – cutbacks, although Senator Fitzpatrick claims they are not cutbacks. He described himself as vulnerable, but the real vulnerable people are in our towns, cities and rural areas. Pupils and teachers will be affected by these swingeing cuts and the ones most at risk are those in disadvantaged circumstances. Many in the teaching profession have, for many years, highlighted this critical problem and we must protect them. The horrific litany of cuts from the Department's budget includes €6 million from in-service training, €6.2 million from IT research and development, €5 million from structural reform of the Department, €2 million from the second level building programme and a further €1.3 million in miscellaneous cutbacks.There is a school in Elphin, County Roscommon awaiting an extension – a college which reflects all that is admired in the education system – with enthusiastic and diligent pupils, dedicated and professional teachers and a proud and hard-working parents association. Is the Minister telling us that the people concerned are not worried about cutbacks? They want funding to ensure their extension is built. This case is replicated throughout the county and nationwide. I have no doubt the Department will hold back some of the funding.The danger is that cutbacks hit the marginalised hardest. Recent reports indicate that the Celtic tiger economy has not bestowed its benefits equally and that the gap between rich and poor is wider than ever – this is true of the education sector too. Unless we fund education to the maximum level, we will not have the education system we deserve. It is imperative the Department recognises the folly of its ways in restricting these vital educational routes and allows everyone participate in the education system and be offered the resources to best fulfil their talents and skills for their individual development and the development of the State.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	195	I congratulate the Minister on his appointment. I have great respect for his achievements in other Departments and have no doubt he will bring the same spirit of innovation and courage to this Department and make his mark in an area where innovation is much needed.I regard education, with health and basic income maintenance, as being the highest priority as far as Government expenditure is concerned. During the general election campaign the most important and frequent issues I encountered concerned education.Some 40, 50 or 60 years ago we had a spartan education system and some of the buildings from that era are very cramped, particularly where schools are eligible for additional staff. That is a priority. There is a brand new school in Ballyclerihan near Clonmel where the population is exploding. The school has fine facilities, but the problem is that the population is doubling and trebling practically every year. Improving the fabric of schools with as much money as possible is investment that will not be wasted, although I appreciate the Minister has his arguments with the Minister for Finance.I do not pay much attention to hyperbole about savage cutbacks because every mid-year there are adjustments in expenditure. There are some underspends, but normally more overspends and adjustments must be made as a result. I appreciate that the Opposition feels the need to get its teeth into the Government, but the savagery seems to be totally over the top.Adult education is vitally important. My sister recently returned from teaching maths in England to the Dublin Institute of Technology and observed that one of the biggest differences between the higher education systems was the greater number of mature students in England. This deficit needs to be addressed as a matter of priority. I applaud the Minister's determination to give educational disadvantage top priority.There has been debate and controversy regarding third level fees. When they were removed in 1996, the Minister at the time thought it was the right thing to do and thought she was emulating Donogh O' Malley, but there was also a strong political motive in that the Labour Party wanted to secure the middle class vote. There was much criticism, not least from the Fianna Fáil benches, on the equity of the provision and concern that it would not improve access for the disadvantaged. However, time passes and, at the time, the unemployment rate was 10% or 11% whereas today it is 4%.When fees were reintroduced across the water, it seems to have discouraged many from going to college and many of those who went seem to have built up horrendous debts. There is merit in abstracto of devoting one's resources to maintenance. As the Minister said, the very wealthy can afford to bear it as they do in the United States, but, in practice, if fees were reintroduced, the threshold would be far below that of the very wealthy. As I know myself, even if one is relatively well paid, if one has several children going to college over a period of time, it is a huge strain on finances. The Taoiseach and Tánaiste have taken positions on the matter, but when one is debating it, one must examine the potential impact on attendance at university.I do not know how much the reintroduction of fees would improve access for the disadvantaged but more needs to done in this area because, between the universities and the State, we have not yet devised a system whereby those from the lower socio-economic groups can access third level education. I applaud the Minister's determination to reflect on this and try and do something meaningful within the limits of the resources at his disposal.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	196	I join other Members in welcoming the Minister for Education and Science to the Seanad. In my dealings with him as Minister for the Environment and Local Government I found him a good listener. At times he had a change of mind and I hope he changes his mind in regard to his proposed cutbacks in education.Our education system has been successful at producing well-qualified young people. Much of our prosperity over the last decade can be attributed to this skilled and educated workforce. What effect will the increase in registration fees have on our students? The cost of putting a child through third level education is huge. The cost of accommodation and living expenses since the withdrawal of fees has increased hugely and places a great burden on families, especially parents. All parents want their children, if they have the ability, to get well-paid jobs. However, the increase in fees just places another burden on them This burden is especially felt by families which have two or more children attending college. No student should have to leave college because of an undue financial burden. An investment in education will always be of benefit to the State and society.It is ironic to consider that we have built our success as an economy on having a highly skilled and educated workforce, but now the Government is attacking the future source of a skilled labour force because it got the figures wrong in the last budget and increased spending at a higher level than possible. At the same time as increasing fees, the Government is attacking the areas where most investment should be placed. Young people are dropping out of school without completing their formal education and we are all aware of the social problems this has caused to certain sections of the community. It is important that we invest in the future of all, especially those who come from a background where extra help is needed. Otherwise, as experience shows, it leads to problems in other areas for the State. This cutback shows the extreme short-sightedness of the Government.We all accept that the Government has overspent this year and there is a need for cutbacks to ensure the financial health of the State. However, where were the increases spent? I do not see any major improvements in any area of Government expenditure. Where have the increases on education been spent? Has all the money expended already been spent efficiently and effectively?Parents want to ensure that their children get a good education. At the same time they want to ensure that their taxes are spent well by the Government. Recently I heard on "Today with Pat Kenny" an angry parent, from Meath, complaining that, on the Wednesday before the Nice referendum, the primary school his child attends will close for a teachers' training day and will close again on Friday to prepare for the referendum as the school is used for polling. Is this an effective use of taxpayers' money? Is the school or the Department effective in ensuring reduced disruption to children's education? People are angry because they have seen an extra 20% of their money spent this year, but the level of service has not increased by an equal amount. Then, when the Government gets its sums wrong and tries to correct the problem, it attacks the people who have paid most already – the taxpayer and the most vulnerable in society who may not be in a position to voice their opposition.As the Government introduces cutbacks to the education budget, is it still considering buying a new Government jet? Earlier in the summer there was talk of a new jet being needed. Has this idea been shelved?

Ba mhaith liom mo chomhghairdeas a ghabháil leis an gCathaoirleach agus le gach Seanadóir as ucht bheith tofa mar Sheanadóir.I thank the Fine Gael Members for putting down this motion. It is clear from their contributions so far that they need to be brought up to date on what is happening in education because they are misinformed. Senator Burke mentioned my spin doctors. They are obviously not doing a good job since he managed to get everything so wrong. As Senator Fitzgerald pointed out, there are no cutbacks in education. There is no withdrawal of services, no course that was due to take place has been withdrawn, no teacher has been sacked, no pupil has been removed from a school and no disadvantage scheme has been cut in any way. Adjustments, as happen during the course of any year, have been made. Nobody would want me to leave money sitting in the education budget unspent or to hand it back to the Minister for Finance at the end of the year. I intend to spend every cent that was allocated to the education budget before the end of the year. I will not leave money lying around, particularly money that is going towards tackling disadvantage.I am delighted that we are having this debate. During the three and a half of the months I have been Minister for Education and Science we have debated disadvantage and unfairness in the system. It has been about people who have been able to buy their way into the system, retain places and get an advantage. People have talked a lot about those who cannot get access to primary, second level and in particular third level education. If I have done nothing else I have started a debate on educational disadvantage. When was the last time there was debate in either House about educational disadvantage? I intend to ensure the debate on the problems we face on education, and those of people from less well off backgrounds, continues. In the past we have not had the courage to stand up and take a look at things that have been taken for granted.Senators on the Opposition side talked about problems with maintenance grants and money. I work in the real world and we must all work there. There are limits to the amount of finance any Minister or Government can get. We have to spend the money available to best effect. I will put as much of the money as I can into tackling disadvantage. I hope everybody who wants improvements in education and the tackling of disadvantage will back the moves and will not support the vested interests that have held us back, ensured that changes cannot occur and hindered those at the bottom of the education pile. Those who are excluded will remain so if public representatives do not make courageous and positive decisions.I ask Senators who believe that the third level education of the very wealthy should be subsidised to make clear their feelings. If we adopt such a policy, however, it will be at the expense of those who may not reach second level education and who do not have a hope of seeing the inside of a university or a third level institute. It is time to call a spade a spade in relation to these matters.Senator Ulick Burke said that I had to withdraw certain plans when I was Minister for the Environment and Local Government and suggested that I would have to back down again. I do not think my record was as bad as he seemed to suggest.

I ask them not to conceal the nature of their opposition to my proposals or attempt to dress up their affection for vested interests and the wealthy as concern for students.Senator Fitzgerald spoke of the Government's record. I am sure he does not need to be reminded that the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government increased gross funding for education by 87%, the largest increase in this country's history. The money has been well spent, by and large, but I am keen that we re-examine the allocation of funds for tackling educational disadvantage. The massive sum of €5.5 billion will be spent in 2002. I welcome the fact that Senator McHugh agrees that we should review how €350 million per annum is allocated for student supports. I intend to examine how this funding can be used to help those on the margins of the income limits, such as those excluded because their income is slightly more than €21,000 per year. I agree that these income limits are too low, but I have just €350 million to spend in this area. I will lobby for extra money, but adjustments will still have to be made.

The Government's record in this regard since 1997 has been outstanding: full-time student numbers at third level exceeded 126,000 in the 2000-01 academic year.

Departmental expenditure on access measures to tackle disadvantage at third level has increased from €508,000 in 1997 to €24 million in 2002. I ask Fine Gael and Labour Senators to consider this statistic as an indicator of the performance of their parties while in power. In addition to increasing allocations for the fund for students with disabilities and the student assistance access fund, new measures have been introduced following the report of the action group on access to third level education. The group's most significant recommendation concerned the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, commonly referred to as "top-up" grants. These recommendations were acted on without delay and were introduced with retrospective effect from the 2000-01 academic year. The annual income threshold for the special rates was increased by 32% and the special rate of grant for students residing more than 15 miles from college was increased to €4,000. It is expected that the number of students qualifying for the "top-up" grant in 2002-03 will double to 7,000 and I hope that figure will increase substantially during the next four years.The action group's recommendation of a new millennium partnership fund for disadvantage, providing assistance to partnership companies and community groups, was implemented with effect from the 2001-02 academic year. The total allocation for the 2001-02 academic year was €1.2 million, with 37 partnerships and community groups receiving money. The allocation for the fund will be increased to €2 million in 2002. The Government introduced a maintenance grant scheme for students on post-leaving certificate courses, which is expected to cost over €12 million in 2002. Since the 1999-2000 academic year, the higher, non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable to all eligible mature students. In 2000-01, an access officer post was established in each institute of technology to enhance access by disadvantaged students, putting the institutes on a par with the university sector.I wish to make clear that students who are eligible for means tested student support will not have to pay the €670 charge levied by third level institutions to defray the costs of registration, examinations and student services, as it will be paid on their behalf by my Department or through local authorities and vocational education committees. This means that at least 37% of students in universities and 47% of students in institutes of technology will not have to pay the charge. The increase in the charge must be viewed in the context of the overall package of measures I announced earlier this year, aimed at increasing and improving student support schemes for the 2002-03 academic year. The Government will spend €370 million on student supports, including free fees, in 2002. The measures announced are a clear indication of the Government's commitment to enhancing access to third level education.Since my appointment as Minister for Education and Science, I have made clear at every opportunity that addressing educational disadvantage is one of my priorities.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	207	Our overall approach to tackling educational disadvantage has been framed within the context of the national anti-poverty strategy. The NAPS approach is based on continuum of provision from early childhood though adulthood, with a focus on preventive strategies, targeting and integrated community responses. Challenging and ambitious targets have been set under the key headings of school literacy, adult literacy and school retention, designed to bring about an education system which allows all citizens to realise their full potential.The strategies and programmes being implemented to achieve the NAPS targets will build on the comprehensive range of measures put in place to counter educational disadvantage. At school level these include the Early Start programme, which will receive €4 million this year, and the Giving Children an Even Break programme, which involves a targeted support package for disadvantaged children at primary level. The latter scheme applies to 2,320 schools, includes the appointment of over 200 additional teachers and will ensure that the maximum class size in junior classes in designated disadvantaged schools will be 20. The expenditure for this programme, combined with the resources dedicated to the Breaking the Cycle project in 2002, the support teacher project and the disadvantaged areas scheme, will be about €36.7 million.The early school leaver programme at primary level and the stay in school retention initiative at second level have been merged into an integrated School Completion Programme, involving in excess of 370 primary and post primary schools in 82 clusters and with a budget in 2002 of about €15.4 million. The National Educational Welfare Board was established with a budget of €4.3 million to promote regular school attendance. A wide range of other schemes and initiatives, including those for children of Travellers, non-nationals and other vulnerable groups, has been established to complete a huge programme aimed at tackling disadvantage in our schools.The total intake of colleges of education for primary teaching in the 2001-02 academic year was a massive 1,461. This was made up of 1,000 students on the three year undergraduate course and 461 students on the 18 month postgraduate course, which commenced in February 2002. This was the highest ever intake and compares with an intake of only 500 in the 1996-97 academic year under the rainbow coalition, which slashed teaching places. We are suffering as a result of that short-sighted decision. The Government is repairing the damage by making record numbers of places available in primary teaching. There was a total of 3,741 students in the teacher training colleges in the 2001-02 academic year – 3,000 on the undergraduate course, 280 on an existing postgraduate course and 461 on the new postgraduate course. A total of 1,280 primary teachers graduated in 2002.I refer to adult education which provides a second chance to people. The White Paper on Adult Education, Learning for Life, is the basis of Government policy. There has been a significant increase in investment in adult literacy to a total of €2.9 million to maintain expansion of the scale, scope and quality of provision, including the use of television to reach people in their homes. In addition, 6,000 part-time places were provided under the back-to-education initiative, beginning this year at a cost of €6.31 million with a full year cost of more than €17 million. This represents the largest increase ever provided in further education and is designed to promote increased flexibility and responsiveness of the system for those with less than upper second level education.The National Adult Learning Council has been established and a network of community education facilitators put in place. They will support the development of community education models and help community and voluntary groups to access funding. A third phase in the expansion of the adult educational guidance service is under way with a view to providing a service, at this stage, in 26 areas.These measures are in addition to the continued provision of some 3,800 Youthreach and Traveller training places for early school leavers, 5,700 VTOS places for the unemployed, more than 27,000 post-leaving certificate places, and 22,700 adult literacy places. Given all these developments, it will be clear that, not alone have I continued to fund existing provision in adult education, but have provided for major increases and enhancements to widen access and increase participation in this area.The level of teaching resources has been increased dramatically with the continuing support provided by the Government. More than 3,000 additional teaching posts have been created since 1997 – 1,855 at primary level and 1,225 at second level. This has led to a significant reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio. If one compares 1989, 1998 and 2001, there has been a dramatic improvement from 27:1 in 1989, 21:1 in 1998, decreasing to 19:1 in 2001 at primary level. The figures also show a substantial improvement at second level from 17:1 in 1991,15:1 in 1998 and down to 13.9:1 in 2001.The Government has also made huge strides in the area of school funding. At primary level the capitation grant was increased from €57 in 1997 to €101 in 2002 and grant assistance for secretarial and caretaker services was doubled in 2001 to €102 per pupil. In addition, a grants scheme for minor capital works has been introduced, with expenditure in 2001 in excess of €33 million. At second level the capitation grant has been increased from €224 in 1997 to €266 in 2002. In addition, the second level support service grant was increased from €25 to €99 in 2001-02 and the annual minimum grant for smaller schools was increased from €5,078 to €19,087, which will provide support for the school development planning process.With regard to school infrastructure, a major investment programme is currently under way to upgrade primary and post-primary school buildings right around the country. Expenditure on school buildings has risen almost fourfold from €124 million in 1997 to €608 million in the 2002. More than 850 primary and secondary level school projects are being processed by the Department.

In addition, public-private partnership contracts have been concluded for the provision of five new state-of-the-art post-primary schools catering for 3,500 students. These schools are located at Tubbercurry, Ballincollig, Clones, Dunmanway and Shannon. The schools in Dunmanway and Shannon will be ready to open by the end of 2002.Given this unprecedented level of commitment to both capital and current investment at all levels of education, I am bound to reiterate what I have said previously about the provision for education in the current financial year. Expenditure on education services this year will not be one cent less than the amount provided for in the 2002 budget. What will change is the distribution of the budget over expenditure areas, mainly because some programmes have developed at a faster pace than expected while others have been somewhat slower, primarily because of the need to ensure good planning and effective implementation.The Government's track record in education is second to none. We will continue to invest heavily in education. We will continue to invest in our children's futures. We will continue to ensure we have a workforce that is highly skilled and adaptable to change. In doing so, we are committed to ensuring everyone, whatever his or her social or economic circumstances, has an equal opportunity to participate fully in education at all levels. I commend the amendment to the House. I thank Fine Gael Members for giving me the opportunity to outline the extensive education programme we have in place.

#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	211	I welcome the Minister to the House. He is as committed to his task as he was in his previous Department. He is welcome to set out the great achievements of the previous Government in education, but it would have been sad if, during what the Taoiseach described as one of the golden ages of Ireland, there had not been increased investment in education at a time of unprecedented prosperity. It has been pointed out by Ministers and others that our great prosperity was due to our efforts to educate many, particularly at third level.I attended third level when less than 10% of those who completed second level managed to continue their education whereas nowadays almost 50% of students who complete second level take up a third level place. There has been a dramatic increase in the uptake of third level places. Sometimes we are apt to forget that primary and secondary education is extraordinarily important also because one cannot reach third level without completing these levels. I am glad the Minister concentrated on both.There has been a great deal of upset within universities, particularly among students, about the possibility of reintroducing third level fees. Perhaps the Minister was thinking out loud when he raised this. When fees were abolished by the then Minister for Education, Niamh Breathnach, universities were less than enthusiastic because they could see that they would not be in a position to increase fees as they would be beholden to the Government. This is what transpired and there is a considerable shortfall in many disciplines because the fees support provided by the Government for third level institutions has remained static. This has resulted in an increase in the number of students at lectures and a reduction in the number of staff employed while certain posts have been frozen until funding can be provided to fill them.It is not just the rich who will have to pay if third level fees are reintroduced. Previously, someone who was not rich but certainly not poor with three children in third level education at the same time found it very difficult. To keep up with international standards many students have to pursue postgraduate study. These studies are not just of advantage to the students involved, they are also of advantage to all of us because we must produce the types of people we need to work in our industries. Education is not just of benefit to oneself, it is also of great benefit to all of us.The Minister mentioned he has made a particular effort to ensure computing and information technology skills are well developed in second level schools. That is important, but it is also important that the problems in science and higher mathematics are addressed. There has been a fall-off in the intake into universities in both areas which are extraordinarily important for the types of industry we have attracted to the country. The pharmaceutical, biotechnology and light engineering industries are becoming desperately short of skilled personnel. It will be very serious if we have to import people from other countries to address these shortages.There has been a dreadful falling off in the number of students taking higher level chemistry, physics and mathematics. Fewer than 10% of students now take the first two subjects at leaving certificate level. Only a few years ago the figure was 20%. We must examine the reasons we are so short of teachers in these areas. Even recently there was not too much in the way of employment for mathematics and physics graduates, but now there is a huge range of opportunities for them. I met a physics graduate from Trinity College who told me he was going to South Korea to design computer games. It is a first class job and I was delighted for him, but if we lose enough people with such skills, we will be in a bad way. I heard someone suggest we should bring in science and mathematics teachers from eastern Europe and Russia where there is a surplus. Has the Department addressed this issue? It is vital that we do so because otherwise we could leave ourselves sub-skilled in these areas.There was a huge drop in the number of students taking computer science at university this year. Trinity College was asked to expand its IT department five years ago, but this year its enrolment dropped from 3,000 to 1,500. That is a terrible drop in such a short space of time and staff will have to be laid off.The Minister stressed the Department's role in tackling lack of access to education by those who are disadvantaged. That is only right. I particularly applaud the decision to set up the Committee on Educational Disadvantage under the Education Act, 1998, and I am delighted professor Áine Hyland is acting as chair. She is a close friend and will hear from me on the subject; there could not be a more committed person in the role.The access programmes to universities have been a success. I am glad to see the role of access officer has been extended to the institutes of technology. It is a pity that they try to make themselves more like universities. The French polytechniques would not do this. They absolutely insist on the roles they have. It would be a great pity if we all ended up producing the same people. It is more worthwhile trying to produce the broad spectrum of people needed.I know most about the Trinity College access programme. I attended the certification ceremony in July. It was extraordinary, there was a very large cross section of people, some quite young and some quite a bit older and with good qualifications such as apprenticeships. Four of them had gained places in the university starting in October. I was walking out with a woman, her husband and two teenage children and pointed the way out through the Nassau Street gate. She told me that she wanted to walk around with her family for a while in order that she could show them where she would be studying. It was lovely to see someone so proud of the achievement. I have also met people who came from places like Dunshaughlin community school, where one person out of a year of several hundred went on to university. This area must be addressed and I am delighted to see the Minister doing so.I have one quibble. The Minister said there have been no cutbacks in courses. A course was established in clinical psychology in Trinity College for 12 postgraduate clinical psychologists. There are 50 vacant posts in the health boards which are trying to recruit internationally to fill these posts. There is a shortage of clinical psychologists to deal with people before the courts, especially children, and those in the prison system and other areas. The Northern Area Health Board of the Eastern Regional Health Authority was to fund this course for 12 people. The staff were put in place at considerable cost and of the 12 students selected, some had given up jobs. The course was cancelled at two weeks notice. That is extremely counterproductive.

I know he will be competent in this post because he comes from an education background and no area of first, second or third level education will be daunting for him.When I was involved in second and third level education in the 1980s, I remember the dark days of cutbacks, high unemployment and massive emigration. Since then there has been a transformation and everyone has a good social and economic life. We should be committed to giving every child a good start in education, which is what the Government has done in the last five years. We have ensured every child in every primary and secondary school will have access to third level education. I know this because I was spokesperson on education in the last Seanad and I am delighted to highlight the achievements of the last Government, achievements that will continue under the present Administration. I want to remind the House of what was achieved under the Education (Welfare) Act, 1999.

#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	216	I can make a contribution on any aspect of education and if the Senator wants to contradict me, we can have it out. I want to highlight the Education Welfare Board established in 1999 which put in place welfare officers to deal with regular attendance. We have also created the statutory advisory disadvantage committee to deal with integrated education, which I am pleased to say is what we want, starting at primary level with Breaking the Cycle, home schooling, remedial teachers, resource teachers and career guidance people. All of these people will be working together in harmony to make sure that any black spots in our primary education system will be identified and our psychological services will be able to assess children before they move into second level education. I am very pleased that it is beginning to work. It may not have fully integrated into the system yet, but the concept is there and it will work because we are putting in the resources and money. It is great news and if we do not do it that way, we will not tackle disadvantage. Disadvantage has to be tackled at six years of age so that by the time children are in second level schooling they are well established and able to take part in any class or school subject.The other area worth mentioning is adult education and what has been done in that area over recent years. We have brought in post-leaving certificate course, the VTOS programmes and lifelong learning programmes. There is a scenic route for those who cannot get to third level immediately, but can enter via certificate and diploma courses before going on to get their degrees. That could not happen without investment and I am grateful to the Government for acknowledging that. If one went to any community college tonight one would see that it is absolutely top heavy with post-leaving certificate courses and all sorts of lifelong learning programmes, which is a pleasure to see. To say that money was pulled back and that there will not be investment in adult education is wrong and I do not know how the spin doctors came to that conclusion.The Government has invested over €50 million in implementing the schools IT 2000 project which was launched in November 1997. Private funding was also attracted to the project and Eircom invested €20 million under the information age schools initiative for the provision of Internet access to schools. I could go on. There is huge investment and there are no cutbacks. Anyone who wants to have access to third level education will have it if they get the qualifications and the points. Let there be no doubt about that.

I have nothing more to say, the facts are there. We will continue with what we did between 1997 and 2002 and this Administration will get it right.

#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	224	In his report the Minister said he will tackle disadvantage and of course we welcome that. I reject his suggestion that anybody on this side of the House would not do everything in their power to tackle it. We want equal opportunity for everybody, which means providing the resources to allow everybody the opportunity to get into third level education. That has not been the case.I direct my comments to the Minister's proposal to reintroduce third level fees. Has he lost sight of the people on the ground? Driving around in a ministerial car has taken him away from what is happening in the houses of people who are hard pressed to live from day to day even when there are two people earning in a home. The reintroduction of fees is unacceptable to people who are hard pressed to look after their families. Are we to go back to the day when I finished my own second level education and my parents could not afford a third level education for me? I think we are and families will have to make choices. The strains on families today are greater now than they were when I was growing up and they now have to provide homes for their children as well. The Senators opposite know that Government is telling parents they have to pay for education and houses and it is quite unacceptable.I am glad that children growing up today have a wonderful sense of looking forward and of expectation that the world is their oyster. That is what we have told them they can have. By providing free third level education the opportunities are there for them. We are going to take away those opportunities if the Minister proceeds with this.We are all in favour of tackling disadvantage at primary and secondary level, but money has been put in and we have not got results. Those children are not getting to third level education. It is not just about money in schools. Education is something a large section of our community cannot aspire to because there are other problems locally and in their homes. Their parents may not have jobs, and there will not be a history in their families of going on to third level education. We also need to tackle crime and housing, two of the many issues that have to be tackled to enable people to stay in education and to progress.I live in an area with families who are very disadvantaged and families on middle incomes who are struggling to look after their homes, their children, their children's education and who in a few years' time will have to provide them with homes too. If we proceed with these cutbacks, more areas will be disadvantaged. The money should be put into primary and second level schools to enable children to do well. Children in our community should not be deprived of the opportunity to get a third level education. I live in an area where there is high employment, but I know those people will struggle and make choices which mean some of their children will not go to third level institutions.Children in my area attend a substandard school. The previous Government, which was made up of the same parties, told the people that Coolmine Community School would either be refurbished or rebuilt. I could give the Minister of State a list of primary schools in my area where many children are in prefabricated buildings. That is unacceptable in this day and age. Such buildings are overcrowded. Several young non-national children are in many of the schools in my area. They need extra resources. That is a new community which must be given equal opportunities.There is a special school in my area, St. Vincent's on the Navan Road. The parents of the children who attend that school march outside it in the mornings or afternoons and disrupt traffic because it is proposed to remove it from the jurisdiction of the Department of Health and Children and make it the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science. The parents do not want that. Many of these children need the health supports they already receive. They will not benefit from educational supports to the same extent. The Minister should listen to the parents and give them what they want.There is a lot to do and many issues must be tackled. One such issue is the provision of schools in developing areas. If we know that several thousand people will live in an area, we should plan for schools. Parents should not have to protest and march to get the education they need for their children. These are the issues which must be tackled because they are bothering people every day. I ask the Minister of State not to reintroduce third level fees and not to reduce the number of people, whether they are young or mature students, who want third level education or literacy skills.

I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, to the House. I listened carefully to the Minister's contribution and to most of the contributions. We have had an interesting day because the House discussed reform of the Seanad until 6 p.m. and we are now discussing educational reform. I read the motion in the name of all the Senators and our amendment and I would like to discuss the general improvements in education.I hope Senators do not think I am immodest when I say I have some experience of this issue having served for five years in the Department of Education when times were tough, as Senator O'Toole knows. I am sure the Senator remembers that day in Galway.

They were extremely troubled and difficult times. I know that successive Governments, including that involving the parties on the other side of the House which was in power for two and a half years, made huge improvements in financial allocations to the Department of Education in the 1990s. There was acceptance at the Cabinet table in the past five years for the various initiatives introduced by the Minister. The parties opposite, when they were in Government, also made huge improvements in the two and half years prior to that. The Minister said that he did not want his budget allocation to be unused at the end of the year. That will happen if it is not used at this time of the year.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	229	Otherwise, the Department of Finance will hoover up the money left in the budget allocation. It is clear to the Minister that programmes which are not fully utilised will be continued in 2003.There has been much discussion about third level fees. Many of the people who spoke here today and many people outside the House know there is a need to evaluate what third level education gives to those who avail of it. The Minister said there is a need for him to look at the total expenditure for third level education and to see how that money can be put to best use to allow more people access to third level education. I cannot see how anyone could quibble with that worthy aim. We all want more people to enter third level education.The Minister of State has responsibility for literacy and adult education. We all want people who are currently disadvantaged to get the best opportunity in education. I heard Senator Terry speak with great feeling about her constituency. We could all trot out a list of schools, teachers and classes which would benefit from education programmes.A large sum of money is being spent on third level education. One has only to look at the growth of institutes of technology and universities around the country. There was a 17% increase in the past five years in the level of access to third level education. There is not an infinite amount of money for everything one wants in education. However, we need good teachers. Expenditure on teacher allocations and programmes has increased dramatically over the past seven or eight years. We should not lose our sense of realism. There has been a huge increase in the budget for the Department of Education and Science for programmes for 2002. The increase is approximately 14% in general, but it is more in the Department of Education and Science. That increase will be spent. However, we must be realistic. We must ask ourselves if we can continue to increase it.I listened with interest to Senator Bannon who said there was a need for caution and prudence in terms of expenditure. I was glad to hear it because it proved that Fine Gael's soul was not lost. I was particularly interested because he is from the midlands. He is right that it is necessary to evaluate and get value for the money spent on this important area of education.There is a need for openness. We must be grown up about this matter. We should not say that people cannot say something because it is heresy. It is the one Department where one must have debate about the issues. They must be out in the open and discussed by the public and in both Houses of the Oireachtas. People must feel they have a voice in any discussions. Above all, however, we must be honest and straightforward about the matter and ensure there is an emphasis on disadvantage.There were many telling contributions on this issue. Surely it is possible for every elected representative to accept that the people on whom we should focus are the sons and daughters of those from a disadvantaged background. It is not their fault that they perhaps dropped out of school early or did not have a chance to go on to third level. Their circumstances are not their fault. They did not ask that their background would make it difficult for them to get access to third level education or special treatment. Our entire focus should be on this matter. I welcome the debate and strongly support the amendment.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	230	I thank the Minister of State for attending the debate. I wish to bring three points to the attention of Members and the Minister. First, all those politicians, including the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and prominent educationalists now calling for the reintroduction of third level fees have apparently not even read the report of Clancy and Wall on the social background of higher education entrants. They have certainly not analysed any of the report's findings on the participation rates in higher education. Second, they apparently are not aware of one of the main justifications for the abolition of fees in 1996. Third, they apparently believe that inequality in third level participation can only be addressed exclusively in the context of school leavers attending full-time courses and they have no interest in the disadvantage suffered by adults and part-time students.Between 1980 and 1992 the national participation rate in third level education increased from 20% to 36%. The participation rate of the higher professional group increased from 59% to 85% and that of the lowest socio-economic group from 3% to 12%, both substantial increases even if the increase in the participation of the disadvantaged school leavers was from an abysmally low base. However, the participation rates of two other groups, namely, salaried employees and the lower professional group, either fell or remained almost static during the same period. For salaried employees, that is, PAYE taxpayers such as office workers and sales representatives, the participation rate actually fell from 59% to 48% in this period. For the lower professional group, in other words, teachers, nurses, journalists, public service workers, etc, the participation rate rose between 1980 to 1986 but fell from 47% in 1986 to 44% in 1992.These figures, of which the advocates of reimposing fees are unaware, demonstrate that under the old fee regime, when average participation rates almost doubled and the children of higher professional, farming and business owning parents were doing very well, the children of two groups of parents, often referred to when the need arises as "the backbone of the country," namely, nurses and teachers – ordinary PAYE employees – were making little or no progress. These parents were paying their taxes, were not able to exploit covenants like the higher professional and employer groups and, unlike the farmer group, could not qualify for grants.One very good reason for abolishing fees was to redress the discrimination against these groups. There is at least early evidence from Clancy and Wall's 1998 entrance to college data that the abolition of fees is beginning to redress the relative disadvantage of the lower professional and salaried employee groups. Both groups increased their participation rates between 1992 and 1998. They were the only two of 11 groups whose participation rate declined between 1986 and 1992. We can predict one certain outcome of the reintroduction of fees, that it would definitely worsen the opportunities for the children of nurses, teachers, office workers and all other low to middle income PAYE taxpayers.The advocates of reimposing fees have suggested that their abolition has damaged the fortunes of disadvantaged groups. What is the actual situation revealed by Clancy and Wall? Between 1992, when fees were charged, and 1998, two years after their abolition, the national participation rate increased from 36% to 46% or about a quarter. What about the participation rate of the lowest socio-economic group during that period? It almost doubled from 12% to 22%.Those who claim that a system of free fees damages disadvantaged groups are ignoring the facts – the facts tell exactly the opposite. After the introduction of free fees the group that showed the most significant improvement was the lowest socio-economic group. There is, therefore, no evidence to support the view that the reintroduction of fees will improve equality of participation. There is overwhelming evidence that it would have precisely the opposite effect.Inequality of access is not just experienced by the current crop of school leavers seeking places in full-time courses. What about all those now working and paying taxes who did not get the opportunity to enter higher education after leaving school? In 1980, some 80% of school leavers did not go to college. In 1992 the figure was 64% and even now 50% of school leavers do not go to full college. What about their rights to complete their education? Some of them are taking the initiative by getting higher education through part-time courses. However, they are discriminated against. They are paying fees of €10,000 and more to get the same degree for which full-time students pay no fees.Instead of ill-founded proposals to reintroduce fees for full-time students, we should decide to treat part-time students equally and encourage more of our workforce to get third level education through part-time study by abolishing fees for part-time students. Incidentally, this is exactly the proposal of the task force on lifelong learning set up by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	231	I am happy to share my time with Senator Browne. I am delighted the Fine Gael group tabled this motion. It is a crucially important matter which is worthy of discussion. I could add a few more issues to those raised. There is, for example, the whole problem of the building budget for schools. Regardless of how it may appear on paper, it is causing chaos in schools around the country. The Senators present are from all over the country. Each of us could visit schools in his or her constituency where an expectation that a new building would be up and running by now has not materialised. It can be described as regrouping or cutbacks or any other name, but the reality is that at best a slowdown is under way in school building and at worst the programme is not proceeding.This has happened before. The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera, and the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, both took an interest in this issue while wearing other hats. I am also aware that the Leader in her capacity as Minister for Education and Science in a previous Government also took a great interest in this matter. The good news of the recent past has been swallowed up almost immediately because we were trying to catch up. While I do not dispute the Minister of State's figures about teacher intake, for instance, that there will be 1,280 new graduates entering primary teaching and that the number of teachers has doubled since 1987, both of which are true, the figures on our side have also increased. Changes in birth rates have differed from expectations. There is a need for more teachers in schools as different kinds of functions have been created in schools with teachers doing much more than simply being in the classroom. There is a shortage and we are not even standing still.This morning I heard John Carr, my successor as General Secretary of the INTO, outline the difficulties arising from the non-implementation of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, which the House discussed a couple of years ago. On paper, it is good legislation and we ultimately welcomed it once we had made a number of changes to it. As the Act raised expectations, it would be better if the Minister were to state clearly that he will not implement it before a given date.I was one of those who objected to the introduction of free fees at third level. It was neither a fair nor a correct approach. As Senator Tuffy said, I thought the money could have been used in a different and more creative way in the maintenance area. It was not the right thing to do at the time. However, I would be utterly opposed to regressing in terms of removing free fees at third level. We have moved on and one cannot go backwards. If we were to remove this concession, we would make a mistake twice over. That cannot be done.The burden of maintenance fees is killing people. Senator Tuffy mentioned lower paid professionals such as teachers. One point on which I disagree with her is that the level of the grant will not reduce the number of their children who will go to college, it will reduce the quality of the retirement of their parents. I could give example after example of teachers, nurses, gardaí and others who pawn their lump sum on retirement in order to allow their children go to college. That is the way the price is being paid and it is unfair. I would welcome the Minister examining the level of maintenance fees. Everyone is aware that the way maintenance is being dealt with is not fair.Benchmarking is the issue of the day. Teaching will fall apart if morale is not boosted by a recognition in terms of respect for teachers' entitlements and expectations. Irrespective of the rows, teachers have expectations. They went through the system of benchmarking. It would be helpful if the Minister for Education and Science or the Minister for Finance gave a commitment to payment in respect of benchmarking. This covers the whole public sector. It is of major importance in the education sector.We should look on education as an investment in the future. I would like to think that every child born had earmarked for him or her a certain amount of resources from the State, which that person could draw down at any time during his or her life in order to advance educationally. That is something from which we would all gain.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	232	I wish to share my time with Senator Phelan.Acting Chairman (Mr. Walsh): That is agreed.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	233	I wish to qualify my remarks by saying I was a primary teacher and I am involved in the ICT end of primary schools. The increase in registration fees was a bad move and the possibility of the reintroduction of third level fees would be a step backwards. It would not solve the problem. People admit there is a difficulty in the fair distribution of wealth, but the reintroduction of third level fees would not solve this.We all remember the covenant system. When there was a grants system in the past, business people and others who probably should not have qualified for it. Those who did not qualify were the ordinary PAYE workers, the middle class workers who were squeezed.A great number of students who work part time each year are forced to do so when they should be spending their time studying. That is a reflection on the inadequate maintenance grant and other areas. I welcome the news that the Minister will examine this area.I will concentrate on the primary school sector and disadvantage. The Constitution states we should cherish all our children equally, but that is not happening. School building projects are way behind schedule. Children attend different standard schools. Some are stuck in prefabs while others are in schools that should not be inhabited by human beings.There does not seem to be any co-ordination between the relevant agencies. I called to all the local schools in my constituency during the general election campaign and saw some good schools that had been built and some bad ones. The Department of Education and Science should establish an agency to examine best practice in existing school buildings given the great variation around the country. I understand there are a number of agencies involved in this area, the Office of Public Works, the school buildings project and management units in the Department of Education and Science and some other agency. It would be more helpful if there was one agency which devised a blueprint for schools throughout the country. This would quicken the school building process and lead to the building of better schools.I take issue on the matter of disadvantaged status. I am bemused that some schools are given disadvantaged status while others are not. A school not given disadvantaged status is, in turn, disadvantaged, a contradiction in itself.Teachers in Gaelscoileanna are paid more than teachers in non-Gaelscoileanna. Gaelscoileanna also receive increased capitation grants. I do not accept that position is fair. I taught in a primary school and believed that I did as good as job as a teacher in a Gaelscoil.  I ask the Minister to increase teachers' salaries and capitation grants to ensure they are equal across the board. It is insulting to teachers in non-Gaelscoileanna to pay them a lower salary.The issue of teacher numbers must also be addressed. The Minister glossed over the figures and referred to the large numbers going to college, but the reality is that many children are taught by untrained teachers. That is not fair. Those in the Department of Education and Science do not seem to show forward thinking in this respect. The Department appoints many resource teachers who come out of the classroom scenario where there is no one to replace them. A large number of teachers retired recently. Those in the Department have no excuses. They know that if a child is born this year, he or she will go to school in four years' time. Therefore, it has four years advance notice. If any other business had that advance notice, it would be far better prepared.The issue of male teachers must also be examined. Why are so few males going into the profession? Why are they getting out of teaching so quickly? Nearly half of the male colleagues who trained with me left the profession before they even reached the age of 30. This situation must be examined.The Minister's predecessor did an awful lot of damage to the teaching profession. He damaged morale and wrecked the voluntary aspect for teachers. This area must be addressed again, as well as promotion prospects in education. Many areas in education need to be examined. We need to start from the bottom and work upwards.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	234	I thank Senator Browne for sharing his time with me. I want to speak about the increase in college registration fees. I finished college in May. At least, I hope I did, having regard to Senator Henry's point. I have a primary degree. Many of those with primary degrees end up going on to do postgraduate courses.It is regrettable the Minister is not present. He made great play about living in the real world. The real world was brought home to me a month ago when I listened to a radio programme which I will not name. I listened to a student from Dublin who was returning to college this year. He said he would have to miss the first few weeks of college to continue working to meet the increase in college fees. That is the real world. The real world is not the Minister touring the country in his ministerial merc. That student who was returning to college in Dublin is living in the real world.I received many representations from people my own age on an issue that greatly upset them. The time of the leaving certificate probably causes people more anxiety than any other in their lives. When the leaving certificate results were coming out and college places were to be announced, the Minister announced to those who were at their most vulnerable that there would be a 70% increase in college fees. The timing of his announcement left much to be desired. At the very least, it could have been done at a different stage.I agree with the Leader of House that the emphasis should be on disadvantage, on which we are all at one, but the emphasis should not be to make everyone disadvantaged. It should be to bring up those who are disadvantaged and give them equal opportunities.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	235	I thank the Acting Chairman for his flexibility in allowing the debate to continue to enable as many Members as possible to contribute. I also thank the Minister and the Minister of State – whom I welcome to the Seanad – for their presence for this important debate. I thank my colleagues, and the seconder of the motion, Senator McHugh, for their contributions, which I hope will lead to an open discussion on the important matters highlighted. Whether the Minister likes it, these are the real issues.As Senator John Phelan said, the Minister made several references to the real world. I would like to highlight a few points regarding the real world for many people involved in education today. Approximately 50% of students attending third level institutions have to get a job just to hang on in there. These people are vulnerable, the ones we class as drop-outs. The drop-out rate is greatest in the institutes of education because many studying there come from vulnerable backgrounds. The Minister must make them a priority.We welcome resource and remedial teachers. Is it fair that those professional people are working in corridors and converted cloakrooms of national schools, rural and urban? Can they perform their professional duties in such conditions? The Minister should address that issue as a matter of urgency. He cannot claim that this Government or the previous one had any real input into what happened to pupil-teacher ratios. The population has declined, with a consequential decline in intake at primary level. That is the major reason for the decline in average pupil-teacher ratios. Average figures hide reality. That is what the Minister wants.Senator O'Rourke knows that the schools building programme has been stagnant for the last three years. Given the climate ahead, I cannot foresee any progress in this area. Only schools which declare publicly that there are asbestos roofs leaking on top of students will have remedial works carried out. The INTO has, on numerous occasions, highlighted the plight of several schools which are rat infested or have high levels of radon gas.The current Minister has many bridges to build, a task in which I hope the Minister of State will assist him. His predecessor has destroyed morale among many teachers. Why is it that so many people are rushing to get out of the profession and taking early retirement? The issue of supervision and substitution has been badly handled. The Minister must tackle it as a matter or urgency because it reflects on students at leaving certificate level. It is unfair that they must endure this burden. The €17 million spent in the last academic year was far greater than what it would have cost to pay the teachers involved if the Minister had wished to see the wood from the trees.The issue of reintroducing fees for third level students must be tackled in a positive way. They feel they will be levelled with additional charges when they are mid-way through their academic courses. At current day costs, the reintroduction of fees will mean a cost of €12,000 per year per student. That is based on having to pay €6,000 for meagre living expenses, €670 for registration fees plus average fees of €5,000. We have to consider seriously if we wish to burden students, who have already embarked on their training, with those fees. Investment in education is unparalleled but it must be taken in the context of current day values.I welcome Senator O'Rourke's contribution which acknowledged the efforts and endeavours of previous Ministers in more difficult circumstances than we now find ourselves. The Minister must face reality. He cannot say he is giving priority to the disadvantaged and then reintroduce fees and say he is doing so because of the inadequacy of the uptake of the scheme. That is admitting failure.I thank everybody for their contributions and hope we will have a favourable response from the Minister in due course.

#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	238	I welcome the Minister of State. It is appropriate that we are debating this matter this evening because, as he will be aware, the European Commission has given a warm welcome to the ten candidate countries, indicated that they have fulfilled a sufficient number of the Chapters they were required to fulfil and stated that all that is needed is a "Yes" vote by the Irish in the referendum on the Nice treaty. I am an enthusiastic supporter of the treaty.The matter I wish to raise involves the internal market which, we hope, will be enlarged after the Nice referendum and consequently will have even greater importance. We complain frequently about bureaucrats in Brussels making all the decisions. Unless we take part in the decision-making process, however, it will be quite impossible for us to influence any of the decisions that are made. That is why I want the Minister for Health and Children to address this issue immediately.The Commission, in its proposed Directive COM (2002) 119 final, intends to change a reliable, well understood system for the recognition of the medical qualifications of member states in other EU states to a system which will become cumbersome and discriminatory. As it stands, any doctor qualified and registered in a member state has the automatic right to practise in another member state. This right will be severely curtailed by COM (2002) 119 final.The Doctors Directive 93/16/EC, last modified by Directive 2001/19/EC, guarantees automatic mutual recognition of qualifications between the states. A total of 52 medical specialties are recognised by this directive, some of which are common to all states – 17 in all – but others are recognised by two or more states. The new directive will restrict automatic recognition to the 17 specialties common to all states. All the others will be placed within a new general directive system which will be governed by member states. This will create a new two-tier system of doctors' qualifications. Why, when the EU is striving for an even closer union, is the Commission seeking to divide European medicine?As already stated 17 specialties – anaesthesia, diagnostic radiology, general medicine, general surgery, morbid anatomy and histopathology, neurological surgery, neurology, obstetrics and gynaecology, ophthalmology, orthopaedic surgery, otolaryngology, paediatrics, plastic surgery, psychiatry, radiotherapy, respiratory medicine and urology – are recognised in all states. At present, however, if a specialty is recognised in two states or more it is still recognised as a specialty. For example, cardiology is recognised in 11 states including Ireland; child and adolescent psychiatry is also recognised in 11 states including Ireland; microbiology-bacteriology is recognised in 12 states including Ireland; occupational medicine is recognised in 14 states including Ireland; and thoracic surgery is also recognised in 14 states including Ireland. However, accident and emergency medicine is recognised in only two states – Ireland and the United Kingdom. There is nothing to say that other countries will not proceed to recognise this area of medicine as a specialty. That is what one would expect and it is what everyone in the medical profession in the European Union has been working towards in the past 30 years. It is, therefore, extraordinarily difficult to understand the course of action taken by the Commission.Ireland recognises 24 of the 35 specialties at present and the new document COM (2002) 119 final will place a twofold burden on doctors whose specialty is not one of the 17 recognised by all member states. First, it will oblige them to seek verification from any member state in which they propose to practise. The EU currently guarantees them the right to practise provided that they are registered in any one member state. This is an extremely important part of the internal market. Second, the drive to innovate and improve the quality of medicine will be hampered. Any doctor wishing to practise a specialty not currently offered in another member state will have to seek the right to practise, whereas, as things stand, the law allows him to practise as of right.From the doctors' point of view, the new directive will restrict civil rights – which the current directive upholds. No adequate reason is given for the loss of these rights. From the member states' point of view, it will add additional burdens to national regulatory authorities – in Ireland, the Medical Council, the Hospital Services Employment Authority, health boards and the Department of Health and Children.Having multiplied the burdens of administrators and doctors, the Commission proposes to reduce the resources available to bear these loads. Until now, the highly successful system of mutual recognition has functioned because of the Commission's co-operation with the medical profession through the Advisory Committee on Medical Training and the committee of senior officials of public health. This has evolved and operated for over 30 years. The ACMT and the CSOPH have enabled the Commission to tap into the medical profession's continually evolving training and educational expertise. The Commission plans to abolish both committees, in effect cutting itself off from the institutional structure which has underpinned the success of the current directive.The pace of change in medical knowledge is just as fast as in other parts of modern life. The Commission seems to be turning away from the profession just at a time when it needs it most. The new directive contains no undertaking from the Commission to ensure the same level and quality of professional input and participation within the parameters of the new directive. As the Minister of State is aware, there are Department officials on the committee as well as people from the Medical Council and people representing the profession.It is vital for the maintenance of the currently successful system that the representative body of the European medical profession has a right of participation within the new system. I ask the Minister of State to make urgent representation to the Commission to find out why these proposals are coming forward and to have them reversed from the point of view of practicality.

I compliment Senator Henry on the statement which she has so knowledgeably and eloquently presented. I also thank her for her positive leadership in supporting a "Yes" vote in the forthcoming Nice referendum. Senator Henry and I have worked well together on a number of issues and we usually find ourselves on common ground as in the present instance.Perhaps some explanation is required on the background to the issues which Senator Henry has raised. At the request of the Council of Ministers, the European Commission has produced a proposal for a directive, which is aimed at simplifying and consolidating several sectoral and general systems directives governing the recognition by EU member states of the qualifications of professionals. This proposal was launched by DG4 of the European Commission on 7 March 2002.The Minister for Health and Children notes the concerns that have been highlighted by Senator Henry in her address to the House. The Department of Health and Children also has a number of concerns regarding the proposed directive, as have the health service regulatory bodies – Medical Council, An Bord Altranais, the Dental Council and the Irish Pharmaceutical Society. The Secretary General of the Department met with the four bodies earlier this year to discuss their concerns and to agree a modus operandi for co-ordinating responses to the proposed directive. In this regard, the Department of Education and Science is the lead Department for the negotiations at Council level and is co-ordinating the Government's response to the proposed directive. The Department of Education and Science has set up an interdepartmental group to collate the views and observations of the various Government Departments. These contributions are then presented for discussion at the Council working group.My Department, both directly at the Committee of Senior Officials on Public Health and through the Department of Education and Science, has been making Ireland's concerns known to the European Commission. Our main concerns and those of the regulatory bodies regarding the proposed directive include article 5, which makes provision for a professional registered in one member state to work in another member state for a period of up to 16 weeks per year without having to register with the regulatory authority in the host member state. The Department also has concerns regarding the proposal to abolish the advisory committees under Article 45. These committees examine the training programmes in member states and provide advice to the European Commission and member states with regard to the standards and suitability of training programmes undertaken by members of the various professions.As highlighted by Senator Henry, there are also concerns regarding the automatic recognition of certain medical specialties. At present, certain specialties are recognised by all member states and others are recognised in two or more member states. This second group is covered by the sectoral directive which provides for automatic recognition in the relevant states. If adopted, the proposed directive would do away with this system in favour of a general system under Article 24. This could adversely affect the right to automatic recognition for certain medical specialists who wish to work in other member states.There are, clearly, a number of important issues to be resolved. Both the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Health and Children have made Ireland's position quite clear on these issues. In addition, contact has been made with other EU delegations to brief them on our views and to explore their positions. These liaison arrangements are ongoing on a number of fronts in the area of health policy. On Tuesday of this week, I had a meeting in Luxembourg with Ireland's EU Commissioner, David Byrne, on health issues. There is great co-operation among the member states and I hope the liaison arrangements to which I have referred will have a positive outcome.As part of the co-decision process, the European Parliament held an oral hearing into the proposed Directive on 1 October 2002. Representatives of both the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science attended this hearing as observers. The Irish regulatory bodies were also represented at this hearing. It is clear that other member states and regulatory authorities share our concerns and that redrafting of the proposed directive will be required before it meets with general approval. Officials of the Department of Health and Children will continue to monitor the progress of the proposed directive, to consult with the relevant bodies, both nationally and at EU level, and to raise relevant concerns regarding the proposed directive with the European Commission.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	241	I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Gallagher. It is refreshing to have a Minister of State from the relevant Department in attendance for an adjournment matter in the Seanad.I have to declare an interest – I live adjacent to the site to which I will refer and also to a site known as Jackson Way. Both sites may be familiar to Members of the House and to the general public. In my view, it is no coincidence that the controversy currently surrounding the rerouting of the M50 motorway not only includes a medieval site which should be the subject of a preservation order but also includes a site whose beneficial owners are something of a mystery. The question must be posed as to whether there is a connection between those issues.I propose to the Minister of State that we re-route this motorway because the basic decision-making process on which the route of the motorway was based was flawed in two ways. First, an environmental impact statement was prepared which stated the Carrickmines site was of little value – that has now been completely blown out of the water. Second, the M50 route agreed runs north of where it is actually being built and was re-routed to include and bisect the Jackson Way site as well as the medieval site. What are we to make of this? I suggest the two are connected.I ask the Minister of State if it is reasonable that the route should not be considered final until the rights and wrongs of the Jackson Way site are resolved and made public because everyone knows the history of the Jackson Way site by now. An area of perhaps 120 acres was bought by the company for €685,000, I believe, and the owners – whose names we do not know – are seeking compensation of €118 million on the basis that the land – had it not had a motorway running through it – would have been rezoned for industrial or other commercial purposes. This particular re-routing leaves many questions to answer because it has affected many others.I plead with the Minister of State that we cannot allow this project to go ahead until what is now being discussed in Dún Laoghaire in an arbitration process is resolved and we ascertain the beneficial owner of the Jackson Way site who will benefit from the fact that the route takes in the medieval site. Once we have transparency on this matter, the next report of the Flood tribunal – this issue is to be examined in its next module – and the CAB investigation, we can make a decision on the routing of this motorway which is based on planning criteria alone.The Jackson Way site may be clean as a whistle. However, the worst situation would be that in years to come we looked at the route only to find something was flawed about the planning process over which we could not stand and discovered it was routed there for all the wrong reasons other than planning. That worries me. One of the victims of that routing would be the medieval site known as Carrickmines Castle. My first plea is that we do not go ahead with this when there are such extraordinarily uncomfortable questions to answer such as who is benefiting from the fact that the road goes through the site. Those with an interest in our heritage, medieval archaeology and who have taken an interest in this site will suffer most.The Minister of State should note that a dozen protesters are on site objecting to the presence of several 35 tonne caterpillar diggers carrying out work on a daily basis despite the fact that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, promised there would only be mini-diggers. There is unseemly haste – which I see at 6.30 a.m. – to the ruination of this site which we may come to regret. The site spans four centuries and the discoveries have included coins, human remains, pottery and other artefacts which give us an interest in how people lived over the period. It has been described by many eminent experts as Ireland's Pompeii or a new Newgrange. It is a spectacular site, one well worth preserving. The Minister of State should remember that when one makes decisions like this, they are forever and that it would be a great pity if this road project went ahead on this route if the reasons it was re-routed were subject to serious and uncomfortable questions.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	242	I am grateful for this opportunity to clarify my position on the situation at Carrickmines. I appreciate the genuine contribution the Senator has made this evening and will endeavour to address it.The proposal for the south eastern motorway was approved by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in 1998. In accordance with legal requirements, a comprehensive environmental impact statement was prepared by the road authority, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. This was the basis for extensive public consultation, as well as a public inquiry, which were undertaken prior to the determination of the matter by the Minister.The impact of the proposed motorway route on archaeological features at Carrickmines and a number of other locations was acknowledged as an important element of the EIA process. Dúchas, the heritage service of the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, participated in the public consultation and inquiry involved, together with other parties, including An Taisce, which was also interested in archaeological issues. The selected route, as subsequently endorsed by the Minister, was generally endorsed by all of these parties as the best environmental option.The resulting conditions attaching to the construction of the motorway require that the visibleupstanding remains of the castle and associated medieval buildings will be preserved in situ. It is further required that full archaeological investigation be undertaken to mitigate the impact of works on that part of the complex to be removed by the construction of the motorway.This approach is consistent with the reality that it is frequently not possible to preserve all archaeology in situ. In such cases preservation by record is internationally recognised, and also accepted by Dúchas, as an appropriate method of preserving the archaeological heritage. In the event, and to discharge the conditions imposed by the EIA approval, the National Roads Authority and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council have commissioned extensive archaeological investigations and excavations at the Carrickmines site. These have so far been running for two years and extended – from an earlier estimate of ten months – to deal with the greater than foreseen complexity of the site. Up to 200 archaeologists have been employed on site and the current running cost of the work comes to some €6 million. This work has already significantly enhanced the national archaeological record and recovered more than 40,000 artefacts as an enduring legacy for this and future generations to appreciate and learn from. Thanks to the substantial investment of resources by the road authorities, more has been done to improve our knowledge and understanding of the Carrickmines archaeological heritage in the past two years than in the previous 350, during which it lay buried.More recently, and in response to a request from the Minister for Transport, the NRA and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council have developed a set of supplementary proposals that will achieve the dual objective of preserving extensive areas of the historic and archaeological site at Carrickmines while at the same time allowing construction of the south eastern motorway section of the M50 to proceed on schedule. Furthermore, a long-term management plan for the portion of the castle to be preserved in situ is to be discussed and agreed between Dúchas and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. I emphasise that the NRA has committed to a code of practice with my Department for the mitigation of archaeology on national road projects.Given these circumstances it is not considered necessary or appropriate to place a temporary preservation order on the site. Such orders are used to address unexpected or unauthorised circumstances which may place the archaeological heritage at risk. Their use is not appropriate where, as in the current case, there is an agreed strategy to preserve and mitigate the archaeology of a site. I am conscious of my responsibilities for archaeological conservation both generally and in relation to the south eastern motorway development. A strategy for investigating and conserving the archaeology of the Carrickmines site was approved by the environmental impact assessment for the south eastern motorway. This process has involved widespread public consultation of interested parties, including Dúchas, the heritage service and An Taisce.That agreed strategy has been implemented under a series of excavation licences issued by Dúchas, and will resolve the archaeology of the Carrickmines site through the preservation of extensive excavated areas in situ, the recovery of many artefacts and the preservation by record of other features. Given the implementation of this agreed and wide ranging programme of archaeological work, it is not considered appropriate to place a preservation order on the site at this stage. I regard this approach as proper in relation to the archaeological heritage in this case and I commend it to Senators.I appreciate what has been said by Senator Ross. He expressed the need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to make a temporary preservation order on the lands surrounding Carrickmines Castle, which include Jackson's Way, under section 8 of the National Monuments Act. I hope I have indicated that sufficient steps have been taken by the Minister and Dúchas to ensure that the site is preserved, taking into consideration the necessity to carry out developments.
