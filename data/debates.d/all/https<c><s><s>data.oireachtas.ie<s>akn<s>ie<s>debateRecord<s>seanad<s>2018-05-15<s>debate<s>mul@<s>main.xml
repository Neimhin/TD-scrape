            <p eId="para_14">I welcome the Minister of State. I am raising an issue relating to eel fishermen, with which he is familiar. The depletion of eel stocks has rightly been a cause of concern for a number of years. The fact that the European eel stock is outside of safe biological limits proves there is a need for co-ordinated action to preserve the species. However, many Irish anglers have been without a vital source of income since a total ban on eel fishing was introduced in 2009. While there is no doubt about the need to increase eel stocks, there has been an increasing sense that an outright ban without accompanying Government efforts to improve stock or offer compensation to affected Irish fishermen is unfair. The European Commission confirmed to my colleague, Mr. Matt Carthy, MEP, that while the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, could have been used to compensate for temporary cessation of fishing activities, the Government opted not to include this as a form of support in its operational programme. This was in stark contrast to other governments in the EU, who chose this avenue. It was a grossly unfair decision by the Government. Eel fishermen found their equipment had been rendered worthless overnight and that their entire livelihood had been wiped out. Eight years on, they have not received one cent in compensation. The Commission also confirmed to Mr. Carthy, MEP, that it would be possible for the Government to give aid of up to €30,000 to affected businesses under an exception to state aid rules. He wrote to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine asking for this to be done.</p>
            <p eId="para_15"> There has been talk of a hardship fund for a number of years. I welcome Mr. Brendan Cuffe to the Chamber whom I believe the Minister of State knows. He met the former Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, on 4 April 2015, who promised a hardship fund would be set up. The Minister of State also said the documentation was on the desk of the then Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, waiting to be signed. The Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, met Mr. Cuffe outside the Dáil a few weeks ago and he said, "The hardship fund is there. I am waiting for clarification from Europe". These fishermen have been left waiting nine years for compensation. Mr. Cuffe is 78 years old and his colleague from Galway, Mr. Seán Creaven, a man I was delighted to meet outside the Dáil three years ago, is now 87 years old. I am not looking to treat this issue like a political football. All of us recognise that these men deserve compensation and the Government has indicated a fund will be set up. When will that happen? I hope that the Minister of State can give the House a firm indication of a date and that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, has signed off on the funding for this. The Minister of State will not disagree that these men have been waiting too long. Let us do the right thing.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeanKyne" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Climate_Action_and_Environment" eId="spk_3">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment (Deputy Seán Kyne)<recordedTime time="2018-05-15T14:35:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_16">I thank the Senator for raising this important issue. He is correct that I met Mr. Cuffe and Mr. Creaven recently to discuss an eel hardship scheme. The latest advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas, ICES, in late 2017 is that "the status of eel remains critical and that all anthropogenic mortality, for example, recreational and commercial fishing, hydropower, pumping stations, and pollution, affecting production and escapement of silver eels should be reduced to, or kept as close to, zero as possible". There is no change in the status of the stock as critically endangered.</p>
            <p eId="para_17"> In addition, the European eel remains on the United Nations red list of endangered species. In response to the conservation imperative, the European Commission introduced EU regulation 1100/2007 requiring each member state to implement an eel management plan, EMP. lreland's EMP was approved by the EU in 2009 under the regulation. The plan outlined management actions aimed at reducing eel mortality and increasing silver eel escapement to the sea. These actions included a cessation of the commercial eel fishery and closure of the market, and mitigation of the impact of hydropower installations. The impact of hydropower installations is addressed via a trap and transport programme on the rivers Shannon, Erne and Lee, managed by ESB Fisheries. </p>
            <p eId="para_18">This involves the capture of adult eels migrating to sea, transporting them around the hydropower installations and releasing them. In addition, elver traps are installed at all ESB hydropower stations to facilitate the upstream movement of juvenile eels.</p>
            <p eId="para_19"> Reviews, including public consultation, of the EMP measures were carried out in 2012 and 2015 and existing measures were continued. In addition, I have provided funding to IFI for a collaborative research initiative involving IFI scientists and a number of former eel fishermen to further develop national knowledge of the species and its medium to longer-term potential for recovery. This three-year scientific fishery was commenced in 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_20"> The Minister, Deputy Naughten, and I fully recognise the difficulty faced by eel fishermen. There is no property right attaching to public eel licences and, consequently, the issue of compensation is not relevant or appropriate, given that the closure of the fishery was applied for conservation reasons under the Fisheries Acts.</p>
            <p eId="para_21"> Notwithstanding this, we have progressed the issue of implementing support measures for eel fishermen and ensured that funding will be available for such measures. It is intended that potential support payments would be disbursed annually over a three-year period.</p>
            <p eId="para_22"> As Ireland’s EMP, including its conservation measures, was originally approved by the European Commission under EU Regulation 1100/2007, consultation and discussion with the European Commission is a key element in the consideration of any potential financial support measure.</p>
            <p eId="para_23"> I directed officials of the Department to contact the European Commission outlining Ireland’s objective to fund a support scheme for former eel fishermen. Initial responses have been received and I am advised that officials have now indicated to the Commission our intention to proceed with the measure.</p>
            <p eId="para_24"> Consultation is now required with the Revenue Commissioners and this is being commenced this week. Until consultations are completed, it is not appropriate to elaborate on the possible terms and conditions for, or the prospective number of participants in, any potential support measure.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> The Minister, Deputy Naughten, and I fought hard to secure funding in this year's Estimates for an eel hardship scheme. We consulted with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, during the Estimates process last year. We have engaged with the European Commission and we are now starting the process of engaging with the Revenue Commissioners to establish the terms and conditions of such a support scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_27">I am encouraged that the consultations with the European Commission seem to have been concluded, that the Minister of State has contacted the Revenue Commissioners and that finances are included in the Estimates.</p>
            <p eId="para_28"> My last question is simple, but may not be easy to answer, but the man in the Gallery deserves an answer. When will we be in a position to pay these men some money? I would understand if the Minister of State cannot give me a hard answer, but I ask for an estimate because otherwise I will be back asking the same question again, which I do not want to do.</p>
            <p eId="para_29"> I recognise that the Minister of State has been working towards resolving this issue, but these men have waited a long time. Are we talking about weeks or months? Surely we are not looking beyond the summer. I ask the Minister of State to give me an indication.</p>

            <p eId="para_30">I cannot give an absolute date, but I certainly hope it will not be beyond this summer. As I said, we have started a process with the Revenue Commissioners. Once that is concluded we hope to complete the terms and conditions. Initial preparatory work has been done on that and a draft scheme has been prepared, but that is subject, of course, to agreement with the Revenue Commissioners on the terms and conditions. Once that is completed, I hope in the next number of months we can announce it and seek applications from those who are impacted.</p>

I pointed out that the proposals to phase out biofuels made from EU-produced sugar beet, field corn and rapeseed would remove an income stream worth €5 billion to €6 billion per year to EU farmers, devastate rural economies, close the best immediate option for decarbonising transport and destroy investor interest in the biofuel industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_35"> I pointed out that by chopping and changing EU biofuel policy the European Commission has had a devastating impact on existing investments in sustainable EU biofuel production. Plants have been closed or mothballed. Investment proposals have been shelved. Jobs have been lost and thousands of farmers have lost the market for their products. In the UK alone investors have seen hundreds of millions of euro wiped off their investments.</p>
            <p eId="para_36">One of Spain's largest companies went to the wall. A survey of investors carried out by German industry body VDB found that 81% of those surveyed believed the Commission policy will cause a reduction in investor confidence.</p>
            <p eId="para_37"> The destruction of investor confidence by the Commission will have a negative impact on the efforts that have been under way to attract private investment to restart Ireland's sugar industry through joint sugar and ethanol investment. The European Commission's policy shift lacks any hard scientific evidence to back it up. The Commission has been shown to have made fundamental errors from the outset. It has literally got its sums wrong in calculating the relationship between world commodity prices and biofuel outset. I am sure the Minister is aware that the Commission's impact assessment was queried from within the Commission itself. The Commission's proposals are completely out of line with biofuel policies being followed by governments around the world. As I pointed out on the last occasion on which I raised this matter in the House, Europe's farmers, in partnership with producers of EU sustainable bioethanol, could do the following: boost farm incomes; create investment that supports rural communities; bring jobs to areas that need work; cut Europe's need to import animal foodstuffs, many of which come from GMO grains and are contaminated with antibiotics; help cut Europe's dependence on imported fossil fuels; help Europe cut greenhouse gas emissions; and reduce the pollution from road transport for so many of Europe's cities which threatens the lives and well-being of so many EU citizens.</p>
            <p eId="para_38"> I welcome the fact that the Minister, Deputy Naughten, recently announced that it is his intention to increase the obligation to blend crop-based biofuels into road transport fuels. I had hoped the Minister would announce he was moving in this direction when I raised this issue in my previous contribution in this regard on Commencement matters, which was perhaps last year, but it is better late than never. I ask that the Minister give the House an undertaking that Irish officials will actively support conventional biofuels in the discussions which are ongoing in Brussels between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament, support the line taken by the member states that are resisting the attempt to phase out sustainable "first generation" biofuels, and, most importantly, commit Ireland to pressing for an amendment to the current proposals which will ensure that all biofuels produced and marketed in the EU comply fully with the sustainability provisions contained in the 2016 Paris Agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_39"> I ask that the Minister make available to the House the details of the line Ireland is following in the trilogue discussions. It is so important we know what line the Government is taking on this. I thank the Minister for coming before the House.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment (Deputy Denis Naughten)<recordedTime time="2018-05-15T14:45:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_40">I thank the Senator for raising this important matter. The 2009 renewable energy directive established a common framework for the promotion of energy from renewable sources. It set Ireland a target of 16% of all energy consumption to be from renewable sources by 2020, with a target of 10% for the transport sector. Ireland aims to meet the 10% transport target through the increased use of sustainable biofuels, with electric vehicles also making a contribution. The deployment of biofuels through the biofuels obligation scheme will be the primary mechanism to ensure that Ireland's renewable energy target of 10% for transport will be met. Provisional figures for 2017 indicate that approximately 7% of our energy needs in the transport sector were met from renewable sources, mainly through biofuels.</p>
            <p eId="para_41"> The European Commission published the Clean Energy for All Europeans package in November 2016. The focus of this package of eight legislative proposals, which includes an amendment to the renewable energy directive, is on the period post-2020. The provisions of the proposed renewable energy directive build on the existing directive to provide a framework for the development of renewable energy out to 2030. Currently, the share of biofuels produced from crops grown on agricultural land that can be counted towards the 2020 renewable energy targets is capped at 7%. The level of these biofuels in Ireland is currently about 1%. The proposal put forward by the European Commission for the revised renewable energy directive is that the 7% limit would be reduced to 3.8% by 2030. The negotiating position agreed by the European Parliament is that the cap would be set at the level reached by member states in 2017, subject to a maximum of 7%.</p>
            <p eId="para_42">The general approach agreed by Ireland and other member states at the European Council in December 2017 is that member states may maintain the 7% limit to 2030. Along with a number of member states, Ireland supports the maintenance of the 7% cap for crop-based biofuels as set out in the Council's general approach. The trilogue negotiations on the proposed renewable energy directive are currently under way. Agreement has yet to be reached on a number of issues, including the cap for crop-based biofuels and targets for advanced biofuels.</p>
            <p eId="para_43"> Ireland's biofuels obligation scheme is a crucial policy measure that increases the use of renewable energy and decreases emissions in the transport sector. It was introduced in 2010 and requires fuel suppliers to ensure that biofuels make up a certain proportion of the fuel used in the road transport sector. Biofuels must meet strict sustainability criteria to qualify under the scheme. We discussed this issue at length at the joint Oireachtas committee. Progressive increases in the obligation rate, which is currently set at 8%, have led to the increased use of biofuels.</p>
            <p eId="para_44"> In December 2017, my Department held a public consultation seeking views on the implementation of increases in the biofuel obligation rate in 2019 and 2020 and on how the scheme will be developed into the future. A key theme of the responses received was the need to provide certainly to industry and stakeholders to allow longer term planning. Taking this into consideration, last month, I published a policy statement setting out the proposed future development of the biofuels obligation scheme in this country. The statement set out the following six actions: continue the biofuels obligation scheme until at least 2030 with progressive increases in the level of obligation and to develop the scheme in line with EU energy policy; increase the biofuel obligation rate to 10% by volume from 1 January 2019; increase the biofuel obligation rate to 11% by volume from 1 January 2020; reduce the carryover of biofuel certificates from 25% to 15% from 1 January 2020; work with industry and stakeholders to further increase the use of biofuels post-2020; and carry out public consultations on future obligation rate increases every two years post-2020. The scheme currently contributes an estimated 450,000 tonnes in carbon emission reductions each year towards our national targets. The changes I announced last month will increase this contribution to over 600,000 tonnes annually.</p>
            <p eId="para_45"> The policy statement will provide clarity for stakeholders and facilitate the longer term planning required to increase the use of biofuels. Similarly, the general approach agreed by the Council to maintain the existing 7% cap on crop-based biofuels, which Ireland continues to support, will provide certainty for the industry and other stakeholders.</p>

            <p eId="para_46">I thank the Minister for the reply. We all know the issue here is funding. Despite many commitments to funding, we have seen little of it.</p>
            <p eId="para_47"> I welcome and note that the Minister has made waves on this proposal but we need to hear from him on a regular basis what line Ireland is following in this area. We also need to ensure that all biofuels comply with the sustainability provisions contained in the 2016 Paris Agreement. </p>
            <p eId="para_48"> I note the Minister is working on this matter. This is very important, particularly for my own area of Carlow, where it is hoped to revive the sugar factory. There are many farmers and other people interested in this happening. Carlow is the ideal location for a sugar factory and, going forward, I will be working to make this happen.</p>

            <p eId="para_49">I have clearly set out Ireland's position at the Council and in the trilogue process. Over the next ten years, we will spend €22 billion on climate-related activities, which is €1 in every €5 being spent under the national development plan and is not an insignificant amount. I defy anyone in this House or the other House to reference the sugar industry with me. I was the one who stood up at the public meetings and who took the abuse in this House and the other House for trying to defend the sugar industry. I recall being browbeaten by the Government and many farmers when I tried to defend the retention and development of a sugar industry in this country.</p>
            <p eId="para_50">Shame on all of the organisations at the time. I was, sadly, proven right and now we are in a situation where we are trying to re-establish an industry because of the shortsightedness of the Government and the sugar industry at time. They preferred to take the quick shilling from the European Commission rather than look at the long-term future needs of this country. </p>

I request that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, address the Seanad and advise if his Department will pay any increase in the car insurance of county councillors. I have discussed this with the Minister. Some councillors have class 2 cover, which is business cover, on their car policies in respect of council work. It has come to light in two particular councils that I am aware of. The Minister might give some clarification. He has put a lot of work into the pay and conditions of county councillors. I believe that is going to bear fruit soon. He might explain and put some flesh on the bones of when he hopes to report back to the House with his recommendations to make councillors' pay and conditions better.</p>

            <p eId="para_56">I thank the Senator for raising this issue. It is timely to have this discussion with the students from Scoil Aireagail in the Gallery. There are three Aylwards my sister tells me. That is my sister Catherine, who is with them along with other staff members. She was a councillor herself for six years on Kilkenny County Council. I acknowledge their presence.</p>
            <p eId="para_57"> It is important to ensure that councillors are provided with appropriate supports to allow them to carry out their important role as local authority members and as public representatives. A range of allowances is already in place. The role of my Department is to provide a statutory framework for such supports under the Local Government Act 2001. Those regulations are given effect with the consent of the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform. My Department also issues direction to local authorities concerning the terms that apply to expenses claims and payments. </p>
            <p eId="para_58"> My Department does not provide direct remuneration to local authorities for the payment of such expenses. Local authorities are independent statutory bodies with their own management structures. Local authorities may provide direction, to councillors and employees alike, regarding the use of private vehicles for official council business provided that such direction is consistent with the appropriate statutory framework. I understand that some local authorities have advised their elected members that it is necessary to ensure that business usage is included as part of personal motor insurance policies in cases where private vehicles are being used for official business. It is understood that similar direction has also been issued by some local authorities to employees who use private vehicles for official business. </p>
            <p eId="para_59"> The cost of a private insurance premium is a personal matter for the individual concerned and the insurance provider. The terms and conditions that apply to the payment of motor travel expenses incurred by councillors are consistent with the terms and conditions that also apply to council employees. </p>
            <p eId="para_60">They are based on directions issued centrally by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that apply to all public bodies. My Department has made inquiries with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and it was advised that a range of factors must be taken into account when formulating the motor travel rates for expenses payments, including overhead costs such as replacing the car insurance and motor tax, as well as running costs such as fuel, maintenance and service.</p>
            <p eId="para_61"> Senators will appreciate that, in the time available, it has not been possible to examine this matter in full detail. However, I assure the House that my Department will further engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and local authorities on the matter. It is timely to have the discussion today as it underlines the need for the intended upcoming review of local councillors' terms and conditions. The review will be an important exercise in scoping the role of a councillor, an exercise that has never been done properly in the past. Senators may recall that I have referred to this on previous visits to the Seanad and I hope it will aid local democracy in continuing to attract and retain candidates who can have confidence that they are performing a well-defined role at the coalface of our local political system, and that the supports available to them are appropriate and adequate.</p>

            <p eId="para_62">I know that this has been discussed before and the Minister of State has been looking at it. There is a proposed model of tying councillors to a civil servant type of scale. The Minister of State mentioned his hope that it would be the way forward but is it still his opinion and does he still see it as the answer to satisfy councillors the way they should be satisfied? The Minister of State is aware, more than most, that there must be improvements in the system for councillors. There is no better man and he came from the ground up. His family is steeped in local and national politics.</p>

They have to be signed off by the Departments of Expenditure and Reform and Housing, Planning and Local Government. We can get that sorted this week and it is then a question of personnel, and that is being worked on currently. It is absolutely the intention to remove political decision making from the remuneration of councillors in the future and to establish, once and for all, a link between a public sector grade and the work of county and city councillors across the country. This will ensure that any benefits accruing to grades in the Civil Service will also accrue to councillors. That includes things such as pensions, health provision and other changes. This is particularly timely as we will have the review of the local electoral areas across the country published by the middle of next month. This group will produce its report before Hallowe'en and people throughout the country will have seven or eight months in advance of the next local elections to decide on whether to stand again or whether they wish to become new candidates in council elections.</p>

            <p eId="para_65">I thank the Minister for coming here today to deal with this matter, which relates to Scoil Cholmcille on Blarney Street in Cork. From 1 September, the school will have 216 students.</p>
            <p eId="para_66">If the number of students increases to 220 the school will be entitled to an additional teacher. </p>
            <p eId="para_67"> Scoil Cholmcille currently has a difficulty due to changing demographics. A school was first built on the site in 1840 and a new school was built a number of years ago. The number of young people living in the area has increased so the school has grown at a very fast pace. I was invited to visit the school to see the conditions for myself. When I visited a few weeks ago I saw that one room that had previously been used as toilets had been converted into a classroom. The school is under severe pressure in terms of space. Engineers have advised the school that three classrooms could easily be built adjacent to the existing structure thus accommodating the current needs of the school. I understand that the school is not on the radar of the Department in terms of being granted consent to apply for planning. The school has drawn up initial plans and submitted them to the Department. Unfortunately, the school has not been given the go ahead to go through the planning process. </p>
            <p eId="para_68"> The school has another concern. A list of new schools has recently been announced and it is proposed to build an eight-classroom school in the Gurranabraher area of Cork city. I do not think a site has been identified. There would be a natural feed in from south of the Gurranabraher area into Scoil Cholmcille on Blarney Street. The Department has identified that the demographic has changed. It has acknowledged that there has been an increase in the young population or an increase in the number of people who will require primary school placements. Scoil Cholmcille feels that it will be unable to provide enough accommodation and, as a consequence, is under extreme pressure. I would like the Department to indicate that Scoil Cholmcille can move to the next stage and apply for planning.</p>

            <p eId="para_69">I thank the Senator for raising this matter. I have received a briefing from my Department on the situation in Scoil Cholmcille. I gather that the school has a current staffing complement of one principal, 11 mainstream teaching posts, nine special education teaching posts and one shared home-school liaison post. The staffing level will remain unchanged for the next school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_70"> Last December, the school submitted an application for two mainstream classrooms and seven special education teaching rooms, which corresponds with the extension referred to by the Senator. The position is that the Department is assessing the application. At present, the school has 12 mainstream classroom places, two home-school liaison places and seven special education training spaces. The school appears to be deficient in special education training places but it does not immediately appear to be deficient in mainstream classroom spaces. The Department will consider the application in terms of whether the space applied for is needed. Unfortunately, we are under very severe constraints in terms of not building. I mean we must build in accordance with need, as identified, because there has been such a bulge in the population. On the other hand, the Department recognises that the layout of the school is particularly difficult. </p>

            <p eId="para_72">The Department is assessing what has been proposed and will be in communication with the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_73"> In terms of new school identification, that is somewhat different. I mean the Department is then undertaking demographic exercises and considering whether there is an emerging demand that will exceed the capacity of the existing schools and, in that context, should it consider sanctioning a new school. Such a new school would start with junior infants and work its way up as the population emerged.</p>
            <p eId="para_74">As the Senator knows, the Department is trying to take a longer-term planning view on this occasion, setting out its view of new schools from 2019 through to 2022. It is an attempt by the Department to take a long-term view of needs so it can start to plan for them well ahead. The fact that a new school has been identified as a need in the future does not mean there is an automatic search for new capacity in this particular school. They are not associated issues in the Department's view. The other is a longer-term plan which looks at population and housing developments in the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_75"> All I can say at this point is that the application, which was made just under six months ago, is being scrutinised and the Department will refer back to the school to respond to what has been put forward and to explore what might be possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_76">I appreciate the Minister's reply. The school has an extremely dedicated principal, teachers and assistants who work there and there is huge support from the parents. The numbers in the school have increased much faster than a school would normally experience. That is why there is pressure.</p>
            <p eId="para_77"> There is also the issue of the site itself, but the school has clearly set out in its plan how it can build three rooms. It is a three-storey school and it could be put in place very quickly. That is what the school is seeking in the plans it submitted. It would certainly relieve some of the school's problems.</p>
            <p eId="para_78"> I accept the Minister's response, but the issue will not go away because the numbers will continue to increase. I also accept the demographic changes in the Gurranabraher area and the need for a new school there. However, I hope that will not prevent the other schools in the surrounding areas continuing to grow their numbers because the population is increasing and will continue to increase.</p>

            <p eId="para_79">Clearly, if the population increases and the numbers attending this school increase and so forth, as more schools are allocated the Department will have to consider additional accommodation on that ground. However, on the basis of the current stable numbers in the application, the Department is probably looking at this against the background that it will have to deliver perhaps 18,000 extra places this year so it is confined to concentrating on schools that have a clearly identified need. That is the backdrop against which any application is assessed.</p>

I cannot anticipate what conclusion the Department will reach as it is assessing the application. However, it has given me that level of insight into how it is assessing it. Hopefully, it will be able to revert to the school and some progress can be made over time on what is recognised as a difficulty.</p>

          <p eId="para_83">I would like to express my outrage, and that of the Fianna Fáil group, and condemn the actions of Israel and its use of force against unarmed Palestinian protestors, including unarmed children. An eight month old child was among the victims.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">The killing of 59 Palestinians can only be described as a massacre and must be condemned by the Government in the strongest possible terms. We call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to do what he can and outline our condemnation to the Israeli ambassador. Shooting live ammunition at demonstrators goes way beyond the realms of proportionality and I ask the Minister to urge the Israeli authorities to use restraint. </p>
          <p eId="para_85"> The second issue I wish to raise is the cervical screening controversy and the information deficit among senior management in the HSE, evidenced by when they became aware of the cervical cancer controversy, including when the Minister and his predecessors knew about the issue, which I say is questionable. In fact, it beggars belief. However, the Taoiseach was emphatic in the Dáil earlier that he was not aware of any issues with the programme, which I of course fully accept. The Taoiseach also confirmed, when asked by Deputy Micheál Martin, that no Minister for Health in recent times ever discussed or reviewed the progress of the cervical screening programme with senior management there, which in itself, in my opinion, is a dereliction of duty by a health Minister. The CervicalCheck programme is clearly within the brief of the Minister for Health, and failure to review or discuss it over the course of the last Government or this Government raises serious questions about competency. Ultimately, the women at the heart of this controversy must be the priority of the Government. To date, we have seen a serious lack of urgency in supporting them. Some 4,000 women have yet to receive a call back from the helpline. Moreover, six families of women who have sadly passed away and were the subject matter of the audit have not been contacted to date. If they were wanted for a crime or owed money to the State it would be very easy to find them. This alone beggars belief, and the manner in which families to date have been told has been insensitive and cruel. What we need to see is reform. We need to see competence in this programme and we need to see this as a matter of urgency. </p>
          <p eId="para_86"> The final item I would like to raise is unrelated. It concerns the dangers of cycling on Luas tracks. At 1.40 p.m. today I witnessed a man's tyre get trapped in the Luas tracks in St. Stephen's Green, causing him to fall. Thankfully he had a helmet on and was not injured. I know this matter has been raised before but there is a serious accident waiting to happen. More safety measures and warnings must be put in place to ensure that we do not learn of a tragedy on our doorstep arising from this. </p>

          <p eId="para_87">I too want to point out that what went on yesterday in Gaza is beyond belief. This has been going on for so long with the Israelis that it is not funny. Children were shot yesterday. I have to ask the question: what were children doing there? I often have wondered whether I have the capacity to kill somebody and I think the only way I would ever kill anybody would be if he or she touched one of my children or grandchildren. I cannot for the life of me understand anybody bringing children to an organised protest when they know that those against whom they are protesting have no qualms whatsoever when it comes to using lethal force.</p>

I ask anybody here who has children to stand up here today and tell me that he or she would walk them into a situation where that person knows there was a possibility that they would get shot. That in no way excuses the disgusting behaviour of the Israeli defence forces. Their viciousness, their cruelty and their willingness to kill people is too well known. As for President Trump opening his embassy in Jerusalem, he knew God-damned well when he opened it exactly what it would cause. It is a terrible day. We stand here with 59 people dead, and I agree with my colleague, Senator Ardagh; we must object in the most strenuous terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_94"> The Leader also mentioned today that legislative items are to come before the House without debate, that is, two European directives pertaining to taxation. I refer to COM(2018)147 and COM(2018)148. I do not believe that any European legislation should pass through this House without debate. I believe that time should be found and set aside to debate this legislation before it goes through. That is one job the Seanad can do and can do well. I ask the Leader to reconsider that and to perhaps set time aside to debate both of those items of legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_96">To be honest, I am finding it difficult to put into words how disgusted and horrified I am at the shameful disregard for human life in Gaza yesterday. I spent the last week in Palestine meeting both Israeli and Palestinian human rights organisations and other amazing people across Gaza and the West Bank. I came back into Leinster House yesterday morning ready to share their stories, just as news emerged of the horrific, mounting death toll.</p>
          <p eId="para_97"> It is almost surreal to be back in Dublin. Just days ago, I stood in Gaza at the exact same meeting point near the border fence where the protests are taking place and I got to speak to those living under a brutal, 11-year blockade and occupation. The sense of hopelessness was very clear. Israel's inhumane blockade has confined 2 million people to suffering in an open air prison. The lack of access to water, electricity and healthcare was difficult to take, but the very real despair in people's voices was even worse. They pleaded with us and asked why the international community is not doing anything for them. They asked why they were left there to deal with this situation. I saw it clearly. I am so upset. I felt the hopelessness of many people. They had just given up.</p>
          <p eId="para_98"> Senator Craughwell asked why people bring children to those demonstrations. They have no other choice. They do not know what else to do. They are feeling hopeless. They are choosing death because they do not know what else to do. Over 50% of the people in the region are unemployed. They are all young people. They are sick of life in an open air prison.</p>
          <p eId="para_99"> We hear that another life has been lost today. When I went to Hebron I spoke with a man from Breaking the Silence who said that when he was in the Israeli army, shooting the Palestinian people was like playing a video game. They all cheer and laugh when they shoot somebody. It is absolutely horrendous, and I am appalled.</p>
          <p eId="para_100"> It is time now for change, and this Government has to do something about that. The sad reality is that nothing will change until the European Union and the wider international community puts pressure on Netanyahu's Government. Years of empty condemnation simply has not worked.</p>

          <p eId="para_105">I, too, condemn the slaughter of the Palestinian women, men and children over the weekend. This is nothing new, but those atrocities have focused people's minds. For that reason, I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the House would get a full report from the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on his meeting with the Israeli ambassador. It is not good enough to just have a chat with him. Senator Black and the other Senators who have spoken are right. Action must be taken now. I want to see the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade come before this House to outline the leadership measures and actions that will be taken to address this atrocity.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">We often talk in this House about atrocities that happened and things over which we have no control. We cannot change the past but can change things now. Obviously, Ireland is a small state but addressing this requires not only international support but also international action. Ireland must play its part in that. We must show leadership and tangible actions to make that happen. It will not happen just through UN agreement. Specific actions are required. For our part, we have called for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador from Ireland in response to what has happened. Sinn Féin has called repeatedly for the international community to stand in defence of the Palestinian people. What occurred is the antithesis of all universal democratic norms. The failure of the international community to take a stand against the multiple injustices being inflicted on the Palestinian people by Israel is shameful and outrageous and has to stop. We must do absolutely everything in our power to ensure it stops. Otherwise it is to our shame.</p>

          <p eId="para_109">Like others, I express my utter condemnation of the appalling killings and maiming by the Israeli defence forces of so many civilians in Gaza, particularly a number of children. It is appalling to see carnage of this level. It is a new low. The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade had a session on Palestine with Omar Barghouti last week. Even at that point, it was not apparent just how much worse the situation would get. It was particularly chilling to see the US Administration suggesting this was somehow a positive move. Its siting of the embassy in Jerusalem led to the protests.</p>
          <p eId="para_110"> It is beyond time for empty words. We need to move on and look at the concrete action Ireland can take on this. We should call on the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, to take action on behalf of Ireland, recognising that, as a small state, we work best collectively. Today the Labour Party leader, Deputy Brendan Howlin, called on the Tánaiste to request an urgent convening of the EU Council of Foreign Ministers to discuss what action can be taken against Israel at EU level on this issue, and to convene an independent investigation into the killings. If the UN will not conduct such an investigation, which is likely given the Security Council veto, the EU should then step in and conduct an independent inquiry into the conduct of the Israeli defence forces.</p>

It has a role as a major donor, as an entity, and as a bloc that has invested a huge amount of money in the rebuilding of buildings in the Gaza Strip and West Bank. Senator Black will have seen this. The buildings were subsequently demolished by Israeli action. Therefore, the EU has a stake in this. We all have a stake in this on a humanitarian basis.</p>

I have asked the Leader to have a debate after the referendum on the conduct of referenda and electoral reform but we also need to debate the conduct of the debate itself and the use of respectful language.

          <p eId="para_124">Like many, I watched the gathering last night in County Kerry of those who support women like Emma Mhic Mhathúna and Vicky Phelan, who are enduring such difficult times. I presume everyone watched it. It was heartbreaking. I saw their anger and the continued lack of accountability. More marches in solidarity are planned for this week. We must all support these women and get to the bottom of this and heads must roll in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_125"> The Government seems still to be playing catch-up on this scandal and was, most worryingly, kept in the dark about a strategy that was dangerous and sinister in the extreme. It worries me that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health were kept out of the conversation and shielded from documents which resulted in harm to women. We are here to make good rules to protect our society and if we are not given all of the information, we must ask why. I echo calls made in the Dáil by my colleague, Deputy Marc MacSharry, for clarification on outsourcing of smears to UK laboratories at busy times from CervicalCheck. Women need certainty that smears are being read carefully and that they can trust, once again, a vital screening service.</p>
          <p eId="para_126"> Over the past few days, I was heartened to hear that measures had been taken to help women. However, it is still the case that not enough is being done. We have all heard the saying that it takes a village to raise a child. I call on the Minister to consider that and to ensure that not only are expenses covered but that real, tangible supports are put in place for these women and their families. A discretionary medical card should be provided to anyone with a terminal or chronic illness. I have brought this up several times before. It should be a straightforward matter to claim expenses which should be reimbursed without quibble. Counsellors, childcare services and transportation should be made available to these families without obstacle. A simple request for services should be made and granted in the same conversation. I do not want to read that months down the line, families are still waiting for receipts to be cleared. I suggest these families' names be put on a VIP list circulated to all services. If they make a call for a taxi at night or for a nurse, a service should be provided straight away. The last thing anyone with a terminal illness needs to be doing is checking receipts and collecting dates and times. I encourage a debate on the introduction of care teams for all families suffering at this time. We should have a system whereby the essential village is brought in to support these families, including someone to cook for them, someone to look after their children and someone to look after the women and administer their medications. This should never have happened. We need to ensure it never happens again.</p>

The farming and horticulture community has difficulty getting people to come from outside the European Union due to issues around work permits. There was some discussion with the Minister in the House. I am very happy to acknowledge the great work the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, has done. Today, she announced a pilot scheme whereby 800 people will come in. She intends to expand that but will start initially with 800 people. This is a hugely positive boost for people in the horticulture sector and agriculture generally. She has clearly responded to their extensive representations in the last few days. It is important to acknowledge her good work.</p>
          <p eId="para_128"> Second, I come back to the old chestnut of the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dún Laoghaire. Since I last spoke to the Leader, I have received a letter from the private secretary of the Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities to clarify that the hospital made submissions seeking 12 beds in January 2017 and that while six beds had been opened, there was no funding for the other six.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">The excuse is that the National Rehabilitation Hospital has made a submission to the HSE and it is telling the Minister that it will not be in a position to fund these beds possibly until the end-of-winter planning process of 2018-19. That is for six beds. These people are in acute beds in our hospitals. I went to the Minister of State and to the Minister, I wrote to the Taoiseach and received correspondence from him last week. We have now exhausted everything, apart from having public meetings in the constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and asking for people's support. That may be the next strand of the campaign because I am determined to get these beds open. I spoke to the hospital today. </p>
          <p eId="para_130"> Can we ask the Minister to come back to the House for a debate? I ask anyone in the House who has contacts with the Joint Committee on Health to put this matter on its agenda and to have the Minister appear before that committee to explain why there is a shortage in these beds.</p>

I also wish to condemn the murders by the Israeli defence forces and the Government of Israel for its actions in recent days. It is not only the last number of days but has been ongoing since 1947 when Palestinians were evicted from their homes close to Jerusalem. Those of us who have been to the West Bank and to the Gaza Strip have seen the hardship that these people go through. It is not only the community in Gaza, where farmers and fishermen are curtailed in their everyday work, but also in the West Bank. It is Israel's policy not to have a two-state solution. Israel's policy is to have one state that ends at the border with Jordan, at the Golan Heights and in the Sinai desert, and they want to push the Palestinians out of Gaza in order that the sea can be their other boundary. We must be strong in our condemnation of that. I welcome that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade summoned the ambassador today. We should bring the Minister to the House to report on what he said to the ambassador on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_133"> People have asked what we can do. I recall some years ago, writing to the European Commission on produce coming from Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Israeli settlers continue to push Palestinian farmers out of the West Bank. I ask that we would label produce from Israeli settlements in the West Bank and that we ban that settlement produce. </p>

          <p eId="para_136">I thank the Cathaoirleach and the Leader for the opportunity to observe that minute's silence for the people slaughtered in Gaza over recent days. I also second the amendment to the Order of Business by Senator Conway-Walsh. I wish to add to the calls by others for the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade should come before the House. I have listened to a number of his statements on this matter and on Senator Black's Bill on settlement goods.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">I have heard the Tánaiste and some of his colleagues in government advocate for a diplomatic approach to this issue as if Israel heeds diplomacy or has observed any diplomatic approach to this issue and as if we are dealing with a conventional war or conflict between two states when what we see being inflicted on the Palestinian people on the streets of Gaza constitutes genocide. It is calculated and deliberate slaughter and it is policy. There is no diplomatic response to this because, in the first instance, a willingness to work towards one is needed and there appears to be no willingness on the part of Israel, as Senator Lawlor said, to engage in conflict resolution. Israel's only aim is the ultimate removal of the Palestinian people. The Tánaiste said that he would pursue a response through the UN, as if the US will not block - if it has not already done so - any option to pursue a resolution to this or a reproach to Israel.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> We have exercised our options and I appreciate fully the effort put in by the Tánaiste and his departmental officials. We are a small country with a small presence in respect of this issue, which has such geopolitical magnitude. I do not doubt that we have tried sincerely and valiantly in this regard but yesterday's events did not happen in isolation. This is not a one-off; it is a consistent, calculated, deliberate approach by Israel. Israel does not adhere to international law and, therefore, why should it be treated like another ordinary state? Israel engages in the practice of apartheid. It is a rogue state that is slaughtering people who are peacefully protesting. We should follow the example set by ourselves in the past and boycott apartheid as we did in respect of South Africa. In addition, we should follow the South African Government's example of expelling the Israeli ambassador. We should take that step and expel the Israeli ambassador. There is a time for dialogue and conflict resolution, which we know better than most, but there is also a time for action. The time for action has passed and we need to send a message to the Palestinian people who know all too well the consequences of conflict and colonialism that we stand by them and that we stand for justice, rights and, ultimately, peace. Israel does not.</p>

          <p eId="para_139">As foreign affairs spokesperson for my party, I would like to address the atrocities of the past few days. We utterly condemn as outrageous, inhumane and unacceptable the firing on protesters and the mass killings that have resulted from such action. A total of 60 were killed yesterday and, as I understand from earlier remarks, more people have died today. There has been a multitude of injuries as well. This has been going on for weeks. It is horrendous and outside human norms. It is just unacceptable on every front and I would be remiss in my duty, having the honour and privilege of being spokesperson in this area, not to say that. I commend the Leader on beginning today's proceedings with a minute's silence, which was apt and appropriate. This is not a partisan issue and I commend the fact that the Tánaiste called in the Israeli ambassador and that he was unequivocal in his condemnation, which is what the people of Ireland would request in this instance. There should be an international investigation under the auspices of the UN and if that is vetoed, I will raise the issue in the European context in my capacity as leader of the Irish delegation to the Council of Europe at the next available opportunity. It will be raised by a number of people at that forum. It should also be raised at EU level to ensure there is an international investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">Unquestionably we should have an international investigation. While it is very difficult in the midst of such tragedy and in such a dismal situation, we should look to peace and to a two-state solution. A peace conference is an immediate requirement. Out of this horror, evil and wrong, the prospect for peace may arise somehow.</p>

          <p eId="para_141">There was a jubilant celebration of President Trump's ill-advised move of the American Embassy to Jerusalem yesterday, at which the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said that Jerusalem had been the capital of Israel for 3,000 years. We have had fake news; now we have fake history. That is absolute, utter rubbish. Sixty people were mown down. These were peaceful civilians protesting. The use of dumdum bullets, which should be internationally outlawed, was another part of this outrage. I do not know why they do not declare Israel to be the 51st state of the US, because that is basically what it is; it is a US colony in the Middle East.</p>
          <p eId="para_142"> It was nothing other than murder. We need action, not words. I call for the withdrawal of the Irish ambassador to Israel; for the stopping of the acceptance of settlement-produced goods and for the recognition of the state of Palestine. We really need action. There are decent Israelis. I was listening to the former head of the Israeli foreign office on the wireless the other day. He said the Israeli policy towards the Palestinians is an outrage and he is 100% right.</p>
          <p eId="para_143"> Some 2 million people are confined in an area that is ten miles wide by 40 miles long with inadequate water and sewerage services. These are actively bombed by the Israelis. What is the point in bombing a sewerage system unless they really want to degrade the people to the position of animals? There is enormous unemployment there. If they would only share the land, with Israeli technology they could bring some of these areas up to full agricultural production. I just do not know why the hell they do not just share the land.</p>
          <p eId="para_144"> One of the saddest aspects is that is a gross violation of the Jewish ethic which says that "If you save one life, you save a universe." The corollary of that is that "If you kill one person, you kill a universe of people."</p>

          <p eId="para_147">I join other Senators in absolutely condemning without question yesterday's murders in Gaza. To put things in context, there are 2 million Palestinian prisoners in an area of about 365 sq. km. It is the third most densely occupied part of the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_148"> The Israelis must realise that a revolution will take place and more deaths will come because this is only a start; this is not the end of the situation. They literally could technically move into Israel and Israel needs to be very careful. It would take some army to control 2 million people and that is what they are trying to do. That is why they shot dead in cold blood young people, middle-aged people and children with sharpshooters shooting into the area. It is one of the most outrageous atrocities. It brought back memories to most of us of Bloody Sunday, when the British army mowed down 14 people in the Bogside. As we felt then, we feel now the same sense of outrage over what is happening in Gaza and Israel. We have to condemn it outright. While condemnation is fine, we need to ask what other action we can take to ensure the issue is further highlighted.</p>
          <p eId="para_149"> We in this House warned of the fallout from the opening of the American Embassy in Jerusalem. It was obvious, as those of us who have been in Jerusalem realise. Jerusalem is the centre of all international faiths and is also the capital for Palestine.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">If the Israelis want to make it their capital, it can be shared in some form or other as an international city. That being said, I just feel that all we can do is condemn the activities. Seventy years ago yesterday, the State of Israel was established by international agreement without any concern whatsoever for the faith of the Palestinians living there. Now it is the West Bank and Gaza. I am not too impressed by Hamas's activities. It does not recognise the State of Israel. This is provocative, quite frankly. The other side, the West Bank, is controlled by Fatah. It is more reasonable - too reasonable, obviously, because what is happening in that region is that Hamas is getting backing because of its militaristic approach. Let us be quite clear about this: Hamas's commitment is to wipe out the State of Israel. If it wants to sit down and negotiate, let it sit down and remove those kinds of threats against any other country. We are for the two-state solution. The late Brian Lenihan Snr. was the first Minister in Europe to recognise the two-state solution many years ago, and we are very proud of his commitment. Fianna Fáil supports utterly Palestine and we condemn these activities.</p>

          <p eId="para_154">I join my colleagues in condemning the murderous actions of Israel over the weekend. Senator David Norris is right about using drones to kill the Palestinians. I had the privilege of visiting Jenin, Hebron and Ramallah a year ago. I think it was the greatest education the Seanad has offered me, given what I saw and who I met. The Palestinians are a great people, a brilliant people, but a people living normally in captivity - that is the only way I can describe it - with walls the size of those of the Seanad in between their farms, their trees, their houses and their businesses. There is no electricity, or very little, during the day and no running water. I remember thinking it was like an open prison, and we have called it an open prison. I agree with Senator Ivana Bacik who says Europe has a huge part to play. The EU has an enormous part to play but it seems to be living in a kind of inactivity on the matter. I agree with other colleagues across the House and I would like the Tánaiste to come before the House. I never agree with Sinn Féin because of its past, which has ended in peace, but I have experience of having lived through its military past, none of which I agreed with. However, I agree with Sinn Féin that the Tánaiste should come before the House. Perhaps he might tell us what exactly the Israeli ambassador said to him and what he intends to do now.</p>

          <p eId="para_158">In February, this House unanimously passed a motion to the effect that a non-HSE parent representative be appointed to the HSE primary care national steering group for children with complex medical needs. The HSE has disregarded the will of the Seanad and proceeded with side-lining parents from this decision-making process. The HSE wants to set up a reference group, a proposal which this House and, more important, the parental stakeholders involved, explicitly rejected. Participation is a no-brainer. There have been many scandals and fatal events in this country. This most recent horrific cover-up would not have been possible if there had been stakeholders, service-users, at the table. They would be much more responsible and less interested in protecting their careers because they would be responding to the people of this country and, in this instance, to their children's needs. We must have service-user participation at the table. If the Minister, Deputy Harris, is serious about change in the HSE and addressing the toxic environment of secrecy therein, he needs to allow parental stakeholders to represent their children. Following on from the letters sent to Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Independent Members of the Dáil and Seanad by the head of operations providing the same bland response about a parental group, I hope they will all stand up for change in the HSE and that this will commence with looking after children with complex needs.</p>

          <p eId="para_169"> I wish to speak in respect of Senator Craughwell's contribution. I was going to speak on it anyway but the Senator has raised the EU and the reasoned opinion from the committee of which I am Vice Chairman. Other members of the committee include Senators Kieran O'Donnell, Conway-Walsh and Paddy Burke. We met on three different occasions. We met first to consider whether we would be required to have scrutiny. We then brought in witnesses from the Department, the Revenue Commissioners, the Irish Tax Institute and Christian Aid. The Irish MEPs also came in on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_170"> It is important to realise that the deadline for the receipt by the EU of any reasoned opinion is next Thursday, 17 May 2018. We only deliberated and came to our conclusion last Thursday, 10 May. It is being brought forward and it is important that we bring to the EU our consideration of this matter. We considered it in a very serious, deliberate and measured way. I will provide Members with some of the highlights of that consideration. The committee deems that the proposals are in breach of the principles of subsidiarity. It goes beyond taxation being a sovereign right and a competence for each individual state. Those proposals impinge on that right. The committee agrees that technology and digitalisation is transforming the global economy but a global response is required to devise a taxation framework and not just an EU-specific proposal. That is what is mentioned in these two proposals, COM (2018) 147 and COM (2018) 148. </p>
          <p eId="para_171"> The committee supports the ongoing work of the OECD. I have visited the OECD and discussed many of the things that Ireland has done in respect of the "Double Irish", country-by-country reporting, automatic exchange of information and many other things that have been going on worldwide. There needs to be an OECD or G20-type broad approach, such as the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process. I am sure Senator Conway-Walsh is familiar with it. This particular proposal is a direct challenge and a risk to our corporation tax base. It is not even easy to define the digital economy but many of the proposals refer to moving it to where the populations are. We would lose and the countries with larger populations would benefit from any shifting of profits. It is a global problem. We need to look at it but we do not consider these measures appropriate. I urge the House to adopt the reasoned opinion today. We need to have it in Brussels by Thursday. </p>

          <p eId="para_172">I thought I misheard the last time. Last week at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health, I welcomed the commitment to going down the route of mandatory disclosure. It is an idea whose time is long overdue. Any more information on the when and the how of that will be welcome. I know there is legislation planned in that area. I am concerned about those women who have not been diagnosed with cancer but who may be fearful that there may be information in wrongly-read scans that could affect them and their case.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> When I asked the question about the near 12,000 telephone calls that have been made so far to the helpline, I gathered that about 50% of those calls relate to people who have not been diagnosed with cancer. If that is the case, it is a real measure of the fear out there. It is very important that people get answers as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_174"> I was also concerned to read that the gentleman in charge of the scoping inquiry, Dr. Gabriel Scally, is concerned that there is a fevered atmosphere within the Department of Health as people scramble to be ready for the grilling by the Committee of Public Accounts. That might pose some threat to the scoping inquiry and simply must not be allowed to happen. </p>
          <p eId="para_175"> I will briefly advert to what Senator Ivana Bacik had to say about last night's programme. She is right to deplore anybody calling anybody else a liar. The Senator, however, would be on stronger ground if she took the sauce for the goose as sauce for the gander approach and recalled that there were people on both sides last night who were subject to that particular accusation. It is important to not just pick our own side and sing that grievance. Dr. Peter Boylan----- </p>

          <p eId="para_188">Thank you. I was thinking of Dr. Holohan, a former dean of professional competence and a current practising obstetrician in the Rotunda, who says "the medical needs of the mother do not require the removal of the Eighth Amendment". It is a really strong statement from somebody in her position, as she regrets that "there appears to be a campaign strategy" to suggest otherwise. That is very worrying. I heard Dr. Boylan was on, unopposed, with Pat Kenny on Newstalk yet again this morning. It is now a fact that there are approximately ten or 11 obstetricians in Cork who are asking Dr. Boylan to step aside from his role as chair in light of his campaigning.</p>

          <p eId="para_199">Like others, I wanted to speak on the horrendous atrocities in Palestine over the past number of days and weeks. Nobody has a monopoly on the topic and there have been genuine comments from all sides of the Chamber on Palestine. We must recognise that. My frustration, if I am honest, comes from the fact that I have spent time there and seen how horrific conditions are for people in Palestine. One can see at first hand it is an apartheid state and we should be clear that is what it is. For a Palestinian on the West Bank, it is illegal to be a member of a political party, for God's sake. That is the extent of the discrimination.</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> My frustration is it looks as if the Government is not going to take any constructive action. Surely to God, this Chamber can come together on the Palestine issue. We have the opportunity to do so in a few weeks, as we have Senator Black's Bill. We did not get there the last time but we all know this is an ongoing atrocity of the worst kind. We can either be a talking shop about it, saying it is terrible, shaking our heads and moving on, or we can do something about it. If people do not support full boycott, divestment and sanctions, as I do, they should at least go as far as Senator Black's Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> I remind the Leader, who I think is a similar vintage to me - I hope I am not doing him a disservice - that we defeated apartheid in South Africa not through dialogue but through a powerful boycott campaign across the world that drove the regime to the table.</p>

          <p eId="para_205">Unfortunately, in this House we are all aware of the ongoing waiting lists for our citizens, many of them elderly, who are seeking outpatient procedures or surgeries. These include hip or knee replacements etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">Unfortunately, people have languished on the waiting lists for years and many of them have suffered pain and discomfort, which interfered with their quality of life. </p>
          <p eId="para_207"> The cross-border health directive is one avenue that has been pursued by many citizens and it has proved quite successful. People can avail of the option to get their procedure carried out much sooner north of the Border or, indeed, abroad. Like many of my colleagues in this House, I have been contacted many times on the cross-border health directive. The initiative has received more air time and more people have availed of it in recent times, so much so that it has been estimated that the workload of the people working in that office has increased by 1,200%. I was shocked to learn that there are only 11 people working on all of the applications made to the office by people living in this country. Clearly, more staff must be recruited to ensure that the scheme functions properly. Our focus should be on the people who have waited years for medical procedures. We must ensure that the scheme runs efficiently and that the people who wish to avail of the scheme can do so in a timely manner. </p>
          <p eId="para_208"> I understand that the staffing shortage has been raised with the HSE management at national level. I respectively ask the Leader to bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Health. As I have said, the people on the lists have waited and suffered in silence for years, many of whom are elderly. I ask the Leader to urge the Minister to deploy more staff to the office, thus ensuring that more citizens can have medical procedures carried out as efficiently as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_209">I want to raise an issue related to CervicalCheck and the human papillomavirus, or HPV, vaccine. It is unfortunate that some of the people who were to the forefront criticising the HPV vaccine programme are now to the forefront in criticising the errors in the CervicalCheck scheme. Interestingly, two of the individuals concerned appeared on a television programme recently, yet neither of them replied to the questions asked about this very issue. It is not good to have people talk out of two sides of their mouths on health issues. On the one hand, supporting people without medical evidence to support what they are saying, and on the other hand, criticising every time an issue arises when not all of the facts have been brought to the fore.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> On a positive note, there is a proposal to roll out HPV testing. I believe it is important that the scheme is brought forward. Cervical smear tests will be done in the normal way but the analysis will be conducted in an automated fashion and, therefore, the risk of human error will be completely removed. The testing has the potential to reduce false negatives by between 10% and 15% and increase the detection rate for cervical cancer by 30%. The Minister for Health has talked about the positive aspects of HPV testing. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House so that he can outline the timeline for introducing HPV testing. I want the Minister to also ensure that we have enough skilled people in place in this country to roll out the scheme and that we fast-track its introduction, thus restoring confidence in the health programme. I urge the Leader to give the issue an airing in this House at an early date. </p>

          <p eId="para_211">I am somewhat disappointed by recent events in the debate on the eighth amendment. I had felt and hoped all along that we would have a disciplined, moderate and civilised debate. I felt that we had that up to now but there has definitely been a huge dip in standards over the past weekend and in recent days.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">Last night's debate was most unedifying and was a setback for reasoned thinking. I do not believe any side gained ground, to be honest. We finished with the debate in this Chamber and in the Lower House. We did our job, which was to make a decision and hand it over to the people. That is the reason I have refrained from speaking on the issue in the Chamber since then. However, in football terms, when one sees a team playing the man and not the ball one knows that team is losing. I object very strongly to the attempted vilification of one medical expert, Dr. Peter Boylan.</p>

          <p eId="para_214">That is obviously part of the game plan for the remainder of the debate. It is most unfair. Medical opinion is divided on this, as is legal opinion, political opinion and family opinions. However, we do not attack the opposite person, try to vilify him in a personal way and try to bring his character and credentials into dispute. That should not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> I love to listen to reasoned debate from the people on the opposite side to me. If I hear that Professor Binchy is on the television I will make every effort to listen to him with respect, even though I do not agree with him. There was a great exchange of letters between him and Senator Bacik in <i>The Irish Times</i> which was really edifying. That is the level of debate I like.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> I hope Members will not use the next two weeks as an opportunity to come into the Chamber to take pot shots at individuals who are not here to defend themselves.

          <from>Senator Jerry Buttimer<recordedTime time="2018-05-15T16:35:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_217">I thank the 24 Members for their contributions on the Order of Business. Some 16 Members - Senators Ardagh, Craughwell, Black, Conway-Walsh, Bacik, Lawlor, Ó Donnghaile, Reilly, Norris, Leyden, Marie-Louise O'Donnell, Devine, Kieran O'Donnell, Horkan, Gavan and Colm Burke - raised the atrocities that took place yesterday in Gaza and the killing of innocent human life. Each of us, irrespective of the viewpoints we hold, is shocked, dismayed and extremely upset by what we saw. The one thing we must learn from history, particularly the history of this country, is that we must all work together to reach a solution, whether that is a two-state solution or otherwise. It is important to recognise that human life was lost yesterday and we must condemn it out of hand.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> The international independent investigation called for by the UN Secretary General must take place. Whether Europe plays a role, as Senator Bacik mentioned, or it is carried out by the UN does not matter. There is a need for all involved in moderating, peacekeeping and reconciliation building to come together and to ensure that Ireland plays a role in supporting whatever endeavour can be brought forward to arrive at a peaceful solution. The Government is clear about its commitment in the programme for Government. The Taoiseach spoke earlier about being profoundly shocked. I commend the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on his proactivity yesterday in his statement, on calling in the Israeli ambassador this morning and on his work in recent weeks in his capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I am happy to invite him to the House. Rather than divide the House, perhaps Senator Conway-Walsh will let me endeavour to get him to the House today, tomorrow or next week. Prior to the Order of Business today I put forward a request to him to come to the House. All Members of the House condemn the killings and wish to see an end to the bloodbath.</p>
          <p eId="para_219"> Senator Kieran O'Donnell remarked on the opening ceremony yesterday. There was a very good article in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning contrasting the celebration at one level with the killing and the loss of innocent life at another. Senator Kieran O'Donnell is right. The opening of the American Embassy in Jerusalem was divisive from day 1. It was intended to send a particular message. However, there was an unintended consequence, which was the loss of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">I commend Senators Black and O'Donnell and all Members of the House on their words today and on their work in trying to bridge the gap - and I hate using the word "gap" because it is the wrong word - in trying to bring about reconciliation and in trying to bring both sides together. This is about two sets of people. As Senator Leyden said, it is about people sharing Jerusalem for example. While we had the euphoria of Israel winning the Eurovision Song Contest on Saturday night, it is tarnished today. It is a bit like sport. I do not believe we should mix politics with sport nor should we mix it with entertainment and music. I do not believe they should be mixed and I would not support Senator Lawlor's call to boycott the Eurovision Song Contest. However, at the same time, there is a need to do something. In response to Senator Conway-Walsh, I hope we will have the Minister to the House tomorrow or next week. I ask for her co-operation in that. I am endeavouring to have him come to the House on that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_221"> Senators Ardagh, Murnane O'Connor, Mullen, Colm Burke and, indirectly, Senator Ned O'Sullivan raised the issues of cervical cancer and the eighth amendment. Although they are not linked, they can be grouped under the headings of health and the Department of Health. The words of the eminent Professor Scally are worth looking at. He said that there is a "fevered atmosphere" and that he is running into problems in being able to get information and to further his investigation. We must put that into context. I remind Senator Murnane O'Connor in her absence that last Friday the Government was, as it has always been, about the women in this case. I have been very clear, both as the Leader and in my own capacity as a Member of the House, in condemning the obfuscation and the Chinese walls which were erected. The health system must always be about the patients who require services or medical interventions, in this case the women. That is why Government put a care package in place for the women affected. That is why the Scally investigation was established. That is why we are very much of the view, as I said here every day last week, that we must hold people to account but that we must get all the facts before we do so. </p>
          <p eId="para_222"> As Senator Colm Burke rightly said, let us restore confidence in this cancer screening programme because cancer screening is so important, as is the vaccination programme. The HPV vaccination does work and it is important that we collectively send a message with regard to showing that it does work. That is why Senator Burke's point was probably the most salient point of all made today when he said that the introduction of HPV testing should be brought forward. He is right. It is about reducing the incidence of false negatives and about forensically getting the information and reducing the likelihood of the human error which we saw in this case. Automation does work. It is also about ensuring a higher detection rate. It is about women and it is about people's lives. </p>
          <p eId="para_223"> That is why all of us, on this side of the House and on the other side of the House, are absolutely disgusted by what has transpired. There is no excuse whatsoever for what happened to the women and their families. As I did last week, I condemn it again here today. All of us who are involved in politics serve to bring good to the people for whom we work and represent in our communities and in our cities and counties. That is what we must be doing at all times. I hope that the Scally investigation will get to the bottom of this matter and to the truth. We all want to ensure that the women and their families are supported to the fullest. That is what Government is about.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> Senator Craughwell raised the issue of the motion on the reasoned opinion which is before the House today. I thank Senator Horkan for his very enlightened contribution to the Order of Business which outlined what the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach has done. He outlined the number of meetings, the speakers who have been invited in and what it is trying to achieve. The function of the scrutiny of this legislation has, as Senator Horkan rightly said, been done by the committee. The motion before the House is based on its scrutiny of the directive's proposals. The Cathaoirleach of the committee, Deputy John McGuinness, and the clerk to the committee, Bríd Dunne, have written to me as Leader of the House. I have put it on the Order Paper for today at the earliest possible time. This function has been delegated by the Seanad to the joint committee under Standing Orders and the Seanad is represented by a number of Members, including Senators Conway-Walsh, Kieran O'Donnell, Horkan and Paddy Burke.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">If the Seanad does not pass this motion before Thursday, which, as Senator Horkan has said, is the deadline for submission of a reasoned opinion in this case, then it will not be using its powers under the Lisbon treaty to express a reasoned opinion. The Dáil has already passed the motion and while it is not obligatory for the two Houses to work together, it is certainly most unusual in the issue of what is being asked of us. Before the House makes a decision today, I would like Members to understand there is a limited time that we can discuss this further. The committee has done its work. If the motion is not agreed before Thursday to allow time for the reasoned opinion to be turned into the European Parliament, Commission and Council, we will miss the opportunity but I will be happy to put this matter before the House tomorrow for a debate, rather than have any uncertainty.</p>

          <p eId="para_232"> Senator Ardagh also raised the important issue of the need for safety on the Luas tracks, in particular by cyclists and she highlighted a dangerous situation that could potentially lead to loss of life and severe injury. That is a matter we should take up with the Minister and I commend her on bringing it forward to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_233"> Senators Bacik, Ned O'Sullivan and Mullen raised the issue of the eighth amendment, the debate last night and the issue around the commentary for the next ten days. I think Senator Ned O'Sullivan is correct and I know the Cathaoirleach has made an intervention this morning himself. I do not want to see Members coming into the House impugning people who are not here to defend themselves. Last night on the "Claire Byrne Live" debate, I believe there was a scurrilous attack on the professional and personal integrity of Dr. Peter Boylan. I say that having watched the programme. I am not in any way casting aspersions on Members of the House who spoke here in the debates, who spoke last Saturday at a rally, or who were out canvassing on a different side to me, none whatsoever. As Senator Ned O'Sullivan rightly said, this referendum is a personal one, it is a public one, there are divergent views and never perhaps the two shall meet. I hope that we do not allow for television or radio programmes to become a cheerleading, Hill 16-type of event like we saw last night. I did not think it was a spectacle. I did not think it helped the debate. It caused more confusion and probably did not do a service to the people who wanted to watch and listen and make up their minds accordingly. I hope that those who are not here to defend themselves will not be impugned. Senators Bacik, Mullen and Ned O'Sullivan have made their contributions. Some 81% of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists have taken a position regarding the eighth amendment and that is a fair majority. As a former Chairman of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, which dealt with the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013, we had Professor Monaghan, Senator Mullen and Dr. Boylan before the committee and I hope that for the next ten days, we will have a respectful debate on the facts. Let that be the debate, rather than a debate on personality. I condemn forcefully the attack on Dr. Boylan last night.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">I congratulate Senator Byrne on raising the issue of Gaelcholáiste Luimnigh and its Apple award and the need to highlight the ESB bursaries for Ph.D. students. They are two important events and I commend all involved. Senator Boyhan raised the issue of the National Rehabilitation Hospital. I would be happy to have that debate next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_235"> I congratulate all involved in the Leinster team on winning their fourth European title. It was a tremendous success. Last week the Minister of State with special responsibility for sport, Deputy Griffin, launched the report of Sport Ireland on the sports monitor which showed that 43% of people participate in active sport and 86% now feel they have more opportunity to be involved in sport, and the gender deficit has been closed, which is important. I would be happy to have that debate in the House. I congratulate Kevin O'Brien on his magnificent achievement of a test century yesterday and commend all involved in Irish cricket in Malahide for what was a wonderful day for Irish sport.</p>
          <p eId="para_236"> Senator Kieran O'Donnell raised the issue of the hoax calls. We all deplore the illegal, dangerous waste of time and resources by people making hoax phone calls and I would be happy to invite the Minister to come to the House to debate that matter. </p>
          <p eId="para_237"> Senator Devine raised the issue of parental involvement. The House passed a motion on the matter and we have not demurred from our response to that. It is a matter for the Health Service Executive, HSE. It gave an opinion on foot of the motion that she put forward. All we can do here is reinforce our support for the motion which we have done. It is important that there is outreach to people involved in the matter she raised and I have no issue with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_238"> Senator Gallagher raised the issue of waiting lists and I would be happy to invite the Minister to the House in that regard. If Senator Conway-Walsh will allow me I will endeavour to bring the Minister to the House. I have put the request in and I know he is not available today but we are endeavouring to bring him in sometime this week or next week. </p>

          <from>Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment (Deputy Denis Naughten)<recordedTime time="2018-05-15T16:55:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_248">I am pleased to present the Radiological Protection (Amendment) Bill 2018 to the Upper House. While this Bill is comparatively short and quite technical in nature, it will regularise matters in the area of radiological protection by amending certain sections of the Radiological Protection Act 1991, to effect the transfer of radiological functions from the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment as directed by the Government when the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment was established.</p>
          <p eId="para_249"> The Bill also includes amendments relating to ministerial powers to make regulations to establish and maintain regulatory oversight of practices involving radiation sources. These amendments will enable the transposition into law of certain articles in Council Directive 2013/59/EURATOM laying down basic safety standards for protection against the dangers arising from exposure to ionising radiation. The Bill also transfers the functions currently vested in the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment under the Containment of Nuclear Weapons Act 2003, which implements the State's obligations under the UN Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.</p>
          <p eId="para_250"> The Bill further provides for an administrative appeals process and the right to appeal to the courts to challenge decisions made by the Environmental Protection Agency on registrations or licences for the carrying out of activities involving radiation sources. This brings Ireland in line with international best practice and addresses the recommendation made by an integrated regulatory review service mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency to Ireland in 2015 to, "ensure legislation provides for appeals against the decisions of the regulatory bodies in relation to radiation safety".</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> The Bill will additionally provide that a function under the Harbours Act 1996 requiring the consent of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to exempt certain vessels carrying nuclear material otherwise prohibited from entering an Irish harbour will also be transferred by the Bill to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment as it is appropriate to that Minister. Finally, the Bill will provide for amendments to update the terminology in the 1991 Act to account for developments since that Act came into effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_252"> Before speaking on the details of the Bill, I will outline by way of background the functions of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, in regulating this area. The EPA is responsible under the Radiological Protection Acts for providing advice to the Government, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and other Ministers on matters relating to the following: radiological safety including monitoring developments abroad relating to nuclear installations and radiological safety; monitoring, measuring and assessing radioactivity contamination of the environment, including the seas around Ireland; controlling by way of licence the custody, use, manufacture, importation, transportation, distribution, exportation and disposal of radiation sources; informing the public on any matters relating to radiological safety; and supporting the development and implementation of national plans for nuclear and radiological emergencies. The EPA has a key role as regulator in ensuring that acceptable standards of practice are maintained.</p>
          <p eId="para_253"> Sections 8 and 9 of the Bill will provide the legal basis for the evolution of a one-size-fits-all system of licensing currently operated by the EPA to a risk-based graded approach to the regulatory control of radiation sources, making it a far more streamlined and appropriate system. The provisions on a graded approach to regulation are in line with the requirements of Council Directive 2013/59/EURATOM, referred to as the basic safety standards directive, which lays down basic safety standards for protection against the dangers arising from ionising radiation and with international best practice in the field of radiological protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_254"> The provisions also address the recommendation made by an integrated regulatory review service mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency to Ireland in 2015 to introduce a graded approach to the regulatory control of radiation sources. The new graded approach to authorisation of practices involving the use of radiation sources will provide a new system of registration for low-risk activities resulting in a reduction of the regulatory, financial and administrative burden for practitioners and companies engaged in such practices.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">It will also allow for a more efficient use of the regulatory resources of the EPA.</p>
          <p eId="para_256"> Section 10 of the Bill amends and clarifies the Minister’s powers to make regulations to regulate activities involving the use of radiation sources, including in response to European legislation. Specifically, the amendments provide that the Minister may make regulations for a registration and licensing system to be established and maintained by the EPA to regulate radiation sources based on the magnitude and likelihood of exposures resulting from the intended practice. Further to this, the Minister may make regulations setting out the following: safety and security requirements and conditions that must be met by the applicant seeking a registration or a licence; the procedures to be followed in the application process for the grant, renewal or amendment of a registration or licence; an administrative appeals process to ensure that clients can appeal decisions of the EPA without the expense of having to go to court to make such a challenge as is currently the case; and for the fixing of fees payable in respect of the application process.</p>
          <p eId="para_257"> Sections 11 and 12 clarify the consultation process on certain matters to account for the change in ministerial functions arising from various Government decisions since the enactment of the 1991 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_258"> Part 3 of the Bill provides for the transfer of functions under the Radiological Protection Acts and the Containment of Nuclear Weapons Act 2003 from the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and consequential amendments to ensure the orderly transfer of associated administration and business. These are technical amendments and constitute no change in policy in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_259"> Part 4 of the Bill transfers a function under the Harbours Act 1996 requiring the consent of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to exempt certain vessels carrying nuclear material otherwise prohibited from entering an Irish harbour to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment as it is appropriate to that Minister. Again, this is a technical amendment to account for a transfer of a function and does not constitute any change in existing policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_260"> The Bill completed Final Stage in Dáil Éireann on 8 May 2018. The Dáil discussion provided the opportunity for a useful exploration of the various issues regarding radiological protection generally. A particular focus was on the danger posed by radon gas. While not addressed in the Bill, I am pleased to advise that I recently launched a pilot study on the subject to inform a future legislative scheme to address the issue. I share the concerns of many Deputies about radon gas, which is an issue that has been raised in the past by colleagues here in this House. I am fully committed to introducing measures to address this serious issue and reduce the number of deaths resulting from radon. For me to introduce a scheme, I need to bring forward legislation that repeals the existing legislation set out in statute. To have robust legislation that can work in practical terms, I need to complete that pilot study in the coming months to ensure that I can bring forward legislation to ensure we have a proper radiological retrofitting scheme put in place throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_261"> This Bill will complete the transfer of functions related to radiological protection to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and will establish the legal basis for Ireland to fulfil its international obligations to ensure robust and reliable regulatory oversight of radiation sources in Ireland. Additionally, the risk-based graded approach to regulation underpinned by the provisions in this Bill will provide for a simpler, less costly and less administratively burdensome regulatory framework for both the regulator and practitioners engaged in activities involving radiation sources. I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to hearing the contributions of Senators.</p>

        <speech by="#TerryLeyden" eId="spk_129">
          <from>Senator Terry Leyden<recordedTime time="2018-05-15T17:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_262">I welcome the Minister, Deputy Naughten, to the House. I welcome the Radiological Protection (Amendment) Bill 2018. The Bill is an important step to strengthen Ireland's protections against nuclear and radiological threats, which Fianna Fáil fully supports. Fianna Fáil has always been and remains wholly opposed to any form of nuclear development within Ireland and in other places where nuclear development presents a threat to Ireland. We must remain vigilant in our approach to nuclear threats.</p>
          <p eId="para_263"> The Bill updates Ireland's existing arrangements for the management of radiological and nuclear risks, which are sorely needed given the technological changes and advances in radiological technology. The two main objectives of the Bill are, first, to move Ireland to a risk-based approach in the management of radiological technologies and, second, to complete the transfer of responsibilities for radiological protection and nuclear safety from the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government<b>
						</b>to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment<b>.</b></p>
          <p eId="para_264"> The Radiological Protection (Amendment) Bill 2018 also provides a legal basis under the principal Act for the transposition into Irish law of certain articles in Council Directive 2013/59/EURATOM. EURATOM is the main organisation in Europe for the management of nuclear energy, the development of better safety mechanisms and the research of nuclear technology.</p>
          <p eId="para_265"> On a related note, the decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union will greatly impact Ireland’s protection from nuclear disaster. Currently, the United Kingdom is subject to rigorous safety standards under EURATOM. These will cease to apply, however, when the United Kingdom leaves the European Union unless a separate agreement is negotiated, which I hope will be achieved. That is vital to the protection of Ireland’s interests. The big advantage for Ireland from a trade point of view is the fact that we are a nuclear free country. That has added greatly to the sale of our agriculture products around the world, particularly powdered baby milk from plants in Ireland where there is no threat from nuclear fallout, except the threat from across the water, which is always present.</p>
          <p eId="para_266"> Radiological technology is used in many everyday devices, for example, X-ray machines. This clearly needs to be managed, but it is also important to recognise the difference with very high-powered radiological technology. The current system of radiological control treats all radiological technology equally, something which has been deemed to be out of date and not fit for purpose by leading international experts on nuclear and radiological technologies. This Bill moves Ireland towards a graded or risk-based approach whereby lower risk technologies will simply have to be registered while higher risk activities will continue to require a licence. This approach has been recommended by the International Atomic Energy Agency integrated regulatory review service, and is in line with the EURATOM directive.</p>
          <p eId="para_267"> The Bill also completes the process of transferring responsibility for radiological-nuclear management from the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment. That technical amendment is vital as without that change, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment or the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government may be vulnerable to legal challenge in the course of consultation processes.</p>
          <p eId="para_268"> As the principal organisation with responsibility for nuclear safety standards and research in Europe, EURATOM is very important to the minimisation of the risks that nuclear energy in particular present to Ireland and the rest of Europe. Unless the United Kingdom commits to a separate agreement on this issue, EURATOM’s safety standards will cease to apply to the United Kingdom upon its departure from the European Union. Given that some of the United Kingdom’s nuclear power plants are located just 128 miles from Dublin, it is vital that this issue is addressed. Sadly, despite the Fianna Fáil spokesperson for communications repeatedly raising this issue with the Government in October of last year, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment has yet to raise it with his counterparts in the United Kingdom. If he has not done so already, it would be worthwhile if he was in communication with his opposite number in the United Kingdom. Unfortunately, he does not have an opposite number in Northern Ireland because the Executive has not been set up, which is a major mistake because he would be working with the Northern Ireland Secretary with responsibility for that area. Fianna Fáil supports the Bill. We would like to see it enacted speedily and not delayed in this House.</p>

          <p eId="para_269">I welcome the Minister to the House. He has done a fantastic job. It has to be acknowledged that this Bill is an important milestone in what is another part of the Minister's brief. This legislation, which was passed by the Dáil with the full support of all parties, is an indication not only of the support the Minister has for the Bill but also his regulatory approach to radiological protection and the licensing of such an entity.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">The Bill is working with those changes and is updating legislation that dates back to 1991. It also ties in other legislative measures that have been passed since then. We are working with the new technologies that exist, taking into consideration older legislation and putting forward a new Bill that will be more workable for Irish industry and for the State to police. It is positive legislation and I welcome it. We must move it forward and pass it as soon as possible. Hopefully, next week we can return to it and make further progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_271"> These are important legislative measures, although they might not be the headline legislative measures one will read about in <i>The Irish Times</i> tomorrow morning. This legislation is necessary for Ireland Incorporated and Irish society to move forward and to ensure we are competitive, proactive and that we can deliver when it comes to these key issues in society.</p>

          <from>Senator Rose Conway-Walsh<recordedTime time="2018-05-15T17:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_272">I thank the Minister for coming to the House to discuss this Bill, which I welcome. The Bill transfers many of the functions under the other radiological protection Acts to one Minister. It deals with nuclear safety in the State but does not deal with the threat posed by nuclear power plants in close proximity to the State. The most concerning of these is the plant formerly known as Windscale in Northumberland. Today it is called Sellafield in an attempt to bury the bad memories of the 1950s when the reactor there went on fire and emitted radioactive particles into the atmosphere for weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_273"> The emission of radioactive material from these plants does not just affect the state in which it happens. As we saw with Chernobyl in the 1980s, we are all at the mercy of the winds once material is leaked into the atmosphere. Sellafield houses the nuclear waste left over from power generation in massive cooling pools located on the Northumberland coast on the Irish Sea. It also accepts nuclear waste from outside Britain. The plant is decaying fast yet it is still accepting waste. Has the Minister raised concerns either with the British Government, the EU or the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, about the poor state of Sellafield and the continued acceptance of waste? There are plans to build the first new nuclear plant in 20 years at Hinkley Point, but there was no consultation with the Irish Government when those plans were being drawn up. In the end An Taisce had to take Britain to court. France and Germany also took cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_274"> The attitude of the Government towards the danger posed by nuclear plants in Britain appears to be very lax. What will happen when Britain is outside the EU and we cannot rely on the European courts or pressure from our EU neighbours? There are also reports that sites in the North may be used to store some of the nuclear waste that storage sites like Sellafield can no longer hold. Can the Minister give us an update on what he knows in this regard? In addition, can he give an assurance that the Irish Government is determined to keep this island nuclear free?</p>
          <p eId="para_275"> I also wish to raise the issue of radon gas emissions in residential houses. County Mayo has some of the highest numbers of properties where the presence of radon is above the reference levels. Radon is naturally occurring in the rocks but in large concentrations it can have detrimental effects on health. Information is key. Radon tests, detectors and barriers can make properties safe. Without wishing to scaremonger, it is important that homeowners and people seeking to buy a house have all the available information. I am aware that there are questions on the conveyancing form that is filled out when a house is being sold about the presence of radon and whether any remediation work has been carried out. Are there any plans to formalise this in legislation? Homeowners who bought their properties in the last 15 years do not know if their house has a radon barrier. I understand that from last year, all new houses have this radon barrier. However, what about the almost half a million houses that were constructed during the so-called boom? How do people know if their house has a barrier? Many of the developers who built these houses have disappeared and it is very difficult to find out if there is a barrier without major disruptive work being carried out on the house to find out.</p>
          <p eId="para_276"> Are there any plans for some type of remediation scheme for this? In the Dáil recently the Minister said that a pilot scheme had commenced in six locations and that €75,000 had been set aside for it. Where are these locations and how is that pilot scheme progressing? If successful, is the Minister hoping to get the necessary funding to continue it? This issue will be with us for a long time into the future, longer than the lifetime of a dwelling, so we need a long-term strategy to get the information and to act on it.</p>

          <from>Senator Colm Burke<recordedTime time="2018-05-15T17:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_277">I welcome the Minister and thank him for bringing this legislation forward. In one sense it is a transfer of functions from one Department to another but it is also about tidying up existing legislation and strengthening regulation. That is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_278"> The Bill transfers certain functions from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, as well as some functions under the Harbours Act 1996. With regard to the Harbours Act, there is no reference in this Bill to the transportation of radioactive material. I presume it is covered under the air transport legislation but what regulation do we have for that area? How do we supervise it? There has been criticism previously of flights that go through Shannon Airport, for example. In the case of shipping we know exactly what is involved, but do we have any checks and balances in respect of the airline sector and the transport of radioactive material or goods that might contain such material? Where does that fit into the regulation? I do not see a reference to it in the Bill. Perhaps it is already covered by the legislation covering the airline industry. It would be interesting to have that clarified.</p>
          <p eId="para_279"> We can sometimes take our eye off the ball in this regard because we believe everybody else is keeping an eye on it and that there are proper safety measures all over the place. However, at times a recheck is necessary to ensure we have the checks and balances in place especially with regard to something like this where if something goes wrong the effects can be really detrimental. We must be extremely watchful and careful in that context. I welcome the legislation bringing the regulation under one Department rather than it being spread over a number of Departments, but the issue with the airline area is something on which I seek clarification.</p>

        <speech by="#DenisNaughten" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Climate_Action_and_Environment" eId="spk_133">
          <from>Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment (Deputy Denis Naughten)<recordedTime time="2018-05-15T17:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_280">I will try to answer as many of the questions raised as possible. First, I thank the Senators for their contributions and constructive input to the debate. As I said earlier, the Bill primarily effects the transfer of radiological functions from the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, as directed by the Government decision when the Department was established. Additionally, the risk-based graded approach to regulation, underpinned by the provisions in the Bill, will provide for a simpler, less costly and less administratively burdensome regulatory framework for both the regulator and practitioners engaged in activities involving radiation sources. The Bill further deals with technical issues to provide a legal basis for Ireland to fulfil its international obligations to ensure robust and reliable regulatory oversight of radiation sources in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_281"> As regards the issues raised, I will first refer to the regulations regarding radon barriers. The building regulations date back to 1998 and all new houses built since 1998 have a radon barrier. That is the legal situation. Every house that was constructed since 1998 should have a radon barrier in place. The provision under conveyancing is not provided for in legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">It is in the Law Society's guidelines so there is pretty much a standard procedure in that regard. It identifies this is an issue in circumstances where a property is being sold or transferred. It is identified and flagged at that stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_283"> That neatly leads me to the issue of the pilot scheme. My intention was to bring forward, as part of this legislation, a provision to introduce a scheme for the retrofitting of homes to deal with radon gas. The Department was established two years ago and the legislation is only coming forward now. For the past 12 months, it was my intention to have, when the legislation came forward, a specific provision to put in place a scheme to retrofit homes to deal with radon gas. The problem, however, is that this is already in primary legislation and the only way I can bring forward a scheme is to have it on a statutory basis. Moreover, the existing legislation must be repealed and an actual scheme must be put in place. The difficulty with the current primary legislation is that it is not fit for purpose in practical terms. To try to overcome this challenge, we decided to have a pilot initiative and, based on that, draft the primary legislation allowing us to roll out the scheme across the country. My intention, as Minister, is to have a national scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_284"> The areas covered by the pilot are counties Roscommon and Galway. We have picked 1,400 houses in the region. The reason we picked these locations is that they contain areas with very high radon levels and others with very low levels. Rather than having the contractors involved in doing the work travelling the length and breadth of the country and spending more money on travel than retrofitting houses, and because we want this turned around quite quickly, we allocated a sum of €75,000 to test in areas with high, low and medium levels of radon. The objective is to examine the test take-up rate, costs, challenges and barriers. All 1,400 homeowners have been written to at this stage. The pilot covers Tuam in the north, Loughrea in the south and the area as far as Ballinasloe and up to Castlerea. On foot of that, the objective is to come forward with the amending legislation to roll out a national scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_285"> That number of homes - 1,400 - is only the tip of the iceberg in counties Roscommon and Galway, where there are problems. County Mayo has a particular problem and west Galway has a considerable problem. Since the radon map was first published a number of years ago, I have raised this matter. I am determined to introduce a scheme for the entire country in order that we can actively encourage people to have the test carried out and participate in the scheme to carry out the remedial works required. I understand the costs will not be very prohibitive. Let us see what comes back from the pilot initiative. I hope that, with the agreement of both Houses, we can pass the legislation quite quickly. That is what I am determined to do. The reason for this is that, every week, five to six people are diagnosed with lung cancer as a direct result of exposure to radon gas. That is just not good enough. Radon is the main cause of lung cancer deaths after smoking. I, for one, am very concerned about this and I am very anxious to see it addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_286"> In Northern Ireland, a decision to host a geological disposal facility would be a matter for the Northern Ireland Executive, taking into account planning and environmental considerations. According to the report by the UK Government, the functions relating to the management of radioactive waste in the United Kingdom are devolved from the UK Government to the devolved Administrations. In addition to an area having the right geology, community acceptance is also required. Previously, a site identified in Cumbria in England was rejected because it did not have the support of the local council. In the context of Northern Ireland, therefore, the Northern Executive would have a role in this regard. The UK report notes that such a decision would be 15 to 20 years away. Therefore, any such decision is a long way away but the Northern Ireland Executive will have a direct role in this regard. It is written into the UK procedures that there must be local support. This will be determined by the people in Northern Ireland for the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_287"> Members referred to Brexit, the United Kingdom and what will happen after the latter leaves the European Union. As members know, the United Kingdom has formally notified the European Union of its intention to exit from the terms of the EURATOM Treaty in addition to leaving the European Union. The United Kingdom, however, remains a member of EURATOM and the UK nuclear industry remains subject to oversight by EU institutions. It is likely that the UK will remain subject to that oversight during any transition phase, which is projected to last for two years following the exit in March of next year. Post Brexit, the United Kingdom will continue to be a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency. In fact, the chief executive of the agency was here with me last week or the week before. The agency establishes and monitors adherence to standards and nuclear safety, security and safeguards. Therefore, in respect of the various conventions, partnerships, agreements and intergovernmental treaties under the auspices of the agency, Ireland will continue to play a role in directly analysing and peer reviewing UK nuclear safety procedures to ensure the United Kingdom meets its international obligations. I have exchanged correspondence with UK Minister Richard Harrington, the undersecretary for industry, on the future relationship between the United Kingdom and Ireland after Brexit. The United Kingdom is committed to ensuring that nuclear safeguards under the direction and supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency will continue after Brexit.</p>
          <p eId="para_288"> With regard to Sellafield, there are a number of significant hazards at the site. These are recognised by industry, its regulators and the Irish authorities. Sellafield has the largest inventory of radioactive waste in Europe, some of which is stored in ageing facilities. The circumstances are acknowledged by the UK authorities as requiring active hazard-reduction programmes. In light of long-standing concerns about the potential for an incident at Sellafield to affect Ireland, the Government commissioned a team of international nuclear experts to undertake a probabilistic risk assessment, PRA, of Sellafield. This assessment considered a wide range of events, including operator error, earthquakes, fires, floods, meteorite strikes and terrorist attacks. The assessments included incidents caused by internal events, such as a fire within the facility. The PRA found that while internal events such as a fire could lead to significant releases within the site and surrounding area and the potential for injuries and deaths among site personnel, they would not lead to significant contamination reaching Ireland. The PRA also considered more severe external events, such as a meteorite or aircraft crashing into a facility and causing the dispersion of radioactive material into the atmosphere. The assessment concluded that such events would not lead to contamination levels in Ireland high enough to cause observable health effects here but would require the introduction of food-related and agricultural protective actions in Ireland, causing significant socioeconomic impacts.</p>
          <p eId="para_289"> Ireland has in place a national emergency plan for nuclear accidents. It is designed to deal with the consequences of such events and includes arrangements for the introduction of appropriate preventive protective actions for people and the food chain. At Government level, there is a formal agreement between the United Kingdom and Ireland for early provision of information in the event of a nuclear accident. There are also regular meetings of officials from both Governments to discuss nuclear issues. At technical level, the EPA meets at least annually with the UK nuclear regulators, the Office for Nuclear Regulation and the Environment Agency, and maintains regular contact with them in case of incidents or other developments of interest at nuclear sites in the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">There is a standing agenda item on nuclear power plants, both Sellafield and new nuclear plants, at the twice yearly meeting of the UK and Ireland contact group on radiological matters. We get an ongoing update on the issue at those twice yearly meetings.</p>
          <p eId="para_291"> On Senator Colm Burke's point about transport by air or sea, transport of radiological material is subject to licence under the Radiological Protection Act 1991. Council Directive 2011/70/EURATOM sets out the safety requirements for radioactive waste. Council Directive 2006/117/EURATOM sets out the legislative framework for transport of sources of radiation by sea and by air.</p>
