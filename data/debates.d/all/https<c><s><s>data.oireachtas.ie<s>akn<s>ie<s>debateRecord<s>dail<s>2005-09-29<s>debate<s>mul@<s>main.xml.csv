I will call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I wish to request the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of urgent national importance, namely the need for the Government to honour its election promise and programme for Government by introducing maximum class guidelines to ensure the pupil-teacher ratio for children under nine years of age is below international best practice of 1:20. Government inaction on the issue of overcrowded classrooms is extremely damaging to the life chances and career prospects of the primary school pupils affected.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	4	It is proposed to take No. 14a, motion re referral to joint committee of proposed approval by Dáil Éireann for a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing for the period 2007-13 the specific programme “Civil Justice” as part of the general programme “Fundamental Rights and Justice”; No. 15, motion re membership of committee; and No. 6, Diplomatic Relations and Immunities (Amendment) Bill 2005 — Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 14a and 15 shall be decided without debate. Private Members’ business shall be No. 46, motion re proposed new prison site at Thornton Hall, County Dublin, to be taken immediately after the Order of Business and to conclude after 90 minutes.

Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 14a and 15, motion of referral to joint committee re civil justice programme and motion re membership of committee agreed?

Sinn Féin is opposed to No. 14a being taken without debate, and being referred to committee without debate. We are in the first week of a new term and this is one of a series of motions relating to justice and home affairs that have been referred to committee without debate throughout all of the preceding terms.I understand the import of these issues is not properly realised by many people and it is important that we have a full debate on all matters that refer to civil justice issues. They are part of a wider programme of fundamental rights and justice. The objective is to create a European area of justice in civil and commercial matters. All of this is occurring in the absence of harmonisation of fundamental rights. We believe it is essential to have a full participatory debate with all of the information on the floor of the House, not only on this matter but on all related issues because they affect every citizen.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19191	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I wish to raise two health issues with the Tánaiste. Deputy Kenny yesterday referred to the apparent lengthy delay we now face to introduce legislation to regulate standards in private nursing homes. We had an extraordinary series of revelations with regard to nursing homes——

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19191	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I wish to make the point that this House will become irrelevant if it works itself up into a steam on the need to address an issue such as this, gets promises from the Taoiseach and Tánaiste, as I have documented here, that there would be legislation on this at the end of summer and debate on it now, and then finds it is not on any list.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	10	The Deputy should ask questions on legislation.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19191	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	11	There is an issue here. The Tánaiste and Taoiseach made solemn promises to the House. Not only did they promise it would be done, but that it would be done in the autumn and we would get to grips with what everyone recognised as a scandal. We need an explanation for the delay.My other question is what legislation will we see on the future development of hospitals. The taxpayer has been asked to treble health spending on the promise that waiting lists and chaos in accident and emergency departments would end. Now the proposal appears——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	12	The Deputy should ask questions on promised legislation only.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19191	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	13	Yes, the promised legislation——

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19191	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	15	The Minister's idea is that tax relief for private hospitals will be the basis for expansion in the health sector. We understand 16 such hospitals are waiting, the average contribution from the taxpayer——

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19191	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	17	It does. The Minister for Finance promised this issue would be reviewed under tax——

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19191	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	21	May I finish asking the question?

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19191	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I am trying to put the question. Taxpayers will have to fund 40% of the cost of these new private hospitals——

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19191	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	25	——and the Dáil must have an opportunity to scrutinise those decisions. They cannot be simply announced outside the House when we have not had an opportunity to scrutinise them.

The legislation is not on the A list because the Bill has not yet been cleared by the Government.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	29	To answer Deputy Bruton's question, considerable work is being done in the Department of Health and Children on this matter. We have an inspectorate but it does not have statutory backing and the idea is to put that on a statutory footing.On the second matter, that does not require legislation. The idea is to create up to 1,000 additional public beds——
#PadraicMcCormack	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-party	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-dob	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	30	They closed 60 beds in Galway.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	31	——by taking private beds out of the public hospital system.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19191	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	34	Will it be later this year?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	35	I cannot answer that question until it is cleared by the Government.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19191	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	36	Will we have it this autumn?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	37	There will be a lot of legislation on this general area this autumn, yes.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19191	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	38	The answer is "no".

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	43	The purpose of this was to deflect from the way the Minister spent €30 million on a farm worth €6 million.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	44	Deputy, it does not arise on the Order of Business. As I pointed out to Deputy Bruton, I do not want to take up the time of the House reading Standing Order 26 to Deputies who know it off by heart. I ask the Deputy to stay within the Standing Order.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	45	I will stay within it.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	51	——and what we get is a series of threats against RTE.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	57	I will deal with that matter after the Order of Business. With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I wish to thank Members and staff in the House for their expressions of sympathy on the very sudden death of the General Secretary of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, Dermot Hamilton. I am sure the House will join me in offering condolences to his wife, Patricia, and his teenage daughter, Kelly. Members of the House will understand that the loss of a general secretary to any political party is traumatic but to lose a general secretary in his 40s due to a sudden heart attack on his way into work is very difficult to come to terms with on a personal as well as a political level. I thank the Members of the House once again. I would like to remember Dermot Hamilton and the pressures that are on all of us involved in political life. Our thoughts are with his family at this time.I want to raise a matter on promised legislation which the Tánaiste may know more about than most given that the area in question is close to her own base. I realise the Abbotstown Sports Campus Development Authority Bill is on the pink list but this is the fifth time it has been promised for this session. Is there any credibility in having it on the pink list given that it is the fifth time to be in that position? Is there any light at the end of that particular tunnel?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	58	On my own behalf and on behalf of the Government, I express my sympathy to the Green Party on the sudden death of its General Secretary, Dermot Hamilton, and to his wife and daughter. I did not know Mr. Hamilton personally but his premature and untimely death is a huge loss to his family and to the Green Party, whose members have all our sympathy in that regard.The intention is to bring forward the legislation the Deputy referred to this session.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19191	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	59	A Cheann Comhairle, I am pleased that you have given me the opportunity to sympathise on behalf of the Fine Gael Party with the Green Party's severe loss and what must be a tragedy for Mr. Hamilton's family. To lose someone at any stage in their life is always a tragedy but to lose someone so young is very difficult to take and our sympathies are with the Green Party and with the family.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	60	I join with colleagues in the House in communicating, as I have done privately, the condolences of the Labour Party and myself to the Green Party and to the family of Dermot Hamilton on his premature and untimely death.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	67	Do not apologise, a Cheann Comhairle. I am delighted to be mistaken for somebody so much younger than myself.Does the Tánaiste believe it is acceptable to tell us that a good deal of legislation on the elderly will be brought forward when the programme of legislation before us does not indicate that will be the case?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	68	It is totally misleading.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	69	It is misleading. We have a programme of legislation which refers to one Bill relating to the elderly. It concerns nursing home subventions, which is welcome, but that is all we have. Yesterday, I raised the very important issue of the repayments to elderly people who were robbed of money by the State over a lengthy period and who are getting older by the day. The Taoiseach was characteristically vague yesterday as to what would happen to that legislation. It is the Tánaiste's responsibility. Do we have a guarantee from her, notwithstanding that it is absent from the section on legislation, that this legislation will come before the House this term to ensure people can get their money back to which they are entitled?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	70	I said earlier that there would be a huge focus from the Government's perspective on care of the elderly issues, many of which do not require legislation. On the specifics about the repayments, the legislation will be published next year. It is major legislation.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	71	It states 2005 in this programme.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	79	No, Deputy. We are correcting something that was illegal for 29 years. A total of 15,000 cases have been assessed already. It is not the case that no work has been done but as I told the House and the Deputy previously, we have gone to tender to get a company with experience in mass claims to assist in the design of the scheme. That process is almost concluded but because of public procurement and timing issues, it was not possible to conclude it earlier. That company is very much involved in assisting us with a view to ensuring the legislation is appropriate for what we are trying to do.

If the Deputy wants me to read out Standing Order 26 I will do so. The Deputy knows the ways in which he can raise the matter, including submitting a question to the Minister or raising the matter on the Adjournment.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	87	This is outrageous. There are people waiting for refunds. The Tánaiste promised the refunds would be made. It is now one year later.

The sad passing of Mr. Hamilton reminds me that there is a report on sudden cardiac arrest commissioned by the Minister for Health and Children. When will this be published?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	90	I will communicate with the Deputy concerning the second matter. With regard to the first matter there is no specific legislation promised.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	93	I do not believe it will. Concerning home help services, the figure increased from £13 million in 1997 to €120 million this year.

Will the Tánaiste clarify if legislation is necessary regarding a redress board for those women mutilated in the obstetric and gynaecology unit at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda? If legislation is necessary will the Tánaiste indicate how quickly it will be introduced given the urgency in that case?Concerning GP-only medical cards, will the Tánaiste indicate if it will be necessary to introduce legislation to facilitate——

Some 200,000 people have been promised these and repeated timeframes have passed.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	105	Concerning the second point the answer is no.

This concerns implementing the commitment of the programme for Government to consolidate the Minerals Development Act and to update legislation in line with reform proposals of delivering better Government. We are all anxiously awaiting the deliverance of better government. When is that Bill likely to surface? It is pertinent at this time and covers a wide area, including delivering better government.

#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	110	Why was no explanatory memorandum given with a Bill listed for consideration today, namely the Diplomatic Relations Immunities (Amendment) Bill? This legislation has been held up for 15 years. It is a response to a Supreme Court decision some 20 years ago. It took 15 years to draft this short Bill yet there is no explanatory memorandum to explain the context of the Vienna Convention, immunity and specifically the Supreme Court decision. It seems a sloppy presentation given the time available.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	111	I accept it is usual not to have an explanatory memorandum but there are times we do not have explanatory memoranda with legislation. I am sure the Deputy is more than familiar with the legislation and I do not know why the Department chose not to provide an explanatory memorandum in this case.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	112	I was aiming for a higher standard.

When this Dáil began its first autumn session three years ago a strategic national infrastructure Bill was promised within six months. Three years later we have not seen that Bill and we are promised it will be delivered in early 2006. How can we have confidence in this Government if a Bill to speed up the provision of infrastructure is still promised three years later?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	115	It will be brought forward in the form of a planning Bill next year.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	117	The question I intended asking concerned the national consumer strategy agency Bill but Deputy Hogan has already raised this. This agency was the main plank of the Government response to the rip-off Ireland analysis. Can the Tánaiste put pressure on her colleague to bring this in before the end of the year, as promised, so the agency can be put on a statutory basis?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	118	If an agency could do all that Deputy Howlin expects——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	119	I was quoting the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	123	No it does not. For many years Governments have been promising legislation in this area. We will have legislation in this area as soon as possible.
#JamesBreen	unknown-#JamesBreen-party	unknown-#JamesBreen-dob	unknown-#JamesBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	124	Did the Tánaiste mislead the House in reply to Deputy Rabbitte? He asked if the Hanly report would be implemented and she said it would. The Taoiseach came to Clare and said the Hanly report would not be implemented by this Government. Did the Tánaiste mislead the House in her reply to Deputy Rabbitte? This also refers to a parliamentary reply to me when she said the Hanly report would be implemented and the Taoiseach said it would not be.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	125	I suggest the Deputy submit a further question to the Minister for Health and Children. It is not appropriate on the Order of Business as we cannot have an omnibus question time on the Order of Business.
#JamesBreen	unknown-#JamesBreen-party	unknown-#JamesBreen-dob	unknown-#JamesBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	126	Can a Minister mislead the House and not answer? Did the Tánaiste mislead the House?

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	135	On the case of Dean Lyons, the innocent man who confessed to a murder he could not have committed when in Garda custody, was charged, had the charges withdrawn with someone else subsequently confessing to the same murder, will the Tánaiste say if there is any truth in the story in today's edition of The Irish Times that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is proposing to set up an inquiry under the commission of inquiry legislation of 2004 but he cannot get the money from the Minister for Finance?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	136	It is not a question of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Finance being in any disagreement in regard to this matter. However, if a commission is to be established, resources must be made available so it can succeed. That process of discussion between the Ministers is under way.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	137	Arising from the Tánaiste's reply to Deputy Cuffe about the infrastructure Bill, I understand the national development plan is currently being reviewed. Which will come first, the review of the national development plan or the publication of the crucial infrastructure Bill?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	138	I am not in a position to say. I do not know.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	141	In light of the recent legal experience with which the Government had to contend, is it intended to put the process of public private partnerships on a statutory basis to avoid the kind of mistakes that are made in other areas?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	142	I am not aware of proposals for legislation in that area.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	144	The Minister has already made an announcement in that regard.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	147	It is important to remind the House that he made the same mistake on the Dean Lyons case until he had to backtrack on it. He will also have to backtrack on the Rossiter case.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	149	Why has the alcohol products Bill been scrapped? If the voluntary code about which the Taoiseach spoke yesterday does not work, and I suspect it will not work, will it be re-introduced? As I said yesterday, it is the biggest problem we face in terms of a drugs problem.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	150	The reason it is not proceeding is because voluntary codes have been agreed.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	152	That is a different matter. We will examine the possibility of legislation.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	153	That is disgraceful. The Minister has sold out to the alcohol industry in this case. It is disgraceful for the Minister for Health and Children to operate in that way.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	154	What is the status of the ombudsman (amendment) Bill, which was first promised on the legislative programme of October 2002 to be introduced in 2003? In the recent programme, it is supposed to be published by late 2006. Is it the Government's intention to introduce this Bill? Perhaps it is just to fill up the space on the legislative programme each time it is published.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	155	The intention is late next year.

These regulations cover the Health Bill 2004. The Taoiseach said yesterday that these regulations will be introduced this year but I believe he was referring to different legislation. The regulations covering the parliamentary unit were supposed to come under the Health Bill 2004. It might give us some hope of getting answers to the simple questions asked. The Tánaiste said she would give me the figures in July.

The Tánaiste said private beds will be taken out of public hospitals.

This is the approach the Opposition is currently adopting. The Opposition reminds me of a pack of jackals attacking a herd of mighty beasts. The jackals snipe and bite at loose prey until they get a good kick up the yard and they run away. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform gave the Opposition that good kick up the yard yesterday.As Deputy Costello is aware, the inmates of Mountjoy are represented in great numbers by constituents of his own and constituents of mine. Their interests are very much in my heart in discussing this matter. I am sure they are also in the heart of Deputy Costello.Deputy Costello and I visited Mountjoy in the not too distant past. We saw the facilities available in the men's prison whereby there is overcrowding, no toilet facilities and no facility for inmates to eat in a comfortable refectory and who must bring their food back to their cells. Young people are supposed to be rehabilitated in St. Patrick's Institution. They are supposed to have facilities to enable them to exercise, but there are none. Dóchas was a fantastic establishment when it was built, and it still is. However, it is too small. It is not sufficient for the numbers of female prisoners in Mountjoy. Even though the training unit is fairly new, it is not sufficient for modern-day use to train and rehabilitate prisoners who go there.It must be ensured facilities are in place so people who do the crime also do the time. When the rainbow coalition Government was in power in the mid-1990s, the able and competent Minister for Justice, Nora Owen, tried to address this issue but the rug was pulled from under her by her colleagues in the Fine Gael and Labour parties.The population is increasing and that will result in the need to accommodate more prisoners. Mountjoy Prison is not capable of accommodating that number of people. The job satisfaction of prison officers for the work they ably and completely do is an issue but their overtime bill must be reduced. Automatic gate opening and other modern practices must be embraced so that prison officers are not required to lock and unlock doors repeatedly. Procedures must be implemented, which will result in savings of €25 million per year in overtime. This would also allow prison officers to get more satisfaction from their work and would allow them to participate more in the rehabilitative process, which is needed in the prison system.Drugs in prisons are also an issue. Unfortunately, drugs are prevalent in Mountjoy Prison. Given the prison campus is small access to drugs is too easy.

Rather than restating the points he made, although there are points that require repeating to nail the lie of impropriety in the purchase of the site, I will address three issues raised in the Opposition motion: the so-called haste and lack of examination of the deal; the so-called exorbitant cost; and the so-called unsuitability of the location.I refer first to the claim that the process that led to the selection and purchase of the site at Thornton Hall was too hasty. The announcement that the Mountjoy Prison complex would be replaced was made at the beginning of 2004. Advertisements were placed nationally for interested parties to come forward with potentially suitable sites. A special committee was then established to review all submitted sites and make its recommendations thereon. This committee comprised representatives of the Office of Public Works, the Irish Prison Service and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. To provide added property expertise, the committee availed of the advice of the prestigious and highly respected firm of CB Richard Ellis Gunne, where, when necessary, professional planning and engineering advice was available and utilised. Details of the process followed by the committee are in the public domain and readily available on the Department's website. A contract to purchase the site was entered into in January 2005. That could not be described as "unseemly haste".

The expert group considered a great number of locations in Dublin and adjoining counties, before it made its final recommendation. Let us closely evaluate the cost. An open, transparent and objective public procurement procedure was utilised. More than 30 sites were put forward and assessed. The average asking price was €200,000 per acre but as much as €500,000 per acre was sought. A great deal has been said about the alternative site, Coolquay, and how "this site should have been selected and purchased". Because of a problem with capital gains tax, the vendor of the Coolquay site wrote to the property adviser in the Department and stated, "to advise that he is not proceeding further with the sale of the lands and has asked that all arrangements with the Department of Justice now terminate". What does the Opposition not understand about this terminology? The vendor decided he did not wish to proceed with the sale. This meant the committee and the Department had no site.During the period of selection within the Dublin area, an offer of a site in County Meath was made by Dillon Auctioneers on 14 September 2004. This was rejected on 16 September as unsuitable. However, on 20 December, one day before the letter of withdrawal on Coolquay was received by the property adviser, the same auctioneer again wrote to the Irish Prison Service offering Thornton Hall, which is 2,500 yards from the Coolquay site. The Coolquay vendor withdrew the following day. The vendor made the decision to withdraw, not the auctioneer, and nobody else was responsible for the decision.With no other suitable site on the horizon, the IPS and the expert adviser spoke to the Dunshaughlin auctioneer with a view to the purchase of the Thornton Hall site. The same criteria used in the selection process and original applications were applied to this land. The committee recommended the purchase of Thornton Hall. It was the least expensive suitable site considered by the selection committee.I refer to a case in my county. The NRA and local authority sought tenders for a reasonably lucrative contract. Only one application was received and it was decided to proceed with it with a view to awarding the contract. When the individual discovered he was the sole applicant, he attempted to double the tendered amount. The sale of the Coolquay site was similar. When vendors are dealing with the State, they think they can demand any amount. The owner of Coolquay got caught. I despise Opposition Members for working on behalf of vested interests, something which they accuse the Government of doing constantly. It is reprehensible that they should conduct business in this manner.

No community will welcome a prison in its area. The Minister had to grasp this nettle as soon as possible. He should be complimented on his efforts to reform the prisons, for example, he has dealt quite well with the overtime situation.On entering the Seanad in 1989 I became spokesman on justice for several years. I had the opportunity to visit Mountjoy Prison twice, once as a member of the legal profession, and on an official visit. The appalling conditions in which prisoners are held in Mountjoy Prison were condemned in the 1970s but nothing was done about it. There has been a great deal of rhetoric in this House and elsewhere about improving the prison. Now there is an opportunity to relocate the prison to a site that will provide adequate space for exercise and accommodation and will be to some extent humane.We all talk about the rights of prisoners and their need for proper accommodation. This is a major issue. The Minister is trying to tackle many issues in Mountjoy and in other prisons. Unfortunately, it seems to be as easy to get drugs inside of prison as outside. In a new prison environment with proper procedures and scanning of visitors there is a chance to change this. It is easy for a prisoner to bring a supply of drugs into prison with him. Any person starting a prison sentence should be isolated for seven to ten days to ensure drugs are not passed from one prisoner to another.The people living in the neighbourhood of Thornton Hall will have certain concerns about a prison being built, but that would be the case wherever a prison was sited. The Minister has taken a brave step and the price is reasonable. If this sale does not proceed, or if planning permission is refused or the development fails for some other reason, any Government will find it impossible to acquire a site of that scale for a prison anywhere in the country.Without condemning the work of RTE, the "Prime Time" programme was selective. It did not track the full negotiations or the independent advice given to the Minister and the selection committee since the question of buying a greenfield site for a prison was initiated. That type of selective broadcasting by our national broadcaster is regrettable because it gives a slanted view rather than the fair and balanced view to which the public is entitled.This Minister is the first Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to realise that the conditions in Mountjoy Prison and other prisons cannot be allowed to continue. The cost of keeping a prisoner in Mountjoy Prison is in the region of €100,000 per annum. Despite that expenditure conditions there are deplorable. Someone said they are more akin to those prevailing in the 19th century than to the 21st century, a view with which I concur.The Minister's decision to proceed with this project is welcome and brave. In a decade when the job is done and the prison is built, like other projects condemned in the past, it will be regarded as a wise move.

I speak not only as a public representative for a major population centre but as a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. My colleagues on the committee include Deputies Costello and Jim O'Keeffe to whose wisdom I am always happy to listen.We are all concerned about the antiquated prisons. I recently visited Wheatfield Prison at the invitation of two families. Whatever one might say about the need to deal with criminal justice, people being punished should serve their time in a decent humane environment where it is possible to run proper programmes to cater for their educational, physical and psychological needs. I do not have as much experience of visiting prisons as some of my colleagues but I hope the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights will take the opportunity to visit more prisons. That is important, as we said yesterday.Wheatfield is an example of facilities as they should be for those who must spend some time in prison. Members have referred to drugs in prison. When I visited Wheatfield and spoke to the two young men with whom I spent some time I was profoundly struck by their wish to be housed in what they regarded as a drug-free landing. There are difficulties in that regard and we need to ensure that those who do not wish to use drugs have an opportunity to stay away from them.Deputy O'Donovan covered the difficulties that exist for any community in which a prison has been located. I sympathise with the community group making their point about this; that is their democratic right. Mountjoy Prison, however, has outlived its use and must be replaced. We must provide state-of-the art facilities for prisoners to ensure that they serve out their sentences in a humane environment. That includes making provision for them to have visits with their families and so on.I wish to spend a few moments on the proposals regarding the Central Mental Hospital. I do so as a long-serving member of the former Eastern Health Board and its successor, having first joined in 1994. I had the opportunity of visiting the Central Mental Hospital several times. It is not too dramatic to say that those of us who visited it on those occasions were always greatly shocked by what we saw. If it is true that Mountjoy has outlived its usefulness, there can be no question regarding the Central Mental Hospital.I hope those proposals are being dealt with and that the proper consultation will take place. The Government, when it decided in principle in December 2004 to locate the new Central Mental Hospital on a site adjacent to the new prison, said it would be subject to further study. I hope the Minister can confirm that the study is under way.We must remind ourselves that the Central Mental Hospital is a health facility and must be dealt with as such. I am glad the Government made a commitment at the time that it would remain in the ownership and control of the Department of Health and Children and would be managed by the Health Service Executive. It is very important that it be in place so the separation of the two facilities is understood. I do not know whether the Minister is able to provide assurances in that regard today, but we need continual reassurance. I hope that, as the process develops, the Minister will find a regular opportunity to keep the Dáil and its Members fully up to date with developments regarding the prison facility.It is good that we have had this debate. Other colleagues have referred to television programmes, media coverage and so on. I will not go into that, except to say that ultimately the public will accept that Mountjoy must be replaced and that this proposal is worthy of implementation.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	204	Táim an-bhuíoch den Leas-Cheann Comhairle as ucht an seans a thabhairt dom labhairt ar an ábhar tábhachtach seo.As a member of the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, I am by now well known as a vehement promoter of restorative justice, whereby offenders, particularly first-time offenders, are given the chance to make amends to their local community. As a founding member of the Nenagh community reparation project, I am very much in favour of keeping people out of prison and giving community members every chance to make amends to those offended against and better their lives outside a prison environment. However, one lives in the real world and knows it is not always possible. Unfortunately, in a prison environment people are removed from society in order to protect it from them. Ever greater efforts are made to help people by rehabilitating them on the inside, training them, upgrading their skills, and sometimes helping them become literate or improve their literacy skills. In some way, they must be prepared for a return to society and have as fulfilled a life as possible.It is unfortunate that the issue of the Thornton site has developed in this way, but I hope that it is short-lived. Those of us who have visited Mountjoy agree that conditions there are not acceptable and have not been for a long time. There must be few prisons in the world by this stage where the practice of "slopping out" continues. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, is to be commended on his efforts to address this. It is easy to talk about it, but to grasp the nettle and do something about it is another matter. The Minister is to be highly commended on his work, not only in Dublin but in areas such as Cork, where improvements are being made. I would be among the first to say that current psychiatric services in prisons are anything but adequate. Space and a proper environment for the training of prisoners willing to participate must be provided.I am always suspicious of groups engaging with children and bringing them into protest movements. Yesterday I saw the protest outside the gates of Leinster House. I wonder why people take children out of school to participate in protests. In a democracy, they are more than entitled to do so, but children have no part in protests of any kind. Why they should engage children in this kind of protest is beyond me. We accept that prisons are needed. If Portlaoise were told tomorrow that its prison would close, there would be another protest, since it supports the local economy and provides jobs. The new prison will also, most importantly, provide proper state-of-the-art facilities, and that is only right.In many Departments, we have been playing "catch up" relative to other European countries, where proper facilities in schools, prisons and elsewhere are already in place. This is a very serious attempt by the Minister to consider this most suitable site. One would think the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, made this decision alone. However, we know the committee was involved. When the announcement was made, local residents were asked to meet the director general and refused. Subsequently, they met him, which was welcome. Let us remind people that the planning process will enable the needs of members of the public and local residents to be taken into account in the development of the prison, and rightly so.I commend the Minister on this. We have heard people say before that money has been wasted. The Opposition has absolutely no case whatsoever. I am still trying to remember whether it made any attempts at all to expand or improve facilities at Mountjoy. I welcome the opportunity to discuss this, and I wish we had more time to debate it more thoroughly. I commend the Minister once more on his initiative in this regard and also on his justified criticism of RTE and the economical relationship with the truth shown by its broadcasters, at which we are all disappointed.

It must be far more closely investigated than the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, might like. Having listened to him last night, I almost thought he was in the Four Courts rather than Dáil Éireann and that he imagined RTE was in the dock. That will not wash in north County Dublin, since this is not merely a financial stroke by the Government but something of a political one, given the redrawing of the boundaries of Dublin North means the community around Thornton Hall, which has traditionally been in the constituency and looked to representatives there, will become part of Dublin West.In the meantime, the Minister hopes to drive a coach and four through a considerable amount of information not to his liking. For example, he must face the intense suspicion that there is a great amount of real estate speculation here. After the Jury's sale, the value of such sites as Mountjoy, the Crumlin Central Mental Hospital, Shanganagh, Shelton Abbey and so on makes them lucrative and desirable for the many apartment-builders raising cranes above this city. Having visited Mountjoy and seen the women's prison, I feel it is absolute vandalism to suggest demolishing a prison of that standard, which has many of the facilities of which the Minister spoke. Much can be done to extend Portlaoise Prison and renovate Mountjoy, as well as looking more carefully at new sites, instead of playing poker with taxpayers' money as the Minister has done.The community of Thornton will not stand for it. The Minister has underestimated his opposition in this matter. The irony of moving what is called the Central Mental Hospital to rural farm land is not lost on people. We all understand that many prison inmates have psychiatric illnesses. However, to put a central mental hospital adjacent to or on the same campus as a prison means one is effectively equating illness with crime.

It has been a reckless example of spending in the dark, which is a habit of this Government. First, the Prisons Bill 2005 has not been passed so we do not have a coherent prisons policy. When one considers the poor access to the site and the other serious shortcomings, the cost will be far in excess of that estimated by the Government. Already, six times the market value has been paid for the site.Following last night's meeting of Fingal County Council, the site now has an architectural conservation order. This means the Government faces a negative equity of €24 million, effectively wasting taxpayers' money without even bothering to be accountable. Instead of the Minister with his courtroom contortions trying to mask his game of poker with taxpayers' money, he might turn his attention not only to the Comptroller and Auditor General but also to the complaint made by Councillor Joe Corr and I on behalf of the Green Party to the EU Commissioner for Environment, Mr. Stavros Dimas. This complaint states clearly, and has been taken seriously by the Commission, that the site has not undergone an environmental impact assessment. Such an assessment should be undertaken if the relevant directive is to be properly transposed. Instead, the site was exempted from planning permission and is similar in this regard to the Corrib pipeline fiasco. The Government is trying to get away with an inadequate planning procedure but it will not succeed.

Is trua é nár lorg siad tacaíocht ón bhFreasúra ar fad. Is scannal iomlán é seo, agus ba chóir go mbeimis ar fad gafa leis. Tiocfaidh an vóta, áfach, agus tacóimid leis an rún.As far back as last March, I wrote to Deputy Noonan, Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, recommending an investigation into the agreed purchase of Thornton Hall. In February of this year, I asked the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, the basis on which a decision was made to locate the new prison at Thornton. He responded to the effect that advertisements were placed in the national media requesting persons to come forward with proposals for potentially suitable sites and that a departmental sub-committee was assigned to consider the offers.What the Minister failed to mention in his reply was that according to a letter from the landowner in question, a letter he sent to local residents, a representative of the Government approached him wishing to make an offer on his farm. He stated he had never at any time considered putting the property on the market and he did not engage in the tendering process as outlined by the Minister.Having considered the numerous concerns raised by the local community and the Minister's answers to my questions, it is my opinion that the Comptroller and Auditor General should immediately conduct a thorough investigation into this matter and produce a written report for the Oireachtas before the Minister for Finance gives his final sanction to the purchase of Thornton Hall. The concerns on which my opinion on this matter are based focus on the fact that Thornton Hall does not meet the criteria set down by the expert group. It was posited months after the published closing date and should not have been accepted as it had not gone through the tendering process. The site was evaluated in isolation and processed with extreme haste. It was purchased for six times the market value and the decision to purchase was based on incomplete, inaccurate and misleading information. No environmental impact study was undertaken and the selection criteria used were not clear and objective.The committee's adviser overstepped his remit and there are serious concerns in regard to a possible conflict of interest and perhaps collusion in respect of this adviser, who is related to a Senator. The latter, Senator O'Toole, has a close connection to the landowner in question. Was the Senator present at the initial negotiation regarding these lands? Is it not odd that this adviser, Mr. Webster, was a guest at this year's Fianna Fáil fundraising tent at the Galway Races?An expert group spent a year in deliberations only to discard all the sites it had considered and overrule its own previous decisions in opting for a new site, all at one meeting six months after the start of the tendering process. I stand by my previous assertion in this House that the manner in which the site at Thornton Hall was purchased stinks to high Heaven. I would go further and suggest it may even have been a corrupt deal.
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	209	I support this motion which simply requests that the Comptroller and Auditor General report on the transaction to acquire the site at Thornton Hall. However, the Government's amendment makes no mention of this basic request. The question must be asked as to why the Government refuses to agree to this simple and transparent request. We can only assume it is because it has something to hide.While I accept it is unlikely that any property owner would sell a site for anything like the agricultural rate when it was already in the public domain that it was to be developed as a State prison and was being acquired for that purpose, this does not in any way excuse the grossly exorbitant price that was paid for it. Why not clear the air and allow the Comptroller and Auditor General to examine the deal? That critical issue simply has not been answered by the Government. Its amendment seems designed to divert attention away from this central issue of the apparent squandering of public money by suggesting all of this was motivated by a belated interest in the welfare of prisoners.Mountjoy Prison is in my constituency and I have visited it on many occasions and been incarcerated there twice. I fully accept the time is long overdue to provide a new prison with in-cell sanitation and modern facilities. It is clearly time to close Mountjoy Prison but it should be transferred to a location accessible to the families of prisoners, many of whom regrettably still come from inner city Dublin. The real scandal of our prisons is that the vast bulk of prisoners still come from socially disadvantaged communities. They are a constant reminder of the unequal and divided society that the mentality of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats has fostered.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	210	I support the principle of building a new prison to replace Mountjoy. While I also support the relocation and construction of a modern central mental hospital, it is totally inappropriate to accommodate both on the same campus. There are few communities that would lobby for the location of such facilities on their doorstep. That these facilities were not put through the normal planning process means the location selected must stand up to the most rigorous scrutiny. Good planning must always start by asking whether a particular site is the right place to build. Following that, consultation must take place in regard to the infrastructure needed. This location fails miserably on both counts.We have seen some recent examples of a flawed process leading to a flawed result. Inadequate testing of electronic voting machines and the flawed processes engaged in bringing gas offshore from the Corrib field are obvious examples. The failure of the relevant Ministers to listen objectively to criticism has led to a charge of arrogance. Instead of accelerating the delivery of projects, there have been costly delays and extra expenditure.The price tag of €30 million is merely a starting point. Has there been a costing for the miles of land that must be acquired for the pipeline for water, sewerage and drains? Will the local authority find itself in the unenviable position of having to divert scarce resources from other services to pay for the upgrade of local and regional roads or will a precedent be set whereby the Exchequer picks up the tab? If so, what will be the cost?Will the narrow and unsuitable roads become a headache for the security services, which must ensure that the prisoners arrive at the prison in safety? Has the location ever been considered from the point of view of prisoners' families? The public purse belongs to the public. Those who are charged with its spending carry the responsibility to make good decisions. Not all those decisions will be universally supported. Difficult but correct decisions are the business of good governance. The decision to locate the prison at Thornton Hall is a mistake. It will not stand up to scrutiny and must be reversed.

I listened to Deputy Hoctor commend the Minister for his work in the area of justice. I would remind her of the 2,000 gardaí we were to have under the programme for Government, the absence of community gardaí in many towns and villages and the lack of CCTV installations around the country. I had to smile at her suggestion that the advice of residents should be listened to in these matters in light of the Ministers' address of last April, when he said:I intend to develop a campus in north county Dublin for the purpose and I intend not to be deflected by people who produce notions of fairy ring forts in north county Dublin or architectural details of interest in city centre Dublin. I will not be deflected by all this guff.These are hardly the remarks of a man who will consult residents openly and fairly. Last night, the Minister rounded on RTE and everyone else within the firing line.The issue is not whether there should be a new prison. Clearly there should because we cannot continue the current situation in Mountjoy Prison. However issues arise in terms of accessibility for prisoners and their families, lack of infrastructure, costs and the procedures that were followed. Thornton Hall was not on the first list of 31 bids. It came into play late in the day and was agreed by means of a short process. The matter requires scrutiny and the Comptroller and Auditor General must scrutinise it. It is in everybody's interest that the report be produced.

I commend the Rolestown and St. Margaret's action group for its work. I reject the criticism of the group. For a voluntary organisation, it has acted professionally and I strongly support it.I am opposed to this prison. The Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, Deputy Ardagh, had a brass neck to put forward his position when he knows the project is ill thought out, a waste of taxpayers' money and a scandal. I am horrified that he did so. I reject the idea that €30 million of taxpayers' money can be spent on a farm valued at €4 million. The existence of a €26 million gap is an important national issue. I am currently facing difficulties in seeking a couple of million euro for my own constituency to provide services to the most disadvantaged people.I understand and support the residents' reactions to the impact this development will have on their community, environment and heritage. These are legitimate concerns. Thornton Hall is unsuitable for the proposed development. The site does not meet the criteria of the Minister's expert group on the matter. It was chosen based on incomplete, inaccurate and misleading information, following a questionable procurement procedure. The deal represents bad value for taxpayers' money. I strongly support this motion and urge all Deputies to reject the Government's proposal.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	213	The Minister's bad tempered attack on last night's "Prime Time" programme, which dealt with the purchase of lands at Thornton for six times the normal value of agricultural land in the area, was nothing more than a blatant attempt to avoid answering the key questions posed by the process of this purchase. The "Prime Time" programme went straight to the heart of the matter. What is the Minister afraid of? We simply want the Comptroller and Auditor General to examine the spending of nearly €30 million of taxpayers' money to determine whether, as we suspect, it was done improperly. What is wrong with that? If the Minister is vindicated by the Comptroller, he can come here and strut his stuff, as he is so good at doing.Important questions must be answered. Close to Christmas Eve, an estate agent who received an exorbitant fee spoke to an auctioneer. Fewer than three weeks after the end of the Christmas and New Year break, he brought that site for the first time to the expert committee meeting, which on foot of a preliminary examination of the site agreed to lash out nearly €30 million in taxpayers' funds. The Minister made much of the Clifton Scannell Emerson consultants' investigation of that site during the three weeks preceding the decision to purchase it. He is trying to use the consultants as a smokescreen. It was a preliminary investigation, as the same consultancy said two months later to the Prison Service, and not the type of detailed examination that will now be needed before the project goes ahead. The estate agent told the landowner that no more than €200,000 per acre would be paid. That is like telling him that he could successfully seek €199,999.99 per acre. It is an incredible scenario involving six times the agricultural value of the land.I reject the false counter-posing of the need to move from or refurbish Mountjoy Prison. I, with Deputy Gregory, know what Mountjoy Prison is like. I was a guest there for a period. This motion addresses the process of the purchase of this land. The procedure trampled on the democratic rights of the local community, just as the people of Rossport, County Mayo, were trampled on in terms of the shoving through without consent of a pressure pipeline. From the point of view of prisoners' families, the location is completely wrong. It is in the middle of rural north County Dublin and lacks a proper public transport infrastructure. It is ludicrous.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	214	I wish to share time with Deputy Durkan. Last night, the Minister entered the House in his usual bullying manner. The targets were not only the unfortunate residents of the area in which he wants to locate his super prison complex but RTE and the role of investigative journalism. The Minister was annoyed because he received a telephone call from RTE concerning the programme just as he was pulling on his wellington boots to attend the ploughing championships. As a Member of this House, the Minister's hero, Dessie O'Malley, was to the forefront of those seeking an inquiry into the beef industry. In his report on that issue, Judge Hamilton noted that, if the questions had been answered in the Dáil, the kind of cost the taxpayer has had to endure in regard to that tribunal and inquiry and all the subsequent tribunals and inquiries would not have been necessary. Yet when polite inquiries are made of the Minister, Deputy McDowell, in regard to how the taxpayer will have to pay extraordinary amounts of money for his pet development we are told we are not entitled to ask questions. Those who ask questions or who seek to defend their local interest are impugned and investigative journalists are to be the subject of an official complaint to the RTE authority. I presume the same Minister will complain also about Eddie Hobbs to the RTE authority for having the temerity to ask about the public purse being ripped off over and again by an incompetent Government. The simple solution to the Minister's threat in regard to the RTE authority is to accede to the modest motion by Fine Gael and Labour to have the Comptroller and Auditor General, a competent authority and independent public servant protected by the Constitution, look at the murky goings on that led to the purchase of this site at approximately five times its estimated value.Since the Progressive Democrats party became part of the current Government, it has had a policy of selling off State assets. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, is giving private hospital lands to consultants. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, has already disposed of a number of prison sites and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, is apparently selling and buying land in 70 different locations throughout the country. The Progressive Democrats party is in the business of buying and selling property in a big way. The real problem is that it has lost the run of itself.In his contribution I heard Deputy O'Connor say Wheatfield is a model modern prison. I do not know how many times he has visited that prison. It is a modern prison but is he aware that many of its prisoners would prefer to go back to Mountjoy because the level of drug abuse in Wheatfield is so great? Families whose young people are sentenced to jail there are more terrified than in regard to Mountjoy of the eventual outcome if they are not already drug abusers. Of course the male wing of Mountjoy needs to be replaced but the Wheatfield Prison complex, overseen by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform at vast cost to the State and for which the Minister is responsible, is a disgrace in any modern country in terms of drug abuse. All that expenditure has led to a prison that is overrun with drugs.The decision to close the women's prison, which cost €30 million to build, is a retrograde step in terms of Irish penal policy. There was a lobby for many years that women prisoners, many of whom come from the city centre, should be able to maintain contact with their families and, particularly, their children. The same regime should apply to male prisoners but in the case of women it has been seen as particularly necessary that this should happen. The women's prison which has gained plaudits around Europe will be transferred to a prison farm located on the far side of the M50 which has one bus service per day from Garristown and another home in the evening. That is the public transport provision.The Minister chose to scoff at the environmental and archaeological heritage of the Killsallaghan, Rolestown and St. Margaret's area. I commend the work done by the various residents' associations and, particularly, by Dr. Mark Clinton, who is a recognised national expert on archaeology. The Minister may choose to believe there are no significant archaeological remains in the area. As with much of what he talks about, the Minister does not know what he is talking about. I declare an interest here in that I am a member of Fingal Walkers. I have had the pleasure of walking this site on many occasions in recent years. The breadth of archaeological heritage which exists in the area is of an extraordinary richness and variety. The Minister considers that because of the exemption in our planning laws in the area of security and prison facilities in the interests of the State that he is above and beyond planning legislation. Down the road the European Union and the courts will have something to say on that issue.I shall give another familiar scenario. The Minister chooses a site and does not listen to any advice about its appropriateness or unsuitability, the environmental regulations are ignored and yet the time will come when the EU or the Irish courts will tap the Minister or his successor on the shoulder and say it cannot be done. The Minister chooses to ignore that risk.Having been a member of Fingal County Council and having represented the area I wish to speak on the Fingal development plan. Fingal has two major towns and Meath has another major town within a short distance of the site. There is the whole Dublin 15 Blanchardstown-Castleknock area on one side, Ashbourne in Meath four or five miles away and Swords to the east. In the Fingal development plan this area was to remain properly as an agricultural area and its position in the development plan, in view of its archaeology, was to be enhanced and protected by the various planning mechanisms open under the planning laws. If there are 90,000 people in Blanchardstown and a projected 50,000 to 70,000 in Swords and a rapidly growing population in Ashbourne, what happens in regard to planning where we are meant to have agricultural green spaces, places for golf clubs, and places for leisure between our new towns?If the prison complex is developed it is inevitable the area will be developed intensively. If this development went to a town such as Carlow, it would be the equivalent of three sugar factories. Carlow recently lost hundreds of jobs following the closure of the sugar factory. At least Carlow is on the railway line and people who want to visit would have some access. However, that issue does not appear to have been considered by the Minister. In his arrogance the Minister has decided that planning in the north county and Fingal area and in Meath is a meaningless process that he can decide to ignore.We want sustainable communities in north and west County Dublin. The Minister does not visit the northside or the westside of the city often. He cannot give us sufficient members of the Garda Síochána to patrol Blanchardstown and Swords. Instead he wants to dump on the area and destroy any kind of strategic planning framework for the development of towns in the area and ride roughshod over the legacy of architecture, archaeology and heritage that exists in the area. I hope the courts and the European Union will take a longer term view of what sustainable, balanced planning and development should be in the area.I turn to the issue of value for money. This prison site has already cost an extraordinary amount of money. The process by which the request for the prison site was advertised was truly extraordinary. I cannot understand the late intervention by which the site was parachuted in over a very short period to become the selected site at an absolutely extortionate price. The Minister can bluster and threaten RTE and other journalists all he likes but he has questions to answer because he carries responsibility for this. This is the man who gets a free run on Pat Kenny's radio show at almost any time.

Therefore, if the Minister wants to appear on RTE, I am quite sure that, as he has done so often before, Pat Kenny will give him another two, three or four hours in which to do so. He seems to have a regular slot on the show.The Minister can threaten RTE all he likes but the fact remains that he has questions to answer. The project is ill conceived and ill thought out. We will throw away the €30 million we spent on developing the women's prison at Mountjoy as well as the many millions that were spent on improvements to the juvenile institution there.Should this new prison be developed, the road infrastructure in the area is entirely inadequate. I represent a constituency where I deal with new developments monthly but the Government's rule on infrastructure is to build the item first, whether it be a house, factory or prison. If one marches and shouts long enough in protest a few facilities will be thrown in after ten years. Tell the people of Ashbourne about it because they have been waiting for their bypass for about 15 years. It has been promised every year for the past eight years of this Government.Residents in the area earmarked for the new prison are right to feel concerned that their traditional homes in areas such as St. Margaret's, Kilsallaghan, Rolestown, Corrstown, and their entire way of life, will be changed forever. They will be left in the middle of a vast development site for which the infrastructure will take ten to 20 years to catch up. There is no evidence that the Minister considered any serious alternatives.Does the Minister accept the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General who has the power to examine not just previous expenditure but the key question of value for money? The question facing us on Thornton Hall concerns the cost of what is to be forgone in Mountjoy, together with the costs that have been paid already for the site and the cost of developing the complex to the scale envisaged, including a prison hospital.The Comptroller and Auditor General has a remit to examine value for money issues so he is an appropriate person to carry out such an examination. Two days ago a report was published by the Comptroller and Auditor General on Government overspending fiascoes. One small item in the report only merited a paragraph and concerned the €500,000 wasted on a new computer system for staff records in the prison service. In the scale of waste involved that sum did not merit much mention in the newspapers. We are now being asked to repeat that error by a possible factor of 100. I hope the Minister of State will accede to the motion.

No Minister in any Government should be afraid to allow the Comptroller and Auditor General to examine such proposals before the money is spent. This is particularly so to protect the Minister's integrity and that of his Department, as well as ensuring that there will be no repetition of the electronic voting fiasco. We should recall the sequence of events concerning the latter case. Both the Minister of the day and his successor were warned repeatedly about the consequences of introducing electronic voting. We now have a situation where taxpayers, unwittingly and through no fault of their own, must foot the bill for Government incompetence and lack of ministerial foresight and accountability. That is unlikely to change.Yesterday in the House, we had the spectacle of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform being indignant that the "Prime Time" programme did not give the slant he felt it should have given. Who is he to judge? I notice he is missing from the Chamber now. Possibly, he is on the way down to Montrose——

I note, however, that the same Minister has not voiced any objection to the number of occasions on which Ministers are accommodated by soft interviews on RTE, as if it were their toy. It is the national broadcasting station which is there for everybody and is not the preserve of Government. RTE should not be at the Government's beck and call.Like a number of others in this House, many years ago I had occasion to examine Mountjoy Prison from the inside, having been a customer there for a while. In fact, I even spent one night next door to the death cell, although I do not know whether that was indicative of things to come. I was certainly there, however.

In doing so, the Government should take account of best practice. The Minister should recognise that he is not spending his money or that of the Government but the taxpayers' money. The Minister should also recognise that the procedures involved should be in accordance with current best practice. The basic requirement in this situation is the one incorporated in the motion whereby the Comptroller and Auditor General could examine all the procedures relating to the acquisition. If the Comptroller and Auditor General says it is fine then let us proceed, but he should have the opportunity of examining the details. Let us have a professional opinion on such matters following which it is to be hoped we will at least know what is in store.In the course of the economic boom in recent years, there have been countless overruns and overspends which have all been bemoaned after the fact. This has occurred in almost every area, including electronic voting, the Luas, the M50, the Red Cow roundabout and the port tunnel. The latter project will not take the traffic it was intended to cope with, so people are now trying to figure out how lorries will access the tunnel to get to the port. We should examine the procedures concerning such projects beforehand to be happy that they represent value for money. The Houses of the Oireachtas should know where the Government stands before we go any further.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	224	I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this matter. We have consistently heard criticism from Opposition Deputies of delays in implementing infrastructural projects. Social commentators are forever banging on at us about the lack of so-called joined-up Government. Despite this, when the Minister, Deputy McDowell, presses forward with a bold initiative to replace the 155 year old, outmoded and inefficient design that is Mountjoy with a modern, efficient prison complex, the chattering classes rush to condemn him.When the Government moves decisively to ensure prisoners are kept in humane conditions and have access to facilities, including psychiatric facilities that will assist in their rehabilitation, we are berated for recklessness and undue haste. How many more years would the Opposition parties have us wait before we take action to alleviate the shameful conditions that have resulted in persistent calls to replace Mountjoy?The independent Irish Prisons Board, chaired by businessman Brian McCarthy, strongly urged the Minister not to attempt a refit at Mountjoy Prison but to go the replacement route which we are now rolling out with the acquisition of Thornton Hall.Redeveloping the existing 20-acre site at Mountjoy Prison is neither financially viable, at an estimated cost of in excess of €400 million, nor practical from an operational or developmental perspective. Trying to fix Mountjoy Prison now would be like re-wiring a house with the lights still on. However, we have had calls from Opposition Deputies to do just that. Where would we put the 1,000 or so prisoners we hold there in the interim? Would we keep them all living on a building site? Where is the value for money in that? The development of a greenfield site at the 150-acre site at Thornton means that we will have the room to develop new facilities, introduce single person cells with in-cell sanitation and end the medieval practice of slopping out every morning and after every lock up period through the day. Deputies will readily appreciate that the size of the Thornton site gives us considerable flexibility in developing new facilities as well as allowing us plan for the future.Contrary to the assertion of the Deputies opposite that we are wasting taxpayers' money, the Prison Service estimates that by replacing the Mountjoy Prison complex with a new prison complex at Thornton we should achieve operational savings of €30 million to €40 million each year. This represents more than the total cost of the site in one year's savings. In addition, the proceeds from the disposal of the site at Mountjoy Prison, in the region of €60 million to €90 million, will offset to a considerable degree the cost of the new development at Thornton. The acquisition of the site also means that the Mountjoy site will be available for development of a variety of facilities. This would undoubtedly rejuvenate the whole area around Mountjoy, and would benefit the local community. Surely Deputies across the floor should welcome this. One Deputy who represents the area, Deputy Costello, should consult his constituents on their preferences in this respect.

In many ways this was a typical response of the Government in general and the Progressive Democrats in particular. When inconvenient facts are disclosed, the reaction is to shoot the messenger, which was the reaction of the Minister last night. The Government had the same reaction when Eddie Hobbs's television programme produced some inconvenient facts for the Government. Again it made an attack on RTE.

It is well and good if he can get away it. However, he should know that in a democratic society a line exists between manipulation and control. He has attempted to cross this line. The "Prime Time" programme has already given him his answers. It is now clear that the Minister refused to appear on RTE. He has been given the opportunity and he still has the opportunity. Incidentally he also refused to appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights to answer questions on the matter. On the other hand he had no problem appearing in the House and giving his speech last night.

#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	259	He has used the sub judice rule to excuse his non-appearance either before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women’s Rights or on RTE to answer questions on the issue. There is a contradiction here. My interpretation of the rule is that if an issue before the courts is also being debated in this House, at a committee or elsewhere, one should deal with the issue in a restrained way and one is quite entitled to deal with the issue provided one uses careful language and a measured approach. I will leave objective observers to decide whether the speech of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform fitted within the category of being a measured reaction.In his speech, the Minister admitted that RTE had done extensive research and had unearthed all the information. Is he now trying to suggest that only his version of events can be published or broadcast? He is using his attack on RTE and his attack on everybody else last night, including me — I do not take any notice of the rubbish coming from him — to deflect attention from his deficiencies and inadequacies in this transaction. He has essentially been caught in the corner. As he has awkward facts to explain, he just hits out at everybody including RTE. The default position of the Progressive Democrats on any issue is to shoot the messenger. After all the bluster and ranting is over, the Minister still must face the bare facts. It is rather like what Winston Churchill noted after the war: the dreary steeples of Fermanagh and Tyrone were still there. He paid five times the market value for this farm. That fact remains. The Minister bought what I have called and will continue to call the dearest farm in Europe. We are not talking about any change with regard to Mountjoy but about the appalling waste of taxpayers' money in spending €30 million on a farm worth no more than €5 million or €6 million, and paying that for a prison site which turns out to be entirely unsuitable.We will look at the question of cost, an issue which the Government has been trying to avoid. In terms of value for the taxpayer, this was a crazy transaction. Any property experts to whom I have spoken and who are involved in that area or adjoining areas said they were stunned by the amount of money paid by the Minister for the site. He was buying a farm — agricultural land. He did not have to get planning permission. The land did not need to have development potential of any kind. Zoning did not matter, nor did anything else. The Minister was supposed to get a suitable site at a reasonable cost. He got neither.The Minister has attempted to use the process and explain through it that he did a great job. In the speeches delivered, much reference was made to the deficiencies in that process, and clearly such deficiencies existed. A farm was introduced at the end of the day, virtually at the last minute, dropped down from the clouds, so to speak, and within eight working days the sale was rushed through, accepted, put through Cabinet and contracted by the Minister.The Minister cannot say that the process produced the result and that as a consequence he can justify this outrageous waste of public money. The process was irregular, but it was the Minister who set it up. If the process produced a bad result, he is also responsible. He will say he had to be open with everyone in the way he did business, that the matter had to be publicly advertised and so on. With whom was the Minister open? In the end, he was open only with the vendor, before whom he waved a crock of gold, and the vendor's advisers. At the same time, the Minister took great care to ensure that nobody else in the area or the community would have the slightest idea as to what he was about. If this project goes ahead it is those people and the coming generations who will suffer the consequences. They were not to be told what was happening. Where is the openness and transparency in that approach?With regard to the process and the cost, the Minister is indicted on all fronts. He does not have an answer to the basic question why he paid five or six times the value of the farm. If any of us wished to buy a farm, would we do that? In my legal days I bought farms for many clients and I would not engage the Minister to do the job. There are many agents in the area involved. One would check the current market value with the agents in the area. One would check availability and take reasonable steps to ensure one was getting what one wanted. Nothing of that kind was done in this case. What happened took place with unseemly haste. It was rushed through at the last minute and there is no way of avoiding that. It was a disgracefully hurried decision in a situation where a preferred site was apparently back on the market, a site which was far superior and had been carefully examined by the committee.The Minister talks about price per acre but the Coolquay site was clearly superior. It had access and development potential. Per acre it was a more expensive site, but I am not complaining about the price per acre because the site was suitable. The Minister has the duty — as has every member of Government — to get value for money and pay market value, no more or less. This did not happen in this case.We have also ended up overpaying enormously for a site which clearly is unsuitable. That is becoming increasingly obvious. The suggestion has been made that the site was properly checked in advance, with the names of engineers and surveyors touted around by way of support. I have gone to the trouble of looking at the site search survey produced by these eminent people and everything I read in it confirms that going ahead with the purchase at the time was absolutely foolish.The survey begins by telling us that the Thornton Hall site was 155 acres. No explanation has been given for purchasing just 150 acres. This reason is that the five acres zoned for rural cluster development were the only valuable part of that farm. No explanation has been given as to why the only valuable five acres out of 155 suddenly disappeared off the scene over a 24-hour period. The Minister did not even mention this.The report goes on to say that a detailed survey of the site together with a geophysical and archaeological study would be required to finalise a decision on suitability. Why was this not done before the decision was made? This was a good report and everything it said about road access indicated enormous problems ahead. It noted there was no sewerage service for the land. It also looked at the issues of water, electricity and gas supplies and in all cases pointed out the difficulties and problems involved. The report ends by advising further investigation by means of bore holes and notes that such investigation could not be completed prior to the completion of the report.Everything in the report tells us that this transaction should not have gone ahead in the manner it did. If one looks at the situation, coupled with the decision of Fingal County Council yesterday to designate the vicinity involved as an architectural conservation area, an ACA, one wonders what will ever happen in terms of a prison development on the site.Regarding what has been referred to as the Mullingar motion, the Fine Gael-Labour motion, the bottom line is that major concerns have been raised about this site transaction and the public is entitled to have those concerns addressed. I fully accept that when Deputy Costello or I raise such concerns, people may legitimately say that we are in Opposition and that is our job. However, our motion is not intended as a means of utterly condemning the Minister, although at first sight of what has happened, it should be. We are restrained in what we are doing. Our motion is effectively neutral. We are simply calling for an independent examination of the transaction. Why does the Minister reject this approach? What has he to hide? That is the issue before the House and for the public.The Minister said this is a bizarre proposal, complete nonsense with no basis in law or reality. I have no respect for the Minister's business sense but I have some for his legal knowledge. However, at this stage I am beginning to doubt that too, because the provision permitting the Oireachtas to request the Comptroller and Auditor General to conduct a report goes back to 1923, the foundation of the State. Those who founded the State had the foresight to include a provision in section 7 of the Comptroller and Auditor-General Act to allow this procedure to be followed. The Minister is therefore quite incorrect when he says this proposal has no basis in law or reality. It is based on the Comptroller and Auditor-General Act 1923, as amended.That then gives rise to the central and major issue. What has the Government to hide? Why will the Minister not allow an independent audit of this transaction? He tries to defend the indefensible. He is not at this stage prepared to allow the Dáil ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to examine the transaction. He wants to leave it for 12 months, when the deal will be done and dusted and nothing can be done to question it. The approach of the Government and the Minister, Deputy McDowell, is very simple. Effectively, he is asking the Dáil to endorse an approach which involved paying five times the value for this farm to acquire a site which it transpires is utterly unsuitable for the purpose for which it was purchased.On that basis, I ask the House to accept the very reasonable Fine Gael-Labour Party motion and to reject the Government amendment.

Is onóir mhór dom an seans seo a bheith agam an Bille simplí seo a chur faoi bhráid na Dála.This Bill will amend a previous Act of the Oireachtas, which has been amended once before, and is of a technical nature. I will first provide the House with a brief description of the current law on international immunities. I will then explain the reason which gives rise to this Bill and set out its provisions.In 1967, Ireland ratified the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961 and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations of 1963. These two international treaties were adopted to codify what is perhaps one of the oldest and most accepted fields of international law, namely, the formal relations between states and their official representatives. As is stated in the preamble to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, peoples of all nations from ancient times have recognised the status of diplomatic agents.The two Vienna conventions recognise the functional necessity of diplomatic and consular privileges and immunities for the peaceful and efficient conduct of international relations. Effect was given to Ireland's obligations under these conventions by the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act 1967. This Act gives effect in Irish law to the two Vienna conventions. The Act also confers certain privileges and immunities on the United Nations and specialised agencies of the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development and the Customs Co-Operation Council.Part VIII of the 1967 Act permits the Government, by order, to designate an international organisation or body of which the State or Government is or intends to become a member to be an organisation to which Part VIII shall apply. Under section 40 of the Act the Government may, by order, confer on such a designated body and its officials inviolability and exemptions, facilities and immunities, privileges and rights.In addition to section 40, section 43 of the 1967 Act permits a Government order to confer immunities and privileges on international judicial bodies or semi-judicial bodies established under an agreement to which the State or Government is or intends to become a party.The Diplomatic Relations and Immunities (Amendment) Act 1976 expanded Part VIII of the 1967 Act by the insertion of section 42A. This section allows immunities and privileges to be conferred on international organisations and bodies in accordance with international agreements to which the State or Government is or intends to become a party. In other words, it is not necessary that the State or Government is itself a member of the international organisation or body. It suffices that the State or Government is or intends to become a party to the international agreement which confers immunities on the organisation or body.As was common drafting practice at the time, Part VIII permits the Government to confer, by order, privileges and immunities in broad terms. The power to confer privileges and immunities is not expressly stated to be limited to matters such as those covered by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961. However, subsequent jurisprudence on separation of powers and consequent changes in drafting practice indicate that the discretion of the Government should be formally limited so as to limit its power to make such orders to the types of privileges and immunity conferred in the 1961 Vienna Convention. The privileges and immunities conferred by orders made under Part VIII are so limited.This Bill will only amend Part VIII of the 1967 Act, as amended in 1976, and is solely concerned with the absence of any express limitation on the nature of immunities and privileges a Government order may confer on international bodies and organisations. This Bill will in no way alter the substance of Ireland's commitments to our obligations regarding international privileges and immunities. It will simply insert into the 1967 Act a clear statement of principles and policies which will serve as a limitation on the exercise of delegated legislative power by the Government.The Bill will limit the delegated legislative power, conferred by Part VIII of the 1967 Act, by providing that the Government may, by order, only confer those inviolabilities, exemptions, facilities, immunities, privileges and rights which are conferred upon or afforded in regard to sending states or missions under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. The types of immunities and privileges afforded by the Vienna Convention are as follows: the inviolability of the premises of an embassy of a foreign country or an international organisation; the freedom of the premises in question from taxation; the inviolability of archives and official documents; the inviolability of the person of the diplomatic or official officers of the foreign state or international organisation; freedom of communication; immunity from social security provisions; immunity from civil and criminal jurisdiction, subject to certain exemptions; and immunity from customs duties.Section 3 of this Bill will insert this limitation into section 40 of the 1967 Act. Section 4 of this Bill will insert this limitation into section 42A and section 5 of this Bill will insert this limitation into section 43. Section 6 of this Bill will provide that every Government order, made under Part VIII of the 1967 Act and enforced immediately before the passing of this Bill, shall have the same statutory effect as if it were an Act of the Oireachtas. To date 45 orders have been made under Part VIII regarding 37 different international organisations or bodies. Some 29 of these orders confer privileges and immunities while 16 merely designated a body or organisation under Part VIII.Some 25 of the orders relate to international agreements to which the State or Government is or intends to become a party, as provided for in section 42(a). A figure of 19 orders relate to an international organisation or body to which the State or Government is or intends to become a party, as provided for by section 40. One order relates to an international judicial body as provided for by section 43. The privileges and immunities conferred by these orders are of the nature of immunities and privileges afforded regarding the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations as I have just outlined.This Bill will do no more than insert into the 1967 Act a constitutionally required limitation on a legislative power that has been delegated to the Government. Diplomatic immunities are essential to the effective conduct of international relations and to the work of a wide range of international bodies. It is very important that the granting of immunities to such bodies, often in pursuance of Ireland's international obligations, be in accordance with best legislative practice. I commend this Bill to the House.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	265	The Diplomatic Relations and Immunities (Amendment) Bill amends the 1967 and 1976 Acts regarding the granting of privileges and immunities in the State to diplomatic and consular missions. The document I received with the Bill states that the legal framework is for the granting of privileges and immunities to diplomatic and consular missions, international organisations and bodies and their personnel.Mention of international organisations and bodies and their personnel aroused my curiosity. I sought information on these organisations and bodies when I tabled a question to the Minister on the number of people, and organisations to which these people are attached, that have diplomatic immunity. I expected more detailed information. The reply stated that: "All diplomatic agents of embassies in Ireland, including their spouses and families, are granted diplomatic immunity in accordance with the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act 1967." The reply also stated:Currently there are 54 resident diplomatic missions in Ireland, with approximately 880 diplomatic agents, including their spouses and families. The total number of diplomatic personnel fluctuates regularly due to the staff rotations of other states. There are 59 embassies accredited to Ireland but resident abroad, mainly in the United Kingdom. The diplomatic agents of such embassies are afforded diplomatic immunity when in Ireland.The reply did not contain information concerning international organisations and bodies and their personnel as mentioned in the advice document that accompanies this legislation. Do bodies and organisations other than embassies enjoy diplomatic immunity at present? If so, who are they and how many are there?One of the major guiding documents for the granting of privileges of modern diplomatic life is the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, signed in Vienna in 1963. This convention notes that consular relations have been established between people since ancient times and, more importantly, that such contacts and arrangements contribute to the development of friendly relations between nations. Consular and diplomatic ties between countries are extremely important and should not be dealt with casually or lightly. Ireland has seen a considerable expansion of countries opening diplomatic representation on our soil in recent years. The expansion of the EU and our development as a more dominant world player in trade and economic activity is largely responsible for that. We have developed a network of missions overseas and we now have 300 members of the Civil Service, from the Department of Foreign Affairs, working on missions overseas.I have concerns about the immunities that have been extended to individuals, groups or organisations under the 1967 and 1976 Acts. The Bill now being discussed seeks to ensure retrospectively that all orders issued under existing legislation to extend these privileges will have statutory effect from the passing of this amendment Bill. It appears that all orders passed under existing legislation are open to challenge at the present time. If this is the case, how long has this matter remained without remedy? How long has the Minister known that the orders may have been open to challenge? How many orders have been passed under the legislation since it came to the attention of the Government that all such orders did not have the full and necessary cover of the legislation?This is not a matter in which there should be any legal uncertainty and this situation could have left current diplomatic immunities open to challenge and potentially open to mass withdrawal. This could have had embarrassing consequences for the State. These diplomatic arrangements are part of our consular services and are extended to those working in Ireland on behalf of governments or other organisations in the same way they are extended to our people working abroad. It is important that this be dealt with in an unambiguous manner. The legal basis upon which these immunities and diplomatic privileges are extended must be absolutely clear.The legislation before the House is of great importance and, in line with our obligations under the Vienna Convention, Ireland must ensure that where diplomatic immunities are extended to persons within the State, it must be done on the basis of the law. If the potential for legal challenge has been known for some time and, as I believe, there has been a delay in bringing forward the necessary legislation, it displays very questionable judgment on the Government's part.If there was legal uncertainty in this matter why was amending legislation not brought to the House sooner? This legislation has been promised by the Government for a number of years. We questioned the Taoiseach on this matter in 2003 and legislation was promised for 2004. In line with overruns on other aspects of the work of this Government we must wait until autumn 2005 for the presentation of this amending legislation.This is not the first occasion matters of diplomacy have been treated casually by this Government. In the run-up to the local and European elections in 2004 the Taoiseach used the service of what is known as the diplomatic bag to write to our overseas missions and urge diplomats to vote for Fianna Fáil. This was an old-style stroke, utilising this method of communication with overseas embassies in an overtly party political way. No other parties, not even the partners in Government, were informed by Fianna Fáil of the intention to use this facility in such a manner.In line with the need to ensure that all matters in respect of diplomatic immunities and privileges are in order, we must also be sure that Ireland does not extend diplomatic relations to countries prematurely. In this regard I refer to the case of Burma. This is a country where one third of children are chronically malnourished or physically stunted. The military junta in Burma is largely responsible for an escalating humanitarian crisis, according to the head of the UN food agency. It is a country where the pro-democracy leader has been held under house arrest for many years and has survived physical abuse, deprivation of food and two assassination attempts.Despite this, the Government extended full diplomatic relations to Burma in 2004, to the dismay of democrats in many countries, including Ireland. Ireland's decision to extend diplomatic relations with Burma caused major surprise. The announcement was made on 13 February 2004 when it was announced that Ireland would open diplomatic relations on a non-resident basis with Burma and that our ambassador in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, would now also be accredited to Rangoon. Burma Action Ireland described the action as a diplomatic coup for the military regime that would bring much valued status to an illegitimate government. A former special adviser to the Taoiseach wrote an article in The Irish Times at the time calling for Ireland and the European Union to stand against what he termed a very nasty regime.Given the appalling level of human rights abuses in Burma and the lack of respect by the military regime for any sort of democracy, extending diplomatic relations at the time was highly questionable. It was stated that moves to extend these ties with Burma have been put on hold. I would like to know if this is still the case. Will the Minister of State say clearly in the House that Ireland has withdrawn entirely from the position adopted in 2004 in regard to this anti-democratic regime?Prior to the summer recess, the situation in Ethiopia was debated in this House. At the time, up to 36 people had lost their lives in violence which was linked to public disquiet regarding the manner in which the elections were held. The government of that country had also charged four newspaper editors for slurring what was termed the good name of the security forces after they criticised the police for shooting these people. The opposition parties had attempted to broker an agreement with the government parties, through the medium of a power-sharing arrangement hammered out by the head of the EU delegation to Ethiopia, whom I met prior to the summer recess. This man, Dr. Berhanu Nega, has since been elected mayor of Addis Ababa.That country faces challenges. It has made significant progress in recent years, but the difficulty surrounding the elections of last May has shown how fragile this progress has been. I would like to know from the Minister of State what action is being taken by the Government to support the development of a more open and transparent democratic system in that unfortunate country. What reports has the Government received from our diplomatic and consular staff in the region?The United Nations summit held earlier this month in New York was a major disappointment. I hope we will have an opportunity to discuss in more detail the issue in a special debate on the United Nations summit. The non-proliferation treaty and the failure to reach agreement at the summit was a scandal and disgrace. It has created an unstable and dangerous situation, particularly in regard to countries attempting to develop nuclear weapons. It is almost inevitable that if the present situation continues, nuclear weapons will get into the wrong hands and unscrupulous people will hold to ransom, sooner rather than later, democratically elected governments. There is a grave responsibility on the so-called civilised nations of the world to come to an agreement on the treaty.There is a serious example of double standards in the stance that is being taken on Iran. I would like to see much greater transparency in regard to Iranian development of nuclear power. I support fully the efforts being made by the three European countries in their discussions with that country. I resist totally any hypocritical attempts to impose double standards on that country whereby other countries can develop and expand their nuclear arsenal and develop nuclear power but Iran must abide by different standards. We should discuss this issue in more detail because it is a major problem.Some of the attitudes and statements being made by people who should know better have driven the Iranian people to support and put into power more conservative or more extreme individuals. The election of the mayor of Tehran as President of that country is a direct result of attempts by people who should know better to back the country into a corner. The hypocrisy and double standards being used in respect of that country contrast seriously with the failure to reach agreement at the United Nations in regard to the non-proliferation treaty.In June, I attended the meeting that dealt with the discussions on the treaty. It was scandalous that people could not even reach agreement on an agenda for the meeting. We know what has happened since in regard to Iran. I am not an apologist for that country and I believe that programme must be open and transparent. However, there are double standards but I will not delay the House by discussing the serious developments that happened in recent months. This problem is snowballing and could become quite serious unless there is real leadership on a global basis.The other matter with which I would like to deal are our diplomatic moves in regard to Turkey. I understand that talks on the accession of Turkey will commence next week. In its most recent declaration, Turkey refused to recognise Cyprus as a legitimate state. Any talks that commence on the accession of Turkey will be built on sand unless there is some progress on the status of Cyrpus. It is unacceptable that any country should enter into negotiations without recognising a legitimate component of the European Union.I visited Turkey late last year and I hope the accession talks can commence and be meaningful, because the hope of accession to the European Union is lifting the heavy hand of state domination on people in the Greek Orthodox Church, some of the Kurdish freedom movements and other people we met who suffered human rights abuses. The heavy hand of state oppression is being lightened because of the reforms that are taking place. However, the recognition of Cyprus should happen sooner rather than later. Talks that take place without dealing with that issue would be built on sand.I have posed a number of questions to the Minister of State and I hope he will put his response on the record.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	266	I share the views of the previous speaker regarding the urgency for a debate on a number of matters. These include the United Nations General Assembly meeting this month, in particular, the debate on United Nations reform in regard to the current feasibility and urgency of achieving the world millennium development goals and a number of other matters relating to Turkey's accession to the European Union. It is important that the political environment should allow that these issues could be discussed as soon as possible at the UN so that conclusions can be reached or, for example, in the case of the accession of Turkey to the EU, that a debate should take place in advance of a decision. I do not intend to digress on these issues, as we will have an opportunity on Question Time next week to pursue them in detail. I also hope we will have an opportunity to deal with substantive matters in debates over the next few weeks.The Bill is interesting. I remarked earlier that it merited an explanatory memorandum because of its importance. I was grateful for the note forwarded to my party on 14 September by the legal division of the Department. An explanation is needed as to why there was such delay in introducing the legislation, although I understand its political context. The concept of immunity has changed since 1963 and 1967. An explanatory memorandum could usefully have put the powers and immunities conferred by the Vienna Convention in context and could have made the case for their extension.The Bill has three functions — to name other organisations, extend immunities and introduce a retrospective legitimisation of orders that have been made. Immunities in the European Union vary and that is why the concept of immunity is interesting. For example, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe provides an immunity that is much wider than that extended to the membership of the European Parliament. This was exploited recently. The most distinguished exploiter of this anomaly was the Italian Prime Minister, Senor Berlusconi, whose instant accreditation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe was a simple ruse to acquire an immunity wider than that provided by the European Parliament. This was raised at the credentials committee of the Parliamentary Assembly.Issues have arisen during the long history of immunity. The preamble to the Vienna Convention correctly made reference to the ancient principle of respect for those involved in diplomatic action. The long history of immunity lodged in such a context is not simple. I accept the difficulties of providing a parliamentary response to the issue of sufficiency. An explanatory memorandum would also have been useful to address new circumstances that have emerged in recent years such as the International Criminal Court or the Rome court as it is known by its detractors. For example, the evolving jurisprudence might have examined conditionalities relating to compliance with international human rights standards and the prosecution of crimes against humanity and other crimes. I refer to the proposed UN international convention on the elimination of corruption, which lacks a few signatures to become a legal instrument. Next week we can discuss what action the Government is taking in this regard.However, the legislation raises an interesting principle, as it refers to the extension of privileges to agencies and their representatives with whom the Government intends to have a relationship. This is welcome because it contradicts an old chestnut, which lies at the base of much foreign policy, that even though morally and publicly there may be immense support for the ratification and implementation of an international instrument, the Government takes the view that it is only when domestic legislation is in place that we can accept the discipline of such an instrument. This legislation is an interesting contradiction in this regard, which is welcome, as it goes in an entirely different direction. The question of intention is correct. The suggestion that a country signs up to international responsibility following the passage of domestic legislation is an assumption of bad faith among fellow members of an international organisation such as the UN. I would welcome a move away from that.The issue of reciprocity may be teased out in another way when it arises in regard to international adjustments such as this. A wide range of immunities and privileges are conferred by different countries under the Vienna Convention, which merit consideration. I am not a constitutional lawyer but I question the broad conferral of legitimacy on orders made in the past. Under the principle of retrospection, if an issue has been raised about the constitutionality of the breadth of powers the Government has given itself and, having put a limitation into legislation in 2005, can it automatically confer a legitimate status on all the previous orders? I question the constitutionality of such an approach.The legislation will facilitate the conferring of immunities and privileges on those concerned with investigation, mediation and the establishment of fact under a number of international instruments. For example, if the International Criminal Court sought to investigate cases involving people seeking residence in Ireland and they are covered by a UN instrument or under the devolved powers of the ICC, they would qualify, which is welcome. I could nominate a few places of potential investigation. However, I would not go down the road of limitation with other agencies. The legislation is providing that instead of providing an open power, it confers a limitation on the Government but I would have welcomed the placing of the principles of the Vienna statute in a modern setting.I agree with Deputy Allen's comments. It is a contradiction with which we must live. Many places which fall short of the test of democracy seek to confer protections and immunities on their representatives although they do not accord rights to their own citizens. The history of diplomacy is such that these are often the people whom one wishes to confront within a discourse here. If one is to protect the possibilities of discourse one must consider modernising the law.I would like to see all these issues spelt out in greater detail, particularly the comparative work undertaken in regard to other countries' abuse of immunity. Some of the most powerful countries significantly abuse immunity, using it as a cover for espionage, spying and even assassination. It is a topic worthy of a more extensive discussion. This long-promised Bill is welcome and makes a necessary adjustment but I hope it is the beginning of a wider debate.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	267	I wish to share time with Deputies Ó Snodaigh and Finian McGrath. Like other speakers and particularly Deputy Michael Higgins, I am concerned about the absence of an explanatory memorandum to this Bill. While it is a small Bill with a technical aim we should have received an explanatory memorandum. Its omission is bad practice and should not be repeated in other Bills, particularly coming from the Department of Foreign Affairs which issues so few Bills. I believe this is the first Bill from that Department in the 29th Dáil. If there is to be a second Bill I hope this practice is not repeated.The Bill is short and seeks to bring Irish law into line with international conventions, particularly the Vienna Convention, which on the surface is something that, as a democratic nation, we should seek to do. We would like our diplomatic representatives to be treated as we treat the representatives of other countries here.Other speakers have mentioned qualifications to that principle. Our diplomatic service is not directly comparable to that in other countries whether or not they are democracies. Often the officers found in embassies with titles such as "political attaché" or "military attaché" are there to further the interests of their countries rather than engage in diplomatic relations. That is where the quality of such legislation falls down. How can this small country defend itself against that type of abuse? Conversely, how do we protect our diplomatic staff who represent us in less than ideal circumstances in other countries?This Bill gives us an opportunity to discuss a view probably shared by everyone in the House, namely, the pride we should feel in the quality of our diplomatic representation around the world, at embassy and consular level. Those who have made visits on behalf of this House to other jurisdictions know of the professionalism, talent and commitment of people who work in Irish offices around the world with few resources.I would have welcomed a wider debate on how we might level the playing field between how we are represented overseas and how we receive representatives of other countries. Ireland is under-represented. It is represented in fewer than half of the countries in the world. It has fewer ambassadors than there are here from other countries. For example, in the next two months Cuba will send an ambassador here yet there is no process or attempt to advance a process that would place an Irish ambassador there.Our ambassador in Mexico seems to cover the entire Central American region, the northern half of South America as well as the Caribbean area. While this is a small country our representatives should not have to cover half the globe. It is unfortunate that we have not had a more wide-ranging debate to address those issues which are linked to diplomatic representation and immunity for our representatives.A White Paper on foreign relations and diplomatic representation would have been a good use of Government time. We have received White Papers from the Department of Foreign Affairs on the European question. The US State Department issues annual documents stating its judgment of the countries with which it has diplomatic relations. That approach may be too judgmental.An annual report of Ireland's relations with various countries would be a good use of the resources of the Department of Foreign Affairs. It would inform us when we come to tabling legislation which increasingly has an international dimension. I would welcome more imagination and initiative on the part of the Government and the Department.I am concerned about the collective foreign policy and diplomatic representation that seems to occur at an EU level. Some of this makes sense. We can share the facilities of other countries in places where we do not have direct representation but when it becomes a homogenised approach we risk losing the capital we have gained recently as a small neutral country, however one defines that neutrality in the future. We risk becoming an appendage of a European whole that will make compromises on how it presents itself to the wider world.We are unique and distinct and should use our representation to put across those qualities. If we succeed in that we will benefit not only in terms of our diplomatic stock but economically in terms of how we sell the country as one with which it is worth doing business and as a tourist destination. We should strive to have a standard of representation higher even than that of countries represented here. If we do that we will continue to punch above our weight as we have done with limited resources, few legations, embassies and consular offices around the world.I hope that in passing this small Bill, irrelevant as it might be to the wider issues, the Department might produce wider policy positions on Ireland's plans for representation overseas.

I mo thaithí le hambasáidí agus taidhleoiríÉireannacha agus iasachtacha thar na blianta, is dream iad atá díograiseach san obair atá ar bun acu. Bhí siad i gcónaí an-chuidiúil dom agus dóibh siúd a raibh mé ag cur a gcásanna trasna. Chuidigh siad go mór liom. Chomh maith leis sin, d'éirigh liom i gcónaí i dtaobh na gceisteanna a bhíá gcur agam freagra cuí a fháil uathu. Dá réir sin, measaim gur chóir dúinn i gcónaí déanamh cinnte de go bhfuil an caighdeán is fearr tacaíochta agus cosanta á thabhairt againn dár dtaidhleoirí agus dá réir do thaighleoirí de chuid tíortha eile atá ag obair sa tír seo. Tá sé tábhachtach go bhfuil caighdeán idirnáisiúnta i gceist anseo, mar táimid ag lorg pé rud a chuir muidinne ina luí ar ár dtaidhleoirí agus an fhoireann inár n-ambasáidí thar lear. Tá na tíortha sin ag lorg na cosanta céanna sa tír seo.Sa Bhille seo, measaim go bhfuil aitheantas ar an dainséar go raibh an iomarca cumhachtaí ag an Rialtas ó thaobh na gcinntí a bhíodh á thógaint aige maidir le pribhléid nó diolúine a thabhairt d'eagrais idirnáisiúnta. Chomh maith leis sin, tá an Bille ag iarraidh go mbeadh an Rialtas in ann amach anseo cur le líon na n-eagras agus grúpaí a bheadh clúdaithe ag na pribhléidí sin.The Bill recognises the dangers of the Government having discretionary powers that are too wide. I believe that they are still too wide regarding the awarding of privileges and immunities to international organisations, communities and other bodies. It is welcome that the Bill limits the privileges and immunities for which the Government may make provision by order to those that may be conferred under the Vienna Convention. However, those privileges and immunities include the inviolability of organisations' premises, means of transport, communications, private baggage, persons in private residence, as well as immunity from the criminal, civil and administrative jurisdiction of the State and from being obliged to give evidence as a witness.Given the potentially serious consequences of those privileges and immunities for the public good, I feel that allowing the Government to be the sole arbiter of whether to award those to additional organisations is ill-advised. It would be preferable if the designation of such organisations, because of the gravity of what we would be granting them, were not the sole responsibility of Government. The Houses of the Oireachtas should be afforded the opportunity to contest a Government order relating to the awarding of such immunities and privileges before a decision is made. That could be done through a debate, either of the full House or in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which could examine the merits of the organisation or person in question.Some effective mechanism must be put in place whereby the entire House has the opportunity to discuss it rather than its being a Government or ministerial directive or order. Effective mechanisms to enable the scrutiny of Government orders by both Houses of the Oireachtas should be put in place to ensure that the organisation or person who has been granted it is still complying with its terms when the decision to grant it comes up for discussion once again.It is not open-ended; one does not grant immunity for ever more to an organisation. I presume that there would be time limits so that it comes up for review. Those organisations have a duty to comply with the Vienna Convention, and we must ensure that before the granting of a renewal or even in the first instance, those organisations or persons comply with it. Article 55(1) reads as follows.Without prejudice to their privileges and immunities, it is the duty of all persons enjoying such privileges and immunities to respect the laws and regulations of the receiving State. They also have a duty not to interfere in the internal affairs of that State.The final stipulation is a major duty regarding embassies around the world and what went on in previous decades and probably still goes on among the staff and officials of some embassies who enjoy such privileges and immunities.In asking the Government to grant such privileges and immunities, there is an onus on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to demonstrate their necessity — reflected in the changes to this legislation that we have suggested — and the suitability of the organisation, including its practices, to enjoy them. The conferral of such privileges and immunities must be in the interest of and not compromise or undermine the public good. It is correct that we should examine and evaluate the use of diplomatic privileges and immunities to date. Has what we granted in the past been abused or worked well? Do we really need this legislation?I asked the Minister yesterday how many certificates had been granted to people avoiding criminal prosecution because of their standing. In fairness, the answer was that no such certificate had been issued. That is a good sign. Embassies in Ireland and those who have such accreditation or privilege have not abused it. However, we must review the matter. It may be the case that embassies, when officials breach the law, quickly shift them out of the country. We have seen that in newspaper reports regarding other countries. The review should consider the activities of the British Embassy in particular in this State and the Government's ability to respond effectively to incidents within the constraints of the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Acts 1967 and 1976.Since we are dealing with foreign affairs and immunities, while I welcome this Bill, I hope that it does not proceed before another that seems to be stuck on Committee Stage, namely, that regarding the International Criminal Court, which is just as vital, if not more so. In a way, it is related to this Bill, which should not take precedence over it. I would welcome a discussion on Committee Stage.This question might be more appropriate for the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern. However, when I asked him, I did not receive an answer that made complete sense. Why should Ireland, as a neutral country, accord recognition to military attachés? There are military attachés in embassies in this State. I do not have a complete list, but I know that the British Embassy, for instance, has a military attaché. If my memory serves me right, so does the American Embassy. That begs the question what their role is. How many such attachés are there? Do all NATO countries have military attachés and what is their role? Is it similar to what we have seen in films and novels about the Cold War? Are these attachés the intelligence service operatives or contacts for their states? They must have a specific purpose. We do not purchase a significant amount of weaponry from other countries which might necessitate the presence of military attachés. Ireland is a neutral state and does not often engage in major military discussions with NATO countries. Deputy Boyle suggested a White Paper should be produced to deal with this entire area. Such a White Paper should deal with the issue of military attachés.I welcome the thrust of this short Bill. However, it would be better for this House to concentrate on passing the legislation necessary to facilitate co-operation with the International Criminal Court given that it is four years since the passing of the associated referendum.

There is no explanatory memorandum and I am uncertain of its function and context. In dealing with any legislation, it is important that Members should have some type of briefing as to its impact and the reasons for its introduction. Have there been abuses of the system whereby, for example, diplomatic immunity was retrospectively and improperly applied? I am conscious of the emphasis on security in today's society and speculate the legislation may have emerged in that context. However, I do not know for sure.The Minister of State outlined the specific areas for which immunity is provided under Part VIII of the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act 1967. This legislation states that the Government may, by order, only confer those inviolabilities, exemptions, facilities, immunities, privileges and rights which are conferred upon or afforded in regard to sending states or missions under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Internationally, it is of critical importance that in all democracies — and all non-democracies, because that is the way diplomatic relations operate — the rights and privileges of diplomats are recognised and fully afforded. Situations have arisen where personnel who were not covered by diplomatic immunity had to have such privileges extended to them in order to ensure their safety and so on. We are increasingly likely to have some involvement in volatile situations on a worldwide basis because we have more embassies and diplomatic missions now than was the case heretofore. As our diplomatic reach expands, greater responsibilities will be thrust upon us. What will be the effect of the Bill in this context?Members of the diplomatic service have particular privileges in regard to the transmission of documents, an activity in which they are usually engaged on a daily basis. Does this legislation impinge on the free transmission of documents?The Minister of State referred to the types of immunities and privileges afforded by the Vienna Convention. I notice there is a typographical error in the document he circulated with reference to the inviolability of the premises of an embassy of a "foreign county". I hope the Minister of State does not refer to a neighbouring county.

I presume these and other inviolabilities outlined by the Minister of State, including the inviolability of archives and official documents and of the person of the diplomatic or official officers of the foreign state or international organisation in question, are not in any way impacted by this legislation. Deputies Michael D. Higgins and Allen and other speakers have already referred to this.As we continue to expand our diplomatic boundaries to include new missions throughout the world, reciprocal arrangements will be put in place. In some cases, the level and degree of immunity which representatives of other states would expect, as dictated by conditions in their homeland, may not necessarily accord with what is suitable to afford them in this country or some of our neighbouring countries. I travelled on one occasion to a country which, for diplomatic reasons, I will not name. It was pointed out to me the existence of apartment blocks where an immigrant population was housed. Upon observing that this seemed to be poor treatment of the immigrants in question, I received a reply which I will not pain the Minister of State's ears by repeating.In countries where democracy has not long or has never resided, there may be a different attitude to rights, freedoms and privileges to that which prevails here and in the United Kingdom and United States, for example. This will also affect our diplomats who are sent to those states and we must bear this in mind at all times. In respect of the diplomatic staff sent to Ireland from such states, it might be useful to acknowledge that their homeland may not necessarily be the hub of democracy. In this regard, situations may present themselves for the Department of Foreign Affairs in the event of activities which could be regarded as doubtful.Deputy Michael D. Higgins rightly referred to some of the activities that went on in various embassies over the years. During the Cold War era it was suggested there were more wires in at least two of the embassies than would incinerate a joint of meat. Those who stayed on the premises were risking their health. That is how operations were conducted at the time. It was an abuse of the diplomatic system, albeit an established and accepted abuse. One moved in, installed eavesdropping equipment, wires, telephone jamming and tapping devices and other electronic gadgets to spy on one's hosts. It is likely this established practice still goes on and will continue. The problem is that as we expand our boundaries in terms of diplomatic missions, we must recognise we will encounter more of this type of situation than we did in the past. From time to time, we read of situations where for one reason or other a diplomat encounters difficulties but is covered by diplomatic immunity. Will this Bill affect such situations? Was a person previously covered by diplomatic immunity if, for example, he or she was involved in a row outside a nightclub and, if so, will that continue to be the case? I do not refer to the provoker of the attack but to a potential innocent bystander who may require cover. The Minister of State might clarify that issue.Freedom of communication, which is provided for in the previous Act, covers a multitude of circumstances, such as the right of an individual to communicate with his or her embassy, non-interference in the transmission of documents and the freedom for diplomatic staff to go about their work in the same manner as in their home country. The latter circumstance may have a different meaning for some of the newer democracies. We need to keep an eye on that matter.I pay tribute to the diplomatic service, which does a tremendous job. The expansion of its boundaries has brought great benefit to this country. Embassies are trade as well as diplomatic missions and work on a 24-hour basis in important locations. From an economic as well as a prestige point of view, it is important that people are located in as many places as possible. Deputy Boyle remarked that the ambassador to Mexico covers a whole region in Latin America. We have a massive population in that area and are increasing trade with it. It is imperative that individual missions are located in each of those major countries. Latin America is going to experience significant economic expansion and has entered into agreements with North America which will have an impact on world trade. We need to have diplomatic missions which can act as the voice of Ireland in that region.I remember a situation where I received significant publicity. While someone once said that all publicity is good publicity, I do not think that applied to the situation in question. I was in Australia as part of an august delegation.

I was most impressed by the degree to which members of the Irish Embassy and the trade mission were alert and worked from early morning until late at night. They were able to make presentations instantly, were professional in the way they did business and competed more effectively then many other delegations. People should write about these important issues rather than frivolous ones, although the latter is more entertaining. I will let my colleague into all the secrets concerning the quality of the wine at a suitable moment.

My praise applies to all our embassy staff. I have seen their work first hand. The current situation is different to that of 30 years ago. They are much more professional, incisive and fearless in the way they go about their business. Credit should be given where it is due. Those who have provided these services over the years should take a bow.As the European Union expands, the diplomatic service will probably take on a different role in terms of, for example, Turkey's accession. The effects of diplomacy will be vital. The Mexican stand-off between Turkey and Cyprus is unhelpful and has to be resolved. The issue of the recognition of Cyprus will come to the forefront shortly. Negotiations cannot progress and, notwithstanding the accession of Cyprus, the two sides will be stalled unless these issues can be satisfactorily resolved. It will be important that productive diplomatic steps are taken and nothing is allowed to impede progress. A simple matter can give rise to problems which should not exist. I hope the powers of the diplomatic service can be effectively applied to that area.Reference has been made to Iran, Iraq and the role of diplomacy before the recent war. It is never too late to call in the diplomatic service. It can play a vital and effective role. The difference between the present and 1939 is that the diplomatic services were abused by Adolf Hitler in order to accommodate his future plans. He managed to create the suggestions in the minds of diplomats that he had been wronged and had no intention of doing harm; he was misunderstood and if people had enough cop-on they would have known he had a few things to do and basically he was a nice guy.That is an example of where diplomatic services were abused. We are all too young to remember when a certain British Prime Minister returned home from a diplomatic mission in central Europe and said there would be no war in our time. They were famous words but they did not mean anything. He had been walked up the plank and locked into something he could not get out of and had been outwitted. We know what happened afterwards.I do not wish to incur the ire of the Chair by overstepping my diplomatic immunity here. I hope the Bill is before the House for a particular purpose. I would like to have seen specific instances of where the Bill would be effective. In my old age, anytime I do not see something on those lines I get suspicious.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	286	I thank the Chair for the opportunity to address this legislation. It allows for a wide debate on the broader issue of diplomatic and international relations around the world. The Diplomatic Relations and Immunities (Amendment) Bill 2005 is important legislation that I will support. When one looks at the details of the Bill and reflects on diplomatic relations this debate is relevant to what has been going on in the world in recent months. I think particularly of crises in the Middle East, Iraq and other parts of the world which give us an opportunity to consider in which direction we are going and if Ireland, as an independent neutral country, can develop foreign policy and work closely with people who are interested in bringing peace and justice throughout the world while respecting the integrity of different countries and nationalities. In this debate it is important when speaking about diplomacy to keep in mind respect for other countries and their citizens. This is not what is happening compared to the 1950s when Ireland was highly regarded internationally on foreign policy matters. It is time to draw a line in the sand and make a decision on which direction we are going. While many Members wish to go in different directions it would be damaging for the integrity or our country.As a small independent neutral country, Ireland has had a proud history. As a boy growing up I recall hearing of people such as Frank Aiken and their contribution to international relations. On a cross-party basis we should not be afraid to say people such as the late Seán MacBride also put us on the map. It is important that tradition is remembered in the House regardless of the political party or grouping to which one belongs because the issue of respect for countries, their diplomacy and international relations is bigger than any political party or groupings the House. Because of our history and experience other countries respect our integrity. When it comes to conflict resolution the Irish people and the Department of Foreign Affairs will always be heard whether it is in Europe, America, Latin America or the Middle East. That is important. I am aware from speaking directly with people from different nationalities there is always a soft spot, a special grá, for the Irish view on their problem. We should not under estimate that, despite the fact that many say Ireland is a small country and is not a loud voice in the world. Whether one is speaking with the Irish-American community, people in Latin America or in Europe there is that experience.When debating this legislation on diplomatic relations it is important to reflect on the importance of foreign policy and how it is carried out by the State. The Vienna Convention recognises that peoples of all nations from ancient times have had to recognise the status of diplomatic agents. I strongly support that concept because there is always need for such respect.The Bill confers certain privileges and immunities on the United Nations and specialised agencies of the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Customs Co-operation Council. The key groups are the United Nations and specialised agencies. I have great respect for the United Nations and would encourage people not to lose that respect. I accept there are problems and that the Government is part of the reform agenda in the United Nations. I have respect for those who go to the UN and put its weaknesses on the table and who are not afraid to do so. At times many of us consider that mistakes have been made internationally by the United Nations but the vast majority of us feel strongly about fixing them and bringing us back on to the international stage. I say that also in respect of those who are directly involved in the Council of Europe. It is important that the independent voice of Ireland is heard.The question of diplomatic relations triggers the broader debate on human rights. This is an area where Ireland could have a role in dealing with questions of human rights. We have a strong record on this issue and we should be proud of our tradition. Also we should be proactive and not afraid to stand up to the larger powers if we are of the opinion there are abuses of human rights in different countries. That may not be popular and one may be under pressure but one should take the right course.Given that I have mentioned diplomatic and international relations I think particularly of Christy McGrath, the Irish jockey, who is in jail in London. I thank all Members who have supported that campaign. This is another miscarriage of justice. I understand more than 70 TDs and Senators have signed a petition in the name of Christy McGrath, who is no relation. I met his family a few months ago and gave a commitment that I would raise the case no matter where I go. I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to keep an eye on this case and to be more proactive. I confirm that any time I have been away, and it has not been often——
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	287	I was wondering if the Deputy would enlighten the House.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	288	——the experience has been positive and the back-up staff have been courteous. Recently we were in London dealing with crime issues and anti-social behaviour and the way in which we were looked after by the staff at the Irish Embassy and by foreign affairs personnel was commendable. I appreciate that.In 2002 I went as an international observer to Bogotá in Colombia for the trial of the Colombia Three. The Department of Foreign Affairs, the embassy staff based in Mexico, and the staff in Bogotá in Colombia strongly supported me and the families of the three men. People such as Sheila McGuire went out of their way to respect the integrity of the host countries. Unlike Jeffrey Donaldson when I was in that country I met the Government, military people, ministers, prisoners and human rights people. I had a broader view and I listened to all groups on this issue. People should realise there are major concerns about human rights issues and it is proper that we raise them.The International Red Cross has been supportive in such situations by providing a great service and thus saving many lives. From my experience, having visited the Red Cross offices in Bogotá, I found that many of the organisation's members were at risk as they operated in delicate situations. However, they remained there permanently to support citizens locally in an impartial and independent manner. I have nothing but the highest respect for those Red Cross officials.We should pay tribute to the men and women of the Irish Army who have served overseas on UN missions. I think in particular of those who made the ultimate sacrifice in laying down their lives in such situations. They did not do so for a particular cause but in the interests of peace and international relations. All Members of the House should recognise the valuable role the UN has played in this respect. Irish soldiers have served in the Middle East, for example, where local people have had a positive experience of those foreign missions given the impartiality and professional integrity displayed by our peacekeepers.Irish emigrants to America have played a proud role in the history of that country. In recent times also we have seen the influence of people such as Mr. Niall O'Dowd and Senator Peter King who put their necks on the block for the peace process. They deserve our thanks and support because they helped to nurture and develop the peace process. When some Members of this House became wobbly and weak-kneed, those people stuck with the issue leading to the conclusion of a historic agreement on IRA weaponry in recent days. I welcome the statement by General John de Chastelain on disarmament and the peace process generally. I commend the two clergymen who were directly involved in acting as witnesses to the decommissioning process. They have done their bit for peace and harmony both here and internationally.We should also pay tribute to those who had the courage to put their money where their mouths are by investing in this country. They have played a positive role in developments here.In addition to praising the valuable work of Irish Americans, we should not be afraid to criticise when necessary. Good friends and relations can be openly critical of each other on particular issues, so if I disagree with President George W. Bush on his Iraqi policy, it does not mean I disagree with the vast majority of the American people, including Irish Americans. It is important to understand this distinction: one can disagree with governments but one can still work closely with individuals.I wish to highlight the plight of illegal Irish immigrants in America and I urge the US authorities to deal with this unacceptable situation. Such immigrants want to make a contribution to that country, yet they are constantly under pressure because of their status as illegals. That unresolved issue is relevant to the legislation before the House.With thousands of people coming to Ireland from other lands, we must recall our own history in order to support and understand such immigrants here. I am concerned that due to divisions in certain parts of the country over asylum seekers and refugees, such people are not being fully integrated into our society. We must be more inclusive but, while I accept we have a leadership role, it is not just up to politicians. It is up to members of residents' and community groups as well as trade unions to roll up their sleeves and ensure that immigrants can become part of an inclusive country that respects diversity.Racism must be dealt with head on and cannot be tolerated in any circumstances. As regards our own peace process, the same goes for sectarianism which is unacceptable. It cannot be excused or explained away. Some communities may feel fearful and under threat, but one does not take it out on one's neighbour because he or she is Catholic or Protestant. Neither can one blame sectarianism for disadvantage and poverty. I know many poor people in disadvantaged parts of Dublin who, when it comes to race or religion, are the most inclusive and open-minded people that one could meet anywhere. We should not confuse such issues.To revert to the Bill before us, section 1 states:In this Act "Principal Act" means the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act 1967.Section 2 states:Part VIII of the Principal Act is amended by substituting the following section for section 39:"39.—In this Part—‘organisation to which this Part applies' means an international organisation, community or body standing designated for the time being by order under section 40 of this Act;‘Vienna Convention' means the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations done at Vienna on the 18th day of April 1961 as set out in the First Schedule of this Act.".When I visited Colombia in 2002, I met a group of trade unionists, including three Coca Cola workers named Hector, Efrian and Javier. They were working in a difficult situation because staff including shop stewards, were being assassinated by right-wing death squads. They told me at that meeting, on 4 December 2002, that 3,800 people had been killed since 1986. In the preceding 12 months alone, 178 trade unionists had been killed. They told me all about the deaths of workers in the Coca Cola factories. They asked us to contact the American, Colombian and Irish Governments, as well as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, on this issue. I gave a commitment at that meeting to bring this message to people's attention when I returned home. They also thanked us for having travelled to Colombia and expressed their deepest appreciation for our efforts. In discussing international relations, we must not sit on the fence. We should stand by those who have sought our assistance.Granting of immunity to bodies in pursuit of Ireland's international obligations should be in accordance with best legislative practice. Comprehensively drafted legislation is an important requisite in this regard. I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this wide-ranging debate on the Bill. As a small, independent country, we should focus on adopting an independent foreign policy by acting as international peace brokers. In that way, we will further develop the respect for our country that already exists at the UN and other international fora.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	289	I sincerely thank all Deputies for their contributions to this debate. I have made careful note of what they have said. Many issues have been raised that are somewhat distanced from the remit of the Bill, such as the UN summit, Burma, Iran, the Council of Europe and the situation concerning illegal Irish immigrants in America. All of these issues have been raised in the past and can be raised again by way of parliamentary questions next week, as well as in the various committees. We will be only too delighted to deal with each of these issues and to respond to them in due course. It is important that today, however, we should focus on the Bill before us. The Bill is a technical amendment to the 1967 Act and is necessary to limit the discretion of the Government to make orders for the application of privileges and immunities.A number of Members have raised the fact that no explanatory memorandum was circulated with the Bill, but there is no onus or requirement on the Government to do that. The legislation has evolved as a result of our experiences in the diplomatic field and following court decisions. There is a requirement to ensure that our laws are modernised, focused and applicable to the discretion needed by the Government in order to take its decisions. It is not normal for any Government to bring forward legislation that restricts it, but in this situation we are doing so because it is important at this time.An explanatory memorandum is a tool to assist Members of the Oireachtas in their deliberations. Based on what has been said in the House today, I can give a guarantee that we will create an explanatory memorandum and have it circulated before Committee Stage. We circulated a background note through the Whip's office to all the parties two or more weeks ago. The note fully sets out and explains the elements of the amendment. We will ensure this is enhanced and incorporated in the explanatory memorandum.The only kinds of immunities and privileges conferred by Government order have been of the nature of those found in the Vienna Convention. No abuse has arisen. This Bill has been produced merely to ensure the 1967 and 1976 Acts are in line with the best legislative practice as outlined recently by the Supreme Court.A number of Deputies asked why this amending legislation is being introduced now and not earlier. Although the principles and policies test was first set down by the Supreme Court in the 1980 case of Cityview Press v. AnCO, it was only through developing jurisprudence which emerged over a number of years that the true significance of the judgment became known. There have been a number of important cases in recent years, including Laurentiu v. Minister for Justice in 1999 and Leontjava v. the Director of Public Prosecutions in 2004. It was considered prudent to await the Supreme Court ruling in the Leontjava case, which was delivered in June 2004, as this judgment further clarified the relevant issues. Now that these decisions have been reached it is possible for us to proceed with the legislation now.Of the 191 members of the United Nations, 113 have diplomatic accreditation to Ireland with 54 based on the island of Ireland and 59 operating from the United Kingdom. This shows the respect for Ireland as a sovereign state and a small country playing a major role in diplomatic and foreign affairs throughout the world. It shows the desire throughout the modern world for accreditation to our country and the respect we have gained. This of major importance and enables us to have bilateral and multilateral relations with all these countries on many issues which ensures there is a consensual attitude on many issues that are of global concern in many of the fora in which Ireland is represented.Some Deputies asked about the various organisations which enjoy certain immunities under Irish law. Some 37 organisations enjoy such immunity. Not all of these bodies have permanent offices in Ireland. The list of orders detailing these bodies is as follows: SI 216 of 1971, Council of Europe (Immunities of Persons Participating in Proceedings of European Commission and Court of Human Rights) Order 1971; SI 39 of 1972, INTELSTAT (Designation of Organisation and Immunities of Organisation and its Officers and Employees) Order 1972; SI 26 of 1972, International Atomic Energy Agency (Designation and Immunities) Order 1972; SI 178 of 1973, International Tin Council (Designation) Order 1973; SI 380 of 1974, International Cocoa Organisation (Designation) Order 1974; SI 141 of 1974, European University Institute (Designation of Organisation and its Officers and Servants) Order 1974; SI 79 of 1975, International Coffee Organisation (Designation) Order 1975; SI 324 of 1976, European Space Agency (Privileges and Immunities) Order 1976; SI 34 of 1976, APC-EPC Convention of Lomé (Privileges and Immunities) Order 1976; SI 329 of 1977, International Fund for Agricultural Development (Designation of Organisation) Order 1977; SI 275 of 1977, Financial Support Fund of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (Designation of Organisation) Order 1977; SI 291 of 1979, European Space Agency (Designation of Organisation) Order 1979; SI 339 of 1980, International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (Designation and Immunities) Order 1980; SI 333 of 1980, Eurocontrol (Designation and Immunities) Order 1980; SI 321 of 1980, International Olive Oil Council (Designation and Immunities) Order 1980; SI 274 of 1980, International Natural Rubber Organisation (Designation) Order 1980; SI 105 of 1980, The Second ACP-EEC Convention of Lomé (Privileges and Immunities) Order 1980; SI 235 of 1982, Common Fund for Commodities (Designation of Organisation) Order 1982; SI 203 of 1982, Intercountry Project for Statistical Computing (Privileges and Immunities) Order 1982; SI 184 of 1983, International Jute Organisation (Designation) Order 1983; SI 276 of 1984, International Tropical Timber Organisation (Designation of Organisation) Order 1984; SI 114 of 1985, ACP-EEC Convention of Lomé (Privileges and Immunities) Order 1985; SI 394 of 1986, International Fund for Ireland (Designation and Immunities) Order 1986; SI 370 of 1986, International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (Designation of Organisation) Order 1986; SI 290 of 1986, EUMETSAT (European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites) (Designation) Order 1986; SI 242 of 1986, International Organisation for International Carriage by Rail (OTIF) (Designation of Organisation) Order 1986; SI 125 of 1989, Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (Designation and Immunities) Order 1989; SI 116 of 1991, The Fourth ACP-EEC Convention of Lomé (Privileges and Immunities) Order 1991; SI 65 of 1991, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Designation and Immunities) Order 1991; SI 64 of 1991, Council of Europe (Privileges and Immunities) Order 1991; SI 186 of 1992, International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage (Privileges and Immunities) Order 1992; SI 144 of 1992, Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency (Privileges and Immunities) Order 1992; SI 193 of 1993, European Telecommunications Satellite Organisation (EUTELSAT) (Designation and Immunities) Order 1993; SI 192 of 1993, European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) (Privileges and Immunities) Order 1993; SI 191 of 1993, INTELSTAT (Designation of Organisation and Immunities of Organisation and its Officers and Employees) (Amendment) Order 1993; SI 465 of 1994, General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Designation and Immunities) Order 1994; SI 329 of 1994, World Trade Organisation (Designation and Immunities) Order 1994; SI 186 of 1994, European Radio Communications Office (Privileges and Immunities) Order 1994; SI 392 of 1996, European Patent Organisation (Designation and Immunities) Order 1996; SI 459 of 1998, Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Acts 1967 and 1976, Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (Designation and Immunities) Order 1997; SI 393 of 1998, Council of Europe (Privileges and Immunities) Order 1998; SI 476 of 2002, International Organisation of Vine and Wine (Designation) Order 2002; SI 89 of 2002, The International Organisation for Migration (Designation) Order 2002; SI 82 of 2002, The ACP-EC Partnership Agreement of Cotonou (Privileges and Immunities) Order 2002; and SI 914 of 2004, ATHENA (Designation and Immunities) Order 2004.Deputies can see from that list that there are individual organisations and also statutory instruments which were enhanced, renewed and changed as required as a result of subsequent decisions being taken either at an international convention or by those bodies in convention on a global basis. We had to reflect those decisions in our statutory instruments.The reference to which bodies may benefit from privileges and immunities is contained in both the 1967 and 1976 Acts and is not amended by this Bill. The Bill also deals with the nature of immunities which may be granted. It clarifies and defines that which may be granted and strengthens the position, role and relevance of the decisions taken and to be taken by Government, as clearly laid down by law through Oireachtas Éireann. Today we are enhancing the role of the Oireachtas in containing and restricting the Government to the decisions which it takes under both the 1967 and 1976 Acts, which is an important decision.A number of issues and questions were raised to which we can return on Committee Stage. Deputy Ó Snodaigh raised various military questions and I was interested in his attitude, particularly regarding the role of military attachés in particular missions in Ireland. As a sovereign state, this State cannot dictate to another sovereign state the capacity, qualifications or relevance of the people they place on their missions. Our job is to ensure that, based on the information we have, the international obligations which we must fulfil and the laws which govern this area, including the Vienna Convention, we take our decisions based on the requirement imposed and the desire of another sovereign state to have an accreditation to our country. Whoever countries decide to send, once they have made their decision and the criteria are met, the Government is obliged, after due relevant examination of both the individuals proposed and the accreditation required, to accept the decision.All these people carry diplomatic passports and as all in this House know, a passport is a sacrosanct document, the most important document one can have next to one's birth certificate. Respect for passports, be they the ordinary passports of the citizens of any state, or diplomatic passports, is critically important for the mobility of all people and for their protection.Deputy Durkan raised a question with regard to someone breaking the law in or outside a nightclub. This law of immunity would apply in such a situation unless the dispatching mission or country decided to waive the immunity. We are fortunate that never in the history of this State has any diplomat been granted immunity in this country as a result of being involved in a criminal activity elsewhere. We have a strong and unique record in that area. It shows the information, intelligence, focus and commitment which exists with regard to ensuring that we do our job to the highest standards of integrity and that the sovereign states which send their missions to us send us only diplomats of the highest quality.I echo the tributes paid to our ambassadors and diplomats throughout the world. As many Members have noted in the debate, they do an outstanding job on behalf of our country. They do a unique job in that the Irish flag flutters high across the world. It is served by people of unique abilities and commitment and absolute dedication. As Members of this House and members of Government, we have been privileged to benefit from the wise counsel, total commitment and absolute integrity of these people who serve their country and its citizens.They serve others as well, namely, those of the countries in which they are domiciled and those who find themselves in difficulty. One can recall the tsunami earlier this year. Our ambassador to Malaysia, Daniel Mulhall, came all the way from Kuala Lumpur, based himself in Phuket and discharged an outstanding service to the people of that troubled region at a difficult time. He not alone looked after the citizens of Ireland who were unfortunate victims but also looked after other citizens, from Europe and elsewhere, who required diplomatic services at that time. The delivery of that service has been acknowledged across Europe and the world.Deputy Boyle is anxious that we extend our missions to different parts of the world. Obviously there is a cost involved. We must be very measured in what we do and very careful where we place our missions. We have now changed our focus to some extent. For a small country like Ireland, having very strong missions in different parts of the world, it is critical that we have good representation. Accordingly we are opening consular offices in different places, with quality people delivering a focused service in important areas to ensure we can continue to cover the world and supply the highest level of diplomatic cover possible, taking into account the resources required to do so. We thank all of our diplomats at every level for the services they give to our country day and night, seven days a week, year on year. We are very grateful.This Bill will serve to address a technical concern regarding existing legislation which has arisen from recent case law. The Bill places a limitation on a legislative power which has been delegated to the Government so that existing legislation is in accordance with best legislative practice. In addition, this Bill will ensure that existing orders are on a firm basis. Both of these are important to the conduct of Ireland's international relations.I look forward to this Bill being brought before the select committee in due course. I look forward to the contributions of members of the committee. All the questions raised today can be revisited there. We will circulate the explanatory memorandum to ensure that everyone is fully briefed on the requirements contained in the Bill so that we can continue to enhance the legislative programme which is critically important to the running of a modern nation in an important area of global activity.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	290	I move:That the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs, in accordance with Standing Order 112(1) and paragraph 1(a)(i) of the Orders of Reference of that committee.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	291	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.The case to which the Deputies refer is that of Private Kevin Barrett, who died on 18 February 1999 while serving with the 84th infantry battalion in Lebanon. I avail of this opportunity to express my sympathy to the family of Private Barrett on their sad loss.The death of Private Barrett was the subject of a UN board of inquiry and an Irish contingent board of inquiry as well as a military police investigation. The coroner for north-west Donegal held an inquest into the death of Private Barrett on 5-8 September 2005. The jury returned an open verdict. I am advised the military authorities cooperated fully with the inquest into the soldier's death.I have arranged to meet the late Private Barrett's mother in the near future. I will listen carefully to what she has to say and then consider whether any future action is called for in light of the circumstances surrounding this unfortunate accident. Pending my meeting with Mrs. Barrett I prefer not to go into detail regarding the inquiries held to date. I am sure Deputies will appreciate that this is the proper approach in a sensitive situation such as this.

This is a tragic case and I warn the Minister that at the meeting Mrs. Barrett will express grave dissatisfaction at the way she was treated. The way this woman and her family were treated is nothing short of scandalous. I am not sure where the blame lies but this side of the House wants the Minister to initiate a Garda inquiry into the matter. The Minister might also examine the workings of his own Department and consider why material was not forthcoming when sought by one of the legal teams for the family. The material was not received until the inquest opened in Donegal in September this year. The military police sergeant who investigated the matter stated that something was not quite right about this shooting. On several occasions he sought the reopening of the case. The coroner expressed an open verdict on the case. One statement was withdrawn at the inquest and there is cause for concern. It is regrettable that we must wait on the actions of a mother bereaved of a son before we take action.I am an advocate of Irish people serving overseas and making a contribution. Tragedies have happened and will happen again. It is crucial to have structures in place so that families can have confidence in what they are told happened. When a body is returned from overseas it should come home in a proper and respectful manner and this was not the case.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	293	I join the Minister and the other speaker in extending sympathy to Mrs. Barrett and the family on the death of Kevin Barrett. I am disappointed by the Minister's response as he is well aware of the problem. Mrs. Barrett was told by the army that her son died as result of an accident and there were many unanswered questions. The Minister now proposes to have an investigation because the family wants to know the precise circumstances of the death. I want the Minister to state when the investigation will take place and the investigation must address the following questions. Why was the Barretts' legal team not given army documentation on Kevin Barrett's death? Will the Minister now make it available to the family? Serious questions remain about the condition of Kevin Barrett's body after his death. Can the Minister provide an explanation?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	294	I share the concern of the Deputies but I prefer to meet Mrs. Barrett to hear what she has to say. I do not need Deputy Timmins to tell me what she thinks. In respect of the inquiry, sometimes it is impossible to ascertain the circumstances in which someone died. In this case there have been inquiries by the UN, the Irish army and a three day inquest. In none of those cases was there a definitive conclusion on how this young man died.There has been a proposal for a Garda inquiry. I propose to read the transcript of the inquest and then read a report by the military on the inquest. Following my meeting with Mrs. Barrett I will speak to the military and then I will decide what further investigations are warranted. That may involve outside expertise or it may be a Garda inquiry. I will make the decision soon.

I understand the family did not receive results of any of these inquiries except the coroner's report. The family did not get the result of the main UN inquiry. The legal team sought the result of that inquiry and did not obtain it. The Minister stated that no inquiry came to a conclusion on the cause of death but I believe the UN inquiry concluded that death was caused by self-inflicted discharge of a weapon.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	296	Yes, but it did not conclude if it was accidental or deliberate.

The Minister should use his judgment without needing someone to tell him an inquiry should be carried out.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	298	The coroner, Dr. John Gannon, said Private Barrett died as a result of a discharge from an Army weapon. Why did it take so long to meet this lady to consider or listen to what she had to say on the matter? When does the Minister propose to meet this person and does he hope to set up the investigation immediately following the meeting?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	299	To answer Deputy Sherlock first, the lady in question did not seek to meet me. I initiated the contact with her and I will meet her next week. The inquest finished just last Tuesday fortnight. There has been no avoidable delay on my part. I initiated the contact with Mrs. Barrett.I wish to correct the record of the House. Deputy Timmins is absolutely wrong in the implications in his questions. First, a copy of the Defence Forces contingent board of inquiry has been released to solicitors representing the Barrett family.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	303	As an ex-Army officer, Deputy Timmins should know that United Nations boards of inquiry are internal documents of the United Nations. They are made available to state authorities on condition that they cannot be released or made public in any way, including for judicial proceedings. However, with the agreement of the United Nations, a copy of that part of the UN board of inquiry entitled "Description of the Incident", which gives a factual description of the circumstances of Private Barrett's death, was released to Mrs. Barrett. That is the position and there is nothing more we can do, as the Deputy knows.Deputy Timmins asked could I kick-start an inquiry from my casual observations of what appeared in the media. It is not a question of acting on casual observations. This is a very sensitive matter and I feel deeply sorry for the family who are obviously traumatised by this. I will not go off on some tangent based on some casual reading of a newspaper headline. I will not use this case to scrounge around for votes as the Deputy is doing.

I referred to information available in the public domain. The Minister should check the record.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	305	The Deputy said as clear as a bell would I not trigger an inquiry from a casual glance at the information.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	307	I will have another inquiry if I deem it necessary and having studied the matter properly, not in a casual manner, because it is not a case that should be dealt with in a casual manner.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	308	This is a serious matter. The Barrett legal team was not given the Army documentation. Will this documentation be given to the legal team?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	309	It has been given to them. A copy of the Defence Forces contingent board of inquiry has already been released to the Barrett family's legal team. I will inquire how long it took to release it or whether there was an undue delay.
#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-party	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-dob	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	310	The Minister is correct that the UN cannot release the court of inquiry document, which is an internal document. Under Defence Forces regulation C55, the Chief of Staff or Deputy Chief of Staff have the power to initiate an inquiry if they feel it is a matter of national importance.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	311	I repeat I will initiate any inquiries and seek the support and help of anyone to pursue these inquiries. However, there will be such inquiries as I determine are warranted having studied fully all the evidence and information available in the case.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	312	I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 5 and 165 together.The background to the rapid response elements concept, commonly referred to as battle groups, is that at the European Council in Helsinki in 1999, member states set themselves a headline goal that by the year 2003, co-operating together and voluntarily, they would be able to deploy rapidly and then sustain forces capable of the full range of Petersberg Tasks as set out in the Amsterdam treaty. In short, these are humanitarian, rescue, peacekeeping and crisis management operations, including peacemaking. This included, inter alia, a capability to provide rapid response elements available and deployable at very high readiness. The ambition of the EU to be able to respond rapidly to emerging crises has and continues to be a key objective of the development of the European security and defence policy, ESDP.Ireland's participation in such operations is entirely consistent with our foreign policy commitment to collective security which recognises the primary role of the UN Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security and our tradition of support for the United Nations. During his visit to Dublin in October 2004, the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, stressed the importance of battle groups and requested Ireland's support for them.At the Cabinet meeting of 16 November 2004, the Government agreed that I should advise my EU counterparts of Ireland's preparedness to enter into consultations with partners with a view to potential participation in rapid response elements. A military capabilities commitment conference was held on 22 November 2004 at which member states committed up to 13 battle group formations which will be available to deploy to crisis situations within a five to ten day period from 2005 onwards. A battle group co-ordination conference was held on 11 May 2005 at which initial offers and commitments by relevant member states were confirmed. It was noted that only one slot, the second semester of 2007, remains unfilled.Ireland supports the development of the EU's rapid response capability in support of UN authorised missions and is positively disposed towards participation in the rapid response elements in this regard. However, it is important that the full implications of our participation are assessed and, to this end, I have established an interdepartmental group to report to me on the matter. This group met in December 2004 and has established three sub-groups to address the policy, legislative and operational issues arising.The sub-groups met on a number of occasions over the summer to progress issues in regard to battle groups. The legal issues sub-group met on four occasions. The Attorney General's Office is now in the process of submitting its report on the legal issues involved to the Attorney General and I expect to receive his report shortly. Once the advice is received, the other two sub-groups will expedite the completion of their considerations and report to me shortly thereafter. I will then consider the report and advise the Government accordingly.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	313	I thank the Minister for his reply. He said recently during a visit to Haulbowline that he intends to bring the report to Cabinet at the end of September. Has the report not yet been considered or brought to Cabinet? I assume from his utterances and from the quotations in the article that the view he expressed previously in the House that he supports the triple lock method is no longer valid and that he wants to ditch it at this stage.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	314	I do not have the report. I anticipated the Attorney General's office would be a bit speedier than it has proved to be. However, I expect to hear from the Attorney General next week and there will be no avoidable delay in bringing the matter to Cabinet.Second, Deputy Gormley is absolutely wrong. He could not be more wrong even to imagine that I would abandon the triple lock method. I am fully and totally committed to the method.
#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-party	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-dob	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	315	Within time.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	316	I said on several occasions in this House, and I repeat today, that we understand the rationale of battle groups, rapid reaction in modern warfare and terrorism conditions, and we will participate provided we can do so while at the same holding onto the triple lock.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	317	The Minister said that his impression is it can be done by way of legislative change. He said that there will be certain elements in the Dáil that will fight that legislative change tooth and nail. I wonder who these certain elements are and why would we want to change it if there is no real change?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	318	As I outlined to the House on a number of occasions, there are some difficulties, particularly about Irish troops travelling abroad and the requirement for Dáil approval, a UN mandate, etc. This applies currently when people travel abroad to participate in peacekeeping if the number is more than 12 and they are under arms. I do not wish to anticipate the report but it may be necessary, for example, to amend the relevant legislation, the Defence Act, to enable people to travel abroad solely for the purpose of training. I expressed my personal opinion on a number of occasions that slight legislative change is all that is necessary in this instance. A constitutional change will not be required. I must await the advice of the Attorney General, who is the official legal adviser to the Government and on whose opinion I will act.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	319	It takes a long time for the Minister to achieve results in whatever capacity he operates. He must provide immediate clarification on the issue because there is ambiguity between his position and that of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is there conflict between them on this issue?The Minister says there is no point in changing the legislation. However, it is a while since the issue was raised and I would like him to clarify the current position. Has the Minister received the report of the expert committee on the options open to Ireland to allow members of the Defence Forces to participate in rapid reaction battle groups? If so, what are its recommendations?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	320	I have not received the report because the Attorney General has not forwarded his advice which will underpin the report. However, I expect that advice will be available next week. I did not say that legislative change would not be necessary. I said a legislative amendment will probably be necessary.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	321	But not a constitutional amendment?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	322	Yes. That is my opinion but I must await the advice of the Attorney General. There is no conflict between me and the Minister for Foreign Affairs or any other Minister on this matter. We are all ad idem in our commitment to the triple lock, and our determination to respond to the entreaties of the United Nations and its Secretary General and the demands of international peacekeeping by participating in battle groups while holding on to the triple lock.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	323	Assuming the Minister obtains the report next week, when will the legislation be introduced, given that this involves a relatively small change? Does he agree that all these small changes are chipping away at the last vestiges of neutrality?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	324	I do not wish to anticipate what the report will suggest. I am confident I will have the report and I will be in position to go to Cabinet before we meet again for Question Time. We will discuss what, if anything, the report proposes by way of legislative amendment at that point.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	325	The Government task force on emergency planning last met on Tuesday, 20 September 2005. The membership of the task force includes Ministers, senior officials of Departments, senior officers of the Defence Forces and the Garda, and officials of other key public authorities that have a lead or support role in Government emergency planning. The work of the task force continues and there have been 41 meetings to date. Further meetings will be held on a regular basis as required. The office of emergency planning within my Department supports the work of the task force and continues to work with Departments and other public authorities to ensure the best use of resources and compatibility between different emergency planning requirements. A key area of activity of the task force is oversight of emergency planning to refine and develop the arrangements that exist, to continuously improve them through regular review and revision and to generally provide the basis for an increased confidence in the emergency planning process.An interdepartmental working group on emergency planning supports the work of the task force and carries out studies and oversight of emergency planning structures and processes. The working group has met on 37 occasions and it encompasses all Departments with lead roles in the various Government emergency plans and key public authorities, including the Defence Forces, which plan to support such activities. The working group, under the guidance of the Government task force, continues to meet on a regular basis and is chaired by the office of emergency planning. It is a forum for developing strategic guidance to all those involved and for sharing information on emergency planning.The lead responsibility for specific emergency planning functions remains with the relevant Departments, as do the budgetary and resource management requirements. Emergency plans are co-ordinated by the various lead Departments at a national level and through the local authorities, including the fire service, the Health Service Executive and the Garda divisions at local and regional levels. The Defence Forces contribute significantly to the work of both the Government task force and the interdepartmental working group on emergency planning. The Defence Forces emergency planning and preparations are of the highest standard and are well co-ordinated with the lead Departments and other key public authorities.The Departments and key public authorities involved have responsibilities under a number of strategic areas of Government emergency planning and regularly report on developments and progress at meetings of the task force. The Government's objective is to ensure all State bodies can react quickly and efficiently to a large scale emergency. Each of the Departments represented at the task force has assured the office of emergency planning it is addressing its emergency planning responsibilities and plans and response arrangements are in place to address large scale emergencies in Ireland.As chairman of the task force, my approach continues to be that such responses must be characterised by effective management of all aspects of emergency planning and by a high level of public confidence in all the response arrangements. Review and refinement arrangements will ensure co-ordination of all those responding so that should we be unfortunate enough to experience a large scale emergency, we will mount a credible response.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.I will continue to report regularly on a confidential basis to Government on emergency planning. I am pleased to report to this House that there continues to be excellent co-operation between my Department and all other Departments and public authorities in these vital areas.

Has the task force been allocated funding since 2001? How is it resourced? Has the task force overseen exercises? If so, have reports been published on how they were carried out and on whether they were successful? In 2003 the Emergency Planning Society recommended to Government that emergency planning should be underpinned by legislation and an emergency planning authority should be created? In other words, one group would be responsible with one person in charge and this would be underpinned by legislation.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	327	The task force comprises representatives of various Departments and, therefore, funding is not required per se. We try to meet at least once a month in Government Buildings. I chair the task force.The recommendation to which the Deputy referred reflects the emergency planning model used in Britain and the US. It is generally felt, although perhaps not by the group to which the Deputy referred, that the model we use under which Departments are responsible for their own plans and it is the task of Government to co-ordinate the entire operation is more appropriate to Ireland's circumstances and it has worked well. Fortunately, we have not experienced a large scale terrorist attack or a nuclear explosion. However, the outbreak of foot and mouth disease several years ago was handled well, using the emergency planning process. I remain confident the arrangements in place are best suited to Ireland's circumstances. Just because the British or the Americans use a particular system does not mean it is right. Our system is similar to that adopted by Spain. The Spanish had to deal with an unfortunate incident in the not too distant past, which they dealt with well.A full programme of exercises has been carried out and all the exercises were extremely successful. I will ask my officials to make the full list available to the Deputy.

However, the Civil Defence, which comprises 6,000 personnel, is an important element of emergency planning. The Minster recently came in for criticism following the appointment of a former Fianna Fáil councillor to lead the body. What expertise has he in this area? It is a strange appointment.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	329	That is a separate question, not a supplementary.

Why did the Minister make this appointment?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	331	This is a separate question but I have no problem responding to it. The person I appointed is eminently well qualified for the job. He has vast experience both in business and in the public sector, where he worked for many years as a community welfare officer. He has administrative experience as a member of Limerick County Council. He served in the FCA for many years and he is well known as a community leader in the area. His association with a political party should not disqualify him.Question No. 5 answered with QuestionNo. 3.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	332	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 155 and 163 together.The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 sets out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force, comprising 930 for the Air Corps, 1,144 for the Naval Service and 8,426 for the Army.The strength of the Defence Forces, and the number of female personnel by rank, as advised by the military authorities, is provided in the following table. The figures are correct as at 31 August 2005.The White Paper provides an overall strength figure of 10,500 for the Permanent Defence Force, all ranks. This figure comprehends provision for the allocation of up to 850 members of the Permanent Defence Force to overseas peacekeeping missions at any given time. The military authorities advise there are some 750 members of the Permanent Defence Force serving overseas on such missions. I am satisfied the current strength is adequate to meet all needs arising at home and overseas.I intend to maintain the established Government policy of ongoing recruitment to the Defence Forces.

Will he confirm that the Reserve Defence Force has been disbanded? I received a call from somebody today who went in for training last night and was told the training centre was closed and that he should turn up in Limerick to say goodbye. There may be no truth in this but the Minister might be able to clarify the matter.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	334	There is an ongoing programme of reform of the Reserve Defence Forces. The FCA is becoming the Army Reserve and Slua Muirí is becoming the Naval Reserve. Therefore the different units are being reorganised and amalgamated in various places. The official changeover takes place next Saturday, 1 October 2005. The ceremony will take place at Sarsfield Barracks in Limerick and I will extend an invitation to Deputy Timmins if he wishes to attend.I am not aware of the case to which the Deputy refers but there should be no interruption to training or anything of that nature. There was no question of closing until next Saturday. That is not the position and should not have happened.

Sreenan visited the United States from 28 March 2005 to 1 April 2005 on foot of an invitation from General Richard B. Meyers, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This visit was a Chiefs of Defence Staff visit, which is a traditional means of CHODs paying courtesy visits to their foreign counterparts and discussing matters of mutual interest.Lt. Gen. Sreenan held bilateral discussions with General Meyers and his staff on matters of common interest, namely operational aspects of UN mandated peace support operations in Kosovo, KFOR; Bosnia, EUFOR; Afghanistan, ISAF; and sub-Saharan Africa.Lt. Gen. Sreenan also held bilateral discussions with commandants of schools where Irish officers attend training courses. Lt. Gen. Sreenan also used the visit to observe demonstrations and be briefed on the latest developments in regard to equipment for the protection of the individual soldier on peace support missions.

The indication was that he had been instructed because of a possible embarrassment and unfavourable optics to go missing.Does he agree that the meetings outlined in his response reveal that we are hand in glove with the United States in military matters? This is confirmed almost every day in Shannon where we are complicit in this bloody war in Iraq which gets worse day by day. Our so-called neutrality is going out the window. The Minister, and this Government in particular, have contributed more than any other Government to dismantling the last vestiges of our neutrality.

I do not feign illness. I was visiting a barracks in Athlone. I did not feel very well. The visit went on longer than I had anticipated and there was not sufficient time to travel to Dublin to keep the appointment with General Meyers which I regretted and for which I apologised. That is the truth and I hope the Deputy accepts that. There was no question of me being instructed to go missing. I do not go missing and I certainly do not take instructions to go missing from anybody, no matter who he or she is.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	348	No. I take no instructions of that nature from anybody. I am who I am. I was genuinely ill on that day and genuinely sorry I could not meet General Meyers. There was no insult intended to General Meyers. I made that clear to his staff and to the American Embassy.I compliment Deputy Gormley on his wonderfully imaginative description of us getting rid of neutrality and being "hand in glove with the United States" and "complicit in the bloody war in Iraq". There is no complicity in the war in Iraq. This is an arrangement in Shannon that has continued for the past 50 or 60 years under the jurisdiction of various Governments.If the Green Party becomes part of the next Government Deputy Gormley will insist that this arrangement comes to an end and we will lose 1,500 jobs immediately in the Shannon area. The troops will be able to go to another airport in a so-called neutral country to avail of the facilities there. Some countries whose governments won elections on the basis of opposing the Americans fell over one another to offer the facility to the United States if we were to withdraw it.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	368	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 11 and 32 together.The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women in the Defence Forces, Army, Air Corps, Naval Service, including the Reserve Defence Force, and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities. In effect that means that women are eligible on the same basis as men for participation in operational and ceremonial activities, for assignment to all military appointments and educational and training courses, and for promotion. All female personnel undergo the same training and receive the same military education as their male counterparts.To encourage increased participation by women in the Defence Forces, my predecessor decided in March 1998 to reduce the height requirement for all female recruits to 162.5 cm, or 5 ft. 4 in. That height requirement now also applies to male recruits. The Defence Forces actively encourages female applicants, for example, by advertising. Where possible, all graphical advertisements and booklets produced for the Defence Forces show both male and female personnel and emphasise that all applicants are assessed on an equal basis. Stands at recruiting fairs are generally staffed by male and female personnel. When the Defence Forces are invited to give talks at all-female or mixed schools, every effort is made to have a female speaker.The strength of female personnel in the Permanent Defence Force grew from 244 at the end of 1997 to 524 at the end of August 2005. That constitutes an increase of over 100% in the number of females serving over the period. On 5 August 2005, I wrote to both the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, along with a number of outside organisations, seeking their views and recommendations on how more women might be encouraged to enlist in the Defence Forces. I hope to have replies by the end of this month.When the submissions have been received and examined, I propose that officials, both civil and military, of my Department meet representatives of each of the organisations that made submissions, along with the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers and the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, to consider the ideas and suggestions to see what, if any, improvements or changes can be made to the programme of recruitment to encourage more females to join the Defence Forces.

He mentioned height, which is an old bugbear of mine. If I understood him correctly, the requirement is now 5 ft. 4 in. for both males and females.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	370	Yes.

#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	372	The Minister appealed for more women to join the Army. Did he do so mainly to be politically correct? He claims that a great deal has been done to encourage women into the Defence Forces, but can he expand that to say what specific initiatives have been taken in the 12 months since he assumed office?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	373	To be honest, I do not know the answer to Deputy Timmins's question. I do not know why women do not see it as the job for them. Traditionally, that has been the case, and fortunately we are trying to change that. I take the Deputy's point about height. As he knows, the Garda Síochána has got rid of the height requirement and instead introduced one for physical fitness. To the best of my knowledge, that has been the case for the last few years. I have asked the military about this. I believe that the United States has a lower limit of 4 ft. 10 in. and Australia 5 ft.There was a time in Ireland when the lower limit for male recruits was under 5 ft. I have asked the Army about that. One of the problems is health and safety. The Army received medical advice that females in particular, but also men under a certain height, because of some of the gear that they have to wear, especially when abroad, are more likely to be damaged by the physical activity in which they are forced to engage as part of their duties in the Army. That is being kept under constant review, and I have asked the military to report to me on it.

Put bluntly, half the population are women, but only 5% of those in the Army or the Naval Service, and fewer than 5% of those in the Air Corps are. Women should be allowed to play their part.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	377	I propose to take the questions together.The House is well aware of speculation surrounding affairs at Irish Ferries and, in particular, the intolerable consequences upon the staff thereof who, against a background of threats to their livelihood, are being asked to take very important decisions from their perspective. Issues which arise for Irish Ferries and their staff must be addressed internally within the organisation, and such is the legal requirement regarding most other sectors of employment under the Protection of Employment Act 1977, although seafarers are excluded from it. This issue has not arisen in isolation and, no doubt, has a background. It must be resolved within the organisation itself, albeit with the assistance of the State's industrial relations machinery.Ireland's access to overseas markets is vital, and companies such as Irish Ferries have benefited from our economic growth. They have also benefited from the stability of the Irish industrial relations framework. Accordingly, it is in the interests of all parties that a resolution be reached in the matter. I understand that the national implementation body met yesterday evening to consider the situation in Irish Ferries and that issues remain under its consideration.I also understand that the Labour Court has been in touch with both parties, and I strongly urge them to engage with it with a view to seeking a resolution. We are all aware that the legal framework of the employees concerned is dictated by the laws of the state in which the ship is registered. Accordingly, Irish registered ships remain subject to the provisions of Irish law regardless of where the ship is.Primary responsibility for the sector rests with the Minister and Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. The Minister of State has already stated that he considers the measures announced extreme and that the implementation of the proposed redundancies would have grave consequences for Irish seafarer employment, given Irish Ferries' position as the largest employer of Irish seafarers. He expressed his hope that the company would delay implementation of its plan until recent proposals concerning State aid guidelines for the sector have been considered by the Government.The Department has sought preliminary legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General on whether a statutory redundancy situation will exist in Irish Ferries. As no direct communication has been received in the Department regarding what exactly the company intends from a statutory redundancy perspective, it will not be possible for the Office of the Attorney General to provide definitive advice at this stage. I repeat the Government's position on the current Irish Ferries situation, which was given by the Taoiseach to this House yesterday, namely, that in an Irish labour context the action is sharp practice and totally unacceptable.Part of the question referred to the cost. Since we do not have the figures, it is difficult to give it. However, I have indicative figures. If a statutory redundancy situation were established at Irish Ferries — no note has been received in the Department in that regard — and 500 workers with 20 years' service, each earning €600 a week, were made redundant, the gross cost of such statutory redundancy would be 500 x 600 x 20 x 2 x 1, which is €12,000,500. That is two weeks' pay per year of service, plus a bonus week.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	378	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing the Private Notice Questions.After the Taoiseach's strong comments in response to Deputy Rabbitte yesterday, we know how the Government feels about this. What will it do specifically? He strongly urges the company to comply with normal industrial relations practices. Has either the Taoiseach or the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment sought a meeting with the management of Irish Ferries? Does the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, intend to seek a meeting with the management to convey in no uncertain terms that the view of the Government and this House is that its behaviour is sharp practice, unacceptable and a mortal blow to the concept of social partnership?Has the Minister of State, who has special responsibility within his Department for labour affairs, conveyed the view directly to IBEC, as the parent organisation involved, that the concept of social partnership will be damaged severely if this proposal by a maverick company is allowed to be implemented? Has he had any discussions with his colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Gallagher, in regard to the safety aspects of this matter? The job done already by this company on the MV Normandy has ensured the normal maintenance carried out up to now by Rosslare Ship Repairs is no longer being done. That company has folded and the vulnerable employees working for less than the minimum wage are not only crewing the ship but carrying out routine maintenance. Is the Minister of State as concerned as I about the health and safety aspect, as well as all the other issues involved in this desperate set of proposals?
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	379	Deputy Howlin has raised several issues. I am glad the four Deputies have chosen to put down these questions because it is an extremely important issue which should be debated in the House.Members are aware it has not been the practice here for a Government representative to make a direct approach to a company in regard to issues such as this. The voluntarist approach has served us well. There is a considerable amount of labour relations machinery, including the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court. We always urge parties in dispute to take their grievances to these bodies in the first instance. There are good reasons for this, not least that it is likely to be the most successful approach. As Members are aware, one party in this seems to embrace that process much more than the other. However, the national implementation body has been involved and some matters are still under consideration at that level.I agree with Deputy Howlin that this proposal is most damaging and, like him, I worry about its implications for social partnership. With regard to the role of IBEC, it is difficult for any Member to find fault with bodies or individuals who make representations. We do it all the time and it is a matter for IBEC in its judgment as to how it chooses to represent its members.

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	381	IBEC has not enhanced its reputation in this matter but it is for that organisation to decide the approach it should take.I answered questions yesterday in regard to the role of the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Gallagher. I pointed out that when these ships are docked in Irish ports, regardless of the flag of convenience issue, it is open to the Irish authorities to check them for health and safety requirements. This has been done in the past in regard to MV Normandy. However, I was not aware at that stage of the points raised by Deputy Howlin today and I undertake to raise them with the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	382	The Farrell Grant Sparks report highlighted the clear warning sign given when Irish Ferries first brought up the issue of additional tax breaks some years ago. Moreover, the privatisation of the Normandy route which serves Cherbourg and Roscoff was another clear indicator that what is happening now was inevitable. Why did the Government not act in regard to the PRSI exemptions which ended in 2003, in respect of which the Minister is attempting to obtain agreement in Europe?Despite major State investment, including the allocation of €51 million for the National Maritime College of Ireland in Ringaskiddy, County Cork, there was no emphasis on safeguarding jobs for seafarers. There was another clear warning sign from the Irish Maritime Development Office which received the sector's existing State aids and recommended their implementation. Why did the Government do nothing before now and why has it allowed Irish Ferries to make this outrageous announcement regarding compulsory redundancies?
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	383	The issues raised by Deputy Perry were addressed to some extent by the Taoiseach yesterday. He is correct that there has been substantial investment by the State in terms of training seafarers and other matters. It is reasonable to say this action was flagged by previous events in regard to the MV Normandy. However, we do not serve anybody’s interests by pretending we have control over issues when this is not the case. We do not have control over situations where vessels are flying flags of convenience. This is a weakness which may need to be addressed at European or even international level and it makes tackling this issue somewhat difficult in some of its aspects.The exemptions Deputy Perry mentioned and the other tax breaks were introduced before my time and I cannot account for what has happened in the past. I face a major challenge in trying to ensure what we do in the present and in the future addresses what is an outrageous attack on Irish workers.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	384	The point I make in regard to the PRSI exemptions is that the EU will agree to them because it is the standard practice in other territorial waters. If the PRSI exemptions were in place, the actions now taken by Irish Ferries would not have arisen. It seems the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Gallagher, knew of this situation 18 months ago but failed to act. The result is that seafarers, Irish people educated here, are being forced out of work. This is not an issue that arose years ago, this is an immediate problem and it is affecting people now. The Minister of State has said he is now seeking derogation for Irish Ferries until permission is forthcoming from the EU for the PRSI exemption. Why has the Minister waited until now to seek permission from the EU? That is the problem.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	385	The current situation at Irish Ferries arises against a background of the company being quite profitable. It would have been difficult to predict that this issue would arise at this time, notwithstanding the point Deputy Perry made that issues had already arisen in regard to the MV Normandy. I am not entirely clear in regard to the implications of the PRSI exemptions, nor am I clear that the outcome Deputy Perry outlines would be automatic were the derogation in place at this stage. We await legal advice on a number of issues, not least the important one of statutory redundancy. I will report to the House as soon as I have that information.

I welcome the Taoiseach's comments yesterday in regard to sharp practice. A situation where a chief executive who earns €14,617 a week and has a personal fortune of €20 million invested in his company can tell workers to leave and that he will replace them with employees who might be paid €1 per week is an utter disgrace. It is absolute gangsterism.

It is critical that the Minister of State, his counterpart in the Depart of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Taoiseach now take action as my colleague, Deputy Howlin, has urged. Will the Government tell Eamon Rothwell and his management team they must withdraw the deadline and engage in no more outrageous and disgraceful intimidation of workers? Will the Government convey this message tonight? The company's behaviour is arbitrary and disgraceful.Is it the case that the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and the Minister of State at that Department, Deputy Gallagher, have still not received a copy of the Sparks report? This report was compiled by respected consultants who examined the company and asserted that it would remain profitable beyond 2007 because it carries out a vital function for our island nation. Is it not extraordinary that Mr. Rothwell rejected this report before the responsible Minister saw it? Has the Minister seen it yet and what is proposed to be done about it?The Minister of State says that the matter is not within the Government's control. He implies that the sea is a sort of jungle. This morning, we heard from Scottish trade union leaders that the Scottish Executive has successfully implemented a licensing system for all ferries and other vessels operating out of Scottish ports. To tender for a Scottish route, it is necessary to adhere to Scotland's rules on manning levels, conditions and wages. What is the Government doing about that? Yesterday, the Taoiseach wrung his hands. Can we have a licensing system to ensure that the disgraceful behaviour of the Irish Ferries management is not repeated?In terms of the reference to the national implementation body and the Labour Court by the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, where does he expect these events will lead to? What can be done over the next few days?The document I have before me, which was provided by the International Transport Workers Federation and SIPTU, is a draft EU directive from 2000 concerning ferries. My constituency colleague, Deputy Woods, and the great former Minister of State, Deputy Jacob both dealt with this matter at different stages.

The Deputy made the point that part of our defence has been that certain matters are not within our control and it is a jungle out there.

That will be an important element of this matter.On what the national implementation body and the Labour Court can do, it is difficult to predict the outcome of this dispute. The week before last, I did not hold great hopes in terms of another dispute but it worked out extraordinarily well. It is fair to say that both bodies have a positive record. It is in everybody's interest that all parties enter the negotiations directly rather than through an intermediary. The sooner that is done, the more likely it will be that the bodies will be successful.The draft EU directive on ferries has apparently existed since 2000. Over the past year I have become familiar with draft EU directives. It does not surprise me to find that a draft directive is in the works for a considerable period. The good news is that, ultimately these directives ——

#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	418	I was about to make suggestions concerning the Scottish Executive and the European trades directive but the Minister of State has addressed these issues.Where will the matter leave workers in other industries? Last week, Aer Lingus workers talked about having been pushed out of jobs. Is the Minister of State concerned about the precedent that will be set if the matter is allowed come to pass? Other company executives will explore similar methods of increasing profits. Where does that leave the minimum wage or workers' basic rights? People are being forced out of their jobs. They are being bullied. The reality of this so called redundancy package is that peoples' arms are twisted and they are made to leave their jobs. What can be done? The Minister of State has talked about looking at this and that, which will not be of much use to workers contemplating their future. Will the Government introduce legislation to prevent this precedent being followed by other companies?
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	419	On the basis of the information available to me, there is no danger this precedent would cause effects in the manner outlined by Deputy Crowe. The difficulties that have arisen concern vessels operating under non-Irish flags. In the circumstances outlined by the Deputy, the workers clearly operate under the terms and conditions of Irish labour legislation. The dangers outlined will not automatically arise from the attempt by Irish Ferries to displace its staff. However, it is useful to be warned that a constituency is pursuing this agenda. I am satisfied that the machinery of the State in terms of legislation and support mechanisms would be strong enough to deal with this situation were it within Irish jurisdiction. The minimum wage, which was increased this year, is sometimes found not to be paid. We eventually manage to track down offenders. A system exists to redress breaches of the rights enshrined in our legislation.In terms of redundancy, a slightly different situation obtains. We are awaiting detailed legal advice and no redundancies have as yet been notified. In a situation where workers were thrown out of their jobs because a factory was closing, the State would be obliged to move quickly to look after those workers and ensure their rights are honoured. That is not the case in this matter. I do not view as an automatic right that a company in this situation would be able to come with a begging bowl to the State.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	420	The Minister of State said his legal opinion may be that these redundancies will not be liable to further redundancy payments that would ordinarily apply if a company is closing. If that is the route to be taken will he outline further the real consequences for the workers involved and the whole proposal from the company? What would that lead to given that he has signalled that may be the way he will proceed? If this is, as we see it, a race to the bottom in terms of replacing current working conditions and staff with those from economies of lower pay demands and conditions how are similar occurrences to be restricted from happening across a whole range of different Irish industries and businesses?
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	421	Given the generosity of redundancies and the precedent set with regard to payments has the Government stated categorically that it will not pay it because it would set an unbelievable precedent? Will the Minister of State agree it was a major mistake not to have renegotiated the derogation for PRSI? The derogation would have meant 20% of taxation which would have made the jobs more sustainable. Is it a mistake that we are only now raising it with the EU?

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	428	In regard to Deputy Eamon Ryan's question on redundancy, as I said previously I do not have detailed legal advice at this stage. My understanding is that redundancies occur in a situation where the job has finished. It would seem that it is stretching it considerably to suggest a redundancy occurs where one worker is displaced and replaced by another. However, we have learned here and elsewhere that it is prudent to await legal advice. We are all aware of situations where people have run off to the courts and have succeeded in getting decisions one would have hoped they may not have got. There is reason to try to ensure that would not arise.In regard to the race to the bottom, so far as other jobs are within the jurisdiction of the State there are considerably stronger safeguards, although I cannot say there are cast iron safeguards. I concede there are developments across a range of areas that concern me.

#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	439	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in Ireland. County Kerry has the highest incidence of cardiovascular disease in Ireland. Documentation provided by the CHAIR project organised by the former Southern Health Board clearly demonstrated that cardiovascular patients in County Kerry are under-served compared to patients in Cork.A cardiologist was appointed six months ago to provide a cardiology service for Kerry patients both in Tralee General Hospital and in the private hospital, the Bon Secours Hospital, Tralee. This improved access considerably for Kerry patients to invasive cardiology facilities, in other words, angiograms. Prior to the appointment 4% of CHAIR admissions to Tralee General Hospital had coronary-angiography as inpatients. After his appointment such admissions increased to 17%. The service for public patients was withdrawn recently due to a lack of funding. This is disappointing as the service provided by the consultant, Dr. Victor Kocka, was proven to be extremely effective and beneficial.The national cardiovascular strategy report of 2003 recommended a full-time cardiologist for County Kerry as a matter of priority at that time. We still did not get that cardiologist. Currently there is 0.4% of a cardiology post in County Kerry serving a population of 126,000. County Cork which has a population of 420,000 has six cardiologists. I understand Comhairle na nOspidéal is evaluating the case for the appointment of a full-time cardiologist in Kerry.I appeal to the Minister of State to convey to the Minister my request that a full-time cardiologist be appointed to Tralee General Hospital starting in January 2006. This appointment should also be accompanied by the necessary support staff and adequate funding. Serious consideration should also be given to the provision of invasive cardiology facilities, including coronary angiography, coronary intervention and permanent pacingin Tralee General Hospital. These facilities would be most beneficial for Kerry patients and would provide urgent access and avoid the long journey patients have to endure to avail of this facility in Cork city. I appeal to the Minister of State to represent my case to the Minister as a matter of urgency. For whatever reason Kerry has the highest rate of coronary disease in the country. For example, in the period from 1998 to 2002 of the 25,149 deaths in the Southern Health Board region, counties Kerry and Cork, 10,726, or 43%, were attributed to diseases of the circulatory system and the higher percentage of those was in County Kerry. It makes no sense that County Kerry would be without a single cardiologist. It is unfair to the population of Kerry. Without wishing to exaggerate, I am convinced that fatalities have occurred in the past and will do so in future because of the lack of basic cardiovascular treatment facilities in the county. This is an urgent matter and I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for having allowed me to raise it on the Adjournment.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	440	I have been asked to take this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.I thank Deputy Deenihan for having raised this matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline the details of the work in progress to address cardiovascular disease in Kerry. The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for the provision of services at Kerry General Hospital.Heart disease is the single biggest killer in Ireland and living with heart disease is an everyday reality for thousands of Irish people and their families. To tackle this disease the Government launched, in 1999, the cardiovascular health strategy "Building Healthier Hearts", which contains 211 evidence-based recommendations.The overall aims of the strategy are: to reduce the risk factor profile in the general population, to detect those at high risk, to deal effectively with those who have clinical diseases, and to ensure the best survival and quality of life outcome for those recovering from an acute attack.Since 1999, the Government has committed more than €60 million towards the implementation of the strategy. This funding has supported a wide range of new regional services and initiatives, which have had a measurable impact on the diagnosis and treatment of patients with heart disease.As regards tackling cardiovascular disease, the Department of Health and Children has been advised by the Health Service Executive's southern area that investment in the development of cardiology services has taken place in all service areas across the region in Cork and Kerry under the cardiovascular health strategy. Cardiovascular disease accounts for 46% of all deaths in Cork and Kerry.In line with priorities identified in the Southern Health Board's cardiovascular health strategy five-year action plan, published in June 2000, Kerry General Hospital received in excess of €500,000 over the first three years of the strategy to develop cardiology-related services in the hospital. This has resulted in the appointment of 11.5 technical and administrative staff for the hospital.The strengthening of its infrastructure has enabled Kerry General Hospital to develop a cardiac rehabilitation service and a cardiac non-invasive diagnostic service, as well as extending its telemetry service in cardiac care units, extending its resuscitation-training programme and providing for ongoing staff training. It has also ensured that essential cardiac equipment was procured for the cardiology services at the hospital.I am advised that the priority for the region, as identified in the interim report of the joint working group on cardiology manpower is the appointment of a full-time consultant cardiologist at Kerry General Hospital.In April 2004, €350,000 was allocated under the strategy to support the consultant post in Kerry cardiac rehabilitation services and a first responder programme in the region. Subsequently, €160,000 was allocated in 2004 to begin the process of establishing the consultant cardiology service in Kerry with a full year allocation of €476,000 in 2005. This funding has allowed the HSE southern area to appoint a cardiac technician, nurse and clerical support, as well as providing non-pay costs for such services as angiograms and angioplasts.A consultant cardiologist was appointed in 2005 in a partnership arrangement between Kerry General Hospital and the Bon Secours Hospital, Tralee. The principal appointment is with the Bon Secours Hospital in Tralee and involves a temporary sessional arrangement with Kerry General Hospital enabling the consultant to work in partnership with Kerry General Hospital in developing specialist cardiology services. Weekly sessions are divided on the following basis: Bon Secours Hospital, Tralee, seven sessions and Kerry General Hospital, four sessions.I am advised that an application has been forwarded to NHO/Comhairle to seek funding for a full-time consultant cardiologist post for Kerry General Hospital. I am confident that Kerry General Hospital will continue to provide high quality services to the people of Kerry.

I also acknowledge the presence of the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, who will respond to the debate. It is certainly better than having a Minister or a Minister of State here who has nothing to do with that Department.The bombshell announcement by Hospira of Donegal town on 23 August last is still sending shock waves throughout the entire county. This was the latest in a savage litany of such job loss announcements in Donegal over the past five years that have brought the total of industrial job losses in the county to more than 7,000. Our industrial base has been virtually wiped out, leaving the county with the highest unemployment rate in the country, at more than four 4 times the national average.Prior to the Hospira announcement the vast majority of job losses in the county were in the textile sector. Names such as Fruit of the Loom, Comer Yarns, Herdsman's, Nena Models and, more recently, Clubman Omega come to mind. The textile and clothing industry in Donegal — with a few honourable exceptions, such as Magee and Company of Donegal town and Sioen Protective Clothing in my own parish of Gweedore — has vanished off the employment map.We were conditioned into accepting that the loss of these traditional type jobs was inevitable and were transferring to low-cost economies. However, Hospira, a pharmaceutical company involved in the production of health care products, was looked upon as the industry of the future, a virtual flagship for the county. The 560 workers were confident of their future. Such modern type industries require the skills and training of an educated work force, or so we were told. However, we now realise that even such modern industries are not immune to closure. The Hospira jobs are not being lost. They are simply being transferred to Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic in Central America.The loss of the Hospira jobs will have devastating economic and social consequences for south-west Donegal, an area already suffering from economic depression from the crisis in the fishing industry. The main breadwinners for hundreds of families are being consigned to the already bulging ranks of the unemployed, with little or no immediate prospects of finding alternative employment in their own county. Many have huge financial and family commitments. Mortgages are outstanding and families have to be educated.The fall-out is not confined to those immediately losing their jobs in Hospira. It will have a knock on effect on every business and service industry in the area, including hotels, restaurants, cafés, hairdressers and crèches. Every single service will suffer from the impact.The management of Hospira had the highest praise for the skills and the commitment of the workforce. The closure is not a reflection on their loyalty or dedication. Instead, the finger of blame has been pointed directly at the Government's failure to control costs for manufacturers. Many of these costs are imposed directly by the Government in the form of stealth taxes. Others arise where the Government has a direct influence, such as the high cost of energy, insurance, PRSI payments and exorbitant commercial rates.When the news broke we had the usual chorus of sympathy and promises from Ministers, saying that "every effort must be made" and "we must harness all the agencies". The old time-worn scripts were just being recycled and regurgitated. We have heard it so often before. Empty promises and pious platitudes are no longer sufficient. They do not put bread on the table.A new departure is required. We do not need yet another task force or the commissioning of a further report. The special status of the county must be recognised. An extraordinary situation requires extraordinary measures. Incentives must be offered to industries willing to locate in County Donegal. This can be done in many ways, such as tax incentives and rates concessions. Access and communications must be further improved.In spite of the industrial body blows in recent years, County Donegal has so much to offer — an attractive and pleasant environment, excellent educational facilities, a skilled and educated workforce, excellent housing at reasonable prices and the absence of traffic jams, to name but a few attractions.With proper marketing, promotion and commitment, jobs can be attracted to the county. Our citizens only wish to live and work in their own environment. It is the responsibility of the Government to deliver these jobs. We are often told of the numbers of jobs created in the past seven years and I do not dispute the figures, which are probably accurate. However, very few of these have been created in County Donegal. We have lost more than 7,000 jobs in the period and fewer than 1,000 jobs have been created to replace these losses. In future the Government will not be judged on what it promises but on the number of jobs provided for the thousands of unemployed throughout the county. I ask for the commitment of the Minister of State and his colleagues. I hope that in his response he will hold out some hope for the thousands who have lost their jobs and the many who never had jobs in Donegal.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	442	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. The announcement by the company that it is to close its Donegal facility is most disappointing and particularly devastating for the workers and families directly affected. The role of FÁS, the State training agency, will be particularly important in assisting those who are to lose their jobs. FÁS has already been in contact with the company and will provide advice and training opportunities for the Hospira workforce. The agency will make its full range of services available to the workers, which will include top level agreement with the company on responsibilities and actions; intensive interviews, individually and/or in groups, with affected workers that will outline the range of supports and services available; preparation of a skills analysis report by FÁS based on identified workers' needs and local opportunities; referral by FÁS of affected workers to jobs, training courses or other options; establishment by FÁS of special or customised training courses where necessary; and ongoing support and action to keep redundant workers in touch with the labour market.In addition, Enterprise Ireland is also providing information and support for those who might wish to start their own businesses. IDA Ireland is also in discussion with the company regarding the possible future use of the facility in Donegal town. The full support of the Donegal County Enterprise Board is also being made available.The Deputy will be aware that there have been significant job announcements in Donegal recently, with more than 210 new jobs announced last week by Zeus Industrial Products and PowerBoard. These projects being supported by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, respectively, are in addition to 423 jobs which the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment announced earlier this year for the north-west region. The State development agencies, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, FÁS and the county enterprise boards, under his auspices, are fully committed to supporting and promoting job creation and job retention in Donegal.In addition to recent job announcements, this commitment is also evidenced by ongoing development and support by the agencies for a number of business parks and enterprise centres in Donegal. These include the completion of the IDA Letterkenny Business Park; the provision of a 25,000 sq. ft. advance office building at Windyhall; the completion of site development work at Ballyshannon for a new facility, and at Buncrana, where IDA Ireland is working with a local developer to provide new manufacturing and office buildings; support for nine community enterprise centres in Donegal by Enterprise Ireland; support for the expansion of the Letterkenny Institute of Technology business development centre; and the development of a marine biotechnology centre at Letterkenny IT.I recognise that Donegal has experienced significant job losses in recent years, particularly in traditional sectors such as textiles and clothing. Since his appointment, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, has visited Donegal twice and has met many groups and companies on these visits to discuss both difficulties and positive developments in the county. His colleagues in Government also recognise the particular difficulties in Donegal and in that context will be working together to assist in improving the overall environment to increase the attractiveness of Donegal as a location for enterprises.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	443	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to address the House on this important issue. I am delighted the Minister of State is present to listen to this sensible proposal. I hope the Government will provide funding for a very worthwhile pre-school education project. Preparing for Life is a plan to enable children to be ready for school. Fewer than half the children living in disadvantaged communities are ready for school at four and five years. A poor start at school stacks up problems later in childhood and into adulthood.Several Government initiatives focus on enabling children to be better prepared for life. A group working on the north side of Dublin has prepared an excellent plan to make the most of existing resources and increase the proportion of children ready for school. The plan seeks to turn good intentions into practical ideas, which, if proved to be successful, could be implemented in other parts of the country.The plan has many unique aspects. It seeks to address the needs of children at each stage of development from conception to the day they go to school. It works with parents as children grow up showing how improvements in children's well-being eases stress on families. Moreover rather than claiming that it has the answer, rigorous evaluation will be an integral part of the plan. The people involved aim to discover which of their ideas work before recommending that they be taken up elsewhere. The plan also sets out the way in which the preparing for life group set about finding new ways of getting more children born into three very disadvantaged communities better prepared for school each year. The plans also connect not only to improve the well-being of children in the area but also to demonstrate possible courses of action for other disadvantaged communities in Ireland and elsewhere in Europe.Approximately 7,000 people live in these communities and the proportion of children aged 14 or less is twice that of Ireland as a whole and the number of children under one year is also elevated. Approximately 70% of the families live in houses rented or being purchased from the local authority, which is up to three times higher than the national average. While unemployment has reduced by approximately 45% in the past five years, approximately one in nine adults are still out of work. Drug dealing, safe play areas for children, clubs for teenagers and tackling so-called joy-riding are among the primary concerns for parents in the community.Only 12% of the children in this area continue to third level, which is less than a quarter of the national average. To make matters worse more than two fifths of children leave school by their 15th birthday compared with less than one fifth nationally. Problems with heating, damp, fixtures and fittings are experienced in 56% of the houses. More than 55% of the children do not go to bed before 8 p.m. Some 26% of the children displayed significant problems with conduct before starting school. One in five children has major health and eating difficulties. Some 31% of children starting school last year had missed ten or more days by the end of March.Sadly 52% of the children in these communities were not ready for primary school when they commenced. School readiness is the critical stepping-stone to well being in childhood and into adulthood. There is strong evidence that this lack of readiness contributes to significant behaviour problems in school, which tends to de-motivate teachers and adversely affects other pupils. Lack of readiness greatly disadvantages children's learning resulting in them frequently arriving at secondary school with significant reading, writing and attention deficits. By this pathway problems in the first few months of primary school eventually contribute to higher levels of school dropout which in turn leads to lower levels of university attendance and lower income levels among children born into disadvantaged areas.I urge the Minister of State to consider the proposals of this worthwhile group. I commend and thank those directly involved, including Noel Kelly and the northside partnership team for their excellent work. While this plan is about children, education and quality of life, it is also about preventing children from becoming at risk later in life. It will assist in preventing them getting involved in drugs and ending up in our prisons. Above all the plan is about creating a positive future for disadvantaged children. I urge the Minister of State to listen to the proposal when it comes on stream in coming weeks.

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	446	I welcome the opportunity to outline the Government's approach to promoting greater social inclusion by prioritising investment in education in disadvantaged areas. The wide variety of measures in place at local level throughout the country for tackling educational disadvantage range from pre-school interventions, supports for tackling children's literacy problems, reduced pupil teacher ratios, increased capitation grants and measures to tackle early school leaving and strengthen ties between the school, the family and the community. In addition, there are interventions in support of youth and in providing second chance education for young people and adults.Under the new action plan for educational inclusion launched by the Minister for Education and Science last May, further investment is being targeted at young people at risk to help them to make the most of the educational opportunities available to them. The DEIS, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, plan provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated school support programme which will bring together and build upon a number of existing interventions for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage. Approximately 600 primary schools, comprising 300 urban-town and 300 rural and 150 second level schools will be included in the school support programme. The new action plan will be introduced on a phased basis, starting in the current school year, and will involve an additional annual investment of €40 million on full implementation. It will also involve the provision of some 300 additional posts across the education system.A key underlying principle of DEIS is that of early intervention, including assisting children who are having difficulty learning to read and write at an early stage before the problem becomes entrenched. Key measures to be implemented on a phased basis over the next five years include targeted early childhood education provision for 150 urban-town school communities allowing increased access to literacy and numeracy support initiatives and extended availability of home-school-community liaison and school completion programme services. The 150 urban-town primary schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantage will be targeted to benefit from maximum class sizes of 20:1 in junior classes and 24:1 in senior classes. Rural primary schools participating in the new school support programme will be targeted to benefit from access to a teacher or co-ordinator serving a cluster of schools. Measures will be implemented to enhance student attendance, educational progression, retention and attainment. Measures will be put in place to support the recruitment and retention of principals and teaching staff in schools serving disadvantaged communities. Professional development for principals, teachers and other personnel in schools participating in the SSP will be enhanced.The action plan will also focus on greater integration of services and improved co-operation and partnership working both within the education sector itself and between the Department of Education and Science and all other relevant Departments and agencies at both national and local level. Priorities will include seeking to expand and develop areas of mutual co-operation with other Departments and agencies on, for example, early childhood education and care, nutrition and health, and literacy and numeracy. The involvement of students, parents, local communities and agencies operating at local level will be an important dimension of the overall planning process for schools in the new school support programme.Also central to the success of the action plan will be an increased emphasis on planning at school and school cluster level, target setting and measurement of progress and outcomes to ensure that the increased investment is matched by an improvement in educational outcomes for the children and young people concerned. I am confident that the extra supports being put in place will make a real difference to the lives of young people in disadvantaged areas.With regard to the Preparing for Life proposal that the Deputy asked about, I have been informed by the Minister for Education and Science that her Department's regional office service met the education co-ordinator of the northside partnership on a number of occasions and has provided advice on the development of the proposal. I understand that the proposal is intended to address the needs of children at each stage of their development to better prepare them for school, and that it involves mentoring and group training for parents to improve their skills, esteem and aspirations for their children. The proposers intend that the project will result in improved physical and psychological health and better educational outcomes for children at key stages in their development to the point of reception in school. I understand that the proposal will shortly be presented formally to the Department and that at that stage, it will be assessed in terms of how it can fit in with the Department's overall programmes to address educational disadvantage.I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline just some of the work that is being done in the area of tackling educational disadvantage at present and our plans to extend this further.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	447	I welcome the opportunity to air this issue which, if not addressed, will become a nightmare for many new home owners. Until recently, if a developer was constructing a housing estate, the developer held the responsibility of keeping that estate properly maintained until the local authority took it into charge. With the advent of apartment building, local authorities began to insert a clause in the planning permission insisting that purchasers sign up as members of management companies. The clause has now been extended by many local authorities to house-only developments or mixed developments of apartments and houses. Instead of the developer carrying the cost of the maintenance, the home owners must now take responsibility for the maintenance of sewers, water mains, paths, roads, open spaces, public lighting and even having to pay the ESB for the public lights within the estate. The fees for home owners generally range between €300 to €1,200 but can rise higher.As the clause is inserted in the planning permission, it appears in the contract of sale, so if one does not pay the fee, one cannot close the sale. I will quote a typical example of the clause in a planning permission, this one relating to a house-only development:A management company shall be set up in order to manage the communal activities of the development. Prior to the commencement of the development, details of the management company shall be submitted to the planning authority for approval, and with particular emphasis on the provision of sanitary services. Each individual property owner shall be party to the management company agreement and this agreement shall be registered as a burden on the individual property folios in the Land Registry upon the sale of each unit.Accordingly, the management company becomes a lien on the property so that the property cannot be sold until the fee is fully paid. The management company is initially set up by the developer. I have come across one case, which I believe is the norm, where the developer who set up a property company registered it to the development office and had directors related to the developer.When the last house is constructed, the developer engages a management agency and the home owners become the management company. The developer says goodbye and the home owners then assume responsibility for just about every aspect of the management of their estate. Instead of organising Christmas parties for their kids or cutting grass and so on, they are ensuring that the sewers are working, that the bulbs are replaced in the street lighting, and they are considering which neighbours to take to court for not having paid their fees. This is not the way to build social capital. Subject to the estate being in a satisfactory condition after a number of years, in reasonably good condition, the council will take the estate in charge. It will not take it in charge if there are problems.Unfortunately, over the years, I as a councillor have witnessed short cuts being taken by unscrupulous developers. That can seriously increase the length of time before a council will take an estate into charge, if it does so at all. I am aware of some estates which are 30 years old and still not under council charge.Most new home owners to whom I have spoken found out about the management company obligation on the day they were closing their sales. Many told me that their solicitors had brushed the clause aside as though it were standard. Failure to pay the fee would result in the purchase falling through and the loss of a non-refundable deposit. In some cases that can run to thousands of euro.The cheques, which in some instances are made out directly to the builder, go directly to the management company set up by the builder. Is is only some months or years later, when the residents ask what they are paying for, that they discover a difficulty. They are starting to put pressure on the management company to finish the estate and discover they may as well put pressure on the builders because they are the same people involved.I can understand the need for a management company in the case of apartment blocks with shared areas of responsibility. However, the lack of legislation has left many buyers open to additional financial exposure. An article written by Susan Mitchell was published in  The Sunday Business Post on 26 June last. She quoted Michael Noonan, who had established the Institute of Residential Management Companies. He told her of a development where the insurance company took the view that the development was being mismanaged. The management company had no sinking fund or money in its account to meet any liability that could arise. It owed the ESB €45,000 and the ESB came out to cut off the power supply.That is one example of what can happen. The Northside People newspaper reported on thousands of homes in Tyrrelstown, near Blanchardstown, which were affected by a biological contamination of their water supply. Residents who contacted Fingal County Council were referred to a management company. In the end, the council had to bail out the people, but it was a private management company which had the responsibility for the upkeep of those people’s water system.What should be done? I contacted several local authorities to find out how this situation has arisen. I also contacted the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. No one seems to be able to point me towards a guideline, clause or a section in legislation which triggered off this change in practice. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government must immediately consult the local authorities to end the practice of insisting on this clause in house-only or mixed developments on the housing component, and must regulate for the apartment aspect. The Law Society also needs to insist that solicitors properly appraise their clients to ensure clients do not leave themselves open to substantial risk.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	448	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. A new provision was included in the Planning and Development Act 2000 — section 34(4) — enabling local authorities to add a condition to a planning permission relating to maintenance or management of a proposed development, including the appointment of a person or body to carry implement it. The primary objective of this measure was to give a legal certainty to the existing practice of planning authorities requiring the establishment of management companies. This helps to ensure good and prudent management of estates following their completion.It must be emphasised that the provisions in question do not detract from the primary responsibility of developers to finish developments. Planning authorities have extensive powers under the 2000 Act to make developers finish estates in a satisfactory manner in accordance with the planning permission. In addition, local authorities can now be required to take in charge the public services for residential development when requested to do so. It is important to note, however, that taking in charge relates to the public infrastructure like roads, sewers and so on. Management companies have a very different remit. They deal with the on-going maintenance and management of the private elements of housing developments, such as looking after the green areas, landscaping and maintaining community amenities and so on. This is ultimately the responsibility of the property owners, just as any house owner has to take responsibility for maintenance of his or her house. The general issues that management companies must administer on an on-going basis would never have been the responsibility of the local authority. The existence of a management company, controlled by the home owners, is critically important in the case of apartments, which need arrangements to deal with common facilities or structures. I note the Deputy agrees with this point.In Ireland, the shared legal responsibility is provided for at present through a requirement, when apartments are sold, that the owners become members of a management company for the complex. Other conditions are also put on the sale of properties, for example, the payment of charges to cover ongoing maintenance of the communal parts of the building and a sinking fund to cover future costs. Apartment complex management companies are generally constituted as companies under the Companies Acts. The members are the owners of the apartments. The operation of these companies, their memorandum and articles of association, the employment of any property manager or management entity, then becomes a matter for the apartment owners. Recent problems have arisen in regard to the management of apartment complexes, such as the adequacy of maintenance and cost of service charges. In many cases, these relate to managing agents contracted by the management company.A Law Reform Commission working group is currently drafting a report on the law in regard to management of apartment complexes and other multi-unit developments. I understand it has already suggested certain changes in the application of company law to management companies for multi-unit developments to the Company Law Review Group which operates under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Where the Law Reform Commission report identifies any change in the legislative framework to enable management arrangements to operate more effectively, these will be considered by the Government.I accept there is much concern about management companies. I hope the Law Reform Commission comes up with answers in its report. I will discuss with the Deputy the points raised by her in regard to house-only estates. However, it was always the case that the footpaths or roads in some private estates were not up to standard despite the estates being deemed to have a management company. I do not know whether this is still the case but I accept that many people are walking into similar situations with their eyes closed.In many cases, residents do not exercise their rights. When an estate is finished the residents are the management company. However, while they could remain in full control of many aspects of maintaining the property and are entitled to set standards at an annual general meeting, they often hand over responsibility to a management agent. I will check some of the points made by the Deputy with regard to house-only estates if she will provide me with the names of the estates. It may be that the services were not up to standard.I accept this is an issue of major concern. We eagerly await the report of the Law Reform Commission.

During my visit to EUFOR, I met Lord Ashdown, the High Representative for Bosnia-Herzegovina and Major General A. David Leakey, Force Commander EUFOR on 31 May 2005. The discussions were wide-ranging and included the current situation in the area and the prospects for further developments and also the question of the opening of negotiations on a Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU.On 1 June 2005, I visited Camp Eagle Base in Tuzla. This is the location of the headquarters of the Finnish led multi-national task force, north, of EUFOR, with which Irish personnel are serving with EU and other participating nations. I observed, at first hand, what the situation facing our troops is like in Bosnia. I conveyed to the troops, on behalf of the Government and the people of Ireland, our deep appreciation for the outstanding manner in which they continue to perform their duties on overseas service.During my visit I found morale among troops to be very high. I congratulated the Irish personnel on the success of their mission to-date. Irish Defence Forces participation in EUFOR's Operation ALTHEA is a vitally important component of our overall approach to peace keeping. Serving, as they do, as part of a Finnish-led task force, Irish personnel are charged with a wide range of tasks including maintaining security and preventing a resumption of violence, supporting counter terrorism and the fight against organised crime, facilitating freedom of movement for the local population and assisting the return of refugees.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	450	At present Ireland subscribes to the United Nations Standby Arrangements System, UNSAS, under which the State offers to provide up to 850 personnel on overseas service at any given time. Ireland's commitment under the UNSAS represents 10% of the total army strength. This is the maximum sustainable commitment that Ireland can make to overseas peacekeeping operations. At present 749 Defence Forces personnel are serving overseas.Ireland receives requests from time to time in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis. Since September 2004, two such requests have been received from the United Nations. The first request was in April 2005 to contribute a number of Defence Forces personnel to act as UN military observers, UNMOs, to the United Nations Mission in the Sudan, UNMIS. The request was for 15 personnel. The second request was in June 2005 for participation with formed units, ranging from 30 to 850 personnel, in the United Nations Organisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, MONUC.These requests were given careful consideration, as are all requests from the UN. However, following consultation with the military authorities and taking into account the level of existing commitments to overseas peacekeeping operations at the time of the requests, it was decided not to accede to the UN requests on these occasions.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	451	I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 13 and 48 together.The Irish Aviation Authority, under the aegis of the Department of Transport, is responsible for the safety regulation of Irish airspace.Weston aerodrome is licensed by the Irish Aviation Authority in accordance with the Aerodrome and Visual Ground Aids Order, and in issuing the licence, the authority's remit extends to aviation safety standards. In addition, the Irish Aviation Authority is a notice party under planning and development regulations, so that any development with the potential to endanger or interfere with the safety, or safe and efficient navigation of, aircraft is sent to the Irish Aviation Authority.The local authorities are responsible for land use planning on, and in the vicinity of, Weston aerodrome in accordance with the Planning and Development Act of 2000. I understand that both South Dublin County Council and Kildare County Council are closely monitoring proceedings at Weston.The issue of the current and future use and development of Weston aerodrome is of concern to my Department only in so far as it infringes upon Defence Forces responsibility for the control and management of military airspace, which is such airspace as is designated for Defence Forces use under section 68 of the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993.My principal concerns regarding the proposed development of Weston aerodrome focus on maintaining safe and functional airspace in which military flight training and air operations can continue on a 24-hour basis. The Air Corps continually conducts risk assessments to ensure the maximum safety for all airspace users, including liaison with Weston on safety issues.My Department wrote to the Irish Aviation Authority earlier this year to express concerns about possible developments at Weston aerodrome. In response, the IAA advised that no airspace change proposal had been received from Weston at that time. An airspace change proposal has however recently been submitted to the IAA by Weston Airport Limited. Weston has also copied the proposal to my Department and this is under examination at present by the Air Corps.Integral to the ongoing risk assessments carried out by the Air Corps, and cognisant of Weston's proposal to expand into instrument flight rules operations, will be an assessment on the potential impact this development will have on Air Corps flight operations and flying training programmes.This issue, and many other aspects of this proposal concerning the interface between military air traffic, traffic from Weston and other civil users of the airspace, will be considered in due course during the consultation phase of discussions between the principal interested parties, that is, the IAA, Weston airport management and representatives of my Department and the Defence Forces.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	452	I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 21, 25, 39, 44 and 57 together.There are no implications for defence spending arising from the recommendations of the Western European Union Assembly. Ireland is not a member of the Western European Union, but holds observer status. Following the Treaty of Amsterdam, the EU took over the WEU's crisis management functions but the WEU continues in existence in relation to certain functions arising from its treaties, to which Ireland is not a party, and in relation to some residual administrative elements. These include: the modified Brussels Treaty, which involves: Article V, the mutual defence provisions; Article IX, institutional dialogue with the WEU Assembly; the reorganisation and future opening to the public of the WEU archives; and the management of pensions.The WEU Assembly represents the parliamentary dimension of Western European Union and essentially provides a consultative dimension to the Union vis-à-vis the WEU Council, which comprises the Foreign and Defence Ministers of WEU member states. While the council has not met since 2000, the assembly continues to meet to discuss and debate issues in relation to European security and defence. European national parliaments can send delegations to the assembly, which currently has some 400 members. Committee meetings are also held on a regular basis together with colloquies, conferences and seminars on specific topics. As an observer, Ireland can send up to four delegates to attend the assembly. The nomination of delegates is solely a matter for the Oireachtas.As I have already stated, the European Union, through its European security and defence policy, ESDP, has taken over the crisis management functions of the WEU. Many of the issues highlighted in the recommendations of the assembly simply echo current initiatives within ESDP, which include the development of EU capabilities pursuant to the European capabilities action plan to address identified capability shortfalls in relation to EU crisis management operations. As Deputies will be aware, capabilities is a key issue for the European Defence Agency, EDA, which is tasked with supporting the EU in overcoming capability shortfalls together with supporting rationalisation in the European defence equipment market and consolidation of R and T investment.I am supportive of measures, which may emerge within the European security and defence policy and through the EDA, which could lead to future efficiencies in defence spending. I expect that the work of the EDA in the field of defence capabilities development, research, acquisition and armaments, by promoting efficiencies, could yield economies of scale for the procurement of equipment for the Defence Forces. I emphasise that the main focus of these measures by the EU and the EDA is not on increasing defence expenditure, but rather, is towards obtaining better value for existing spending levels.In the context of the broader development of the EU's capacity to carry out both civilian and military crisis management operations, Ireland has advocated that the EU should prioritise the development of qualitative aspects of capability development. I am aware that this view is shared by many of my ministerial colleagues at EU level at a time when the majority of member states, including Ireland, has no plans to increase their defence spending.To summarise, none of these issues or developments implies increased defence expenditure. In essence the key issue is achieving greater return on existing investment though rationalisation, consolidation and co-operation. Moreover, notwithstanding the recommendations of the WEU Assembly or initiatives or proposals from any other source, defence expenditure is and will remain a national sovereign decision for each member state.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	453	KFOR was established on 10 June 1999 in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1244 for an initial period of 12 months, to continue thereafter unless the UN Security Council decides otherwise. The role of KFOR is to support the maintenance of civil law and order within Kosovo so as to develop a climate of safety and security, which will enable the transfer of increased responsibility to the civil authorities. Ireland has participated in the KFOR since August 1999.The Deputy is referring to the actions of members of the 27th infantry group of the Defence Forces, who were serving in Kosovo at the time of the serious outbreak of violence in March 2004. A major contribution was made by Irish personnel in protecting Serb enclaves in and around Pristina. In holding the line against overwhelming numbers of Kosovan Albanians, the Irish Defence Forces saved numerous lives and the homes of Serb families from certain destruction. In addition, members of the Defence Forces based in KFOR headquarters, on their own initiative, and at no little risk to their own safety went into Pristina at the height of the disturbances and evacuated over 340 Serbians to safety, without doubt saving their lives in the process.The actions of the Defence Force personnel highlight the professionalism of our Irish personnel in the roles that they conduct at home and abroad on a daily basis. Letters of commendation were awarded to 18 Irish personnel by the commanding general of the multi-national brigade centre, in whose brigade these Irish personnel serve, for their actions during the course of the disturbances. The commendations were for leadership, initiative and brave participation in the rescue team, which included other nationalities as well.I am advised by the military authorities that there are no plans to mark the actions of Defence Forces personnel with KFOR on 17 and 18 March 2004. However, I would like to take this opportunity to commend the bravery and professionalism shown by the 27th infantry company group of the Defence Forces who were in Kosovo at the time of the disturbances.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	454	The Reserve Defence Force review implementation plan, which was officially launched in July 2004, sets out an ambitious programme of reform and modernisation for the reserve for the period up to end 2009. We are still at a relatively early stage in the lifetime of the plan but I am pleased to say that the implementation deadlines that have been set for specific targets are being met and in some cases are ahead of schedule.To date work has been completed, as per the plan target, on the reorganisation of the reserve. The necessary regulatory changes are prepared and I will formally launch the reorganised reserve on Saturday, 1 October at a ceremony in Sarsfield Barracks, Limerick. This reorganisation involves the disestablishment and amalgamation of reserve units throughout the country and I am pleased to say that the consultative and communicative approach that the military authorities have adopted in this process, has made this change as painless as possible for those involved. I would also like to credit the representative associations for their constructive engagement with the reorganisation process.In addition to the reorganisation outlined above, the other aspects of the plan are also on schedule. The equipment programme is being implemented with the Steyr rifle programme ahead of schedule and the support weapons programme on target. The reserve has already received issues of new clothing as provided for in the plan.The training programme is progressing on schedule and many training syllabi for the reserve have been revised and approved. Work will continue in this area over the course of the plan. The establishment of the Reserve Defence Force training authority alongside the Defence Forces training centre in the Curragh, which is provided for in the reorganised reserve, represents an important development that will further enhance the quality of training available to the reserve. The twinning of reserve units with their PDF counterparts will also improve the availability of specialised equipment and expertise. This will further contribute to the quality of training available to the reserve.The financial allocation to support the training function is in line with plan targets. The current allocation of 114,000 mandays which provides for paid training days represents an 80% increase over the original allocation. Further increases in allocations, subject to financial prioritisation within the military budget as a whole, are provided for.Although I am satisfied that the implementation process is on schedule to date, there are further targets to be met in the remaining period of the plan. The reorganised reserve, which as I have mentioned will be launched on 1 October 2005, is a crucial milestone in the implementation process and this will provide the necessary platform for implementation of other aspects of the plan. The development of the integrated element of the reserve as well as the development of policies to support the selection of suitably qualified reserve personnel for overseas duties, are important elements of the plan that require continued work in order to meet their implementation target dates. Additionally further implementation targets for the equipment and training programmes have to be met over the lifetime of the plan.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	455	As Minister for Defence, I am responsible for the Department of Defence's emergency planning objectives, which are to promote the co-ordination of emergency planning functions across all Departments and other key public authorities and to oversee the emergency planning process in general. In pursuing this objective, I chair the Government task force on emergency planning, which comprises Ministers as well as senior officials of Departments and public authorities which make a key contribution to the emergency planning process. The task force, which is a top level structure that offers policy and direction, co-ordinates and oversees the emergency planning activities of all Departments and public authorities. It promotes the best possible use of resources and compatibility between different planning requirements. The interdepartmental working group on emergency planning comprises officials representing Departments and public authorities with lead or principal support roles in Government emergency plans. The task force charges the working group with carrying out specific studies and developing particular aspects of emergency planning. The working group is the vehicle through which expertise is shared between Departments and public authorities on emergency planning. The working group continues to address emergency planning matters to reduce the potential impacts of emergencies on this State.The office of emergency planning in the Department of Defence supports the Department's emergency planning objective and the Government task force on emergency planning. The office chairs the interdepartmental working group on emergency planning. The lead responsibility for specific emergency planning functions remains with the relevant Departments. Responsibility for internal national security is a matter for the Garda, with support as appropriate from the Defence Forces. The national security committee is concerned with ensuring that the Taoiseach and the Government are advised of high-level security issues and the responses to them, but it is not involved in operational security issues. It is chaired by the Secretary General to the Government and comprises the Secretaries General of the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Defence and Foreign Affairs, the Garda Commissioner and the Chief of Staff, and their respective deputies. It would not be appropriate to give detailed information about the meetings of the committee, but it meets regularly as required and its members liaise on an ongoing basis. It continues to monitor developments which might have security implications, particularly developments in the international arena.Potential threats to the State arising from international terrorism are continuously monitored by relevant parties, principally the Garda and the Defence Forces. The advice available to me is that while the Garda authorities recognise that the terrorist threat to Europe is high, in relation to Ireland it is low. The awareness that the situation could change rapidly and with little warning has ensured that vigilance is maintained. The objective has been, as far as possible, to confine and control threats before they translate to destructive actions. Those charged with precautionary activities, principally the Garda and the Defence Forces, are central to the process. They analyse information to assess potential vulnerabilities and enable those charged with protecting the public to concentrate scarce resources in the most effective way.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	456	I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 35 and 41 together.Courts of inquiry are internal military inquiries. A court of inquiry may be convened by a prescribed convening authority under the provisions of Defence Force Regulations A5 and Part III of the Rules of Procedure (Defence Forces) 1954, SI No. 243 of 1954. The purpose of a court of inquiry is to allow the convening authority to take such action as he may deem necessary in respect of the subject matter of the inquiry. The confidentiality of such a court is based on the fact that the subject matter of a court of inquiry normally relates to a particular individual or individuals. Other than as a prelude to charges, it may also lead to other action as recommended by the court. There may also be security or operational implications arising from such an inquiry. Paragraph 11(2) of the Defence Force Regulations A5 provides that:The findings and recommendations of all courts of inquiry shall be treated as confidential. They shall not be disclosed to interested parties, except as provided in subsection 181(2) of the Defence Act, 1954, Rules of Procedure (Defence Forces), 1954 and Defence Force Regulations A.8 unless otherwise directed by the Minister.Section 181(2) of the Defence Act refers to a situation where a court of inquiry is held prior to trial by court martial. The proceedings and findings of military courts of inquiry are, therefore, not generally available for public inspection. However, courts of inquiry documents have been made available on request, in certain cases, to the immediate families of deceased members of the Defence Forces who have died as a direct result of military service. While such requests are considered on a case by case basis, every effort is made to deal with such requests from bereaved families in a compassionate manner, subject to security considerations and legal implications as regards third parties relevant to the particular case. It should be emphasised, however, that UN boards of inquiry documents are a different matter. Such documents are internal documents of the UN and are the property of the UN. They are supplied to national state authorities on the specific condition that they cannot be released or made public in any manner. This prohibition comprehends and encompasses judicial proceedings.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	457	The most important defence against any terrorist attack is detection and prevention by the security forces. While the Garda has the primary responsibility for law and order, one of the roles assigned to the Defence Forces is the provision of aid to the civil power. In practice, that means that the Defence Forces assist the Garda when requested. The various components of the Defence Forces are active in this regard, providing whatever assistance is appropriate in specific circumstances. The level of terrorist threat to Ireland is continually assessed. The advice available to me suggests that while the terrorist threat to certain parts of Europe is high, in relation to Ireland, it is low. However, it is prudent that we take precautions and keep matters under continuous review.The Defence Forces make contingency plans for a range of scenarios in which the State may be at risk. An urgent and detailed review to deal with a range of emergency situations was undertaken by the military authorities following the events of 11 September 2001. The review included, inter alia, an update of the threat assessment, intensive contacts with other State agencies, a reassessment of operations orders relating to vital installations, alert systems, the Army ranger wing, ordnance and engineer aspects in terms of explosive ordnance disposal and specialist search, a review of equipment and the need for air defence. All matters arising were addressed and all procedures updated as required. As the Deputy appreciates, however, it is not possible to expand on the operational details of such plans. The capacity of the Defence Forces to deal with major emergencies is kept under constant review. Plans and procedures are updated as necessary and the additional equipment that is required to address any perceived deficiencies is acquired on the basis of identified priorities. Training and preparation for such events is also provided for in the Defence Forces annual training plan. The most important defence against any attack is of course external vigilance, detection and prevention by the security forces. All the necessary resources of the Garda and the Defence Forces are deployed to this end.

The inaugural board of the Civil Defence was appointed with effect from 5 June 2002. As the board's term of office was three years, a new board was appointed in 2005. Section 11 of the Act provides that the board shall consist of at least eight but not more than 14 members who shall be appointed by the Minister for Defence; that not less than four of the members of the board shall be women and not less than four shall be men; and that the Minister for Defence shall designate one member of the board as chairperson. Section 11(2) of the Act provides:The members of the Board shall be—(a) the director general, (b) a person nominated by the County and City Managers Association, (c) 4 persons who, in the opinion of the Minister, have experience in business, industry, finance or administration relevant to the Board’s functions, (d) a person nominated by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government who, in the opinion of that Minister, has relevant experience or expertise relating to emergency planning, (e) a person nominated by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, (f) a person nominated by the Environmental Protection Agency, (g) a member of the Civil Defence Officers Association nominated by it, (h) an officer of the Defence Forces nominated by the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces, (i) a member of the Garda Síochána nominated by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, and (j) subject to subsection (5)—(i) a volunteer member of civil defence, and(ii) a member of the staff of the Board.The four members of the board who were appointed by me are Mr. Joe Maher, who is the board's chairperson; Ms Kay Cable; Mr. Tony Kelly; and Mr. Oliver O'Loughlin. The other ten members of the board are Mr. Gerry Gervin, who is the director general of the Civil Defence board: Mr. Ned Gleeson, who is the county manager of Limerick County Council; Mr. Seán Hogan of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government; Dr. Barbara Rafferty of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland; Ms Majella Byrne of the Environmental Protection Agency; Ms Gabrielle Willis, who is the Civil Defence officer of Wexford County Council; Comdt. Kevin Houston of the Defence Forces; Chief Superintendent John T. Farrelly of the Garda Síochána; Mr. Gerry Naylor, who is a volunteer member; and Ms Róisín McGuire, who is a staff member.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	459	I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 27 and 34 together.I have indicated my willingness to make the facilities at St. Bricin's Military Hospital available to the public health service if the service wishes to secure access to the facilities. Representatives of the Health Service Executive and the Department of Health and Children visited the hospital to inspect its facilities earlier this year. I inspected the hospital's facilities in late April. The Department and the HSE have given detailed consideration to the possible use of the facilities for public health purposes. Specialist engineering and architectural surveys which were conducted at St. Bricin's Hospital in 2001 indicated that total capital expenditure of at least €20 million, at 2001 prices, would be required to bring the entire facility up to the standard of acute health board and public voluntary hospitals. While some upgrading work has taken place at the hospital since 2001, the building remains essentially unmodernised. The refurbishment that has been done, including fire safety works and rewiring, has been largely focused on meeting health and safety criteria.I wish to outline the details of the improvements and engineering works which have been carried out at St. Bricin's Military Hospital since October 2004. Some €40,300 was spent on security fencing at the hospital on foot of a contract placed on 13 September 2004. Some €6,054 was spent on two air conditioning units, at the radiographer's room and the hearing test centre within the hospital, on foot of a contract placed on 10 September 2004. Some €125,000 was spent on internal and external painting at the hospital on foot of a contract placed on 15 June 2005. The actual expenditure required for full upgrading and modernisation would depend on the nature of the intended use of the facility. As I have previously made clear, any such expenditure would be a matter for the HSE and the Department of Health and Children. I will consider positively any future proposals for possible public health care use of the St. Bricin's facilities. The Department remains available to do everything possible to co-operate with the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive in that regard if such a consideration arises in the future.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	460	The acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Forces, including the Air Corps, continues to be a key focus of mine. In January 2005, two contracts were signed for the provision of new helicopters for the Air Corps at a cost of over €61 million. Four utility helicopters are being acquired from Bell Agusta Aerospace Company at a cost of €48.4 million, inclusive of VAT. The helicopters, two of which will be delivered in 2006 and two in 2007, will be used in support of Defence Force operations. Two light utility helicopters, which are being acquired from Eurocopter SAS at a cost of €12.8 million, inclusive of VAT, are due to be delivered later this year. The first of the two helicopters was accepted by the Department last week, but is being retained in Germany for pilot training purposes. The second of the helicopters is scheduled for acceptance at the end of October. When the helicopters are delivered to Ireland, they will be used to train pilots for their role in support of the Defence Forces. The eight Pilatus PC-9M turbo propeller aircraft delivered last year have replaced seven Marchetti aircraft in the pilot training role. These modern aircraft allow for the continued training of young cadets to the highest standards. A cockpit upgrade is being carried out on the two CASA aircraft at present in the interests of flight safety. A complete radar upgrade is also being considered for both aircraft to increase their operational capability.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	461	I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 49 and 60 together.Visits to and from the chiefs of staff of armed forces of other countries are primarily a matter for the Army Chief of Staff. From time to time, courtesy calls from visiting foreign military personnel are arranged with me, subject to the demands of my schedule. The purpose of the trip to Ireland of the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff of the US armed forces, General Myers, was as a return visit to the Army Chief of Staff who visited Washington DC on 31 March 2005. A courtesy call to me at my office in the Department of Defence was scheduled as part of General Myers's itinerary on Wednesday, 20 July last. Some weeks before I learned of General Myers's visit, however, I committed to inspecting the military barracks at Longford and Mullingar as part of my programme of nationwide barracks inspections. Such visits are important as they give me an opportunity to meet and talk to many of the core staff of the Defence Forces. I was ill on the day, unfortunately, and travelled to the midlands against the advice of my doctor. As my visits to the barracks went considerably behind schedule, I was unable to return to Dublin in time to receive General Myers's courtesy call. My regrets were conveyed to General Myers by the Secretary General of the Department of Defence and the Army Chief of Staff, who was hosting the visit. I am disappointed that embarrassment was caused to General Myers by the over-zealous reporting of certain sections of the media in respect of an unavoidable clash of engagements compounded by illness. The media has made offensive suggestions about why the meeting did not take place. Such suggestions are without foundation. Ireland and the United States are bound by historical and family ties. We are reminded by the historic events this week of the value of our close and abiding friendship with the US.

Informal discussions of a general nature took place on that occasion. I am kept fully informed of matters relating to the Naval Service and the Air Corps on an ongoing basis through the usual channels.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	463	The conditions under which the Defence Forces may participate on overseas peace support operations have been made clear by the Government. The system of conditions, which has been referred to as the "triple lock", must be satisfied. I have established an interdepartmental group to examine all issues relating to our possible participation in the battlegroup concept. Among the issues being examined by the interdepartmental group are the provisions of the current legislation relating to overseas operations. I expect to receive the group's report soon. As I have said on many occasions in response to questions in the House and in public speeches, there are no plans to remove the "triple lock" requirement for Government, Dáil and UN approval for participation by the Defence Forces in overseas peace support operations.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	464	I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 38, 45, 52 and 66 together.I wish to outline the background to the rapid response elements concept, commonly referred to as battlegroups. Member states set themselves a headline goal at a meeting of the European Council in Helsinki in 1999. They agreed that by 2003, co-operating together and voluntarily, they would be able to deploy rapidly and then sustain forces capable of the full range of Petersberg Tasks set out in the Amsterdam Treaty. The Petersberg Tasks are humanitarian, rescue, peacekeeping and crisis management operations, including peacemaking. They include, inter alia, a capability to provide “rapid response elements available and deployable at very high readiness”. The ambition of the EU to be able to respond rapidly to emerging crises has and continues to be a key objective of the development of the European Security and Defence Policy. Ireland’s participation in such operations is consistent with its foreign policy commitment to collective security, which recognises the primary role of the UN Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security and its tradition of support for the UN. This position has been endorsed by the UN Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who recognises and supports the development of EU rapid reaction elements as a key factor in enabling the UN to respond more rapidly and with greater authority to emerging crises. During his visit to Dublin in October 2004, Mr. Annan stressed the importance of battlegroups and requested Ireland’s support for them.At the Cabinet meeting of 16 November 2004, the Government agreed that I should advise my EU counterparts of Ireland's preparedness to enter into consultations with partners with a view to potential participation in rapid response elements. During a military capabilities commitment conference that was held on 22 November 2004, member states committed up to 13 battlegroup formations which will be available to deploy to crisis situations, within a five to ten-day period, from 2005. Initial offers and commitments by relevant member states were confirmed at a battlegroup co-ordination conference held on 11 May 2005. It was noted that only one slot, the second semester of 2007, remains unfilled. Further progress has been made in a broad range of areas including a 2005 requirements catalogue, which details an initial list of the capabilities required to meet the aims set in the 2010 headline goal. Work has also been done on the establishment of the civilian and military cell, which supports the co-ordination of the civil and military elements of ESDP operations. Progress has also been made on the European capabilities action plan. The European Defence Agency has continued to support the development of European capabilities in respect of the 2010 headline goal and in relation to crisis management operations generally.Ireland supports the development of the EU's rapid response capability in support of missions authorised by the UN. It is positively disposed towards participation in the rapid response elements in this regard. As it is important that the full implications of Ireland's participation are assessed, I have established an interdepartmental group which includes representatives of the Departments of Defence, the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs, as well as the Defence Forces and the Office of the Attorney General. The group, which met in December 2004, has established three subgroups to address policy, legislative and operational issues. The subgroups met on a number of occasions during the summer to progress issues relating to battlegroups. While the legal issues subgroup met on four occasions, the others met less often because it is difficult for them to make meaningful progress in the absence of definitive views on the legal issues involved. The Office of the Attorney General is in the process of submitting its report on the legal issues involved to the Attorney General and I expect to receive his report shortly. When the advice has been received, the other two subgroups will expedite the completion of their considerations and report to me in October.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	465	The office of emergency planning was established following a Government decision in October 2001 as a joint civil and military office within the Department of Defence. The office supports the work of the Government task force on emergency planning, which I chair, and continues to work with Departments and other public authorities to ensure the best possible use of resources and compatibility between different planning requirements. A key area of activity is overseeing emergency planning; refining and developing the arrangements that exist, continuously improving them through review and revision, and generally providing the basis for increased confidence in the emergency planning process.The interdepartmental working group on emergency planning supports the work of the task force, carries out studies and oversees emergency planning structures and processes. The group encompasses all Departments with lead roles in the various Government emergency plans and the key public authorities, including the Defence Forces, which plan to support such activities. This working group, under the guidance of the Government task force, continues to meet and is chaired by the emergency planning office. It is a forum for developing strategic guidance to all those involved in emergency planning and for sharing information on emergency planning. The lead responsibility for specific emergency planning functions remains with the relevant Departments, as do budgetary, exercise programmes and resource management requirements. The Department of Defence does not have a specific budgetary allocation for emergency planning as emergency plans are co-ordinated by the various lead Departments at a national level and through the local authorities, including the fire service, the Health Service Executive and the local and regional Garda divisions.Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces are the provision of aid to the civil power, meaning in practice to assist the Garda Síochána and other civil authorities when requested. The various components of the Defence Forces are active in this regard, providing any assistance that is appropriate in specific circumstances. The capacity of the Defence Forces to deal with major emergencies is kept under constant review. Plans and procedures are updated as necessary and such additional equipment as is required to address any perceived deficiencies is acquired on the basis of identified priorities. Training and preparation for such events is also provided for in the annual training plan of the Defence Forces. The total budgetary allocation to the Defence Forces includes overall provision for these roles and other roles which may be assigned to the Defence Forces by the Government.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	466	I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 47 together.A Permanent Defence Force contingent has been serving with the UN mission in Liberia, UNMIL, since December 2003. A one-year extension of the initial deployment of one year was approved by the Government in December 2004, subject to the renewal of the UN mandate and a satisfactory review of the mission. In the near future, I will bring proposals to the Government for the continued deployment of a contingent with the mission after December 2005. From the outset, my predecessor signalled the Government's intention that the involvement of the Defence Forces in UNMIL would not exceed two to three years. The UN has been advised accordingly. Elections which are planned for October 2005 under the comprehensive peace agreement of August 2003 should be completed by the time the Irish contingent withdraws. The contingent is there to assist the people of Liberia to regain the peace they deserve. It is general policy that deployments of Defence Forces contingents to peace support missions overseas should be for defined periods.An Irish contingent, together with an infantry company group from Sweden, provides the quick reaction force to the UNMIL force commander. When the unit was deployed in late 2003, its initial focus was to help secure the Monrovia area and to support the disarmament process. In recent times, however, the focus of the unit has altered to framework operations in support of the election process. National elections are scheduled to be held on 11 October, with results expected on the 26 October. The new Government is expected to take office in late January 2006. The Secretary General of the UN has indicated that there will be a review of the UNMIL mission in March 2006, and depending on the political and security situation in Liberia at that time, a downsizing schedule for the UNMIL mission will be agreed at that time.

One of the roles assigned to the Defence Forces is the provision of aid to the civil power, meaning in practice to assist the Garda when requested. There are detailed procedures in place to enable the Garda to obtain the assistance of the Defence Forces in matters of law and order when they consider it necessary.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	468	While primary responsibility in this area lies with my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, a request for assistance from the United States of America in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina was received through the EU monitoring and information centre in Brussels. Following consideration by the military authorities it was decided to offer to supply and operate two water treatment and purification plants; three critical stress debrief teams; 3,000 ready to eat meals; 65 tents for approximately 500 people; and, if required, a team of Defence Forces personnel to run a camp. Staff officers and logistics experts could also be provided. This response, along with responses from 20 other EU member states was made to the USA through the EU monitoring and information centre. The USA accepted a number of offers but did not call on Ireland in this regard. However, a donation of €1 million was made by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and accepted by the USA.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	469	A number of informal meetings of EU defence ministers have been held in recent years. The meetings have been a useful forum for informal discussions focused on promoting dialogue between defence ministers in the context of the continued development of the European Security and Defence Policy. An informal meeting of EU defence ministers is scheduled to take place in the United Kingdom on 13 October 2005. The meeting will include a capabilities demonstration on air-to-air refuelling. Progress on Operation Althea will be discussed over a working lunch. The meeting will be followed by a meeting of the steering board of the European Defence Agency. An agenda has not yet been finalised for this meeting.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	470	I consulted my Cabinet colleagues in April 2005 on a draft proposal to conduct a nationwide public information campaign on emergency planning. Following an assessment of the observations I received, I decided to recommend to Government that my Department should proceed with the research stage of the project. This will allow a planned and costed proposal to be put to Government later for such a campaign in 2006.Similar campaigns have been undertaken across Europe. Research undertaken in the United Kingdom in advance of its public information campaign, launched in July-August 2004, showed that people wanted information about what to do in an emergency and wanted to know what the Government and emergency services are doing to prepare for an emergency.My Department is currently drafting the scoping requirements and tender for such a research project in consultation with other key Departments. It is envisaged that the analysis of the output from this research phase will be completed quickly and will inform further recommendations to be made to Government on the type and format of such a campaign. I am reluctant to speculate further on the type of recommendations that will result until this work is completed.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	471	I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 50 together.The Government task force on emergency planning has worked, since it was set up in 2001, to co-ordinate emergency planning and response arrangements across those Departments that lead and support the State's response in an emergency.The task force continues to meet on a regular basis, most recently on Tuesday, 20 September 2005. The meeting on Wednesday, 13 July 2005 was convened at particularly short notice as a special meeting in the aftermath of the London bombings.A focus of the task force continues to be on making the necessary arrangements to respond to the risks from terrorist activities, ensuring that the protection available to the Irish people is maximised, putting mechanisms in place to support the response agencies and providing co-ordination for maximum efficiency and effectiveness.Potential threats to the State arising from international terrorism are continuously monitored by those involved, principally the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces. The current advice available to me is that, while the Garda authorities recognise that the terrorist threat to Europe may currently be high, with regard to Ireland it is low.The awareness that the situation could change rapidly, and with little warning, has ensured that vigilance is maintained. The objective has been, in so far as possible, to confine and control threats before they translate to destructive actions.Those, principally the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces, charged with precautionary activities are key to the process. They analyse information to assess potential vulnerabilities and enable those charged with protecting the public to concentrate scarce resources in the most effective way. This assessment work, including that of potential terrorist activities, will continue and must by its nature remain confidential.Arrangements regarding security issues that may arise are primarily a matter for the Garda Síochána. Emergency planning preparations are designed to ensure that as far as possible the necessary advance planning is in place to deal with the consequences of any incident that may arise.A critical issue in an emergency situation is the question of issuing adequate and timely warnings and providing the necessary information to the general public on threatened or developing emergency situations.The EU civil protection mechanism and other international mechanisms provide Ireland with certain warning and alert systems and mechanisms. Television and radio broadcasting will be the key means of contact with the public in such circumstances but all other means of communication will be utilised. International linkages have also been important as a means of sharing expertise and resources. The European Union continues to develop programmes to improve co-operation within the Union, to prevent and limit any consequences of chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear terrorists threats. This was given new impetus by the EU declaration on combating terrorism agreed under the Irish Presidency in 2004, which, among other things, emphasises the benefits of co-operation and co-ordination.I am pleased to report to this House that there continues to be excellent co-operation between my Department and all other Departments and public authorities on these matters and I continue to report regularly to Government on emergency planning, on a confidential basis.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	472	I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 54 together.Dr. Eileen Doyle and the external advisory committee presented their report, The Challenge of a Workplace, in March 2002. This independent report addressed the range of interpersonal issues within the Defence Forces. Its contents and recommendations were accepted in full.Implementation of the recommendations of the report has been one of the highest priorities for the Defence Forces and my Department since its publication. An independent monitoring group was established in May 2002 to oversee the implementation of these recommendations.The independent monitoring group's progress report, Response to the Challenge of a Workplace, launched by my predecessor on 24 September 2004, is available on the Defence Forces website and describes in detail the progress achieved since the publication of the original Doyle report in 2002.Arising from the Doyle report, the following steps have been taken: firm guiding principles have been set out in the Defence Forces dignity in the workplace charter; a major educational awareness programme is ongoing throughout the Defence Forces; a new administrative instruction on interpersonal relationships was introduced in March 2003. The instruction and a users guide were distributed to every member of the Defence Forces; some 185 of a planned 200 designated contact persons have been put in place throughout the organisation to facilitate the operation of the formal and informal procedures that may be used by any party wishing to institute a complaint. Training is ongoing as required to maintain the number of qualified designated contact persons available; an independent external confidential free phone helpline and counselling service was set up for members of the Permanent Defence Force in March 2003; an independent pilot project of exit interviews seeking the experiences and views of outgoing members of the Permanent Defence Force was conducted; leadership training has been given by external experts and has been the subject of NCO focus groups with emphasis on "training the trainers"; an effective interpersonal skills for leaders course for personnel in supervisory and management positions; changes in cadet school instruction have been initiated and issues concerning the ranking, selection and training for cadet school instructors are being addressed; Defence Forces regulations, administrative instructions, policies and procedures have been reviewed by an equality steering group under a Labour Court chairperson; on 19 September 2005 the President appointed the first Defence Forces Ombudsman; an officer within the Defence Forces human resources management section has been assigned responsibility for equality matters; and a training circular 06/04 entitled, Military Code of Conduct for Students and Instructors in all Training Environments, was published. This was followed by an extensive series of associated workshops for all relevant personnel.The Chief of Staff has repeatedly emphasised his acceptance of the problems indicated by the Doyle report. He has recognised the necessity to tackle this matter in a fundamental way at all levels of the Defence Forces and has demonstrated a very active and genuine commitment to change. He has emphasised that it is incumbent on all commanders to ensure that best practice in the management of personnel is fostered at all levels to eliminate the problems identified in the Doyle report.Policies on equality, dignity and bullying are constantly being communicated to all ranks. I am satisfied that the military authorities are alert and vigilant on this issue and are committed to addressing the matter in a continuing and proactive manner through education modules on interpersonal relationships now embedded in career courses for all ranks.I reiterate that bullying is not training for anything. I fully realise that the project of bringing about necessary fundamental changes in attitudes and culture will not be quick or easy. However, with substantial and vigorous leadership, I have every confidence that the proper environment will be firmly established and maintained throughout the Defence Forces.Following the recent military police investigation into allegations of bullying at McKee Barracks, the deputy Chief of Staff has convened a court of inquiry, which will inquire into all matters connected with these recent allegations of bullying. The court of inquiry will make findings and recommendations on these matters and until such time as it reports I am not in a position to comment further. I am advised that currently there are no further military police investigations ongoing into bullying in the Defence Forces.In adopting and implementing administrative instruction No. A7 on interpersonal relations, rigid guidelines with regard to the prohibition of any form of sexual harassment, harassment or bullying have been set down in the Defence Forces as well as procedures for the making of and dealing with complaints of unacceptable behaviour. All ranks have been made fully aware that all forms of unacceptable behaviour, including bullying, will not be tolerated.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	474	The Aceh monitoring mission, AMM, in Indonesia was launched by the European Union on 15 September 2005. The aim of the mission is to monitor the implementation of the peace agreement concluded by the Government of Indonesia and the Free Aceh Movement, GAM, on 15 August 2005.The mission is a civilian mission within the framework of the European Security and Defence Policy, ESDP. The mission comprises a total of just over 200 unarmed civilian and military personnel. The European Union's political and security committee, PSC, will exercise the political control and the strategic guidance of the AMM under the responsibility of the EU Council.The key tasks of the mission are: to monitor respect for the end of hostilities between the parties; to monitor the demobilisation of GAM fighters and to decommission their armaments; to monitor the relocation of non-organic Indonesian military forces and non-organic police troops; to monitor the re-integration of active GAM members into civil society; to monitor the human rights situation in the context of the disarmament and demobilisation of active GAM members; to fulfil certain responsibilities in ruling on disputed amnesty cases in line with agreed dispute settlement procedures agreed in the MoU; and to investigate and fulfil responsibility in ruling on complaints and alleged violations of the MoU in line with agreed dispute settlement procedures.On 7 September 2005, the Government authorised the despatch of members of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the Aceh monitoring mission. On 8 September 2005, three officers of the Defence Forces were deployed to Banda Aceh in support of the mission. Following a short period of training in Medan in Indonesia, the officers deployed to the Aceh province on 15 September 2005. Two of these officers, who will be deployed for just over three months, are specialist ordnance personnel and are directly involved in the weapons decommissioning process. The third officer, who will be deployed initially for six months, with a possible extension for a further six months, is employed in the mission headquarters.To date reports from the European Union indicate that the decommissioning process is progressing well.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	475	At the meeting of the steering board of the European Defence Agency on 23 May 2005, among other matters, a report was made to the board regarding developments in the European defence equipment market with specific reference to armoured fighting vehicles. The agency, having completed initial analysis of the market, reported that there were up to 23 separate programmes currently ongoing or planned with regard to the development and acquisition of such vehicles and that there was significant potential for rationalisation and consolidation in the market so as to achieve greater efficiencies in the development and manufacture of such vehicles.The steering board agreed that more co-operation was urgently needed and instructed the agency to work with governments planning for next generation AFVs to ensure that they would have as much in common as possible. This could include pooling efforts and resources on new technologies and possibly collaborative programmes. The essential effort in this regard is to achieve improved economies of scale from the collaborative efforts of member states and also to potentially improve the capability of vehicles through more effective expenditure of existing or planned research and technology investment.Participation in any EDA programme is a matter for each member state. The EDA does not have authority to force states into any particular programme. The discussion at the board meeting in May has no direct implications for Ireland's military procurement. However, I would expect that rationalisation and consolidation of development and procurement of defence equipment generally should deliver greater efficiencies and improved capabilities for our current level of ongoing investment in equipment for the Defence Forces. The EDA and the participating member states, have similar ambitions regarding their own investment in defence equipment.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	476	The individual concerned was retired, by the President, on the advice of the Government with effect from a date in June 1969. The retirement was effected pursuant to section 47(2) of the Defence Act 1954 and Paragraph 18(1)(f) of Defence Force Regulations A15, which provide that an officer may be retired "in the interests of the service". The individual initiated proceedings in the High Court in November 1998 regarding the circumstances of his retirement some 29 years earlier. The High Court found in favour of the State in June 1999 on grounds of inordinate delay in the bringing of the proceedings. The individual appealed the case to the Supreme Court in September 1999. The Supreme Court found similarly in favour of the State in January 2001. A decision to retire an officer "in the interests of the service" is only taken for the most compelling reasons. The Government advice to the President was on grounds of security. I am satisfied that the matter was handled in an entirely appropriate and proper manner in 1969 and that the decision taken then was taken only after very detailed and due consideration.In early July 2002, arising from a newspaper feature article on the case, published on 29 June 2002, the then Minister requested the Judge Advocate General to examine and to review the case with regard to the following terms of reference: to inquire into the circumstances surrounding the retirement of the individual referred to by means of a complete review of all relevant documentation held by the Department of Defence and by the Defence Forces, and to have full access to any civil or military personnel for the purposes of their providing explanation regarding any apparent gaps or ambiguities in the documentation and to report to the Minister with her conclusions and recommendations.These terms of reference were subsequently enlarged by the then Minister at the request of the Judge Advocate General to provide that the Judge Advocate General was "to be entitled, within the Terms of Reference, and the manner of the Inquiry contemplated, to take such representation in writing from any party whom she considers to be appropriate".The Judge Advocate General, a civilian barrister, carried out a detailed examination and review of all the historical documentation relating to the decision to retire the individual concerned, by reference to the entirety of both the civil and military files in the matter. Her report was submitted to the then Minister in mid-September 2002.In December 2002 the individual sought an order of the High Court quashing this report by the Judge Advocate General. The High Court found in favour of the applicant for reasons enumerated in the text of the High Court judgment. I understand that the final order arising from the judgment is not yet available. It should be emphasised, however, that the recent High Court judgment in the matter of the report of the Judge Advocate General specifically and only related to the actual procedures utilised by the Judge Advocate General in the course of her review and examination of this matter in 2002. The substantive issue, namely, the Government decision in 1969 to recommend the retirement of this individual from the Defence Forces by the President, remains entirely unaffected by the judgment of the High Court, a point specifically emphasised within the text of that recent judgment itself.As regards the issue of release of documentation, the position is that all the military and civil documentation within the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence, relating to the Government decision in 1969 to recommend that the President should retire the individual concerned, has been released to the individual in full, in accordance with the recommendations of the report of the Judge Advocate General in that regard.The individual in question has had access to these documents relating to his retirement since 14 November 2002 when his legal representatives attended the Department and were given copies of all the relevant records held in my Department.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	477	The White Paper sets out a comprehensive programme for the development of defence and the Defence Forces for the period 2000 to 2010. It might be noted that the programme is expressed in terms of policy decisions taken and goals, objectives and plans and not in terms of specific recommendations.Just past the half-way point, most of the major elements of the White Paper development programme have been implemented. These include: a rebalancing of defence resource allocation achieved through payroll savings and the sales of properties and the full reinvestment of these resources in new equipment and improved infrastructure for the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps; continuous recruitment to the Defence Forces; a continued commitment to overseas participation; the development of the Reserve Defence Force, including a new organisational structure and better clothing, equipment and training; and the decentralisation of the Civil Defence function.Significant progress has been made also in terms of organisational change in the Department and in the Defence Forces but that work continues. It is my intention that the White Paper will be fully delivered on, within the original schedule.The Department's strategy statement for 2005 to 2007, published in July, provides for a civil-military review of White Paper implementation to be completed by end-2006. That review will commence soon and I believe that it will assist the implementation process.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	478	KFOR was established on 10 June 1999, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1244, for an initial period of 12 months, to continue thereafter unless the UN Security Council decides otherwise. The role of KFOR is to support the maintenance of civil law and order within Kosovo so as to develop a climate of safety and security, which will enable the transfer of increased responsibility to the civil authorities. Ireland has participated in KFOR since August 1999.The Irish contingent currently comprises an infantry group of some 210 personnel together with a number of personnel in staff posts at various headquarters. The infantry group was first deployed in September 2003. Previously a transport group had been deployed with KFOR since August 1999.The Irish infantry group operates as part of a multinational grouping, within the Czech led multinational task force centre. It comprises a Mowag APC mounted company together with support and logistic elements. The main tasks of the Irish infantry group include the following: provision of general security to all ethnic groups, institutions and cultural sites; provision of support to UNMIK police and other agencies with security tasks; identification of and reporting on extremist groups and activities; vehicle and foot patrols; vehicle checkpoints; and operation of observation posts.It had been anticipated that a reorganisation and scaling-down of KFOR would take place in 2004. This had partly commenced when civil disturbances broke out in March 2004 in Kosovo. The withdrawal of the Irish contingent was planned as part of this reduction in KFOR presence and was to have been completed by October 2004. However, having regard to the fragility of the peace in Kosovo, and subject to ongoing assessments of the situation on the ground, both I and the Minister for Foreign Affairs are agreed on the importance of maintaining an Irish presence in the Western Balkans in 2005-2006.In December 2004, SFOR, NATO-led mission, was replaced by an EU military mission under the European Security and Defence Policy known as Operation Althea or EUFOR. EUFOR was established under the authority of the UN Security Council Resolution 1575 of 22 November 2004. There are currently 54 Defence Force personnel deployed to EUFOR as part of a Finnish-led multinational task force based in Tuzla and also in the force headquarters located in Sarajevo. Within the Finnish-led task force, Ireland provides personnel for the headquarters, the military police unit, joint military verification teams and a national support element. There is no plan to significantly increase the Irish contribution to EUFOR over the next 12 months. The long-term objective of this mission is the establishment of a stable, viable, peaceful and multi-ethnic Bosnia and Herzegovina, BiH, co-operating peacefully with its neighbours.Ireland has long been an advocate of co-operative approaches to security and EUFOR-KFOR have been an important expression of the approaches to regional peacekeeping and crisis management in Europe. Ireland's participation in Partnership for Peace, PfP, since December 1999 has provided an important framework for co-operation and consultation in this regard. Our involvement in the region is also consistent with our ongoing participation in the development of EU crisis management capabilities.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	479	As the Deputy's question indicates, the suicide rate within the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, reflects that of the wider national population from which members of the Permanent Defence Force are drawn. Every death resulting from suicide is a tragedy for the family concerned. Therefore, while the suicide rate does not show any apparent excess over the rate for the national population as a whole, there is, however, no room whatever for complacency in the matter. Accordingly, the Defence Forces have adopted a formalised healthy living-mental health well-being awareness programme, which incorporates training modules in stress management skills, mental health well-being, post-traumatic stress disorder, suicide awareness and prevention. The study referred to covered the period 1970-2002. The study reported period-averaged suicide rates per 100,000 population of 18.3 for male civilians in the 20-65 age group as against 15.3 for PDF personnel in the 17-65 age group. All PDF suicides were male suicides. The study reported a period-averaged age-adjusted suicide rate among male PDF personnel that is lower than that of male civilians.

Pending the outcome of the investigation I do not consider it appropriate to comment any further in the matter.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	481	Defence Forces personnel have participated in a number of staff, technical and crisis management exercises in the context of both the EU and PfP. They have for many years attended workshops, training courses, desktop exercises, seminars and other events overseas as part of their military training and I expect that they will continue to do so. The purpose of such training is to learn from best practice in other defence forces and includes improving the level of inter-operability between forces in the context of peace support operations and the Petersberg Tasks. In accordance with stated policy, the Defence Forces do not participate in multinational military field exercises. However, from an optimum readiness perspective, this may need to change if we wish to participate fully and effectively in EU battlegroups-rapid response elements. The question of joint training missions with the forces of other member states is among the issues being reviewed by the interdepartmental group I have established to examine the full implications of Ireland's potential participation in EU rapid reaction elements.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	482	I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 154 together.The case to which the Deputies refer is that of Private Kevin Barrett, who died on 18 February 1999 while serving with the 84th Infantry Battalion, UNIFIL, in Lebanon. I am advised that the circumstances surrounding Private Kevin Barrett's death are as follows. Private Kevin Barrett's battalion was carrying out a tour of duty in south Lebanon from October 1998 to May 1999. On the evening of 17 February 1999 after normal duties, Private Barrett, in the company of number of other soldiers went to the "C" company HQ canteen for the evening. They were driven back to their post in the early hours of 18 February 1999. Private Barrett went to his accommodation, which he shared with another soldier, who was asleep at the time. Shortly afterwards, another colleague visited Private Barrett and they were chatting for some minutes. Private Barrett discharged his weapon while his colleague was not looking. Medical help was summoned and Private Barrett was pronounced dead.The death of Private Barrett was the subject of a UN board of inquiry and an Irish contingent board of inquiry as well as a military police investigation. The coroner for north-west Donegal held an inquest into the death of Private Barrett from 5 to 8 September 2005. The jury returned an open verdict. I am advised that the military authorities co-operated fully with the inquest into the soldier's death.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	483	The office of Ombudsman for the Defence Forces has been established as an independent statutory office under the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004 by the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004 (Commencement) Order 2005. The appointment of a person to the office is made by the President acting upon the recommendation of the Government. Ms Paulyn Marrinan-Quinn was recently so appointed by the President upon the recommendation of the Government as the first Ombudsman for the Defence Forces. She was nominated to the Government by me, having been previously selected by the Public Appointments Service as a result of an open public competition held by it.The function of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces will be to act as the ultimate point of appeal for and administrative investigation into complaints made by members and former members of the Defence Forces against another member or former member or against a civil servant of the Department of Defence. The actual functions of the ombudsman, as provided for in the legislation, will commence with effect from 1 December 2005 under the commencement order. Subject to the terms of the legislation and her own independent personal judgment and discretion, the ombudsman will undertake independent investigation into any complaint made to her and will issue a written report and recommendations arising from such an investigation.The Ombudsman for the Defence Forces may investigate a complaint in respect of an action or decision which may have adversely affected the complainant personally. The action or decision complained of must have occurred no earlier than the 1 December 2005, the date set by Government order for the statutory commencement of the functions of the office. The ombudsman will function independently in the performance of her duties and has a wide discretion in the discharge of the duties of the position subject to the terms of the Act. She will, however, have due regard to the operational requirements of the Defence Forces. Where the complainant is serving in the Defence Forces, the complaint must have been within the military redress of wrongs system for at least 28 days. The ombudsman, on receipt of the complaint from the complainant, must form an opinion that the complaint is not likely to be resolved within that forum and that the other necessary criteria set out in the Act are satisfied. Complainants who are former members of the Defence Forces will apply directly to the ombudsman in the first instance.The Ombudsman will typically investigate and ascertain if the action or decision complained of was taken without proper authority or on irrelevant grounds, was negligent or careless, based on erroneous or incomplete information, improperly discriminatory, unreasonable notwithstanding consideration of the context of the military environment, based on undesirable administrative practice or contrary to fair or sound administration. There are specific exclusions within the legislation in respect of certain specific areas and matters which are outside the remit of the ombudsman. An important component of the work will consist of the making of formal written reports and recommendations to the Minister on foot of investigations undertaken in various individual cases and in following up the official administrative response to these reports and recommendations. There is a statutory requirement for the Ombudsman to provide an annual report to the Houses of the Oireachtas.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	484	The Commission on Nursing in the Report of the Commission on Nursing 1998 considered that registration as a midwife should no longer be a mandatory requirement for entry to the higher diploma in public health nursing or registration as a public health nurse, PHN. It stated:In light of the range of services offered by public health nurses and the ongoing development of nursing and midwifery services in the community, registration as a midwife should no longer be a mandatory requirement for entry to the higher diploma in public health nursing or registration as a public health nurse. An alternative education programme relating more closely to the core generic maternal and child care service requirements of public health nursing should replace the mandatory midwifery requirement. The commission recommends that the board establish a working party composed of PHNs, health service providers and nurse educators to determine the content and duration of a course in maternal and child health, as an alternative to the mandatory midwifery qualification.Accordingly, An Bord Altranais, which is broadly representative consisting of 29 members, including 17 elected nurses from all divisions of the register of nurses, unanimously decided to remove the mandatory midwifery requirement for public health nursing in July 2002. The board subsequently developed the maternal and child health module for nurses who do not have a midwifery qualification, and thereafter the requirements and standards for public health nurse programmes. The maternal and child health module and the requirements and standards were developed by working groups that included key stakeholder representation including public health nursing course leaders, managers and clinicians. This publication is expected to be available within two to three weeks. It was proposed, as set out by the commission, that this course should be offered as an alternative to the mandatory midwifery qualification for PHN students. Those with midwifery registration would not be required to undertake the course. This course addresses the professional and practice issues as they relate to maternal and child health in a primary health care setting as a dimension of the role of the PHN, and includes both theoretical and clinical requirements.

The report was published last year and is available on my Department's website. The study concluded that the introduction of a dedicated inter-hospital air ambulance service would be appropriate in an all-island context.In considering the report, the DHSSPS advised that its priority at present is the need for further investment to improve the ground ambulance service. On foot of the report, my Department had detailed discussions with the Department of Defence regarding the future provision of air ambulance services by the Air Corps. Arising from these discussions, a detailed service level agreement has recently been prepared and signed. The signatories to the agreement are the Department of Defence, the Department of Health and Children, the Health Service Executive, the Defence Forces and the Air Corps. The agreement sets out the range of services to be provided by the Air Corps, specifically inter-hospital transfers for spinal and serious injuries and illnesses, air transport of neonates requiring immediate medical intervention in Ireland, air transport of patients requiring emergency organ transplant in the UK, air transport of organ harvest teams within Ireland and air transport of patients from offshore islands to mainland hospitals where the Irish Coast Guard service is not available.A steering group comprising representation from each the signatories to the service level agreement has been established. The group will monitor the operation of the agreement and will amend, if necessary, the provisions of the agreement to take account of service developments, including the new fleet replacement programme currently being put in place by the Air Corps. Finally, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources confirmed that the Irish Coast Guard will continue to provide services on the same basis as currently delivered.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	500	Customs services, both nationally and internationally, are acutely conscious of the importance of coastal surveillance and it is considered regularly at national and international fora. The Customs and Excise service of the Revenue Commissioners has primary responsibility for the prevention, detection, interception and seizure of controlled drugs at importation in Ireland and is well aware of the potential for smuggling drugs along our extensive coastline. The customs service operates a number of maritime units for inshore and coastal surveillance, and is supported nationally by both the Irish Naval Service and the Air Corps. Over recent years, the customs service has considerable success in seizing large quantities of drugs in maritime traffic. Many of these operations involved collaboration with the Garda Síochána and other national and international law enforcement agencies. The service also maintains close working relationships with other foreign customs and law enforcement services responsible for maritime and coastal surveillance.The Customs and Excise service regularly evaluates its operational response to drug smuggling on the basis of sophisticated risk analysis based on intelligence gathering at all levels of the drugs production and supply chain network, including current national and international drug smuggling routes and the smuggling methodologies used. The customs service has re-launched its customs drugs watch programme, which seeks to enlist the help of the public in the critical element of reducing the supply of illicit drugs by notifying customs on a confidential basis of suspicious activity at our sea, land, and air boundaries. Customs has also acquired a new revenue customs cutter, RCC Suirbhéir, which now patrols and monitors our internal waters, territorial seas and adjacent waters. The customs service has also enhanced a number of its anti-drugs programmes, specifically its canine programme, which now has nine drug detector teams strategically deployed at our main ports and airports. Later this year, customs will take delivery of a state-of-the-art mobile X-ray container examination unit to assist in countering the smuggling of drugs and other illicit products in containerised freight traffic.At national level, Customs and Excise engages in regular surveillance exercises and joint operations with its inter-agency drugs joint task force partners, that is, the Garda Síochána, naval service and Air Corps. At EU level, through membership of the customs co-operation working party and engagement with Europol, customs continues to organise and participate in regular bilateral, trilateral and EU-wide intelligence-led joint surveillance exercises and operations, including maritime focused operations, with other customs and law enforcement agencies. In 2003, the Irish customs service led and co-ordinated an international surveillance operation to tackle the smuggling of drugs into the EU and neighbouring countries by sea. The Customs and Excise services of 26 other European countries participated in this very successful operation during which they seized over seven tonnes of cannabis resin and 730 kg of cocaine. Such surveillance operations are a regular feature of the supply reduction work undertaken by Customs and Excise to detect and to disrupt drug smuggling operations and are wholly in keeping with the responsibilities laid to Customs and Excise in the national drugs strategy.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	502	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that new online service has greatly reduced the demand for personal service at their vehicle registration offices. An increasing number of motor dealers now register new vehicles online themselves — currently approximately 80% of such registrations nationally are online — in preference to using the facilities at vehicle registration offices. In addition, a valuation inquiry facility has been made available on the Revenue Commissioners' website, allowing all customers to obtain vehicle registration tax quotations on second-hand vehicles online.Vehicle registration facilities ceased in Roscommon town with effect from 1 March 2005 and the service is now being provided from Galway, with service also available, if necessary, from neighbouring offices at Castlebar, Sligo and Tullamore. New procedures were introduced at that time which simplify and speed up the registration process for used vehicles. These new procedures eliminate the necessity to physically examine all such vehicles, as had been the case previously. The new arrangements also provide a facility for customers to register vehicles by post without the need to bring their vehicles to a Revenue office. These initiatives have greatly assisted the successful consolidation of vehicle registration services into the larger centres. The Revenue Commissioners do not consider it necessary to re-introduce a vehicle registration service in Roscommon town based on current service demands. The Roscommon-based Revenue staff will, however, continue to carry out other Revenue duties in the area.

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	508	Data on the recorded catch by commercial salmon fishermen will not be formally available until mid October when full analysis of exploitation during the 2005 season has been completed by the central and regional fisheries boards. The Government has accepted the scientific advice that continues to maintain that reductions in the overall fishing effort are required in order to sustain and rebuild salmon stocks nationwide. For this reason, current Government policy has been designed to bring spawning escapement up to the level of the scientifically advised conservation limits as soon as possible. In keeping with this policy, when setting the commercial salmon quotas for the 2005 season, I gave a firm commitment to fully align the exploitation of salmon, both at national and district levels, on the scientific advice by 2007.In order to achieve this, I will ask the new national salmon commission, which I intend to appoint shortly, to progress the specific recommendation made by the outgoing commission to align the exploitation of salmon on the scientific advice by 2007. The Government has consistently ruled out buyout as an effective means of achieving the restoration of salmon stocks and has instead, since 2002, promoted the application of quotas on commercial fishing and bag limits on angling to achieve catch reductions as the best instrument available to achieve this objective.Moreover, no convincing case has been advanced as to the public good that would be acquired by the State in the context of a publicly funded buyout of commercial salmon licences nor why stakeholders benefiting from increased numbers of salmon entering the rivers should not contribute in whole or in part towards achieving that increase. As a result, and as I have previously and consistently indicated to the House, I have no plans at present to introduce a buyout of commercial salmon fishing licences but I am continuing to review the matter in the context of the policy outlined above. In this regard, I would be open to any relevant proposals presented to me whereby stakeholders benefiting from any reduction in commercial catch would engage in the first instance with licence holders and indicate a willingness to address any compensation issues that might arise. I can confirm that broad outline proposals have been submitted to me recently, which I intend to consider in the context of any review of policy.

For the purposes of most other social welfare payments, entitlement to an increase for a qualified adult is based on the income of the spouse or partner. A qualified adult increase at the maximum rate is payable where the spouse-partner's income is €88.88 per week or less and tapered reduced rates are payable where income is less than €220 per week. The lower threshold was last increased in budget 2000 while the upper threshold has been increased in each successive budget since then, from £135 in 2000 to €220 in budget 2005. Any change in the current arrangements relating to entitlement to qualified adult allowances would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of available resources.

The requirements are set out in the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 2002 and the Road Traffic (Construction and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 2003 to 2004. These regulations apply in the interests of public safety and to protect road infrastructure.Regulation 59 of the Road Traffic (Construction and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 2003 provides for the issuing of special permits by local authorities for the use of vehicles on roads notwithstanding that they contravene certain provisions of the aforementioned regulations. Specifically, the special permit system is intended to deal with vehicles carrying abnormal and indivisible loads. The function is assigned to local authorities because they are best placed to assess the suitability of the roads in their functional areas for use by non-compliant vehicles and to determine the appropriate routes and itineraries to be used in the making of journeys by such vehicles. A special permit issued by a local authority may cover one or more vehicles and have a validity of up to 12 months duration. I have no plans for my Department to take on the function of issuing special permits. However, in particular circumstances, a single special permit system issued by one body has merit and I have held some discussions on this subject. I will ask my Department to explore how best to proceed.I am aware of the dissatisfaction of some haulage contractors concerning the existing arrangements for the issue of special permits particularly in connection with journeys conducted on a regular basis involving wide and long loads. My Department is currently reviewing the special permit system with a view to identifying ways to streamline the process with regard to the transport of wide and long loads and to introducing, as far as is possible, the application of uniform practices by local authorities in the administration of the special permit system generally.

Accordingly I have no role in this process. I understand from the NRA that the primary construction work on the port tunnel is expected to be completed in December 2005 and that the tunnel will be open to traffic by mid-2006, following the testing and commissioning of the tunnel's operations and safety features.

In addition, Iarnród Éireann also provides an express parcels service and a road freight service to and from Ballina for Mayo industries.On 29 July this year, the unit load service for single container loads ceased given the absence of sufficient business to maintain this activity. However, I understand discussions are continuing with a number of suppliers regarding the possibility of operating a trainload container service from Ballina for local industry.

However, this date is still the subject of discussion between the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the European Commission.With the introduction of digital tachographs, smart cards will be used to record and download data from digital tachographs. My Department will shortly be able to support those companies planning to introduce digital tachographs in advance of the compulsory requirements. I expect to make, in the coming weeks, the necessary statutory orders for the introduction of the digital technology, including the issue of driver cards, company cards, workshop cards and enforcement cards as required under EU law. Once the necessary orders are made, the Department will commence the issue of such cards as the demand arises from the industry. Existing buses and lorries using analogue tachographs are not affected.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	523	In January 2005 I made regulations, the Road Traffic (Speed Limit-Traffic Signs) Regulations 2005, S.I. No. 10 of 2005, prescribing the regulatory traffic signs displaying metric units of measurement, kilometres per hour, that the road authorities must provide on public roads to indicate the speed limit in force.Since the passage of the Road Traffic Act 1994 the power to apply special speed limits has been vested in the elected members of county councils and city councils through the making of special speed limit by-laws. Section 9 of the Road Traffic Act 2004 sets out a new process for the making of speed limit by-laws by the elected members and expands the range of options available to county and city councils in relation to the deployment of special speed limits.A legislative provision to provide for the application of a special speed limit to operate during specific periods of the day, such as when school children are entering or leaving a school premises, became operative on 20 January 2005. I issued guidelines on the application of special speed limits to the county and city managers last April pursuant to the 2004 Act. Copies of the document were placed in the Oireachtas Library at the time and the guidelines are also available on my Department's website www.transport.ie under roads/publications. Local authorities are required to have regard to these guidelines when applying special speed limits and in the case of applying the 30 km/h special speed limit that is provided for in the 2004 Act, it may only be pursued in accordance with provisions in these guidelines.Decisions as to whether or not to apply a special speed limit at a particular location or to apply a special speed limit that is operative on a periodic basis are matters that fall to be determined by the local authority having complied with consultation and consent processes required under the 2004 Act.While proposals for new formats of traffic signs are examined from time to time in my Department, I want to emphasise that the traffic sign regulations that I made in January of this year and the range of sign options already available under those regulations are adequate to support the implementation of any special speed limit options.

In parallel with the opening to traffic of the Dublin Port tunnel, Dublin City Council will be introducing a heavy goods vehicle traffic management strategy to manage HGV traffic entering and exiting the port and to ensure that maximum traffic benefits are secured from the Dublin Port tunnel. The issues referred to by the Deputy are under active consideration in this context.My Department's formal role will be to put in place the necessary regulatory framework to support the strategy. I have asked my officials to monitor, in conjunction with the NRA and Dublin City Council the arrangements, including HGV traffic management arrangements, for the integration of the Dublin Port tunnel in the Dublin road network so that I may be assured that maximum traffic benefits will be secured from the Dublin Port tunnel.

For this reason, agricultural tractors and trailers are not liable to roadworthiness testing. In March 2005 my Department wrote to local authorities concerning the use, in a local authority context, of agricultural type tractors and trailers for the carrying of goods or burden of any description and outlining the necessity for hauliers engaged by local authorities to hold a road freight carrier's licence if hauling for hire and reward.Periodic roadworthiness testing applies to goods vehicles, goods trailers over 3,500 kg gross design weight, buses, ambulances and passenger cars. The roadworthiness testing of commercial vehicles, including goods trailers, is carried out by authorised testers, usually private garages, appointed by city and county councils in accordance with the European Communities (Vehicle Testing) Regulations 2004. There are in excess of 100 such testers in the country.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	526	I understand that the midlands regional planning guidelines, which were approved in mid-2004, do not include specific reference to the re-opening of Killucan railway station. It is imperative that a sufficient population is in place in the catchment area of a station to justify its re-opening. The present position is that Iarnród Éireann is in discussions with Westmeath County Council to establish if proposals for the development of the Killucan area will provide this necessary population growth.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	527	I am informed by Iarnród Éireann that it has no immediate plans to re-open the Mullingar to Athlone line. The strategic rail review examined the case for re-opening this line and concluded that it was not a priority project. The review suggested it could be re-evaluated at a future date in the context of securing progress in advancing and adopting complementary land use and transport policy at the regional and local levels in the areas concerned. However, Iarnród Éireann's first priority will be to finalise the renewal of infrastructure and rolling stock on the Galway and Mayo lines.The crucial factor to be considered in any decision to re-open a railway line is the likely scale and pace of development along the rail corridor in question. The greater the critical mass of population and economic activity, the more likely a sustainable case can be made for rail investment. I already made it clear to local authorities in other parts of the country that it is for them to develop and implement land use strategies which would support the case for rail investment. While there are no immediate plans to reopen the Athlone to Mullingar line, the issue will be kept under review having regard to the matters to which I have already referred.

However, since January 2001 the Department has implemented notification and approval procedures in respect of the introduction of new or revised services by State bus companies. The procedures are designed to ensure that these exempted operators do not announce or introduce services which may serve to pre-empt the introduction of licensed services by private operators. The procedures are also designed to ensure fair treatment for exempted operators, enabling them to introduce new or revised services in an orderly and speedy fashion and providing a mechanism to enable them to comply with their obligations under section 25 of the Transport Act 1958.I can confirm that in recent months my Department received three notifications for services on the route in question. The first of these notifications was successful and a reply issued to Bus Éireann on 16 September 2005. The remaining two notifications are under consideration. In accordance with standard procedures for processing the applications made by bus operators, details of any application received remain confidential until a decision is made.

This requires EU approval and is under current consideration by the EU Commission. Persons in receipt of the single farm payment will qualify for the once-off payments under the disadvantaged areas scheme provided they are eligible under that scheme.For the 2007-13 period, the use of modulated funds will be considered in the context of the new rural development strategy and programme to be drawn up for that period.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	534	My Department circulated draft regulations in relation to veterinary medicines for consultation in early August of this year and has received written submissions from most of the main stakeholders. My Department has also subsequently met with many of these stakeholders concerned as part of the consultative process. In addition, as required by the relevant legislation, the animal remedies consultative committee will meet shortly to consider the draft regulations, following which I will make final decisions on the issues involved so that the regulations can be brought into force by the transposition deadline of 30 October 2005 specified in the EU directive concerned, Directive 2004/28.The draft regulations concerned are primarily designed to implement EU legislation but, insofar as is possible, in a way that is most appropriate for Irish farming conditions. In relation to the ‘prescription only' issue, the position is that EU Directive 2004/28 provides that all veterinary medicines for food producing animals must be subject to prescriptions. However, the directive also includes a provision for exemption criteria to be adopted at EU level, which will provide a mechanism for certain categories of medicines to be exempted from the prescription requirement. The EU has not yet adopted a decision on the exemption criteria but must do so before 1 January 2007. Pending this decision, existing national prescription and distribution arrangements may remain in place.My Department intends to avail of the exemption clause to the maximum extent possible and has made a submission to the European Commission with a view to retaining ‘off prescription' in Ireland all products, other than intramammaries, which currently enjoy this status. The draft regulations published by my Department provide that veterinary medicines, such as wormers and certain vaccines, will continue to be available off-prescription until a decision is taken at EU level on the exemption criteria. In practice, this means that, apart from intramammaries, my Department is retaining the essence of our existing national prescription and distribution regime. In view of this, the concerns set out in the Deputy's letter are unfounded and the question of extending the range of persons who may be permitted to prescribe does not need to be addressed at this stage in the context of the regulations scheduled to come into force at the beginning of November of this year.The EU directive provides that prescriptions may be written by "a professional person qualified to do so in accordance with applicable national law". When the exemption criteria issue is resolved in the course of next year, I will review the regulations and, in particular, the provisions relating to the categories of persons who would be permitted to prescribe veterinary medicines, in light of the outcome, with a view to ensuring competition in the marketplace and to avoid imposing unnecessary costs on farmers. Full consultations will be held with all stakeholders on the matter at that stage before final decisions were taken.

I am further informed that from 1 January 2005 to date there have been six recorded incidents of criminal damage at the location mentioned, including criminal damage to windows.The Garda authorities are of the opinion that much of this anti-social behaviour emanates from youths accessing the location via a gap in the boundary fence at this complex. I have been advised by the Garda authorities that in the context of a forthcoming rejuvenation scheme, they have recommended the replacement of the fence with a high boundary wall to prevent access in this way.I am informed that two community gardaí are allocated to the area on a full-time basis. Regular ongoing attention is given to the area by uniform and plain clothes mobile patrols.I am assured by local Garda management that they are satisfied that sufficient gardaí are deployed on a daily basis in the area to deal with all incidents arising.

His application was investigated, in turn, by the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, both of whom concluded that the person concerned did not meet the criteria for recognition as a refugee, as defined in section 2 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended. The person concerned was made aware of the outcome of his application by the two bodies by letters dated 15 January 2003 and 25 July 2005 respectively.In line with normal procedures, the file of the person concerned has been forwarded to my Department's ministerial decisions unit for final processing and a representative from that unit will be writing to the person concerned in the coming days to advise him of his position in the State.

Having given full consideration to the matter the visa was refused because my Department was not satisfied on the basis of the documentation provided that an adequate relationship history existed between the applicant and the reference in Ireland.In order to prevent abuses of the system, in so far as is possible and without unduly interfering with the Irish citizen's private circumstances, the immigration division will seek to establish various matters. These include the context in which the marriage took place, the validity of the marriage and whether the couple are residing in a family unit. This may involve requesting supporting documentation as evidence of the relationship or an interview by the immigration authorities of either or both parties.An appeal of the decision to refuse the visa application was subsequently submitted. However, based on the additional documentation supplied, the visa appeals officer was unable to conclude that the initial decision should be overturned. Consequently the application was refused on appeal.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	540	In Ireland powers of arrest are to be found both at common law and in a large number of diverse statutory provisions. These powers for the most part are exercisable only by a member of the Garda Síochána. However, as the Deputy avers, there are situations where any person may effect what is known as a "citizen's arrest". The basis for these important powers is set out below.At common law all persons, including a member of the Garda Síochána, may arrest without warrant any person who has committed or is committing a breach of the peace in his or her presence or any person whom he or she reasonably believes is going to commit a breach of the peace in the immediate future.Turning to the key statutory provisions in this area, the Criminal Law Act 1997 confers two distinct powers of arrest on any person including a member of the Garda Síochána regarding arrestable offences. "Arrestable offences" in general terms refer to offences which are punishable by imprisonment for five years or more and include an offence of attempting to commit such an offence.Under section 4(1) of the 1997 Act any person "may arrest without warrant anyone who is or whom he or she, with reasonable cause, suspects to be in the act of committing an arrestable offence." Section 4(2) provides that where an arrestable offence has been committed, any person "may arrest without warrant anyone who is or whom he or she, with reasonable cause, suspects to be guilty of the offence."Where either of these powers is exercised by a person other than a member of the Garda Síochána, two further qualifications apply: the power may only be exercised if the arrestor "with reasonable cause, suspects that the person to be arrested by him or her would otherwise attempt to avoid, or is avoiding, arrest by a member of the Garda Síochána", and once an arrest has been effected by the ordinary citizen he or she must transfer the person arrested into the custody of the Garda Síochána as soon as possible. This was already the position with respect to the citizen's common law power of arrest.Finally, under section 19 of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act 1976 any person may arrest a person whom he or she reasonably suspects of being in the act of committing, or having committed, any offence scheduled in that Act, these are offences of the kind associated with terrorism, if committed in Northern Ireland.The scope of these powers has been examined by the courts and I would refer the Deputy to Professor Dermot Walsh's text Criminal Procedure published by Thomson Round Hall 2002 for a more detailed treatment of the law relating to the citizen’s powers of arrest.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	541	I am informed by Garda authorities that an application for a Garda CCTV system in Arklow has been received and is under consideration by the advisory committee, along with applications from other cities and towns throughout the country.As the Deputy is aware, some 17 locations nationwide which has been selected to receive a Garda CCTV system. This programme of implementation of CCTV systems is being implemented on a phased basis as follows: phase 1 — Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick; phase 2 — Athlone, Clondalkin, Tallaght and Waterford; and phase 3 — Ballyfermot, Carlow, Castlebar, Clonmel, Ennis, Kilkenny and Sligo.Installation of CCTV systems is of necessity a detailed, complex and lengthy process. I am anxious to accelerate the implementation of the CCTV programme, and reduce as far as possible the workload of the Garda Síochána in this regard. I believe that the answer is to outsource the installation of Garda CCTV systems to the greatest extent possible, making use not only of the technical but also of the project management expertise in the private sector. I have asked the Commissioner to submit proposals for outsourced CCTV systems in the 11 locations in the remaining two phases, with a view to achieving implementation in priority locations by the end of 2006.As a first step in this process the Garda authorities engaged a consultancy firm to examine all aspects of Garda involvement in CCTV systems, including: the installation, operation and management of CCTV systems; monitoring, recording and related activities; accommodation and situation of facilities and staff regarding the town CCTV system and Garda station premises; and assessment of civilianisation of Garda CCTV monitoring conducted under the management of the Garda Síochána.The consultancy firm also examined which procurement model is the most suitable in terms of commercial viability and cost effectiveness for the provision of town centre CCTV systems. This consultancy process has recently concluded and the Garda authorities are now finalising their proposals in consultation with my Department.The inclusion of other town centre locations, including Arklow, beyond the 17 already listed in the programme of Garda CCTV systems will be considered in the context of the revised procurement model. The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible for the Garda Síochána to install CCTV systems in all areas that have sought them. To this end, I launched the community based CCTV scheme on 15 June 2005. This scheme has been developed in response to a demonstrated demand from local communities across Ireland for the provision of CCTV systems. The scheme is designed to provide financial assistance to qualifying local organisations, towards meeting the capital costs associated with the establishment of local community CCTV systems. The scheme is being administered on behalf of my Department by Area Development Management Limited, ADM.I am informed by ADM that while a total of 83 applications for funding under the community based CCTV scheme, 51 under stage one and 32 under stage two, were received by the closing date of 20 September 2005, no application for funding under either stage was received in respect of Arklow. It is anticipated that a further call for funding for community based CCTV systems will issue in early 2006.

If the circumstances change, the applicant may submit a new application.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	544	I have received a report from the Garda authorities on the matter raised by the Deputy. I am informed that records at the Garda communications centre, Harcourt Square, indicate that the first call relating to the location in question was made by 999 call at 19.46. This was from a female caller who reported a disturbance at the location and stated that a window had been broken. At the same time another call was received at the centre from a female caller with a foreign accent reporting a disturbance at the same location. She provided a contact mobile telephone number. This information was collated with the information already received. At 19.48 the original caller contacted the 999 service at the communications centre and stated that the disturbance had ceased, that the landlord had evicted the people concerned and not to send anyone to the location. As a result, the request for assistance was cancelled and no Garda unit was dispatched to the location.At 22.15 gardaí at the Bridewell Garda station were first made aware of criminal damage at the premises when a complainant called to the station and reported it. A patrol car was dispatched to the scene and, upon arrival, the gardaí noted damage to the glass on a number of apartment doors. The investigating gardaí have been in contact with the complainant and have requested additional information.I am informed that the incidents of criminal damage at the location are currently under active investigation by the gardaí.

He failed to attend for interview at the Office of Refugee Applications Commissioner as arranged on 5 January 2004, or to subsequently pursue his application. His application was, therefore, deemed withdrawn and was refused. He was notified of this refusal by way of letter dated 4 March 2004.In accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, he was informed that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him. He was given three options, first, to make representations to the Minister within 15 working days setting out the reasons he should not be deported, second, voluntarily leave the State or consent to the making of a deportation order against him. No response was received from him. The Minister went on to consider his case for deportation under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, prohibition of refoulement. A deportation order was signed in respect of him on 2 July 2004.He was requested to present himself to the Garda national immigration bureau on 11 November 2004 to make arrangements for his removal from the State. However, I understand that he came to the adverse attention of the Garda prior to this date and was detained pending his removal. He was returned to Moldova on 15 December 2004 on foot of the deportation order.The person concerned claimed asylum in the State as a single adult. The only mention of a spouse was on his asylum application form where he stated that she was residing in Moldova. The effect of a deportation order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain outside it thereafter.

This court appearance relates to criminal offences which he has been charged with. He is not serving a sentence at this time. The warrant detaining him was issued on 27 July 2005 and ordered that he be committed to Cloverhill Prison pending this further court appearance. He was subsequently transferred to the Central Mental Hospital for treatment, on a voluntary basis, later that day and he remains there to this time. The Garda authorities have advised that no further charges are pending against this person arising from the alleged incidents for which he is being detained.

His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. Subsequently, in accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, he was informed by letter, dated 30 August 2005, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him. He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before an order is made or consenting to the making of a deportation order. Representations have been received on behalf of the person concerned. This person's case file, including all representations submitted, will be considered under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, prohibition of refoulement. I expect the file to be passed to me for decision in due course.

Since the enactment of the legislation, my Department has been contacted by individuals and-or solicitors regarding various institutions not specified in the Schedule, including the facility mentioned by the Deputy. Following consideration of the matter and consultation with relevant public bodies, I signed an order on 9 November 2004 which provided for the inclusion of 13 additional institutions in the Schedule. A further order was made on 1 July 2005 adding three institutions to the Schedule. The question of including additional institutions has now been fully considered by my Department in consultation with relevant Departments and it is not proposed to add further institutions to the Schedule at this point.

An approved course for the purpose of the schemes means a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years duration and a full-time postgraduate course of not less than one year's duration pursued in an approved institution.Students from this State who are attending undergraduate courses in Northern Ireland can apply for maintenance grants in respect of approved courses generally at higher national diploma level or higher, which are pursued in colleges approved for the purpose of the schemes.There are no plans at present to change this position. Any extension of the scope of the grants scheme, can be considered only in the light of available resources and competing demands within the education sector.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	555	The staffing of this school for the 2005-06 school year was considered by the independent staffing appeal board on 14 June 2005. The board, having considered the appeal with regard to the criteria outlined in Department circular 19/02, was satisfied that a departure from the staffing schedule is not warranted in this case.It would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operations of the independent appeal board and accordingly, I am not in a position to facilitate a deputation on this matter.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	556	My Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students. These are the higher education grants, HEG scheme, the vocational education committees' VEC scholarships scheme, the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees and the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses. The HEG scheme is administered by the local authorities under the aegis of my Department. The other three schemes are administered by the vocational education committees.Generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment. An approved third level course for the purpose of the HEG and the VEC scholarship schemes means a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years' duration and a full-time postgraduate course of not less than one year' duration pursued in an approved institution. The schemes outline their respective courses which are approved for grant purposes.The decision on eligibility for third level grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has to date been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy.If an individual applicant considers that he or she has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by the relevant local authority or VEC and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may itself in exceptional circumstances seek clarification on issues from my Department.Under the terms of the third level student support schemes — clause 7.6 of the higher education grants scheme, maintenance grants are not payable to candidates who already hold an undergraduate degree and are pursuing a second undergraduate degree. Similarly, tuition fees are not papable in respect of a second period of college attendance at the same level.I understand that the student referred to by the Deputy already holds a degree. She is therefore ineligible for the higher education grant and is also unable to benefit under the free fees initiative in respect of her attendance at Mary Immaculate College. As the rules governing the schemes are of general application, exceptions cannot be made in individual instances. Tax relief, is however, available in respect of undergraduate fees paid in publicly funded colleges here and in other EU member states as well as in private colleges in the State. This relief applies at the standard rate of tax and is available to full-time students and part-time postgraduate students. Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from local tax offices.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	557	The process of assessing the need for new or additional educational facilities at primary or post-primary level in a given area entails consideration of all relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends, housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet the demand for places. Liaison with existing schools is an important part of the process also, as the school authorities would usually alert my Department where, in their view, the need for additional accommodation is anticipated. In that way, every effort is made to ensure that there is adequate existing provision, or that timely arrangements are made to extend capacity or provide new infrastructure where necessary.Over and above the statutory consultation provisions regarding local authority area development plans, my Department has in recent years worked to strengthen contacts with local authorities to enable informed decisions to be made in planning future educational provision. For example, a specific forum, the Dublin school planning committee, chaired by officials of my Department, interacts with the Dublin local authorities. That forum comprises representatives of the local authorities in Dublin together with representatives of the patron bodies of primary schools, and it works proactively in monitoring demographic changes and their likely impact. Outside that process, meetings with local authority planners are a regular feature of the school planning process.The criteria for prioritising large-scale building projects were revised last year following consultation with the education partners. Under the revised criteria, school projects in rapidly developing areas are assigned a band 1 rating, which is the highest priority possible. That is clear evidence of my Department's commitment to ensuring that the needs of rapidly developing areas are met as quickly as possible.The school planning section of my Department is also working proactively with some local authorities to explore the possibility of the development of school provision in tandem with the development of community facilities. That enhanced co-operation has the effect of minimising my Department's land requirements and thus reducing site costs, while at the same time providing local communities with new schools with enhanced facilities.In addition, under the provisions of the strategic development zones, or SDZs, it is generally the position that sites must be reserved for schools and that the schools must be developed commensurate with housing and other developments such as community facilities.My Department has recently adopted an area-based approach to school planning where, through a public consultation process involving all interested parties, a blueprint for schools' development in an area for a ten-year timeframe is set out. The areas covered in the pilot phase of that new approach to school planning include the rapidly developing areas of north Dublin, south Louth and east Meath and the N4-M4 route running from Leixlip to Kilbeggan and including all rapidly developing towns and villages on that route. Taken in combination, I believe that the measures outlined will improve the speed and effectiveness of the response to emerging needs in areas where they are developing significantly.With regard to the co-ordination referred to in the question, local authorities have no direct role to play in school provision, which is a matter for my Department. However education providers can use the statutory processes open to the public at large to make their views known regarding any specific planning issues.

The lease on that accommodation is for a five-year period, ending on 31 December 2006. The annual rental for the premises is €298,388. The school's contribution is capped at €3,175 per calendar year. The cost of architects' and consultants' fees relating to those premises was €94,623.A sum of €386,937 was also spent by my Department on refurbishment to bring them up to an acceptable standard. My Department has taken a decision that the costs involved in refurbishing the properties originally occupied by the school in question are excessive and, accordingly, it is not intended to pursue that option as a long-term accommodation solution for the school. That has been communicated to the trustees. In the circumstances, my Department is pursuing alternative accommodation solutions. A decision in this matter will be taken as soon as all the possibilities are identified and examined.My Department did not incur any costs in securing those buildings when they were vacated.

So far, my Department has approved an additional 1,466 places on post-leaving certificate, or PLC, courses in the 2005-06 academic year. Based on a ratio of 16:1, that would involve an additional 91 teaching posts.To date, based on requests from post-primary schools and vocational education committees, my Department has allocated approximately 56 extra teaching posts for PLC courses. The allocation is being reviewed in the light of the shortfall in the uptake of posts, and the remaining 44 posts announced will then be allocated. A breakdown of the allocation to individual schools will be compiled by my Department and forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it is available.

Decisions to place children in facilities outside the State have only been taken in exceptional circumstances and have usually arisen because of the specialised educational or health care needs of the children involved. In this regard my Department provides funding in respect of the placement of a small number of children abroad. However, the majority of the cases relate to children on the autistic spectrum for whom placements abroad were arranged prior to the formal introduction of dedicated school-based services for children with autism at the end of 1998.The Deputy is aware that the National Council for Special Education, NSCE, through its network of special educational needs organisers, SENOs, is responsible for the identification of appropriate educational settings for children with special needs. The SENOs are also responsible for liaising at local level with the health authorities to ensure that, in identifying appropriate educational settings for individual children, any care or health considerations are also taken into account.I hope that in putting in place appropriate educational provision for a child with special needs, and where the care or health needs of the child are such that a residential placement is a necessity, it will be possible in all cases to ensure appropriate provision either exists or can be established in this country. However, if, for whatever reason, appropriate provision is not available in this country, then the issue of locating a suitable placement abroad will be considered.

Discussions are taking place with the management authorities of a small number of schools with a view to establishing second level provision for groups of children with autism who are now coming to a transition stage and are about to move from primary to second level. Organising such provision is a significant task of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE.The NCSE was established as an independent statutory body with responsibilities as set out in the National Council for Special Education (Establishment) Order 2003. Since 1 January 2005, the NCSE through local special educational needs organisers, SENOs, is responsible for processing resource applications for children with special educational needs. Where a pupil with special educational needs enrols in a post-primary school, it is open to the school to apply to the local SENO for additional teaching support and-or special needs assistant support for the pupil.

Pupils not attending their nearest national school or school of amalgamation may, subject to conditions, avail of concessionary fare paying transport to another school, subject to spare seats being available on the bus and provided that no extra State cost is incurred by extending or re-routing the service.

The provision of housing is primarily a matter for the local authorities and married personnel have an equal claim on such housing as other members of the community in the same income category.Some 54 of those overholding married quarters at the time — 51 at the Curragh, two at McKee Park, Dublin 7 and one at Arbour Hill, Dublin 7 — were written to in August 2002 and requested to vacate the properties. In the Curragh, nine of the quarters have been vacated to date and three others have been purchased by the occupants. A further eight of the properties have been offered for sale and a number of those sales are likely to be finalised in the near future. The three properties in Dublin have also been offered for sale to the occupants. In addition, the sale to the occupants of ten quarters overheld at Cathal Brugha Barracks, Dublin, is under examination.My Department is continuing to examine all options, including affordable housing and voluntary and co-operative housing schemes, in relation to the re-housing of those overholders who would in the normal way be eligible for local authority housing.

A total of 116 activities were chosen representing participation by the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces and the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Activities consist of training courses, seminars, workshops, conferences, staff exercises and table top exercises.Defence Forces personnel have participated in a number of staff, technical and crisis management exercises in the context of both the EU and PfP. In accordance with stated policy, the Defence Forces do not participate in multinational military field exercises. Ireland also participates in the PfP planning and review process, known as PARP. In common with the other EU neutral states, Ireland is using the PARP process in connection with planning for humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping and crisis management, collectively known as the Petersberg Tasks. The scope of our involvement in PARP is focused on enhancing interoperability and familiarity with operating procedures in a multinational environment.Participation in partnership for peace activities is entirely voluntary and is based on the principle of self-differentiation, that is, a State selects for itself the nature and scope of its participation. It is Government policy to stay in the mainstream of peacekeeping. Ireland's participation in partnership for peace enables our peacekeepers to remain abreast of developments in areas such as training, interoperability and humanitarian aspects of peacekeeping. Participation enhances the ability of our peacekeepers to work with those of other countries and also enables us to share our own peacekeeping skills with a wide range of countries. We want to ensure that the Defence Forces have a full voice in preparations for peacekeeping missions, and we do not want to see Ireland absent, when matters in which we have a legitimate interest are being discussed.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	571	On 15 July 1998, the Government approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks considered surplus to military requirements. The barracks in question were located at Ballincollig, Fermoy, Castleblayney, Naas, Kildare and Islandbridge, Dublin.The sale of approximately 97 acres at Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, was completed in 2003 for a total of €42 million. The bulk of the lands were purchased by O'Flynn Construction. The sale of a site comprising circa 2.7 acres to the Southern Heath Board for €1.73 million was completed last December. It was agreed at the time that an area comprising approximately 27 acres at Murphy Barracks would be transferred to Cork County Council for community use and title to this area is currently being transferred to the council. A half acre site has been set aside on foot of a request from the Office of Public Works for a plot of ground to facilitate extension of the existing Garda station located on Main Street, Ballincollig, as has a site comprising circa 1.7 acres for the Department of Education and Science for a Gaelscoil. The combined value of those two sites is in the region of €2.5 million.Some 19.218 acres at the former Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, were sold to Cork County Council in 2001 for €973,889 for development in conjunction with the IDA. Castleblayney Military Post, County Monaghan, comprising circa ten acres, was sold to the North Eastern Health Board for €761,843 in 2002. Seven acres at Devoy Barracks, Naas, County Kildare, were ceded free of charge to Naas Urban District Council, while a further 14 acres were sold to that authority for €8,888,167. The balance of the barracks lands — one acre — was sold to Kildare County Council for €380,921 in 2002. Clancy Barracks, Islandbridge, Dublin, comprising approximately 13.65 acres was sold to Florence Properties Limited for €25.4 million in 2004.The Government decided on 1 July 2003 that Magee Barracks, Kildare, would be among the State lands released for inclusion in the Sustaining Progress affordable housing initiative. The intention is that this initiative will be targeted at those who in the past would have expected to purchase a house from their own resources but find that they are unable to do so in the current market. How land at this location might play a role in the delivery of affordable housing units is the subject of ongoing communication with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.The value of sales-disposals completed to date, in respect of the six barracks the subject of the July 1998 Government decision, is in the region of €80 million. The security, maintenance, consultancy and other costs in respect of those barracks identified for closure in 1998 are as follows:SecurityMaintenance and other costs€€Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig #1,120,604257,113*Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy #330,81342,633Castleblayney Military Post #131,28910,548Devoy Barracks, Naas #472,65416,959Magee Barracks, Kildare #123,29115,677Clancy Barracks, Dublin #649,441203,089# Now sold or no longer in the administration of my Department. No further costs will be incurred by the Department of Defence.* Includes costs relating to the preparation of an integrated area action plan.These costs were more than offset by savings on military security duty allowances and utility costs consequent on the closure of the six barracks. There are no plans to close any further barracks. The Department's property portfolio is, however, kept under continual review and any properties deemed surplus to military requirements will be disposed of to fund much needed investment, to meet the equipment and infrastructure needs of the Defence Forces.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	572	I propose to take Questions Nos. 159 and 161 together.The acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Forces continues to be a key focus for me as Minister for Defence. I am aware that significant investment has taken place in recent years and I will continue the good work in that regard.The unprecedented level of expenditure on equipment for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service was made possible by the Government's decision that pay savings arising from the reorganisation of the Defence Forces set out in the White Paper of 2000, along with proceeds from the sale of surplus properties, would be reallocated for investment in modern facilities and equipment.Investment in new equipment for the Defence Forces is provided for under various subheads of the Defence Vote relating to defensive equipment, mechanical transport, aircraft, ships and naval stores, engineering, communications and information technology equipment, etc. All elements of the Defence Forces, Army, Air Corps, Naval Service and the Reserve have benefited from the investment in new equipment.The equipment issued to the Defence Forces is in keeping with the most modern requirements and the highest international standards. The ongoing investment in the Defence Forces will ensure that this remains to be the case.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	573	In order to reach the requisite level of interoperability, and taking account of the short timeframes envisaged for the deployment of the EU's rapid reaction elements, it would seem to me that the various forces and elements comprising a battlegroup would need to be familiar with the equipment, standard operating procedures, organisation and operations of the group as a whole. However, that does not lead on to an inevitable conclusion that there is a requirement to undertake extensive overseas training. Indeed, Defence Forces personnel have for many years attended workshops, training courses, desktop exercises, seminars and other events overseas as part of their military training and I expect that they will continue to do this. The Defence Forces have also attended training courses and workshops under PfP PARP, the purpose of which is to learn from best practice in other defence forces and includes improving the level of interoperability between forces in the context of peace support operations and the Petersberg Tasks. Whether possible participation in battlegroups would change this situation remains to be seen.As the Deputy is aware, I have established an interdepartmental working group to examine all issues in relation to Ireland's potential participation in battlegroups. Among the issues to be examined in this regard will be the question of the need for overseas training and the issues which such training might give rise to, including the policy and legal issues. Pending the completion of the work of the group, I cannot say whether overseas training will be necessary, having regard to Ireland's possible contribution to a battlegroup.

While the Garda Síochána has the primary responsibility for law and order, one of the roles assigned to the Defence Forces is the provision of aid to the civil power, meaning, in practice, to assist the Garda Síochána when requested to do so. The various components of the Defence Forces are active in this regard, providing such assistance as is appropriate in specific circumstances.The Defence Forces make contingency plans for a range of scenarios where the State may be at risk. An urgent and detailed review to deal with a range of emergency situations was undertaken by the military authorities following the events of 11 September 2001. It included, inter alia, an update of the threat assessment, intensive contacts with other State agencies, a reassessment of operations orders relating to vital installations, alert systems, the Army ranger wing, ordnance and engineer aspects in terms of explosive ordnance disposal and specialist search, and a review of equipment including the need for air defence. All matters arising were addressed and all procedures updated as required.The Defence Forces have available to them equipment for monitoring and protecting their members in dealing with nuclear, biological or chemical, NBC, threats identified from time to time. They hold an extensive range of modern NBC equipment that meets their current requirements. This range includes approximately 7,000 NBC suits, 1,500 of which were delivered in 2004. A further 1,000 NBC suits have been ordered for delivery later this year and a further 1,000 suits will be delivered in 2006.The capacity of the Defence Forces to deal with major emergencies is kept under constant review. Plans and procedures are updated as necessary and such additional equipment as is required to address any perceived deficiencies is acquired on the basis of identified priorities. Training and preparation for such events is also provided for in the Defence Forces' annual training plan.The most important defence against any attack is of course vigilance, detection and prevention by the security forces. All the necessary resources of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces are deployed to this end.

The main commitments are to: the United Nations Mission in Liberia, UNMIL, with 413 personnel; the NATO-led international security presence, KFOR, in Kosovo, with 210 personnel; and EUFOR, the EU-led operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with 54 personnel. Other personnel are serving as monitors and observers with the United Nations, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the European Union. Staff are also deployed at the organisational headquarters of the OSCE, the UN, NATO and the EU.At present, Ireland subscribes to the United Nations Standby Arrangements System, UNSAS, under which the State offers to provide up to 850 personnel on overseas service at any given time. This is the maximum sustainable commitment that Ireland can make to overseas peacekeeping operations. It should be appreciated that at any one time one group of personnel will have just returned from service, one will be on overseas duty and a further group will be in training. There are no plans at this time to increase the level of our commitment to UNSAS.Ireland receives requests from time to time concerning participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis. Full details are as listed in the following tabular statement.

My Department has recently issued approval to the council to accept tenders for the refurbishment of rural houses in the Belmullet area.In order for my Department to determine an overall budget cost for this project the council has been requested to submit documentation on the proposed overall budget costs for formal approval. My Department has also requested the council to submit a schedule of proposed remedial works over the next three years at various locations throughout the county to enable the council and the Department to assess funding requirements over the period.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	578	The Ballina main drainage scheme is approved for construction in my Department's water services investment programme for 2004 to 2006. In July 2005, I approved Mayo County Council's tender recommendations in respect of upgrading the treatment plant and the expansion and improvement of the sewage collection system. It is now a matter for the council to make arrangements for the commencement of the works with the successful tenderers.A revised report, Water Services Pricing Policy (Polluter Pays), was received by my Department from the council earlier this month and is under examination. In common with all schemes funded under the water services investment programme, the objective is to identify the proportion of the capital cost of the Ballina scheme that should be met by the non-domestic sector in accordance with the polluter pays principle. The water services pricing policy report is being dealt with as quickly as possible and my Department will advise the council of the outcome of its examination shortly.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	581	As part of an overall response to Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions reduction target for the purposes of the Kyoto Protocol, the Government has signalled an intent to purchase carbon allowances up to a total of 18.5 million allowances over the protocol commitment period 2008-12, or 3.7 million per annum. The cost of these allowances would be met by the Exchequer and would depend on a number of factors, including the type of allowances purchased and the price at the time of purchase. A purchasing strategy is currently being developed by my Department in consultation with the Department of Finance. These arrangements will be published when the arrangements are finalised.Irish installations participating in the EU emissions trading scheme may opt to purchase carbon allowances in addition to or in lieu of reducing emissions. The cost of such purchases is a matter for the installations concerned.

As the Deputy is aware, the management of public water services infrastructure is a local authority function and, consequently, any issues affecting the operation of the Ringsend plant are matters for the Dublin City Council and the contractor the council has appointed to run the plant.I am nevertheless conscious of and concerned about the odour problems that have arisen in this case and of the adverse consequences for local residents. Earlier this year the council engaged independent consultants to undertake an extensive technical examination at the plant, to assess all processes and possible sources of odours. While the consultants' assessment is still being finalised, I understand that a programme of works proposed by the contractor who operates the plant in response to the key issues already identified by the consultants has begun and will continue into 2006. The question of publishing the consultants' completed report will be a matter for the council in due course.The council has indicated to my Department that it regards the implementation of a permanent solution to the odour problems from the Ringsend plant as a top priority. While the completion of the plant means that water in Dublin Bay is cleaner now than for many years and that Dollymount strand has been awarded a blue flag, I regard any significant odour impact from a treatment plant on local residents as unacceptable and something that must be resolved with the greatest urgency.

The company did, however, make a submission to my Department in the course of the review of the retail planning guidelines in so far as they relate to retail warehouse development.I am aware that the draft north Ballymun local area plan was put on display by Fingal County Council on 14 September. The closing date for comments and submissions is 26 October. Adoption of the local area plan will be a matter in due course for Fingal County Council and any proposed subsequent development would, of course, be subject to the statutory planning permission application process.Consultations between prospective developers and the public authorities in Ballymun in relation to any proposed development are a matter for the parties concerned and do not fall within my Department's remit. It is normal practice, particularly in the case of large-scale developments, for any person who intends to submit a planning application to enter into consultations on the proposed development with the planning authority and for the planning authority to give advice regarding the proposed application. Such consultations are formally provided for under section 247 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	584	Under the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, announced by the Government in July 2004, local authorities will, over a four-year period, progressively assume responsibility for accommodating supplementary welfare allowance or SWA rent supplement recipients of 18 months or more continuous duration with a long-term housing need.The RAS is a collaborative project between my Department, local authorities, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the community welfare service. All local authorities are due to implement the new arrangements during 2005. Roll-out commenced in an initial group of lead authorities, namely Dublin, Galway and Limerick city councils, South Dublin, Donegal, Offaly and Westmeath county councils and Drogheda Borough Council. Cork city and county councils and South Tipperary County Council are now implementing the RAS.The main actions to date have been to put in place the structures necessary to commence the project, identify and resolve issues arising and to engage resources needed to support implementation. Programme managers have been appointed initially to assist the lead authorities but thereafter to be available to support other authorities over the implementation period. Regional and local implementation groups in the lead authority areas have been established to ensure effective ongoing liaison and co-operation locally between housing authorities, health service executive areas and other welfare agencies. A number of seminars have been held in the lead authorities to inform accommodation providers of the new scheme and receive their views. Training seminars for local authority housing practitioners are to commence from November 2005.Work is ongoing in the lead authorities towards identifying persons on rent supplement in need of long-term housing support. Starting with persons who have been in receipt of rent supplement for 18 months or more, community welfare officers in health service executive areas are continuing to review cases which, subject to meeting eligibility criteria, are in the process of being transferred to the relevant housing authority for the purposes of establishing long-term housing need.Where a long term housing need is identified by the local authority, it will set about sourcing suitable accommodation for the household under the rental accommodation scheme as quickly as possible. The first transfers to the RAS occurred this month and the pilot local authorities are currently negotiating with accommodation providers in their areas. Pilot projects to secure long-term contracts for the supply of rented accommodation are also being advanced.Based on Department of Social and Family Affairs data, a table detailing the number of recipients in receipt of rent supplement by county on the 16 September 2005 is attached. The data is not available for each local authority area. As only rent supplement recipients of 18 months or more duration with a long term housing need are eligible to transfer to the RAS, not all current rent supplement recipients will be eligible for the RAS.CountyRecipientsCarlow879Cavan408Clare1,216Cork6,734Donegal2,087Dublin22,148Galway3,391Kerry1,771Kildare2,329Kilkenny786Laois359Leitrim186Limerick2,274Longford370Louth1,502Mayo1,771Meath636Monaghan325Offaly569Roscommon564Sligo476Tipperary1, 747Waterford1,726Westmeath872Wexford1,820Wicklow1,603Total58,549

Figures for 2004 are also available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie. New multi-annual action plans have been prepared by local authorities for the provision of social and affordable housing over the period 2004-2008. These plans, which have been approved by my Department, are designed to assist local authorities in identifying priority needs over the coming years to provide a coherent and co-ordinated response across all housing services.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	586	As indicated in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 1058 of 12 April 2005, the provision of appropriate heating systems is eligible for funding under both the disabled persons and essential repairs grant schemes. Decisions on the type and extent of work which may be grant aided in individual cases are matters for the local authority administering these schemes in their functional areas.My Department's circular letter HGS 4/01 of December 2001 makes it clear that local authorities may assist the provision of heating under the disabled persons grant scheme in a range of possible circumstances as follows: where central heating is already installed in an existing house, the cost of extending that system to any new accommodation provided would qualify for grant purposes; where an existing house has no central heating, electric storage heaters or other arrangements can serve the new accommodation, although it may occur that a central heating system is being installed in the whole house in conjunction with the provision of the additional accommodation for the disabled person — in such cases the cost of the heating system may be apportioned and the proportional amount for installing the heating in the accommodation for the disabled person may be covered by the grant; in the case of an application for a disabled persons grant solely in respect of the provision of a central heating system, authorities should exercise appropriate discretion taking into account the nature of the disability.The circular makes it clear that the payment of a grant in respect of such works should only occur in exceptional circumstances. It would be a matter for the local authority to determine the precise interpretation of the exceptional circumstances provision. In such cases it would be for authorities to determine the eligibility of each application on its merits and, where acceptable medical evidence supports the necessity for the provision of appropriate heating facilities, they may assist in the provision of such facilities in accordance with the terms of the disabled persons grant scheme in their area. In relation to the essential repairs grant scheme, the circular states that the statutory regulations do not specify what works qualify for grant and that it is a matter for the local authority to assess the circumstances of each individual case and decide what works are necessary to prolong the useful life of the house for the occupants.

The price at which the local authority intends to sell such sites to housing applicants is a matter to be determined by individual local authorities and the amount the subsidy to be recouped by the Department is subject to the Department's approval prior to the disposal of such sites.My Department has no proposals to change the conditions of the claw-back arrangements relating to this scheme. Under the scheme local authorities are providing housing applicants with sites at discounted values and therefore to avoid windfall gains accruing to the new owner by a sale within a short period after the acquisition of a subsidised site, the owner must repay a proportion of any profit from the sale of this site to the local authority. Where a site is sold within the first 20 years of occupancy the amount to be repaid is calculated using a formula which has been circulated to all local authorities. The amount payable is reduced by 10% per annum for each full year of occupancy between ten and 20 years. After 20 years no refund would be due to the local authority.

The study report has been submitted to, and is currently being examined by, my Department in light of its relevance to future strategic investment requirements under the water services investment programme. The study analyses the existing drainage system in the greater Dublin area and proposes policies, strategies and projects for developing the drainage system to meet the development needs and anticipated population growth of the area for the period to 2031.The selection of particular infrastructural schemes by my Department for inclusion in the water services investment programme is based on formal assessments of needs adopted by local authorities in which proposals are identified and prioritised by reference to a range of qualifying criteria. The recommendations in the greater Dublin strategic drainage study will inform this prioritisation process at local authority level and will be taken into account by my Department when specific proposals are put forward by individual authorities for funding under the water services investment programme. My Department's general observations on the study will be furnished to Dublin City Council within the next few weeks.

There are extensive enforcement powers available to a planning authority under Part VIII of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to require the works to be executed in conformity with the planning permission granted. In addition to requiring the provision of a wide range of facilities and services as a part of a permission, a planning authority may also enter into an agreement, as provided for in section 47 and Part XIV of the Planning and Development Act 2000, with a developer for the appropriate development of land. This agreement may then be enforced, as a civil matter, through the courts.
