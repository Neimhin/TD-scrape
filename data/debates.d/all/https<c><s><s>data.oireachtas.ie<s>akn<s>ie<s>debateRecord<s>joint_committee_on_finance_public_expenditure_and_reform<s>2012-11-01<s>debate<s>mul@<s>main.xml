          <p eId="para_19">They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. Before I invite Mr. Boucher to begin his presentation, is it agreed that the witnesses' presentation will be published? Agreed. That said, I thank Mr. Boucher, Mr. McLoughlin and Ms Carragher for their attendance this morning. I invite Mr. Boucher to make his opening statement.</p>

          <p eId="para_20">I thank members for the opportunity to update the joint committee on Bank of Ireland's progress since we last met.  I am accompanied by my colleagues, Liam McLoughlin and Lynda Carragher.  We have provided the joint committee with a presentation in advance, which hopefully provides a reasonably comprehensive picture of our position.  The bank is a public company that is subject to the listing rules of the Irish, London and New York stock exchanges.  The presentation is a public document and is presented under the rules of the aforementioned stock exchanges.  All comments I make are governed by the stock exchange disclosure rules.  As the Chairman has suggested we keep this relatively brief, if it is acceptable to members, I would like to go through the presentation relatively quickly.  Clearly, however, if I have skipped or have not paused for long enough on any particular part of it, I am sure that will come up in our questions and answers session.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">  I will turn to slide four of our presentation, which sets out, from Bank of Ireland's perspective, its strategic goals.  It is important to bear in mind that the bank raised a significant amount of capital in 2011.  Virtually all this equity capital came from the private sector and was provided by investors who believe that the Irish economy is recovering and that Bank of Ireland can support and benefit from that recovery.  The investors' investment case is that Bank of Ireland can become the pre-eminent bank in Ireland and they have provided the capital and endorsed the use of the bank's funding and infrastructure in support of this goal.  We in Bank of Ireland believe this is a time of both challenge and opportunity.  We believe that if we are the most focused bank, if we engage heavily with and work with our customers and if we derive new lines of business in our franchises, then we can establish ourselves as the pre-eminent bank in Ireland.  We are extremely well positioned in our core markets.  We have had agreed a European Union restructuring and viability plan and are the only Irish bank that has had such a plan agreed.  Under that plan, it is clear what businesses we have exited and what businesses we are in.  In accordance with the plan, those businesses that we are in, and in particular our Irish franchise, are those businesses to which we can devote capital and funding.  It clearly is one of our key goals to be strongly capitalised, thereby reducing our reliance on monetary authority and Government guarantees.  At 30 June 2012, our core tier 1 capital was 14%, which is a very strong capital ratio well in excess of any regulatory requirements.  Over the period since 2009, we have generated equity capital of €10 billion, of which approximately €1.5 billion net has come from the State.  We must ensure that, in the future, our businesses are sustainable and, in particular, sustainable from a funding proposition.  Over the past three years, we have worked very hard to grow our customer deposit franchises.  Our deposit franchise in Ireland has proved to be highly resilient and, in particular, we have grown a retail deposit franchise in the United Kingdom, primarily through our relationship with the United Kingdom's Post Office.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">  Over the past three years, we have continued to reduce our cost base and costs are down by approximately 20%.  The stock market is expecting our costs to be approximately €1.5 billion within the next couple of years and we believe this to be a sustainable target.  We are in the middle of a redundancy programme within our business and have taken a €66 million charge in the first half of the year, which we expect to have been utilised by the year-end.  At the same time, we are continuing to invest in our businesses because we wish to ensure we are here for the long haul and it is not just about cost-cutting.  Therefore, we are investing heavily in payment systems and in branch networks in Ireland and in other parts of our franchises.  From our perspective, the raising of capital, restructuring and deleveraging our balance sheets and reducing our costs will not achieve our goals unless we grow revenue.  It is extremely important that we grow revenue as we cannot cut or restructure our way to glory.  In simple terms, the way in which we grow our revenue is to sell more products to our existing customers and to get new customers.  This is a key focus in those core franchises we have decided we are in and which have been endorsed under our European Union plan.  The Irish taxpayer has taken a considerable risk in supporting Bank of Ireland and has provided investments to Bank of Ireland.  Clearly, as an investor, it is our absolute goal that we reduce the Irish taxpayer from any support provided to Bank of Ireland, we reward any taxpayers' investment in Bank of Ireland and, ultimately, we repay the investment in Bank of Ireland.  As a public company, my colleagues and I work for our stockholders and our job is to ensure we have a sustainable business into the long term with good sustainable returns for those who have provided us with capital.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">  As for the restructuring of the balance sheet shown on slide five, we have achieved our business sale targets.  We were required to sell €10 billion of loans and we have sold those well within the discounts assumed for the prudential capital assessment review, PCAR, 2011 exercise and well ahead of the schedule that was set therein.  A total of 50% of our assets are outside of Ireland and our deleveraging initiatives are all outside of our Irish businesses.  I have touched on our deposits franchises, which have remained very strong and resilient.  Based on both the deleveraging and the deposit, at 30 June our loan-to-deposit ratio, which is a key target, was 136% and based on developments since that period, our loan-to-deposit ratio will have reduced further.  As I mentioned, our capital ratios remain strong.  Our market positions in our Irish and United Kingdom franchises are strengthening.  In particular, in July 2012 we signed an extension of our very important franchise with the United Kingdom Post Office, which extends our contract with the Post Office beyond 2023.  A total of 21 million people per week visit a post office in the United Kingdom and we are the chosen financial services provider.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">  Turning to slide six, I mentioned that we continue to work on our cost programmes.  We have a redundancy charge, which we took in the first half of the year and, as I mentioned, I believe this charge will be fully utilised.  From the bank's perspective, the repayment period and payback on a redundancy charge of that note is approximately 11 months.  As I mentioned, we continue to invest strongly in our core franchise and in particular in payment systems.  The key task we have is rebuilding the profitability of the bank.  We believe we have made significant progress in capital raising, in deleveraging and in our cost initiatives but, ultimately, our route to profitability to repay taxpayers' investment and to provide a return to our other shareholders is through increasing the profitability of the bank and that is our focus in the future.  On slide seven, we explain in particular our balance sheet targets and as I have just advised, I believe we are well on the way to progress in that regard.  The rebuilding profitability targets are more influenced in particular by interest rates, economic growth and the self-help initiatives we are undertaking.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">  Slide eight demonstrates the pressure under which our income has been in the first half of the year and the initiatives we are taking as a bank to try to enhance our operating profits.  The most important focus for us is to reduce the cost of raw material.  The cost of raw material to the bank is influenced by the cost of wholesale funding, by deposit pay rates in the markets and in the Irish market in particular, as well as in the cost to us of the Government eligible liabilities guarantee, ELG, guarantee.  We are taking a number of initiatives to reduce that cost of raw material.  Slide nine shows the breakdown of our portfolios, both between the different business segments and on a geographic basis.  Approximately 54% of the group's balance sheet is in mortgages, of which approximately half are in the Republic of Ireland and half in the United Kingdom.  The rest of our business is spread between Ireland, the United States and the rest of the world.  It is likely, in accordance with our strategic plan, that the proportion of our balance sheet in Ireland will increase and the proportion of our balance sheet outside Ireland will reduce, which is in line with our deleveraging plans.  Slide 11 demonstrates the impact that low interest rates, which are not reflected in the cost of money to the bank, are having on our net interest margin.  Our net interest margin reduced from the second half of 2011 to the first half of 2012.  We are taking a range of initiatives to try to address this and to improve our net interest margin.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">We anticipate that that margin will gradually start to improve.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> Slide 12 deals with our costs, which I have already touched upon, but I am obviously happy to discuss that in more detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> Slide 13 looks at our provisions and impairment charges in the first half of 2012 compared to the first half of 2011. It demonstrates where the provisions are taken between our different loan books. We provide significant further detail in our interim accounts. Based on the trajectory of what we anticipate and if the economic environment, both in Ireland and the UK, continues at its current pace, we believe our loan loss charges will reduce further in the second half of 2012. Key influences on our loan loss charges are commercial real estate in the Republic of Ireland and our Irish mortgages. As regards the Bank of Ireland commercial real estate book, we have estimated for our provisions a peak-to-trough fall in commercial real estate prices in Ireland of 65%. We see evidence of the market stabilising at that level. </p>
          <p eId="para_29"> At the interim results announcement in August, I advised the market that from Bank of Ireland's perspective the pace of increase in the formation of arrears in our Irish mortgage book was reducing and that continues to be the case. </p>
          <p eId="para_30"> Our assumptions for our loan loss provisions are based on a peak-to-trough fall in house prices in Ireland of 55% and then another 10% on top of that for sale costs, etc. From our perception, the market appears to be stabilising at current levels. Obviously the market is a mix of a number of different micro-markets, but our experience in the main urban areas - both in terms of our own existing book and the flow of new business - is that house prices seem to be stabilising at current levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> Slide 15 demonstrates the mix of our deposits, in particular between Ireland and the UK. The rationale is that we can fund our UK business through retail deposits and therefore it is a sustainable business going forward. Our deposit target of €75 billion to €80 billion by December 2014, based on our experience in the period up to 30 June and since, looks eminently achievable.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> I will now turn to slides 17 to 20, which deal with the two aspects of our business upon which there was a particular focus in the committee's invitation. We have tried to demonstrate in pictorial form how we see our different tasks and initiatives. One of our most important tasks is continuing to provide new mortgages in the market. That is because it is a sustainable part of our business going forward. We strongly believe in Ireland and that the Irish economy will recover. We were provided with capital liquidity by our investors to support that recovery and to benefit from it.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> In the first half of 2012, mortgage demand remained relatively muted in the economy. We did about 40% of the flow of business in that economy and we have been heavily advertising our products and services. In the period since, we have seen a noted pick-up in mortgage demand and activity in September and October. We have come out with a wide range of new products and services, both for existing customers and to deal with customers who are facing financial challenges. We have a significant number of staff involved in working on short-term and long-term solutions for customers. We have more than 16,000 customers who are currently subject to mortgage forbearance or who have had their mortgages restructured. Our mortgage forbearance and mortgage restructures are based on customers who can meet, in our estimation and theirs, at least the full interest on their mortgages. Some 86% of those customers who are subject to forbearance or restructuring are fully meeting the revised arrangements. While it is early days yet, we believe that our restructuring approach is benefiting a significant number of our customers, which is evidenced by the low level of re-default. </p>
          <p eId="para_34"> We could probably spend a little more time on the SME sector. A key part of our future business strategy is to be the pre-eminent bank in Ireland. We are currently number two in business banking in Ireland, and it is our goal to be the number one bank. A particular focus we have is on the SME sector, where we are number two. We have a wide range and are a universal bank. We have a distribution system in every part of Ireland, primarily through our branch network, which tries to reach out to our customers. We have an internal target, which is also a target agreed with the Government, that we will provide €3.5 billion of new lending to the SME sector. From a Bank of Ireland perspective, we measure this target on the basis of new and increased lending. From our perspective, new and increased lending is what derives revenue, and that is why it has our focus.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> We obviously have a number of customers in the SME sector who face different challenges and we are working closely with them to help them restructure their businesses and look at their propositions going forward. From our perspective in Bank of Ireland, we have a risk appetite in every sector because we believe that in every sector good business people can make money and can develop good businesses. We are not closed to lending in any particular sector. We have identified certain sectors which we feel have higher growth potential and we are devoting more resources to product innovation in those areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> In slide 26, we try to demonstrate both for the market and for the committee where the different divisions are in the second half of 2012. We have tried to point out that certain of our divisions have moved more quickly towards profitably. Our Irish division continues to require the most work and therefore the contribution of our overseas and corporate divisions in rebuilding profitability for the group as a whole, as we restructure our Irish division, is extremely important.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> I will now move to slide 27. As investors and representatives of the taxpayer, we try to demonstrate what the taxpayer is getting out of its support for Bank of Ireland. Our first task is to reduce the risk to the taxpayer from support provided by the taxpayer. We believe that the capital we have raised, the restructuring and deleveraging, the cost-reduction programmes we have undertaken, the agreement of our EU viability and restructuring plans, and the enhancement of our franchises - including the franchise in the UK, further protected by an extension to post office contract - have been a very important part of reducing the risk to the taxpayer. The most significant contingent liability the taxpayer has is in respect of the eligible liabilities guarantee or ELG. Through a range of initiatives, particularly deleveraging and increasing our deposit franchises, we have reduced the liabilities under the ELG from €136 billion at their peak in September 2008 to €36 billion at the end of June. They will have reduced further since that date. Bank of Ireland notes that the ELG is due to expire on 31 December and we are prepared for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> The State invested €4.8 billion in cash in Bank of Ireland in the period up to 30 June 2012, and Bank of Ireland returned €2.5 billion in cash to the State in that period. The State's current investment in Bank of Ireland is a 15% shareholding, preference shares of €1.8 billion which bear a coupon of 10.25% per annum, and a contingent capital instrument which is not part of our core tier one, which bears a coupon of €1 billion per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> In summary, we are making progress against the priorities we have set for ourselves and that we have shared with our investors. It is a very challenging environment, but one that we believe creates opportunities for us. We will continue to build our businesses in Ireland and invest in our Irish franchises. As regards our progress on deleveraging our balance sheet, it is self-evident that deleveraging is outside Ireland and outside our core franchises. We will continue to reduce our reliance on the ELG and we are actively reducing the cost of money to us. We have significant enhancements of some of our key franchises and our capital remains robust. We are on track to achieve our goal of becoming the pre-eminent bank in Ireland. The most important thing we can do in Bank of Ireland is to have a strong focus on all of the objectives that are under our own control and that we can influence. That is our target going forward.</p>

          <p eId="para_46">I apologise for the absence of my party colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, this morning.  I thank the delegation for attending this meeting as I believe an important public service is being provided by the committee, particularly with the live broadcast on television.  Many citizens watching this meeting believe it is important to hear the answers from the banks because they have had significant support from the State and its citizens.  The people feel they should be the boss.  We, their representatives, are asking the questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_47">  One issue not dealt with in Mr. Richard Boucher’s presentation on revenue growth was standard variable rate, SVR, mortgages.  Is that part of the bank’s strategy in revenue growth, on top of selling new products and getting new customers?  Yesterday, AIB gave a fairly stark outline of where it sees SVRs going in the short and medium term.  What is Bank of Ireland’s assessment of this?</p>
          <p eId="para_48">  Bank of Ireland’s mortgage resolution options seem to be mainly concerned with moving people out of their houses.  In its submission, the terms “assisted sales”, “voluntary sales” and “trade down” are used.  Surely, we should be trying to keep people in their homes.  There are other options open to the bank such as the shared equity scheme.  Has it considered this as a way of keeping people in their homes?  I do not see any mention of a deferred interest initiative which was a recommendation of the Cooney report, commissioned by the previous Government.  How many mortgage-to-rent arrangements has the bank undertaken?  That has been flagged as a major answer to mortgage difficulties but it does not seem to be happening.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_9">
          <from> Mr. Richie Boucher<recordedTime time="2012-11-01T12:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_49">Our SVR is designed to be competitive in the marketplace.  It is our desire to continue to grow our business.  To do so, we need to cover the capital we deploy, potential loan losses as well as costs and overheads.  Our current rate is competitive as evidenced by the flow of business we are getting.  Our rate is not the only criterion but also the terms and conditions of our mortgages.  Our products are designed as such that they are commercially sensible for the bank but also help in growing a long-term franchise.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">  I cannot predict where mortgage rates will move.  The primary driver of mortgage rates in our case is the cost of the raw materials – money – to us.  We also try to provide different ranges of products to customers including fixed-rate products which allow people to protect themselves from further interest rate rises.</p>

          <p eId="para_52">We have no plans to do so but I cannot rule it out in the future.  It is determined by the cost of the raw materials - money - to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">  I would be very disappointed if we gave the impression that our primary focus in restructuring mortgages is to move customers out of their homes.  Our primary focus is to maintain them in their homes as it is in their interest and commercially sensible for us.  The mortgage solutions we provide to our customers are primarily designed to maintain them in their homes.  In particular, we look at the level of sustainability of the debt.  We have invested much time, effort and money in getting external advice to look at solutions which are commercially sensible for us and our customers.  The evidence of our focus on keeping people in their homes is the 16,000 mortgages we have restructured and modified, of which 86% are meeting the full terms of their revised arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">  We continue to look at a range of other solutions available to us.  We are required by the Central Bank to have a long process of engagement and go through various phases of pilots.  We have piloted several solutions.  Based on our evidence, what we believe can work for our customers and what is commercially sensible, we will be rolling out several of these schemes over the next several months.</p>

          <p eId="para_58">A split-interest mortgage provides a moratorium on capital repayments.  From our perspective, a restructured and modified mortgage can only be done on the basis the customer is able to meet the full interest payments.  The majority of our customers who have arrears or difficulties can have their mortgages restructured.  A significant issue we face in working with our customers to restructure their mortgages is the extent of unsecured debt outside of the mortgage that was provided by the bank or others.  Bank of Ireland’s primary focus is on the mortgage repayments.</p>

          <p eId="para_78">I will push Mr. Boucher a little further on the mortgage-to-rent programme.  A reply to a recent parliamentary question I tabled shows that only one mortgage-to-rent application has made it completely over the line and the indication is that it was done by a sub-prime lender, neither by AIB nor Bank of Ireland.  It would be an observation that maybe the sub-prime lenders are more realistic about current house values than the two pillar banks.  Has a difficulty for Bank of Ireland in the mortgage-to-rent scheme been, because a price must be arrived at with the housing agency, whether the local authority or one of the voluntary agencies such as Clúid agrees the valuation of those properties?</p>

          <p eId="para_80">Only one financial institution has completed a mortgage-to-rent application and it is a sub-prime lender.  From outside observation, this would seem strange because the sub-prime lenders are very much the pariahs of the sector.  They seem to have a more realistic view of the property values.  Mortgage-to-rent is critically about realising the true value of the property because it must be converted from a mortgage and sold to a housing agency, with the tenant who was previously the resident remaining in the property.  Key to that is realising the real value of the property.  Is Bank of Ireland struggling with that?  Is Mr. Boucher of the view that property prices in the residential sector are approaching what might be considered normalisation, they are not undervalued and they are at their real value?</p>

From a market point of view, it is important that we disclose to the market the assumptions we have made.  The assumptions we have made is a peak-to-trough in Irish house prices-----</p>

          <p eId="para_82">There are no assumptions.  The price of an average house in this country is based upon the average wage by a certain multiplication.  Since 2009, the Central Bank has given direct guidelines to Bank of Ireland and other banks as to what are lending practices.  If one takes the average house in the country, applies the average industrial wage and multiplies that by three or four because one must allow for an LTV of 90%, my observation would be that we are at proper house price values, not at an undervalued market.</p>

          <p eId="para_83">I beg the Chairman's pardon.  I should have made it clearer in my opening remarks that we believe that house prices are stabilising.  Our assumption was at 55% plus 10% in the event of a realisation.  We believe that as a realistic assumption.  It is not a homogeneous market.  There are a number of different micro-markets.  There are different prices.  We believe that prices in particular urban areas have stabilised.  In some rural locations, it is more difficult.  Price discovery is difficult.  One of our issues, because of the low level of transactions in the market, is ascertaining an appropriate price discovery.  It is important that we take a realistic view.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">  Working with customers who are builders or developers, or in terms of repossessions, Bank of Ireland has been involved in the sale of more than 1,000 houses in this market and we are informing ourselves on those views.  We look not only at what house prices are stabilising at, but at the rental markets.  We have a buy-to-let book.  We obviously keep a close eye on rentals in the buy-to-let book, and we see that rental levels are stabilising.  Those are all indicators to us that they are stabilising, but I would concur with the view that in certain rural locations it is very difficult to get a market-clearing price because there is not enough liquidity.  We try constantly to take a realistic view of the value of our collateral.</p>
          <p eId="para_85">  What I try to say in the assumptions is important.  We cannot absolutely predict at a future point in time where we go.  It is important that we try to demonstrate to our investors, and for anyone interested in our stock, or as creditors, what are our assumptions underlying our provision and forecasting.</p>

          <p eId="para_99">  On the small and medium-sized enterprises, I am not sure we got to the bottom of this at all yesterday.  I note Mr. Boucher's presentation states that Bank of Ireland is targeting to approve €3.5 billion in lending in 2012.  I suppose my first observation is the absence of the words "new lending".  As I understand it from yesterday, some of Bank of Ireland's competitors are including in the €3.5 billion target set by Government reapplications for overdrafts and for other facilities.  What percentage of the €3.5 billion is new lending to SMEs, farmers and new businesses?</p>

          <from> Mr. Richie Boucher<recordedTime time="2012-11-01T12:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_100">The €3.5 billion is new and increased lending to customers within a statistical margin of error, which, from our perspective, is 3%.  I am confident that at least 97% of the €3.5 billion will be new or increased lending to existing or new customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_101">  The lending will depend on the utilisation of the customers.  For example, if we approve term loans to customers likely to draw it down, an overdraft, an invoice discounting facility or a revolving credit line, it will depend on utilisation.  Our experience heretofore is that overall utilisation of new lending approvals is approximately 50%.  When it comes to overdrafts, the utilisation is lower.  Overdrafts utilisation, in our experience in the year to day, is approximately 42% or 43%.</p>
          <p eId="para_102">  Our goal is to generate revenue, and restructures, etc., do not generate revenue.</p>
          <p eId="para_103">The €3.5 billion figure is a target that Bank of Ireland has agreed and we welcome it because we have a target for growing our business. We are not in the business of shuffling numbers to make them look good. Ultimately, we are provided with capital and liquidity to grow our business. The target is €3.5 billion and from our perspective it is new and increased in so far as we can be statistically accurate.</p>

          <p eId="para_107">That will depend on, for example, the customers who are repaying debts.  A significant number of our customers who have cash are paying down loans rather than reinvesting in their businesses.  We are making provisions and, therefore, we write off certain of our loans.  The stock may or may not increase.   It is our ultimate goal to increase the stock of lending because this is what drives revenue from our perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">  The most significant element of our new or increased lending is to existing customers for different purposes.  Some of it involves other banks refinancing with us, including in particular customers of banks which are exiting this country.  That is included in our figures.  A customer who comes to us to refinance a loan from Bank of Scotland, for example, is included in our figures because this is a new or increased loan from Bank of Ireland’s perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">  Loan demand varies across sectors and segments but the primary demand is for working capital.  We have limited demand from customers for finance for mergers, acquisitions or new investment in property or equipment.</p>

          <p eId="para_110">Mr. Boucher stated that 84% of credit applications are being approved.  I do not want to compare but AIB’s rate was 90%.  I am not sure that many of the 15 or 16 politicians in this room would disagree that the people who come to us continue to find it extremely difficult to access credit, particularly in the SME sector.  Can Mr. Boucher indicate how many applications are not formal?  Bank of Ireland is approving 84% of loans for those who have completed the credit application forms and have been fully vetted by branch managers or relationship managers.  These applications go up the line in a protected fashion because they have been thoroughly vetted.  What percentage of loans never reach the point of formal application?</p>

          <p eId="para_111">We are trying to generate new business.  My colleagues who are involved in this area break our SME teams into new business generation and more challenged loans.  Each of my colleagues has targets for generating new business.  Much of this work involves going to their local communities to meet with accountants, lawyers or directly with customers to generate business.  That may result in an inquiry which we can follow up.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">  It was suggested at our last meeting with this committee that we might keep track of inquiries that do not follow through.  We are pursuing that suggestion and my colleagues have targets to meet in respect of such inquiries.  However, it is difficult to provide a level of statistical accuracy as to what is an informal inquiry.  Based on my personal experience and observations, successful business people are relatively persistent because they believe in themselves and the future of their businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">  We are not playing with numbers.  Our strategy is to grow our business and our revenues.  We want to generate as much business as we can.  We recognise that in a significant number of the applications we handle every week we will be making decisions on the margins.  I know that some of the customers to whom we decide to advance money will have subsequent difficulties repaying their debts.  I also know that we will decline some of the customers who could have repaid us.  This is not an exact science.  We are trying to generate revenue on an ongoing basis.  Where our colleagues in the business generation side see that an application they have recommended has been declined, they have a right of appeal through a separate appeals process.  We do not make money by saying “No”.</p>

          <p eId="para_119">We are currently at €98 billion.  Further deleveraging will primarily come from running down books we have outside Ireland.  The most significant of these is the UK mortgage book.  Approximately €18 billion of those mortgages are within the UK subsidiary and a further €12 billion are outside of it.  These are naturally running down.  We are also running down certain corporate and business banking portfolios outside Ireland.  Our deleveraging is all based on an ex-Ireland strategy.  It is easier for us to pursue such a strategy because the markets are more liquid, customers have different refinancing options and we have proved that we are able to sell loans in those markets.  Based on the analysis of redemptions and repayments in the two years to date, we believe the target is realistic.</p>

          <p eId="para_138">This is completely at odds with what one of the Central Bank officials said publicly about Bank of Ireland and other banks, that they are dragging their heels on the matter.  What I am hearing from Mr. Boucher is that he is blaming the Central Bank for the delay and that the bank would like to process more of these if it were allowed.  It is pathetic that there have been only 13 applications in 12 months.  Is the Central Bank restricting the bank from proposing more of its accounts to go down this line?</p>

This is not a blame game between various parties.  Our focus is on Bank of Ireland.  There are a number of comments, which are about the sector as a whole.  Our focus is on Bank of Ireland.  My job and that of my colleagues is to do what Bank of Ireland can do.</p>

          <p eId="para_140">I understand, but my focus in this specific question is on why there are only 13 proposals in this scheme after one year given the enormity of the mortgage crisis.  It is important for us to understand why, 12 months on, the bank has only proposed 13 accounts to use this scheme as an option.</p>

          <p eId="para_141">This is one of a range of solutions.  Our prioritisation is to restructure and modify those mortgages that can be done more quickly.  As in any of these situations we must try to make decisions on the best way we can prioritise our resources.  As we make progress, in particular at moving more quickly through our system mortgages that can be readily and quickly modified and restructured, then we can spend more time on those that are much more complex, and in particular where there is engagement with third parties.  The buy-to-rent scheme, for example, does involve a third party in terms of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  There are certain things that are in our control.  I am not seeking to apportion blame.  The primary responsibility for managing our mortgage book, managing arrears and dealing with our customers is with Bank of Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_142">I will leave it there, but it is quite unsatisfactory.  Most people on this committee simply want this issue resolved.

Is he satisfied the bank will be able to raise money on the markets without a guarantee?  Is that the proposal regardless of whether the guarantee is extended?  Is it the objective of the bank in 2013 to be able to raise finances without the guarantee?  That obviously would have an impact on the State because last year the bank provided more than €449 million to the State as a result of the guarantee.  What is the proposal from the bank?  Is it to go without in 2013?</p>

          <p eId="para_163">That has been our experience.  We can do it.  We came off the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme.  The most contentious and best example is our business in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, where we are not covered by a guarantee, yet our deposits have increased.  Bank of Ireland is raising unguaranteed deposits where permitted to do so.  That is our current plan.</p>

          <p eId="para_164">I will try to be as brief as possible.  Bank of Ireland has made provisions in respect of the expectations for 2013.  Last year, the fees paid to the State amounted to €449 million.  To June of this year, it was €220 million.  Does Mr. Boucher expect the fees to be substantially reduced or down to zero by 2013?</p>

          <p eId="para_165">I am not permitted to give that figure.  Our preparations are on the basis of the ELG expiring as intended.  We expect Bank of Ireland will be able to do that.  We are preparing to meet our funding strategies.  I have chosen my words carefully as regards our goals.  Our current estimates of deposits of €75 billion to €80 billion in 2014 are realistic.  They presume that the ELG has expired.</p>

When one telephones a local branch in Scariff, Miltown Malbay or so on, one gets through to a central call centre and it is not possible to speak to the branch staff with whom one has built up a relationship.  The bank has maintained the ability to telephone the branch in the Law Library, but ordinary people in counties Clare, Kerry and Donegal are unable to telephone their local branches.  Does this demonstrate an ability to interact with staff?  As people now realise, banking is about relationships.  Does Mr. McLoughlin accept that part of the reason Bank of Ireland did not lose as much as other banks was that it maintained a more traditional practice of building relationships with customers?  If so, why is it seeking to make interacting with branch staff more difficult?</p>

          <p eId="para_190">The background to the change in contact centres has been driven by the fact that most branch staff are engaging in face-to-face contact and, therefore, are not in a position to be able to pick up telephones to deal with other customers directly.  The general sense we have from our feedback is that it is better to have the ability to speak to customers when they want.  For this reason, we use contact centres, predominantly in Kilkenny, to support our engagement with customers there and then.</p>

The contact centres give us the ability to deal with the customer there and then.  Through these centres, we also provide customers the opportunity to have a message sent to their branches to deal with their calls at a later time.  We are conscious of customers' requirements.  It is not a case of locking out the customer, but of trying to deal with inquiries at the time they are made.</p>

My experience has been the exact opposite.  Whenever I telephoned a branch, someone picked up and helped with my query.  As recently as yesterday, I spent 20 minutes on hold trying to get through to one of the bank's call centres.  Is this acceptable?  If Bank of Ireland hopes to grow its business through increasing its customer base and the services provided to same, will it achieve this aim by call centres putting customers on hold for 20 minutes?  They cannot contact their branches.</p>

My understanding is that Bank of Ireland has been wholly unco-operative in that regard.  Does Mr. Boucher not think that if it was sold at its current market value, even if that is slightly depressed, it would provide an opportunity for the bank to mark the State's support for it by giving that building to the State as a cultural amenity or centre?</p>

          <p eId="para_241">For owner-occupier mortgages, at the end of June - the numbers will have changed since then - there were 4,386 such cases.  Where there was a reduced payment but still more than interest-only, where amortisation of the principal had changed, there were 1,950 cases.  In 2,267 cases, the mortgage term had been extended.  There were 216 various other solutions, as I tried to outline to Deputy Doherty.  Those figures are for those who are not in arrears.  For those in arrears, the figures are 2,579 on interest-only, 428 making a reduced payment, 176 term extensions and 120 other arrangements.  The total for owner occupiers, both not in default and in default, is 6,965 on interest-only, with 2,378 making reduced payments, 2,443 term extensions and 336 other arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">  Based on the available information, the quantum that have moved from interest-only to other sorts of solution will have increased as a proportion of that number.</p>

          <p eId="para_243">From the point of view of the customer, these arrangements are quite depressing.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">  What prospects are there for those who, having lived with the stress from the difficulty of sustaining a mortgage, now face a situation in which they are shackled to the bank and just paying interest?  Term extensions also lead to extra burdens of interest.  We put this question yesterday to the other bankers and Mr. Boucher's counterpart in AIB had the nerve to give us a lecture on moral hazard as it pertains to owner occupiers, those people who are stuck with exorbitant and extortionate mortgages as a result of blatant speculation in building land and house prices.  Why will the bank not consider a write-down for owner occupiers to the real value of their homes and a recalibration of mortgages on a monthly basis to the equivalent amount?  That would remove massive amounts of stress from those who are trapped in this nightmare and release badly needed funds into the domestic economy, shops and services, which would help to regenerate the gutted domestic economy with all the downsides of mass unemployment.  Has Mr. Boucher thought about this or discussed it within Bank of Ireland or with the other banks?</p>

          <p eId="para_245">We review all options available to us on an ongoing basis regarding all of our loan books, including our mortgage book.  The vast majority of our customers are paying their mortgages so we have a responsibility to those customers and to all of the stakeholders in the bank, including our creditors, depositors and share holders.  Our goal is to keep as many people in their homes for as long as we can.  We set out for the customers what we can and cannot do for them.  In the vast majority of cases, 86%, where customers have had mortgages restructured or modified, they are able to meet those terms.  That is what we are doing in Bank of Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_246">The 86% are probably relieved but some of those mortgages have 35- or 40-year terms as a result of the outrageous blackmail in the property market during the bubble.  Has Bank of Ireland considered the idea of revaluation so that homes are valued according to their real value and not the outrageous speculative and immoral values that were gouged from the younger generation who had to purchase homes at the time?</p>

          <p eId="para_248">In the last four years, prices have only gone one way.  It would not take a financial genius to put in place a structure whereby, if there was a sudden massive spike, it could be taken into account.  Is there any merit in the arguments that some of us on the left have made about a general write-down rather than this individual tortuous process for owner-occupiers who face negative equity and unsustainable monthly payments?</p>

          <p eId="para_293">At the capitalisation in July 2011, the amount of money that came in recapitalisation from the markets was a little over €1 billion - from Wilbur Ross, Fairfax, Kennedy Partners and so on and the State invested approximately €1.5 billion.  The fact is the bank is still hugely overdependent on capitalisation.  Its loan to deposit ratio is approximately 136% and its financial engineering is still very fragile, even after that capitalisation.  The asset side of the balance sheet shows that 73% of the balance sheet loan assets are in mortgages, property and construction related loans.  This goes against a bank tradition ten years previously which was completely different.  Why was there not a more open, transparent and honest discussion with the Government pointing out that until the rehabilitation and restructuring of the bank took place - for the sake of the bank and its viability rather than for shareholders - capitalisation should have been by way of creditor capitalisation rather than by bringing in a 35% shareholder which is now the dominant shareholder in the bank?  The amount outstanding on the market is 50%, the amount held by the State is 15% and the amount held by this consortium of investors is 35%.  Therefore, it is a schizophrenic organisation.</p>

          <p eId="para_294">I would like to mention a couple of things.  Circa €5 billion of equity capital has been generated from liability management exercises with bondholders.  In the capital exercise we did in 2011, circa €2 billion came from liability management exercise, circa €1.9 billion came from a rights issue with existing shareholders or participation of new shareholders, including a consortium which came together for a particular purpose, and circa €300 million came from the State.  Therefore, liability management exercises have contributed a significant amount to the recapitalisation of the bank.  By their nature, liability management exercises are bonds being bought in at a discount on their face value, which means the bondholders have taken a loss or have switched from a bond into equity in the bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">  The €1.9 billion raised from the bondholders in 2011 primarily came from 95% of bondholders in the first liability management exercise, who went for an equity option.  Therefore, they ended up with a significant stake.  My information is that many of those bondholders subsequently sold out of their shares and these have been taken up by other market participants.</p>

          <p eId="para_296">That is not near enough, because the bank's balance sheet is still highly vulnerable.  The bank has €7 billion in provisions against a loan book of €80 billion - about 8.7%.  Considering this is all in mortgages and property and construction related lending, that is probably very light provision.</p>

          <p eId="para_298">Personally speaking, those ratios are not a straightforward and robust way of looking at things.   We should look at the maturity of the assets and at how easily they may be collected on.  As mentioned, many of them are 35-year assets.  The likelihood is that the borrowers are not in a position, based on their current, prospective and sustainable earnings, to repay their loans, whether businesses or individuals.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">  I would like to draw attention to the tracker element of loans.  The mortgage book involves loans of a total of €27 billion.  Domestic tracker loans make up 57%, €20.5 billion, and investment trackers make up 81% of a total of €6.7 billion.  Tracker loans are very expensive for the bank to carry.  Yesterday, we discussed the point that if average interest rates, at 4% on the standard variable and non-tracker loans, rose to 6%, that would be a 50% increase, but borrowers are only barely hanging in as matters stand - after restructuring, continuing on interest only loans, stretching out the loan or other strategies or non-appropriate restructuring.  This means the bank is in a perilous position on €27 billion worth of loans.  It is not impressive.</p>

          <p eId="para_340">Bank of Ireland is claiming success because it has restructured quite a lot of mortgages.  However, as Deputy Higgins has pointed out, a lot of those people are in pretty miserable circumstances, even though they may just be able to manage the restructuring arrangement the bank has agreed with them.  The bank has the whip hand, let us be honest.  However, it is not a very good situation and it means that such people are trapped in a pretty awful debt situation for a very long time to come.  In addition, if I understand correctly, there are approximately 16,000 restructured mortgages and all of those people would not be in restructured arrangements were they not in some difficulty.  Most of that difficulty arose from the bubble period and the consequences of the property crash.  In addition, approximately 9.22% of the bank's overall mortgage book is in arrears and that figure is rising, year on year.  It has risen from 5.89% in June 2011 to 9.22% this year, which is a very dramatic increase.</p>

A significant proportion, 75%, of our customers with tracker rates believe the ECB rate will increase in the next five years.  The majority of customers, 84%, are concerned about the resulting increase in mortgage repayments.  If, like these customers, you have concerns about increasing mortgage repayments we may have options that can afford you more certainty of repayments at affordable rates, giving you the benefits your current low rate but without the risk of increases over the next five years.</p>

If someone enters into a debt settlement arrangement on secured debt, particularly in respect of a house, and if an agreement can be arrived at by the bank, the personal insolvency professional and the borrower or borrowers, at the end of the debt settlement period - under the proposed legislation this will be up to six years - is it the bank's understanding that the borrower or borrowers could keep the house?  Is it also its understanding that, as part of a debt settlement arrangement, an amount of debt could be surrendered by the bank to the borrower or borrowers?</p>

The document with which we have been supplied indicates that the underlying loss between December 2011 and June 2012 increased from €722 million to €907 million, a rise of 24%.  Therefore, the most recent figures supplied to the committee indicate that the position on the investment the taxpayer made - involuntarily - in September 2008 has depreciated by 24%.  The document also indicates that impairment charges rose from €901 million in the first half of 2011 to €978 million in the same period in 2012.  This is despite the fact that on page 8 of the document a statement is made to the effect that "Impairment charges below the level incurred in H2 2011 but remain elevated", whereas, in fact, they increased.  A similar statement is made on page 13, namely, "Impairment charges remain elevated but have reduced from the level in H2 2011".  Someone who stopped reading at page 8 or page 13 and did not read as far as page 26 would have obtained a completely different view of the position on impairment charges.  Such charges have actually increased by 9% or €77 million.</p>

Unlike the statements to which I refer on pages 8 and 13, when one reaches page 26, one realises that the amount rose by €77 million.  The overall performance of the bank is also in decline and that is of concern to the people who made the investment, particularly in the context of the fact that the underlying loss increased from €722 million to €907 million.</p>

          <p eId="para_585">A portion of the €4.8 billion is funding a pension of €650,000 a year to Mr. Brian Goggin, former CEO, and the salary for Mr. Boucher, who was previously deputy CEO with responsibility for retail mortgages, to the tune of approximately €620,000 plus benefits, which would bring him close to €900,000.  Mr. Boucher is probably in line for a pension of the order of €400,000.  He is clearly well prepared on a PR level to answer no questions.  Where is his moral compass in all of this?  The problem is that Bank of Ireland sold products during the boom that people could not afford.</p>

          <p eId="para_619">That question has been put before.  The Gallery has heard it enough this morning.  Before I bring in Deputy Shane Ross, Mr. Boucher must clarify a few points.  There has been wide acceptance that his engagement with the committee on a number of questions has been at a minimalist level, if I could even call it that.  I wish to put that on record.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">  An issue has been outstanding since Mr. Boucher came before the committee and I still have not got my head around it.  A question was put to Mr. Boucher, as it was put to AIB, on the absolute cost of the institution reducing the standard variable rate on domestic mortgages by 0.5%.  The figure we got from AIB yesterday afternoon was that private dwelling houses on its domestic book is worth approximately €14.3 billion and a 0.5% reduction would result in a loss of €71 million to AIB.  On the figures Mr. Boucher gave us this morning, the domestic book of Bank of Ireland is approximately €21 billion and if the bank reduced its standard variable rate by 0.5% its loss would be €29 million, approximately a third less than AIB.  Could he explain to us how it is the case that a smaller loss would be incurred following a 0.5% reduction given that the loan book is bigger?</p>

          <p eId="para_624">Another issue relates to a question put to Mr. Boucher by Deputy Donnelly.  Yesterday afternoon, AIB was asked the number of mortgages with a shortfall that it has allowed to be surrendered voluntarily and its policy on shortfalls.  We seem to have received a very vague response from Bank of Ireland on the matter.  The AIB officials advised us yesterday afternoon that 140 properties were surrendered with a mortgage shortfall.  The response of Bank of Ireland to date has been that it has a responsibility to maximise the recovery of all moneys owed by customers and that it has a comprehensive arrangement and process to work with customers to find solutions that can work for them and the bank in this regard.  Bank of Ireland states that, as a last resort, it may have to instigate a formal legal process.  That is not answering the question; rather, it is symptomatic of some of the replies we received this morning.  It indicates the bank is not really engaging with the process in a serious manner.  It also means it is not engaging with this committee in a serious manner, which is of equal concern to me.  What is Bank of Ireland's position on the issue of voluntary surrenders where there are mortgage shortfalls?  What is the bank doing in this regard?</p>

          <p eId="para_687">It is absolutely extraordinary that Bank of Ireland should appoint as a governor somebody who had lost his bonus in Lloyds in a payment protection insurance scandal.  There are now circumstances in which the bank is investigating itself in respect of payment protection insurance.  The board made its appointment in the full awareness that the individual concerned, while not necessarily culpable, was the director in charge of insurance when the scandal arose.  That should be noted by this committee.</p>
