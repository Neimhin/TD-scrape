            <p eId="para_5">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6">As I have outlined to the House previously, most recently on 4 May, following the publication of the Quigley report, additional procedures were approved by the Government for incorporation into the Cabinet handbook which were made available on my Department's website. Those procedures have given the Secretary General to the Government and the Government secretariat a role in examining certain procurements where there is an element of direct service to a Minister or where a Minister has suggested a name to be included in a procurement.</p>
            <p eId="para_7">There is no special interdepartmental group in my Department with regard to the application of the procedures and there was at no time an intention to establish such a group. Any workload arising from the application of these guidelines is being handled within existing resources in the Government secretariat. To date, no cases coming within the terms of the additional procedures have been notified to the Secretary General to the Government.</p>

            <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_8">The decision to appoint an interdepartmental group to oversee the appointment of public relations consultants to Departments was taken because of considerable public disquiet at the manner in which certain Ministers were operating when it came to these appointments. Will the Taoiseach say how many public relations contracts have been awarded since this group was established and whether the group has rejected any public relations consultants put forward for consideration? Does the Taoiseach want to comment on a situation where a private secretary to a Minister of State resigned her post on the basis of repeatedly being asked to attend an event that she believed would compromise her independence?</p>

            <from>An Ceann Comhairle</from>
            <p eId="para_11">That issue does not arise. I point out to the Deputy that given the large number of questions grouped together on the social partnership issue, he might wish to keep his questions brief.</p>

            <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_12">The Ceann Comhairle is as sharp as ever. Since its establishment, has the interdepartmental group examined each public relations contract awarded by all Departments? If so, was it satisfied with the tenders in terms of objective, performance and value for money?</p>
            <p eId="para_13">I ask the Taoiseach, as an experienced politician, for his view on an issue related to this. The public service has served us well under all governments. However, there seems to be a tendency in the past ten or 15 years to, without any consideration, draw in public relations consultants to bolster egos or protect Departments or Ministers. I always believed the public service, in attracting the brightest and best, was well capable of dealing with this area. That trust in the capacity of the Civil Service and public service to deliver for Government and to send out the correct factual messages for Ministers and Departments seems to have dissipated to a point where it is now an accepted fact that public relations consultants are necessary for all announcements by Government. Will the Taoiseach comment on this as a politician?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_7">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_14">On the first point, I reiterate what I said in my reply. There is no special interdepartmental group in my Department dealing with the application of procedures on procurement. There was no intention at any time to establish such a group. The Quigley report contained a number of recommendations in this regard for four or five Departments, including the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Finance. These recommendations have all been followed and I can go through them if necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_15">Any additional procedures or issues that arise are dealt with by the Cabinet secretariat. Since the new procedures were introduced at the beginning of 2005, any cases where there is a direct benefit for a Minister, either fully or partially, are brought to the attention of the Secretary General to the Government by the relevant Department. Responsibility lies with the Department to notify such matters and they are examined by the Government secretariat. Any issues relating to contracts are brought to the Department of Finance's contracts division.</p>
            <p eId="para_16">The Government contracts committee has carried out a review in accordance with the Quigley recommendations. As a result, guidelines consolidating and augmenting various elements of existing guidelines have been made available where appropriate. Furthermore, OPW procurement procedures have been reviewed, particularly in regard to Dublin Castle's conference facilities. A working group was established in early spring to undertake this review and to make recommendations on necessary changes. Its report recommends that revised procurement guidelines be issued to all OPW staff. I understand these guidelines will be complete shortly and will embrace best practice in ensuring that the 2004 Department of Finance procurement guidelines for competitive process are fully implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_17">Deputy Kenny asked me about Ministers who fail to observe the code of conduct for office holders. There have been no such cases this year. The message gets home in these cases and Ministers know the rules.</p>
            <p eId="para_18">On Deputy Kenny's second question, I do not always agree with the Deputy but, as he is aware because he has asked me plenty of questions on the matter, I do not use an agency and I did not use an agency in my time as Minister for Labour or Minister for Finance.</p>

            <p eId="para_31">If Deputy Kenny asked me to outline my views on this matter, I think it is an industry that is far bigger than its merits. The people in the private and government sectors who pay big money for its services are wasting their money, most of the time, especially if they think it will do something great.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_21">
            <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_32">As Deputy Kenny said, the recommendations contained in the Quigley report arose from circumstances in which a Minister was clearly seen to sponsor a particular individual throughout her contact with the public service. It seems extraordinary to me that the Taoiseach is saying that no single contract has come to the attention of the committee, the validating unit or the secretary of the Cabinet — I am not sure how one describes it — since the case relating to the Minister, Deputy Cullen. It can hardly be the case that the type of procurement envisaged in the report has not happened in any of the Departments since then. Given that the purpose of the committee is to have oversight of public relations and communications contracts, has the Taoiseach considered explicitly including advertising in that rubric? It is obvious that this suggestion arises from the recent abuse of advertising by the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, who was more interested in promoting himself than the information he was bringing into the public domain.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PadraicMcCormack" eId="spk_22">
            <from>Mr. McCormack</from>
            <p eId="para_33">He stopped the traffic.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_23">
            <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_34">It has since come to light that the Minister of State personally intervened in the design and content of that material, in the interests of self-promotion. Should such advertising not be included in the committee's remit, especially as we are within sight of a general election, so that Ministers and Ministers of State are not tempted to emulate their particularly industrious north side colleague?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_24">
            <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
            <p eId="para_35">He even threw in a car.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_25">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_36">I reiterate that it is not a committee, but a branch of the Government secretariat that is responsible for considering matters of this nature when they are brought to its attention. The new rules in the public relations area state that when a level of direct service is provided for a Minister or a Minister suggests a name to be included in the tender, any questions relating to the retention of consultants generally need to be addressed in that area. Such questions are referred to the Department of Finance. If the Minister makes a recommendation in respect of a matter in the PR area, the Government secretariat is asked to give its advice on the issue. No new contracts have been drawn up in the past year — there are existing contracts in Departments — and therefore no contract has been brought to the attention of the Government secretariat by a Secretary General of a Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_37">Deputy Rabbitte asked a question about the issue of advertising. I do not think advertising is dealt with in this context. There are general rules stating that people should not be involved in advertising, except when it is appropriate. I do not think the rules were broken in the case mentioned by the Deputy. Ministers should generally avoid using themselves in the advertising of their Departments or agencies. I have answered that before and I stay consistent with my answer. People should avoid that. It is not necessary and is not something people should do.</p>
            <p eId="para_38">The additional procedures apply particularly in the PR or communications area where there is a significant element of a direct service or where the Minister suggests the name of a person or enterprise for a consultancy or a contract. It is a broad area and in these circumstances the Secretary General of the relevant Department is required to inform the Secretary General to the Government who will arrange, if necessary, for the Government secretariat to inquire about aspects of the proposed procurement that it considers necessary. Arising from this the Secretary General will make recommendations to me as to whether any special conditions should be observed in the procurement process. While I do not want to go back over the matter again, as I recall, the Department of Finance and the OPW have also changed the guidelines to take account of the changes that arose out of the Quigley report last year.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoeHiggins" eId="spk_26">
            <from>Mr. J. Higgins</from>

          <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_27">
            <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
            <p eId="para_40">I appreciate the point made by Deputy Joe Higgins. If the Taoiseach is saying that no cases so far this year have come to the attention of the Secretary General to the Government, where does this leave, for example the Department of Health and Children contracts of more than €100,000 this year, including ones with Carr Communications in partnership with PricewaterhouseCoopers for business skills training? Is that contract outside the guidelines of the Quigley report or is the Taoiseach aware of the contract?</p>
            <p eId="para_41">While I was not able to hear every word the Taoiseach said, he mentioned procurement. This year the Department of Defence has two very large contracts for helicopter purchases, one for €48.4 million and another for €12.8 million with Eurocopter. Do those sizeable procurement contracts come under the terms of the Quigley guidelines?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_28">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_42">I again repeat the Quigley report recommendations. The procedures apply particularly in the PR or communication area where there was a significant element of direct service to a Minister or where a Minister suggested the name of a person or enterprise for a consultancy or contract. That is the area in which the Cabinet secretariat is involved. It is not involved in matters that have nothing to do with a Minister or a Minister of State. In the normal procurement arrangements that a Department would follow for the purchase of a contract the Accounting Officers are involved rather than the Minister. If a Minister were to recommend that a helicopter be bought from a particular company, that would be a different matter, but I hope Ministers are not recommending that we buy helicopters.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_44">On procurement, as I stated, the sub-group consisting of representatives of the Department of Finance and the Government contracts committee carried out a review in accordance with the Quigley recommendations and the guidelines consolidating various elements of existing guidelines and augmenting them where appropriate have been made available. As I said, within the broader OPW a working group was established following publication of the Quigley report to review the OPW's procurement policies and procedures and to make recommendations as to changes. That group reported and recommended that revised procurement guidelines would be issued to all OPW staff. I am not sure whether that is completed. If not, it will happen shortly. It will embrace the best practice and ensure that Public Procurement Guidelines — Competitive Process, published by the Department of Finance in 2004 is fully implemented. The OPW will provide further training for staff involved in procurement to strengthen that area.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_31">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_57">I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 16, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_58">As I previously informed the House, in late September I invited the social partners to participate in talks on a successor agreement to Sustaining Progress. I confirmed that the Government would enter the talks on the basis of our programme for Government and within the framework of the forthcoming NESC three-year strategic economic and social overview. As Deputies will be aware, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions raised a number of concerns in advance of taking any decision about entering talks. These concerns, which have surfaced in the context of specific industrial relations difficulties in recent weeks in Irish Ferries, relate to employment standards and the displacement of existing workers. I am pleased the parties involved in the Irish Ferries dispute have agreed to engage with the Labour Relations Commission along the lines recommended by the national implementation body in its statement of Sunday evening last. I hope that the intensive discussions under way will provide a basis for resolution of the particularly complex problems arising in this case.</p>
            <p eId="para_59">Apart from the circumstances surrounding any individual dispute, we still face difficult challenges as a society and an economy in dealing with employment standards in a global market. In this context, I wrote to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on 21 October to communicate directly the Government's intention to engage fully and effectively in the process of devising policies and measures which would protect employment standards and prevent a so-called race to the bottom.</p>
            <p eId="para_60">I view with great concern the potential social and economic implications of the displacement of workers on established conditions to be replaced in the same jobs by workers on much poorer conditions. This Government wants to see greater productivity and enhanced competitiveness based on new products and services, upskilling of staff, new work practices and technological innovation. We do not want to see people building competitive advantage based on poor wages, casualisation of labour, low health and safety standards or other poor compliance practices. This would be the wrong way to go and is unsustainable.</p>
            <p eId="para_61">There has been ongoing contact with the ICTU at official level on the broad range of issues comprehended by the general term "employment standards". Naturally, I strongly support the recommendation of the national implementation body that negotiations on a new partnership agreement should commence as soon as possible. I hope that the ICTU and all the social partners will be in a position to enter into talks about a successor agreement. As yet, no date has been agreed for a formal meeting of the social partners on this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_62">While the issues raised by the Irish Ferries case are difficult, the solutions to the problems we face as an economy and a society are best found within the context of a new social partnership agreement. Only partnership offers us the degrees of stability, engagement and trust that are needed if we are to continue to modernise and improve the quality of life for citizens in a fair and sustainable way. I find it hard to imagine that any other approach would produce the sort of interlocking policy responses that will be needed to meet the challenges that lie ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_63">Since 1987, social partnership has been a process which has delivered stability and confidence for all sectors of the community, especially investors. It has created and sustained the conditions for remarkable employment growth, fiscal stability, restructuring of the economy to respond to new challenges and opportunities, a dramatic improvement in real living standards through both lower taxation and lower inflation, and a culture of dialogue which has served the social partners and, more importantly, the people very well.</p>
            <p eId="para_64">I hope there will be an acceptance on all sides that the Government is willing to work with the social partners to address issues of concern such that everybody involved can recommit themselves to the partnership process. I hope this will bring about an early commencement of negotiations on a new agreement.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_32">
            <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_65">I share the Taoiseach's view and I hope the intensive discussions taking place will lead to this difficult matter being resolved. It is fair to say that the partnership process over the past 15 years has been fundamentally important to economic and employment stability in Ireland which has led in great part to the strength of the economy. Obviously the economy faces a different set of challenges in the years ahead given the growth of China, India and the new EU countries, the emergence of different technologies, competitiveness pressures in manufacturing and so on.</p>
            <p eId="para_66">The Taoiseach said some time ago when the Irish Ferries dispute began to get difficult that there was nothing further the Government could do. Arising from that statement, were some of the actions by Irish Ferries taken as a result of the Taoiseach indicating that the Government could not do any more? Was that a tactical mistake, given that the intervention of the national implementation body has demonstrated that more could have been done and that more can be done? I hope it works out. What is the Taoiseach's view on the damage done to the social partnership structure by this type of activity? Has it made it more fragile and susceptible to damage? During the next 12 to 15 months, does he see the partnership process reducing itself to the areas of real concern to the social partners or expanding its remit to, as he stated here one day, whatever one is having oneself? How does he see the new partnership structure as the economy and the country face the challenges of the times ahead?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_33">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_67">I welcome Deputy Kenny's words on the current discussions. I appreciate the work done by the national implementation body over the weekend. The president of ICTU, the general secretary of IBEC and the Secretary General of my Department worked extremely hard to find a basis on which to deal with an extremely difficult issue. Their terms were to try to put the Labour Relations Commission back into a position on which it could build. We know how difficult it is from the discussions that took place yesterday and today. I hope all sides will try to work around these well-worked out and ongoing issues. It is approximately one year since we dealt with the <i>Normandy</i> when these issues also arose, so they are not new. It is also extremely difficult to do much about some of the issues if people want to move outside and re-flag, as happened with the <i>Normandy</i>. Discussions are ongoing and I do not want to say anything other than to be supportive and helpful. I will return to the question on the ongoing process shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_68">Irish Ferries is part of IBEC. At the end of September I started the process to negotiate a successor agreement, which we hoped to finish by Christmas. On the Monday of that week Irish Ferries made its statement. I answered Deputy Rabbitte's questions on the Wednesday of that week. It certainly did not help and has not helped the process since. It created a great deal of difficulty and tension.</p>
            <p eId="para_69">Related issues on improving our mechanisms arose with regard to Gama and that debate had long commenced, as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions raised such issues a year ago regarding construction and the CIF. I was in the process of giving clarification, and subsequently did so in meetings during October. Discussions on improving the legislative base were already taking place in Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_70">Deputy Kenny asked if my words helped or hindered. As I stated outside the House, to put it in context I was asked at the launch of the new labour trust what more could I do to implement the Labour Court recommendations. Any examination of my words shows they were based on the fact that the Labour Court was involved and I could not do any more on that. I had already answered in the House that day or the previous day that I did believe we should raise the issue in Europe again. I was asked in the House if I would raise it again with the European Transport Council, which I did.</p>
            <p eId="para_71">On the question of whether I knew the action would take place that night, I want to make clear that I did. I was told by trade unionists that the action would take place that night. I was told heavies were going to be used. I knew this when I made those comments and I thought the action would take place at 10 o'clock but it happened the following morning. I was correctly and fully briefed by trade union sources on this.</p>
            <p eId="para_72">Looking at that event in isolation one could say a group of heavies was gathered overnight but this was not the case. I was aware of what was to happen. My words were intended to be helpful and the matter was worked out. Someone suggested I should name the trade union source but I have no intention of doing so. I was well informed by the source, who was totally correct, on the Monday.</p>
            <p eId="para_73">Regarding the damage to the social partnership process, all social partners realise it is the best way to resolve issues now and into the dim and distant future. There have been many difficult issues concerning social partnership and I have been central to most of them in one way or another. Social partnership is always capable of trying to find a way forward and to build and strengthen our economy. The only way of damaging this is to go backwards, or affect our investments, protect our market or do something else in a way that gives a bad image to the country. Social partnership is the right way to deal with these issues but there is not always a resolution. Sometimes issues can be so intractable a stand-off ensues and the matter cannot be resolved fully. Most of the time social partnership does resolve issues. Lost days and trade union figures prove this.</p>
            <p eId="para_74">Maritime issues are fundamentally different in every country but concern exists. I have talked to many people over the past months about this. We all know competitiveness, productivity and investment are important. Together, these elements drive our economy successfully. Sometimes people take the view that the way to be a great manager is to reduce staff numbers, get more out of existing staff and improve bottom line figures.</p>
            <p eId="para_75">We have a high minimum wage, which is by and large not taxable, and it is very attractive. People come here and wonder how we can run the country. For example, most of the Croatian workforce, even those in senior positions, would not receive the Irish minimum wage. Bright managers can take the view that they should outsource work to contract positions, bringing in new people and getting rid of existing staff, and that this leads to higher profitability and is sustainable. This is a disaster and it is the last thing we need to do. We must be careful of this and it is what the Irish Ferries dispute is about.</p>
            <p eId="para_76">We provide much good employment in this country. Over the past few years between 140,000 and 150,000 people have come into this country from the new enlargement countries. They benefit from our minimum wage, our health and safety practices and our good conditions. We look after them very well and while there have been a few incidents most situations are perfect. We must appoint extra inspectors to protect them. We do not want a situation where people seek to get workers out and find another way of getting staff. That is the issue and we can protect in social partnership. I have given a commitment a long time ago that we would try to deal with this.</p>

          <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_34">
            <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_77">Does the Taoiseach agree the prospect of a successor to the Sustaining Progress agreement will be bleak if the management at Irish Ferries is allowed get away with its acts of piracy against its workforce? Given the overwhelming support for the Irish Ferries workers and the significant rejection of the management of Irish Ferries, what further steps can the Taoiseach take to impress on that management that it should not proceed with its plans for re-registration and re-flagging of its ships? Will the Taoiseach accept that such a step on the part of the management is absolutely essential if we are to have a resolution to the current difficulties?</p>
            <p eId="para_78">Given the strategic nature of the role played by Irish Ferries in terms of trade and commerce and our dependence on the sea for the importation and exportation of essential goods, would now be an appropriate time for the Government to consider a buy-out of Irish Ferries, to ensure that it is in State control and that we can guarantee the uninterrupted continuation of the essential supports that this economy requires as an exporting country?</p>
            <p eId="para_79">Will the Taoiseach avail of the opportunity this afternoon, on his own behalf and that of the Government, to join the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in urging full support for its call for a mass mobilisation of support this Friday on the streets of Dublin? The call the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has made is being answered and prepared for by people from every walk of life throughout this State and island. Will the Taoiseach and his Government recognise the fundamental importance of the role of Government and congress in terms of social partnership, support the appeal from ICTU and give a rounded endorsement to its call for maximum support for Friday's demonstration, if all other efforts in the meantime have not overcome the current difficulties imposed by the management of Irish Ferries?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_35">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_80">The Deputy has asked a large number of questions, which I will try to answer. The national implementation body — just to focus on the latest recommendation and not go back over the Labour Court and earlier recommendations of the Labour Relations Commission — made recommendations on four main issues. It said that Irish Ferries should suspend its application to re-register its vessels on the register of Cyprus. Second, it said that the efforts to arrive at an agreement regarding the terms and conditions of employees who wish to remain in the employment of Irish Ferries should continue and be brought to a conclusion by Wednesday, 7 December. Third, the NIB stated that the terms and conditions of employees who are recruited to work on Irish Ferries vessels in the future should reflect, <i>inter alia</i>, Irish minimum wage arrangements, in the context of the unique nature of the contracts of employment which typically operate in the maritime sector and the competitive pressures faced by the company. Finally, the NIB stated that in the event that the outcome of this process was that these vessels were not maintained on the Irish register, the terms of any agreement with regard to existing employees and the standards which would apply to employees recruited to work on the vessels in the future should be reflected in an agreement of binding character, which should not be updated or set aside by any subsequent change in the country of registration. These are the issues set out by the national implementation body.</p>
            <p eId="para_81">The meaning of the recommendations, to answer the Deputy's second question, is that the unions and management are urged to engage fully with the Labour Relations Commission, without prejudice to their respective positions, as stated up to now. The NIB has suggested that the parties should explore a solution on the basis that the re-flagging proposal would be suspended for the moment, that some ring-fenced arrangements would be put in place for those staff who wish to stay on and that some mechanism might be found that would extend minimum standards of employment to new recruits on the Irish Ferries ships, including minimum wage arrangements. The precise manner in which this could be achieved was a matter to be discussed. A contractual arrangement is envisaged that would be binding on Irish Ferries even in the event of the company pressing ahead with reflagging its ships in another country, in this case Cyprus. The precise nature of this contractual arrangement would be a matter for discussion by the parties concerned. Having been involved in and kept abreast of discussions in recent days I support fully those initiatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_82">There is a right to reflag under European laws of re-establishment but the mere entry of a vessel on a foreign register is not in itself sufficient to constitute the exercise of that right. Irish Ferries must therefore satisfy a Minister of a bona fide exercise of that right in accordance with its requirements. The Minister is not obliged to deregister a vessel unless there is a valid and bona fide exercise of that right.</p>
            <p eId="para_83">I am aware that ICTU has arranged a march for Friday, 9 December at 1.30 p.m. in Dublin and at eight other locations, and that a meeting will be held about that this evening. I understand the frustrations about the issue, but Friday is a working day.</p>

            <p eId="para_90">The Taoiseach remarked on how surprised people were in Croatia at the level of the national minimum wage here. The Taoiseach will agree that the Irish would be surprised at the price of a bale of briquettes, a bag of coal or a loaf of bread in Croatia. Does the Taoiseach agree that his position on the services directive is central to the process of social partnership and new talks thereon, and needs to be made clear? Unless we repudiate the country of origin principle, airplane-loads of Croatians and Poles will come here to work under conditions applicable in their country of origin. No matter how diligently I search I cannot find out the position of the Government on that and I ask the Taoiseach to outline it.</p>
            <p eId="para_91">Does the Taoiseach believe that the commitment given by the Government at the outset of Sustaining Progress that 80% of Irish workers would pay tax at not more than the standard rate is an impediment to a new social contract? Between 66% and 67% of people pay tax at the standard rate, at a huge cost to Irish workers. Does the Taoiseach believe the failure to index the tax bands is the biggest stealth tax of all?</p>

            <p eId="para_99">The Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, has advocated the Commission presenting it again in a different form to address the issues where there was fundamental disagreement on the part of several countries because there was no hope of success.</p>
            <p eId="para_100">On Deputy Rabbitte's point on the service directive, I worked last year, particularly with the French, to ensure that the directive as it was at that time did not secure agreement at the European Council. We sent it back for significant changes. It has been in Parliament since with 1,000 amendments. In my letter of 21 October I made clear our opposition to aspects of it. If people could contract people and forward them to a country, it would create horrendous difficulties and I am against that. I made it clear that we were prepared to change. It would probably involve changing some of our legislation but we would engage with that.</p>
            <p eId="para_101">We promised that we would work to establish a serious housing initiative involving State lands and engage with the ICTU on the issue, not that they were all to be completed. We have completed 250,000 houses in that period but we wanted to help with affordability of houses in particular. That is working quite well because a large number of houses is entering that end of the market. Through the State lands we have honoured our commitments. I have spoken previously about fast-tracking the process. What was the other question Deputy Rabbitte asked?</p>

        his plans to review competition law here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_118">The Government, at its meeting this morning, approved the text of the competition amendment Bill 2005. This will strengthen the Competition Act. I plan to publish the text as soon as practicable allowing for the fact that the Bill must now be printed. It will repeal the groceries order and amend the Competition Act to prohibit resale price maintenance, unfair discrimination and so-called hello money in the grocery trade. I hope that the legislation will be enacted as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_119">The Competition Act is one of the most modern competition statutes in the world and it has been working very well in the relatively short time since its enactment in 2002. The Act introduced many improvements in the law and the way in which it is applied. For example, the system for regulating mergers and takeovers in the economy was made more open and transparent, with reasoned determinations being published in respect of each case notified to the Competition Authority. This change has proved to be very successful.</p>
            <p eId="para_120">The independence and powers of the authority were substantially increased under the 2002 Act and its resources have also been enhanced since. A second mergers division was established earlier this year and the Government has committed to making further funding available to the authority in 2006 for the purpose of strengthening its cartels division.</p>
            <p eId="para_121">While I have no immediate plans for a formal review, my Department continues to monitor the operation of the Act on an ongoing basis in conjunction with the Competition Authority.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PhilipHogan" eId="spk_66">
            <from>Mr. Hogan</from>
            <p eId="para_122">I thank the Minister for his reply and I welcome Cabinet approval for the changes he wishes to make. I look forward to their introduction in due course. Given that the Competition Authority does not have a chairman, its anti-cartel division does not have a head and another member of the authority, Mr. Hennebry, resigned recently, a departmental official is needed for a quorum so that the authority can make decisions. That does not indicate the Minister has ensured a well resourced body and I ask him to do something about this. Did the Minister watch the "Prime Time Investigates" television programme last night about car dealerships and, if so, has he an opinion on it?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_67" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Mr. Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_123">The resources of the Competition Authority will be increased under next year's Estimates and the cartels division will be expanded. I met the former chairman of the authority late in the summer prior to him securing a new position in Britain. He was entitled to do that and we will go through the normal processes to find a replacement. However, he indicated the need for the authority to concentrate on cartels in the economy and he suggested that an important initiative I could take would be to secure additional funding in next year's Estimates to create a new division in addition to what is in place to pursue anti-competitive cartels that do not give the consumer a fair deal.</p>
            <p eId="para_124">I do not want to comment on current cases and a file has been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions by the authority regarding the subject matter of last evening's programme. We are endeavouring to eliminate the practices highlighted in the programme and it is one of the reasons the Government sanctioned an amendment to the competition Bill relating to the groceries order. The order, in so far as it set a minimum price so that one could not sell below the net invoice price, inadvertently incentivised price fixing, which has no place in the economy and which the House should not attempt to protect or shelter.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PhilipHogan" eId="spk_68">
            <from>Mr. Hogan</from>
            <p eId="para_125">It is interesting that the Minister takes his view from the chairman of the consumer strategy group, who indicated in her submission to him last July that if the groceries order was abolished, the price of food products would reduce by 9%. However, she has revised that to a reduction of 3%. Circumstances can change in a few months following a decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_126">The Minister did not reply to the question whether he had been briefed on the contents of last night's programme by the Competition Authority, but I am sure he was. When was the authority first informed about an anti-competitive cartel and alleged collusion in the motor trade and what did it do about it?</p>

            <p eId="para_131">We must be careful about how such investigations are progressed. The matter is with the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_132">The decision to abolish the groceries order was based on analysis undertaken by departmental officials and clear conclusions that it was an anti-competitive measure, which has no place in the modern economy. That was the motivating factor behind the decision to abolish the order. I never got into the guessing game about how much prices would reduce but the order kept prices artificially high. The Competition Act 2002 enhanced the independence of the Competition Authority and the powers and penalties that can be applied regarding transgressions of competition law.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#TonyKilleen" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_74">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Killeen)</from>
            <p eId="para_134">In 2004, labour inspectors undertook 462 inspections under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000. So far this year the inspectorate has undertaken 407 inspections under the legislation. Rights commissioners of the Labour Relations Commission, a body independent of my Department, also hear complaints concerning breaches of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_135">A total of 19 employment regulation orders, drawn up through the joint labour committee system, regulate statutory minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment for workers employed in the various sectors where these apply. Ensuring compliance with the minimum pay amounts, terms and conditions forms a major element of the work of the inspectorate. The Government is aware of the concern expressed by public representatives, trade unions representing employees and others close to the issues, with regard to the abuse of vulnerable workers by a small minority of unscrupulous employers.</p>
            <p eId="para_136">The labour inspectorate is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, including immigrant workers. The inspectorate operates without differentiation according to worker nationality, as statutory employment rights and protections apply to immigrant workers in the same manner as they do to native workers. Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the inspectorate seeks redress for the individuals concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated.</p>
            <p eId="para_137">Following the Minister's announcement earlier this year, 31 inspector posts have been sanctioned for the inspectorate. This represents almost a doubling of personnel in the past 12 months and it is indicative of a determination to ensure compliance with employment rights legislation. Following a recent selection process, the labour inspectorate has its full complement of 31 inspectors. When the full complement of officers is fully operational, it will concentrate on employment sectors that have traditionally required considerable attention from the inspectorate. These include the services sectors covered by employment regulation orders such as hospitality, cleaning and agricultural and construction work. Many migrant workers are employed in these sectors. I urge anyone who has specific evidence of the mistreatment of workers to furnish all the relevant details and related materials to the inspectorate with a view to pursuing the matter.</p>

            <from>Mr. Howlin</from>
            <p eId="para_138">Does the Minister of State accept the total number of inspections carried out this year will amount to little more than half the number carried out in 2002? Will he confirm that 31 labour inspectors are in place? I refer to the enforcement of sectoral agreements, to which the Minister of State referred, which is a serious issue animating many workers. More and more complaints are being made to Members about people being paid the minimum wage in workplaces covered by sectoral agreements. How many cases have been brought to the Minister of State's attention? If he does not have the figure, perhaps he will revert to me on it. Is he concerned that the perception that the minimum wage is an acceptable wage has an impact on the wages paid in a range of employments, particularly in the construction and meat industries? What are his proposals to ensure sectoral agreements, which are legally binding, are enforced? Where such agreements do not exist, workers should be protected by law. Has he plans to introduce legislation in this regard?</p>

            <from>Mr. Killeen</from>
            <p eId="para_139">A significant number of labour inspections were carried out following the introduction of the national minimum wage to ensure employers were aware of its existence and of the necessity for compliance. There has been less of an emphasis in this regard in recent times because people are aware of the provisions of that Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_140">Difficulties were experienced in filling the 31 labour inspection posts. Two separate competitions had to be run because a sufficient number of people did not apply. The posts have been filled and training, which is important, is being undertaken.</p>

            <p eId="para_146">All 31 posts were filled in mid-October or early-November and a further training element was to be completed after that date. I can revert to the Deputy with the detail, but the inspection programme is under way.</p>
            <p eId="para_147">With regard to sectoral agreement, as with the minimum wage one of the requirements for the inspectorate is that the specific matter be brought to its attention. Equally important, direct evidence must be made available to it. One of the difficulties is that the evidence must stand up in court if prosecutions are initiated. In general, emphasis has been placed in the first instance on seeking redress for workers, sometimes very successfully.</p>
            <p eId="para_148">Deputies should be aware that while the Gama investigation amounted to just one investigation, it took up a significant amount of labour inspectorate time. People may compare the number of inspections from year to year, but it is important to bear in mind the significant difference between the quality and amount of work required in the case of some inspections. I will revert to the Deputy with regard to the specific cases raised by him as I do not have the information with me.</p>
            <p eId="para_149">Deputy Howlin asked about the impact of the minimum wage from the perspective of employees. I was quite surprised, having introduced the last round of the minimum wage, at the significant level of negative comment from certain groups. It was unwarranted and I was surprised at the extent of it. I assure the Deputy we intend to ensure that sectoral agreements and the minimum wage are in force, but this is dependent on getting evidence.</p>

        <b>Mr. Morgan</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</b>
        his Department’s strategy to prevent the displacement of workers and their replacement with lower paid workers who are subjected to exploitative terms and conditions.
        [37971/05]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_90" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Mr. Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_160">Ireland already has a comprehensive body of employment rights legislation which has among its objectives the protection of employees against arbitrary behaviour by employers. It also has wider aims such as provision for the safety and health of workers and the fostering of labour market harmony by promoting policies that minimise conflict and maximise fairness.</p>
            <p eId="para_161">Specific areas covered by legislation include working time, payment of wages, holidays, national minimum wage, unfair dismissal, redundancy payments, protection of young persons and transfer of undertakings. In general, Irish legislation mirrors the broader EU social protection framework in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_162">Usually, one would expect the composition of a workforce to reflect the broad population of the local catchment area, provided appropriate personnel are available for the specific vacancies arising. However, it should be borne in mind that as far as Ireland is concerned, there is now an EU labour market and nationals of other member states have the same right and freedom to come and work in Ireland as do Irish nationals. Accordingly, employers can choose to hire such workers without regard to nationality. It is important that this be appreciated.</p>
            <p eId="para_163">Concerns with regard to the protection of workers' jobs, pay and conditions of employment, to which the Deputy referred, raise complex legal and policy issues. New challenges are constantly posed by population movement, by the changing structure of the economy, by new work practices and by growing international economic integration. In recent years, our economy has adapted very successfully to these challenges and the continued situation of virtual full employment is evidence of this.</p>
            <p eId="para_164">As Deputies know, the Government has already communicated its intention to engage fully and effectively in the process of devising policies and measures which would protect employment standards and arrest a race to the bottom in terms of employment practices. I am confident that a successful response to these issues can be found for our economy, where the exceptional legal and other characteristics of the marine sector do not apply. They are best found within the context of a social partnership agreement which continues the stability and progressive modernisation of our labour force and employment practices in order to sustain jobs and living standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_165">I view with great concern the potential social implications of the displacement of workers on established conditions in favour of those willing to do the same jobs on much poorer conditions. The Taoiseach is on record as stating that we want to see greater productivity and enhanced competitiveness based on new products and services, upskilling of staff, new work practices and technological innovation. We do not want to see people building competitive advantage based on poor wages, casualisation of labour, low health and safety standards or other poor compliance practices. Not only is it wrong, it is simply not sustainable.</p>
            <p eId="para_166">While recognising the exceptional situation that has recently arisen in the maritime sector, it is important to remember that the full panoply of Irish employment law and social protection still applies to persons employed in Ireland, regardless of nationality. This body of law is, and will continue to be, enforced by my Department.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#ArthurMorganSF" eId="spk_91">
            <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
            <p eId="para_167">The bland phrases "hire workers without regard to their nationality", "view with great concern" and "the Taoiseach would like to see" are not the answer I hoped to get. I was hoping the Minister would give a crystal clear assurance that the Government is opposed to displacement. The Minister said that workers will be hired without regard to their nationality, but that is not what is happening. I have a communication from a constituent who applied for a job as a mushroom picker, but was told that only foreign nationals need apply. Can the Minister give me an unambiguous reply stating that he rejects the drive by certain employers and economists to make this State a low wage economy on the back of exploitation? That is the way we are heading and I would appreciate clarity on the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_168">Would the Minister accept that what Irish Ferries is doing is trying to bring us back to the 19th century? In the 19th century workers had to fight hard to achieve an eight-hour day. That was achieved by the 20th century in most states in Europe and in North America. Irish Ferries is trying to bring us back to a situation where the 12-hour day is the norm. Will the Minister tell me whether he is opposed to that type of activity by exploitative employers? In Norway, for example, there is an excellent relationship between employers and workers and the majority of workers, over 90%, are members of trade unions. Norway has a partnership process through which workers and employers create a better and more competitive economy. We should work towards a competitive economy, not the one some exploitative employers are currently trying to achieve.</p>

            <from>Mr. Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_169">The Deputy obviously did not hear my reply. I will repeat the key sentence. "We do not want to see people building competitive advantage based on poor wages, casualisation of labour, low health and safety standards or other poor compliance practices." I have made it clear here on several recent occasions that we do not want to see a reduction in living standards. We see the economic development of the country based on securing competitive advantage, upskilling of our employment force, greater qualifications, development of new products and services and greater innovation etc. That is our future. The future is not to be found in policies that would reduce living standards, wages, pay and conditions. This side of the House has, historically, always been to the fore in establishing and asserting workers' rights. We were the architects of social partnership in the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_173">We will continue to do that. The record will show what we have done. I have been in discussions with the social partners and I share their concerns. The best way to advance the protection of workers is through social partnership. It offers the best opportunity for all concerned to use that forum as a basis for agreeing whatever new measures are required to ensure a greater degree of compliance with labour law and to examine the modalities of how we do that — we have an open mind on that score — in a wide range of areas to ensure the scenario which the Deputy has outlined does not become a reality.</p>
            <p eId="para_174">There are numerous examples throughout the economy, particularly in advanced manufacturing and in other areas, where clearly the opposite has occurred. We are attracting employment that produces higher wages and a better quality of employment in information and communications technologies, software, pharmaceuticals and biopharma.

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</b>
        his views of the continuing deterioration in industrial relations at Irish Ferries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
        [38000/05]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_101" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Mr. Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_180">Last week I met the management of Irish Ferries and representatives of SIPTU and the ICTU to convey to them the Government's concerns as to the gravity of the situation and the wider implications of the ongoing dispute. I urged all sides to engage in the Labour Relations Commission process with a view to achieving a resolution to the issues in dispute.</p>
            <p eId="para_181">On 4 December 2005 the national implementation body made a series of recommendations to the social partners and the Government regarding the maintenance and protection of employment standards in the labour market. The national implementation body also made the following recommendations in respect of the dispute at Irish Ferries. Irish Ferries should suspend its application to re-register its vessels on the register of Cyprus. The efforts to arrive at an agreement on the terms and conditions of employees who wish to remain in the employment of Irish Ferries should continue and be brought to a conclusion not later than 7 December. The terms and conditions of employees who are recruited to work on these Irish Ferries vessels in future should reflect, <i>inter alia</i>, Irish minimum wage arrangements in the context of the unique nature of the contracts of employment which typically operate in the maritime sector and the competitive pressures faced by the company. In the event that the outcome of this process is that these vessels are not maintained on the Irish register, the terms of any agreement with regard to existing employees and the standards which would apply to employees recruited to work on these Irish Ferries vessels in future should be reflected in an agreement of binding character which would not be vitiated by any subsequent change in the country of registration. The NIB urged the parties, without prejudice to their respective positions, to engage fully with the Labour Relations Commission over the period ending on 7 December with a view to finalising an agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_182">The situation at Irish Ferries has been addressed by all the industrial relations bodies. It is significant that the interested parties are in negotiations facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission. I welcome this development. The work already undertaken by and with the national implementation body, the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission provides a firm basis for resolution. I hope the parties in this process succeed in resolving this dispute quickly and without further disruption to ferry services.</p>
            <p eId="para_183">Overall, industrial relations in Ireland are still quite stable. During the first half of this year 1,463 days were lost to industrial disputes, involving just six disputes. In 2004, a total of 20,784 days were lost to industrial disputes, involving 11 disputes during the year — the smallest number of disputes and days lost to strikes in a single year since records began. This downward trend in disputes has resulted in a very stable industrial relations climate.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PhilipHogan" eId="spk_102">
            <from>Mr. Hogan</from>
            <p eId="para_184">I thank the Minister for his reply. Obviously he has very little to report to us arising from the past 48 hours of talks at the Labour Relations Commission. I hope some progress will be made by tomorrow. This is imperative in the interests of partnership and industrial relations. I do not think a national day of protest is the way to go as it drags other sectors into the dispute and discommodes commuters and other sectors that have not been the cause of the problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_185">Even though the Government was aware this problem was coming down the tracks for a considerable period, in 2004 it opposed the manning directive to give clear pay and conditions for all workers in the maritime sector. The Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Gallagher, tried his best to get this issue put back on the agenda this week. Will the Minister indicate how the Government will proceed to get this matter on the agenda and to reverse engines in its policy on this issue?</p>
            <p eId="para_186">Will the Minister also indicate if there are any plans to establish a bilateral agreement with Cyprus, the country that has facilitated Irish Ferries in regard to flagging, and if we will be able to get a common position between Ireland, Cyprus, other EU states and third countries on proper pay and conditions for workers?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_103" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Mr. Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_187">We must be very clear about this. As the Deputy is aware, the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, has been negotiating in Brussels on the manning directive. A number of other countries also took issue with aspects of the directive at that time. It is not fair to say there was a direct relationship between any of those issues and the action and behaviour of Irish Ferries, nor has the company advanced this as a basic cause for the action it has taken. It has advanced the view that the ultimate motivation for its action is to be found in what it perceives to be its current competitive disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> the international maritime sector. The Government is already on record as not being in agreement with Irish Ferries on its view and in condemning the manner in which it took that action.</p>
            <p eId="para_188">We must be careful we do not use other issues as excuses for the kind of fundamental departure that was made in attempting to replace one set of workers with another on a lower scale. I do not wish to say anything that would undermine the talks process within the Labour Relations Commission. The Government is open to taking whatever measures are necessary to facilitate a resolution of this dispute. It will take whatever constructive approach is necessary on a range of issues pertaining to the maritime sector to facilitate a resolution of the dispute. In essence, however, it is a matter for both parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_189">Last week I met Irish Ferries, the ICTU and SIPTU on behalf of the Government to convey to them the gravity in which the Government views the situation in terms of not just the Irish Ferries dispute but the wider implications for social partnership and the need and imperative to get back into talks and utilise to the maximum potential the existing industrial relations machinery of the State. We will not be found wanting in terms of assisting that process of resolution.</p>

        the steps he proposes to take to address the serious problem of bullying in the workplace; his proposals to introduce new legislation to implement the recommendations of the expert advisory group on workplace bullying; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#TonyKilleen" eId="spk_115" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Mr. Killeen</from>
            <p eId="para_202">In August 2004, my predecessor, Deputy Fahey, established a widely representative expert advisory group on workplace bullying, the terms of reference of which were to advise and report on the effectiveness of measures concerning the prevention of workplace bullying, the identification of improvements in procedures and how to address the contribution made by bullying to the incidence of workplace stress. I launched the group's report on 17 August 2005, a copy of which is available free of charge on my Department's website, <i>www.entemp.ie</i>. The principles laid down by the group in its report will underpin future consideration of the issue by the Government, as anything less is not acceptable in a fair, safe and equitable workplace.</p>
            <p eId="para_203">The key recommendation of the expert advisory group is that legislation be brought forward to deal with workplace bullying. This legislation should apply to all employees in the workforce, irrespective of employment status. Following publication of the report I sought and obtained the views of the social partners on this matter. In September, as part of the follow up consultation process, my Department used the national newspapers and my Department's website to seek the views of interested parties on how best the recommendations of the group might be implemented and received 15 submissions.</p>
            <p eId="para_204">My Department is currently implementing the group's recommendation to conduct a follow up survey on workplace bullying, which will be similar to the survey conducted for the last report on this subject published in 2001, in order to obtain an up-to-date picture of the incidence of the workplace bullying. The tender process for the award of a contract to conduct the survey is nearly complete. I expect the successful tenderer to start the survey in January 2006 and to complete it within as short a timescale as possible. I intend to publish the results of the survey and to bring it to Government along with the views of the social partners and other interested parties for decision.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PaudgeConnolly" eId="spk_116">
            <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
            <p eId="para_205">I thank the Minister of State for his answer. References to bullying conjure images of the intimidation that takes place in school yards, events from which we mature and move on. However, I am sure the Minister of State will agree that bullying can be subtle and difficult to quantify in terms of hard evidence. Does he agree that bullying is a serious problem in workplaces? A SIPTU survey indicated that 87% of workers were aware of bullying. I am not sure whether we need more surveys to prove that bullying exists because it is an issue that concerns all grade of workers. It not only affects children in school yards but also blue and white collar workers on factory floors, in the health and public services and at departmental levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_206">Some of us may be fortunate enough to be able to request and receive a transfer out of a bullying environment but the bully often remains. Many cannot transfer and must stay in their positions to endure further torture. Does the Minister of State equate bullying with anti-social behaviour? He should consider imposing ASBOs on perpetrators.</p>
            <p eId="para_207">He referred to the expert group's report on workplace bullying, which called for strong action by the State. What action is being proposed by the Department and how soon will it take place? What will be done to take care of company directors, senior managers in the public service and workers across the entire sphere? Has the Department examined the experience of Sweden, which has a clear framework of legal guidelines for dealing with bullying behaviour and ensuring dignity at work. Will management agree that bullying can have a severe effect on productivity within the workplace, lead to increases in sick leave and stress levels and cause workplaces to become dysfunctional?</p>
            <p eId="para_208">For some, the thought of going to work is a cause of additional stress. They watch the time until they can leave, whether that involves days, weeks or years. They are in environments from which they cannot escape and urgent action should be taken to help them.</p>

            <from>Mr. Killeen</from>
            <p eId="para_209">I concur with Deputy Connolly that this is a serious issue. It is important to remember the principles that arose from the group's report, which stated that workplace bullying is unacceptable in all circumstances, that management is responsible for ensuring that such behaviour is not tolerated and that incidents of bullying should be adequately addressed and brought to a fair and conclusive resolution in a timely manner. The expert group recommended legislation on that basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_210">The reasons for updating the survey are simple. The 2001 report suggested that 16% of people in the workplace were at some time subjected to bullying and it is important to establish whether the perception that bullying is on the increase is correct. The qualitative issues which arise in terms of bullying must also be established.</p>
            <p eId="para_211">The Deputy is correct in noting that this matter can beset all grades. It is a mistake to assume that all incidents of bullying involve management or senior staff bullying others at a lower grade. In fact, bullying often occurs within the same grade and apparently there are occasional instances of harassment by lower grades of more senior staff. Complex issues are, therefore, at play. It undoubtedly has a negative impact on productivity and gives rise to problems for industry in terms of sick leave and related areas.</p>

An urgent need exists for some form of policy which will outline harassment and intimidation at work.

        <b>Mr. Boyle</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</b>
        the reason for the decrease in the employment rate of disabled persons in 2005 when €70 million is being spent on training and support to achieve the opposite effect.
        [37923/05]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#TonyKilleen" eId="spk_120" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Mr. Killeen</from>
            <p eId="para_215">The most recent estimate of the numbers of people with disabilities participating in the labour force was contained in the 2004 CSO QNHS disability update. This indicated that there were 110,800 people with disabilities in employment, which actually represented an increase of 900 on the 2002 figure. However, it is true that the percentage of those aged 15 to 64 with disabilities in employment fell from 40% to 37% over the period. This was due to the increase in the total number of 15 to 64 year-olds with a disability over the period. However, the CSO attributed this change to small survey changes rather than to a real significant increase.</p>
            <p eId="para_216">This Government is committed to addressing the needs of those with disabilities. In particular, we are committed to removing the obstacles which make it difficult for people with disabilities to participate in the labour market. We have already done a great deal in this area. Under the Government's mainstreaming policy, my Department through FÁS is seeking to increase the participation of disabled workers through a three-pronged approach involving facilitating progression into sustainable employment through skills development, stimulating awareness amongst employers of the contribution that disabled people can make and encouraging their recruitment and providing specific employment supports for disabled people and employers.</p>
            <p eId="para_217">People with disabilities now benefit from the full range of FÁS training programmes and services. Since 2002 FÁS has realised more than 29,000 placements of people with disabilities in open labour market employment, training and employment programmes. Since 2002, the FÁS budget for vocational training and employment for people with disabilities has increased from €54 million to €70 million. This includes additional funds to ensure accessibility of FÁS premises and services for people with disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_218">FÁS provides an extensive range of schemes and grants specifically to promote the employment of people with disabilities in the private sector. These include the workplace or equipment adaptation grant, the employee retention grant scheme, the job interview interpreter grant and the personal reader grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_219">Earlier this year, a new wage subsidy scheme was also introduced by FÁS. This is a significant initiative which has a 2005 budget of €10 million. The scheme offers financial support to employers outside the public sector to encourage them to employ people with disabilities who work in excess of 20 hours per week. Unlike other schemes, the potential exists for both the employee and the employer to receive an incentive. Therefore, I expect that this scheme will contribute to an improvement in the employment rate to which the Deputy refers.</p>
            <p eId="para_220">In addition, the sectoral plan my Department is currently preparing for its area of responsibility in the context of the Disability Act will help set the agenda for addressing the remaining issues for people with disabilities participating in the labour market. It is an agenda this Government is committed to implementing.</p>

          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_121">
            <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_221">Will the Minister of State admit that things are going wrong and the fact that the employment rate among people with disabilities is decreasing is a sign of failure? It is important to acknowledge that and no amount of statistical discussion of CSO survey results will make it less clear. Compared to international best practices, where employment rates of more than 60% are achieved among people with disabilities, not only are we going in the wrong direction but we are also at the lower end of the international scale. I want the Minister to accept that the CSO figures reveal that things are going wrong.</p>
            <p eId="para_222">I fear that the process of planning here is short-term and reactionary. Last year the big issue in the budget was disability but I fear it will not be mentioned tomorrow. Two years ago, the big issue was decentralisation, whatever it will be tomorrow. That short-term reactionary approach does not provide a solution. Does the Minister of State agree with the contents of the NDA report in terms of recent employment of people with disabilities, that what we need is an absolute political commitment not just to the various schemes mentioned by the Minister of State, which are welcome, but which the OECD shows are not working, but to a change in the culture of this country with regard to the attitude of employers and society generally to people with disabilities? Does the Minister agree that the most important action we can take to improve their lot is to ensure access to jobs? More than any social welfare or other relief scheme, that gives people pride, purpose and a reason for getting out of bed speedily every day.</p>
            <p eId="para_223">The NDA report's recommendation is that rather than concentrating on the pilot schemes, though they are welcome, we need cultural change, led from the top. Is the Minister of State willing to take that approach and tackle the general population, where we have the problem, rather than the disabled population, who are willing and able but are not being employed? Will the Minister of State take that different approach of tackling the broader population on this issue as well as following up on the schemes he has talked about? To allow the Minister of State make that commitment, he must first recognise that despite all our efforts, matters are heading in the wrong direction.</p>

            <from>Mr. Killeen</from>
            <p eId="para_224">With regard to the cultural change which Deputy Ryan urges the Government to press on employers and able-bodied people, the Deputy and others should acknowledge that a magic wand cannot be waved with regard to employment of people with disabilities. Such employment is best achieved through the various initiatives and schemes to which the Government has been committed and on which FÁS has worked hard.</p>
            <p eId="para_225">Each person with a disability is an individual, and each of the 900 additional people with disabilities now involved in employment is a significant individual beneficiary. We ought to acknowledge that having additional people benefiting and participating is a positive element, not just for them but for the country as a whole. I reject the Deputy's contention that the Government is concentrating on short-term reactionary policies. In general the plans are three and five year sectoral plans. They are cross-departmental and will be very effective by the end of those periods. The Government does not have the luxury enjoyed by the Opposition of being able to trawl through several hundred issues and pick out ones on which they can put forward negatives.</p>

            <p eId="para_227">The Minister of State was unnecessarily provocative in his last contribution, considering that the programme for Government indicated we would have mainstreaming of all these employment opportunities for people with disabilities through the community employment schemes. Is that another broken promise? Will the Government do another U-turn on this matter in the context of the forthcoming year's Estimates and restore the commitment the Minister of State gave at that time in good faith to mainstream people with disabilities in terms of their employment and training requirements?</p>

            <p eId="para_228">The most important element of the mainstreaming with regard to people with disabilities was in transferring this element of responsibility to FÁS, which clearly has responsibility in all the other areas of training and of placement of people in need of employment or training. That was the key decision, made in 2002. The rehabilitative and health-related issues have meanwhile been dealt with by the Department of Health and Children. The other employment issues are quite rightly dealt with by my Department, which has responsibility with regard to all other sectors for employment issues.

            <p eId="para_232">Support for employment and investment in individual towns is a day-to-day operational matter for the agencies under my Department. Under the industrial development Acts, I may give general policy directives to IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland but I am precluded from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</p>
            <p eId="para_233">I am aware that the development agencies have strategies in place and offer a range of supports for investment and employment creation in Mallow and in the wider region. For example, both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland supported the Mallow development partnership in the preparation of its integrated development strategy for the town.</p>
            <p eId="para_234">As a hub town under the national spatial strategy, Mallow is a key location for IDA Ireland and is currently the location for four client companies employing approximately 500 people. The IDA is actively marketing the town as a location for additional foreign direct investment through its network of local and overseas offices. The agency has planned a programme of site development works at its Mallow business park, which will be complete by the third quarter of 2006 and which will involve an investment of approximately €400,000. In addition to these site development works, IDA also plans to undertake some refurbishment of the 2,072 square metre advance factory on the park during the first quarter of 2006. There are currently 6.2 hectares available for development at the park and the IDA will continue to market this land to potential clients.</p>
            <p eId="para_235">Enterprise Ireland works with approximately 140 companies in the east Cork area, which includes Mallow, with a total employment of some 3,700. In June 2005, Enterprise Ireland south-west region piloted the new enterprise start programme, a joint venture between Enterprise Ireland and FÁS, which has been designed for those mainly in employment who are seeking training in how to start a new enterprise. The agency plans to run the programme in Mallow in the second quarter of 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_236">The North Cork Enterprise Board, which services the Mallow area, focuses primarily on offering "first port of call" business information as well as a guidance service providing support and advice in the development of business proposals. Since 2003, a total of 24 business development training programmes have been offered by North Cork Enterprise Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_237">The FÁS south-west region provides an integrated labour market service to the greater Mallow area from the FÁS office located in Main Street, Mallow. Currently a total of 180 people are participating in a range of 11 FÁS-supported community-based projects throughout the Mallow area. I am confident the strategies and policies being pursued by the agencies, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development will bear fruit in terms of additional sustainable investment and jobs for the people of Mallow.</p>

Is he aware that a very impressive presentation was made to the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business by the Mallow development partnership, which presented innovative proposals for integrated development in a hub town setting? Will the Minister provide funding, even on a pilot basis, to see if such integrated strategic planning can grow enterprises in a town such as Mallow?</p>
            <p eId="para_239">What particular extra resources or supports does the Minister's Department give to towns designated under the special plan as hub towns? The hub town representatives I have met are at a loss to know, other than the title of "hub town", to what the hub towns are entitled by the designation. What additional supports are available to a hub town which are not available to a town which does not have that designation?</p>

            <p eId="para_241">The Government approach to Mallow has been very significant in recent years. When I was Minister for Education and Science, we modernised the second level schooling in Mallow, in particular the Thomas Davis college, and the other second level schools. State-of-the-art buildings are now in place there. We also dealt with primary school education issues there and helped with apprenticeship training in Mallow, all with a view to giving a bedrock and foundation stone for good economic development in the town.

            <from>Mr. Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_243">I am answering the question. Deputy Howlin asked me what a hub town generates. It generates that degree of investment across Departments. Likewise, regarding the railway link to Mallow, critical to its future economic development, it was announced in the Transport 21 initiative that the track will be modernised and that services will be more frequent. That will be of great significance to Mallow. The road network to Mallow has also improved dramatically in recent times. Adding all that up, including the IDA business park and its development, one has a very marketable commodity in Mallow. Its proximity to the gateway city of Cork adds to its overall attractiveness as a location for investment. That is evidenced by the growth of Mallow over the past few years and the numbers of people going to live there. There has been very significant economic activity in the town and it is time we acknowledged that.</p>

I chair the relevant Cabinet sub-committee. This initiative covers a wide range of Departments, one of which is the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. The latter has been looking at initiatives in terms of marine energy, particular communications and so on. Out of that process arose the need for a research co-ordinator. That is the context in which the Government decided to offer that position to the person who occupied the chief science adviser post until recently.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_271">There is a number of subjects one could raise today, including the price of cars. I would like to get closure on several matters, the first of which may be of relevance to the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children. The Taoiseach is aware, as it has been raised before during Leaders' Questions, that the famous PPARS project has cost more than €160 million of public money. Much of the focus on this has gone back to two major consultancy firms and the fees they received. However, the sorry story of the PPARS project is not just confined to large consultancy companies. Following a number of months of investigation into this, I have learned that 14 companies were paid almost €7 million in respect of staff recruited for the PPARS project.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">One of those companies, known as Blackmore Group Assets Limited, received €2 million from the HSE in respect of the recruitment of seven staff. We all know about accountability and transparency. Blackmore Group Assets Limited is not registered in this State or in the United Kingdom. It uses a privately owned trust company in Guernsey to bill the HSE; I have invoices here. Blackmore Group Assets Limited is a shelf company with no substance. When these points were put to the HSE last week for investigation, it insisted that Blackmore is a United Kingdom based recruitment company. The HSE refused to accept the onshore connections or that there are any tax implications in the way Blackmore Group Assets Limited has been paid.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">My charge is that the HSE either does not know about this, is incompetent about this or has failed to come clean about it. Although some Ministers might consider €2 million a small amount of money, it was public money paid to a company I cannot trace. I cannot identify any of the directors or where they are located beyond having an address of a shelf company in Guernsey. I am concerned that Irish law should be fully adhered to, that Irish tax law is fully complied with and that the public should know who is getting paid its money for the recruitment of staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">I do not suggest that the staff recruited were unable to do the job. However, I would like to know the situation in respect of this particular shelf company registered in Guernsey. If the Taoiseach has all the information from the Tánaiste, I hope he can answer these questions. Who are the directors of this company, where are they located and what background check was done on them? Why did they receive €2 million of public money when nobody can trace their location?</p>

          <p eId="para_276">The new system for management control of information and communications technology, ICT, projects in Departments was announced by the Government in October to ensure such projects are managed to best practice standards. As part of that process, the Department of Finance has just introduced a peer review for these projects. Three such projects have been selected to commence immediately on that basis. The peer review process will comprise senior personnel from within and outside the public service with a record of successful management in ICT projects. The peer review team should help to reduce the risk of sub-optimal outcomes, such as cost and time overruns and unexpected long-term maintenance and support costs. The team can suggest that the scope of the project should be modified or that it should be rephased into multiple releases or terminated. A potential list of reviewers has been drawn up by the Department.</p>

          <p eId="para_278">A review group has been established to review the delivery of PPARS, as Deputy Kenny is aware, so that it meets the requirements of the Health Service Executive. The work of the review group, which is ongoing, will involve trying to determine the most cost-effective and efficient option for the HSE and evaluating the resource and the schedules in it. The estimate of €35 million that was provided by the HSE relates to the system's running costs, as originally envisaged. The Department of Finance is looking for substantial reductions in the running costs in the context of this review.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">In respect of the company mentioned by Deputy Kenny and the other companies, the head of the HSE and his senior colleagues are examining all the contracts and the background to them. They are assessing how all such issues were followed through. I cannot speak about individual contracts until we see the report. I have been informed that procurement policies were followed in this instance. I will be honest with Deputy Kenny. I do not know whether the company in question was registered in Dublin, Guernsey or the UK. I do not know and I will not guess.</p>

          <p eId="para_282">I do not expect the Taoiseach to be able to give answers on all the minutiae of this matter. When I submitted a freedom of information request on this issue last July, the Health Service Executive responded by giving certain information. The Tánaiste subsequently gave further information, which had been made available to her by the HSE, in response to a parliamentary question.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">If the HSE had been a private company, questions would have been asked in the House about payments being made to accounts in the Channel Islands. The response of the HSE has been to state that the company in question was a recruitment agency based in the UK. It has been confirmed to me by the UK crown office that the Channel Islands are crown dependencies and not parts of the United Kingdom. An invoice for €4,900 issued by Blackmore Group Assets Limited gives the address and e-mail address of the company, but nothing else. Nobody in this House, the Department of Health and Children or the HSE can pinpoint who the directors of the company are. Who checked the company out? Why did it receive public money of €2 million for the recruitment of seven personnel? If we are in the business of spending taxpayers' money on the recruitment of personnel, surely we can find out where the money went and why €2 million was paid to a shelf company.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">It is understandable that the Taoiseach would not have all the answers when answering questions in the House, but I would like him to be fully acquainted with all the facts of this case. The Tánaiste, who may have all the answers, should put such information on the record so that people can know to whom their hard-earned taxes are being paid.</p>

          <p eId="para_285">I appreciate the Deputy's remarks. All the PPARS contracts are being examined as part of the Comptroller and Auditor General's investigation. I understand there was a procurement mechanism and the staff in question were working. The issues which are under investigation include ascertaining who the beneficial owners of the companies were, to whom the moneys were paid and how the structures worked. I am aware that senior personnel within the HSE have indicated that they will compile a full report on foot of all the documentation available to them going back a number of years. They must give information to the Comptroller and Auditor General, but they also intend to report on all aspects of the matter. It is obvious that these issues will arise again as soon as the information is made available.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">I understand a number of contracts are in question involving a substantial amount of money. I think the cost of the entire PPARS project over approximately eight years to the end of last year was approximately €117 million. It is estimated that €53 million was provided this year. I do not have a breakdown between capital and revenue. It was intended to complete the project by the end of next year, as Members are aware. The HSE has undertaken that it will fully examine all the contracts and give full details on them in the form of a report. I cannot give any more information to the House until we get such details.</p>

        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_164">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_287">Will the Taoiseach respond to the growing public concern at home and internationally about aircraft used by the CIA for the purposes of executive rendition landing at various European airports? Will he specifically address the 50 landings at Shannon Airport of which we are aware? The former President, Mrs. Mary Robinson, has made some public comments on the matter. Amnesty International made a statement on the subject in response to a direct request from the Minister for Foreign Affairs. There is growing concern across Europe about this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">The information that is now available to us contradicts the assurances given by the US Secretary Of State, Dr. Condoleezza Rice, who has not denied that the transport of prisoners has taken place but has carefully denied that such aircraft have ferried prisoners for the purposes of torture. Such information does not offer much relief to people familiar with the new US definition of "torture". According to today's <i>The Irish Times</i>, the definition was “narrowed significantly in a justice department memo of August 2002”. <i>The Irish Times</i> cited the memo which argued that torture is only torture when it involves “physical pain ... equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death”. All that Dr. Rice has denied is that such a form of torture has taken place. However, it has been admitted on behalf of the CIA that prisoners might have been transported for the purposes of what is known as “enhanced interrogation”. If I had the opportunity, I would read into the record the definition of what is meant by “enhanced interrogation”.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">Can the Taoiseach outline the assurances which have been given to him by the representatives of the US Government? Most of the activity to which I refer is taking place on foot of the Iraq war. When I questioned the Taoiseach about the war at the time, he said he did not know whether Ireland was a member of the coalition of the willing. I do not know whether he has found that out since then. If Ireland is a friendly country to the US, as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has said, it is entitled to receive the assurances to which I refer and to remind the US that while it may land its aircraft at Shannon Airport, such aircraft are liable to inspection. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has restricted his comments to assuring us that nothing untoward is going on. Given that the Taoiseach is so close to the Minister, can he interpret for the House what the Minister meant by "untoward", especially in light of what is in the public domain?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_165">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_290">I remind the House that a recent resolution passed by the United Nations, which has agreed a number of resolutions, gave a full sanction to the mission that is taking place in Iraq. Such approval has been included in a number of UN resolutions. Deputy Rabbitte is correct in that there have been considerable issues about this matter in a number of European countries and here in recent weeks. This was one of the primary reasons that the Minister for Foreign Affairs some weeks ago sought a meeting with the US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, to raise these issues with her. As the Deputy knows, that meeting took place last week. We in Ireland cannot and will not allow any aircraft engaged in what are called "extraordinary renditions" to land or refuel at any Irish airport. Ireland has not and will not facilitate torture of prisoners by any state. Any use of torture, wherever it occurs, would be wrong and deeply reprehensible. All Government powers would be exercised to preclude the use of any Irish facility where, in the language of the European Court of Human Rights, there are substantial grounds for believing there is a risk of torture of a prisoner.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">So far as we are concerned, the only definition of torture recognised is the one found in our law. This is the definition of that term in international law. We have repeatedly raised this matter with the US authorities and we have been repeatedly assured by the US authorities, including the US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, that no prisoners have been or will be transferred through this country in aircraft owned or operated by the United States or its agents. Ireland accepts the repeated assurances given by the representatives of the Government of the United States. The US authorities are aware of the importance we attach to these assurances. We have raised these matters a number of times to the highest of levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">On her present mission, the Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, is dealing with these issues. She is to give extensive press conferences later this evening at which she will deal directly with these issues and some of the questions raised on definitions. Deputy Rabbitte is saying that when questioned yesterday she did not elaborate on her definition. These issues will be raised with her later this evening. She said today in Germany that she will deal with these issues in the public domain.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">Obviously if anyone has evidence to demonstrate that prisoners have been wrongly or unlawfully transferred through Irish territory, that evidence should be passed on and we will engage with the Garda Síochána. We are not aware of any such evidence. The matter would then become an issue of law enforcement, albeit with an interstate dimension. Each application to land or refuel in Irish airports from whatever source is assessed on a case-by-case basis. That is the system. All the circumstances are considered before permission is granted to land. Ireland has honoured and continues to honour its obligations in international law and under the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_166">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_294">We are not talking about military aircraft landing with prior approval, we are talking about ostensibly civilian commercial aircraft. Clearly the Taoiseach is aware that to disguise state aircraft as civilian commercial aircraft is in breach of the Chicago Convention. It is not enough for the Taoiseach to say that anybody with evidence should give it to the Garda at Sixmilebridge. How am I supposed to get evidence? I am asking questions as an Opposition politician in this House. What steps has the Taoiseach taken? Has he just taken the assurances at face value? We got assurances that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. What steps has the Taoiseach taken to establish the truth? Is he saying that for the 50 landings at Shannon about which we now know — no thanks to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs — the aircraft were empty?</p>
          <p eId="para_295">Is the Taoiseach saying that the Government does not propose to exercise its right of inspection and search under the Chicago Convention? Does he not accept the remarks of the former President, Mary Robinson, about the Constitution imposing a responsibility for law enforcement in our jurisdiction? We are not supposed to take assurances on a matter as grave as this one at face value given the recent track record. Offering me the prospect of bringing forward evidence to the Garda locally is ludicrous. The Taoiseach is leader of the Government. While admittedly the Minister for Foreign Affairs does not have a great record in finding out things, in this situation it is the least I would expect.</p>

Aircraft may come into Ireland for refuelling stops without notifying the Department of Transport. No notification of these aircraft can be dealt with. There is the Air Service Authorisation Order 1993. I repeat what I said earlier, it has been made clear that the State must refuse permission to land in circumstances where a prisoner has been transferred other than through the process of being a bona fide extradition or where a prisoner is a sentenced prisoner. The phenomenon of transferring prisoners by way of what is called "extraordinary rendition" does not come within the category of permissible flights that can be given permission to land in the territory of the State.</p>

They were recently refused asylum in the State and they are now asking the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for leave to remain on humanitarian grounds. Many of them were opponents of the Taliban regime. On what basis is this cruel decision being made leading to them being threatened with deportation? Is it on the basis that Afghanistan is a supposed democracy, when everybody knows it is a war-torn zone? The past two months have been the bloodiest since the American invasion in 2001. Warlords rule large parts of the country with no respect for human rights or democracy. Women are routinely forced behind the burqa. Amnesty International states that those guilty of human rights abuses are entrenched in positions of power in Afghanistan. Afghanistan is a country where the United States Central Intelligence Agency runs some of its so-called "black sites", the secret prisons.

          <p eId="para_313">I am sure the Minister is well aware of the circumstances. We have completely transformed this area of Irish law and administration to meet all our international obligations. We will continue to address the challenges of migration management on an ongoing basis including tackling illegal immigration. We are putting a huge amount of resources into the provision of accommodation and into a system of fairness. The asylum determination system here compares with the best in the world in terms of fairness of decision making, determination structures, support services for asylum seekers including access to legal advice and to assistance. It provides comprehensive health, welfare, legal and translation services to applicants which are equal to the best anywhere. We have put in place three separate offices, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and the Reception Integration Agency to deal with all aspects of asylum applications, from the initial decision to appeal to co-ordinate accommodation and other support needs. That process is open to these individuals and to every individual. Everyone who has looked at our system regards it as fair. If, as announced by the Deputy, these people may be subject to persecution and all else that the Deputy outlines, those issues will be considered in a fair manner, as are other cases.</p>

          <p eId="para_314">Anybody is at risk of persecution if he or she is sent back to a country that is absolutely ravaged by war, internal strife, war lords and other evils. The Minister for Foreign Affairs was in the United States recently where he implored the United States Government for leave for some tens of thousands of our fellow citizens to remain in the US on human compassion grounds. I support that request. Those citizens should not be forced to come back here when they have made new lives for themselves in the US and they should be allowed to stay. Can we then not give to a few hundred people, who would be forced back to a much different situation than the Irish coming back here, leave to remain here and to make a new life, in the interests of human rights? As a further contribution to human rights for the Afghanis and everyone else, it is incumbent on the Taoiseach to investigate the CIA planes that have been using Shannon on their way to Guantanamo or Afghanistan. My last word on Afghanistan is that any country that tolerates secret CIA prisons where torture is practised is not a country to which this State should deport people or to which we should or send anybody back.</p>

          <p eId="para_315">As I have stated, our system is extremely transparent and is open to appeal. In September the head of the UNHCR publicly congratulated us in New York on our system at the summit meeting and said it was extremely fair. That system takes into account and makes provision for people who have suffered torture or are suspected to have suffered torture or to have had their rights infringed. Our system has allowed large numbers of people to stay in Ireland who have been through the process. We have accommodated of the order of 35,000 people in recent years under our system. The cases the Deputy raised must go through the system. I will not make a judgment on them but if the issues the Deputy raised are true, their cases will be examined fairly. It is a fair system.</p>

          <p eId="para_337">The Patents (Amendment) Bill 1999 passed Second Stage in the Dáil in November 2000. Committee Stage has yet to be taken. The primary purpose of the Bill was to give effect to certain provisions of the World Trade Organisation, WTO, agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property, known as the TRIPs agreement. Since the Bill was initiated, a number of other international developments on intellectual property rights have occurred, some of which impact on the provisions of the earlier Patents Act 1992. The Minister's view is that given the existence of the Patents (Amendment) Bill, it was prudent to take all relevant developments on board in a single Bill. It is proposed to amend the Bill on Committee Stage to include the European Patent Convention, the provisions of the Patent Law Treaty and intellectual properties Acts. I have a note and I will arrange to forward it to the Deputy. All of those issues have occurred since 1999.</p>

          <p eId="para_477">My party will not agree to the guillotining of the debate on the proposed new regime for inland fisheries, which is bitterly opposed by many anglers and communities throughout the country. The least we should have is a full scale debate on this important matter and the report that underpins it by Farrell Grant Sparks, but that is not happening. We have only 25 minutes to try to change a regime and abolish the regional fisheries boards. We are opposed to the proposal on the Order of Business.</p>

          <from>Mr. Perry</from>
          <p eId="para_478">My party is also totally opposed to the proposal. The inland fisheries review is misguided and must be rejected in full. The review proposes to centralise power and sell the State fisheries. A 25 minute debate is a total curtailment. The changes proposed in the review will not save money and will make the system less effective.</p>

          <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_479">This is a hugely important and contentious issue. A total of 100 seconds is all I have available to me as a Deputy on this side of the House to express my views on the issue. At the moment, I am using approximately 100 seconds and unfortunately one cannot say very much in that time.</p>

          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_480">The proposition that the guillotine would apply to the debate on this motion after 25 minutes is completely unacceptable. To divide the debate into five-minute slots is hardly sufficient for the Chamber on this matter, which is back from committee. Prior to its going to committee, we objected to the matter leaving this House without debate and made the case very strongly that it was essential that it be properly debated in this Chamber. If the Government believes that a 25-minute segment of time today is adequate, it fails to appreciate the serious matters that are at the heart of the measure. The time allowed is totally inadequate and we cannot and will not support the proposal.</p>

          <p eId="para_481">The motion before the House is to defer the date of the fisheries boards elections, which is 20 December, and to extend the tenure of the present boards for 12 months. As the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Gallagher, stated, we have no difficulty with having a debate on the new structures. The boards needed to be restructured and a debate on that can take place. The Whips can arrange that in the new year. The date of the election is in two weeks' time and we have to defer that, but the discussion on the new structures, the system and the process can take place in the new year.</p>

The Department of Education and Science and the Department of Health and Children are in discussion on the establishment of a pre-employment consultancy office. The legislation arises out of the North-South Ministerial Council and we are trying to find a mechanism whereby we can make progress. I raised it when I was in the North and while we have not yet found a solution, we are trying to make progress on the lines we originally intended. I hope to have some news on it shortly.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_701">Regional Fisheries Boards (Postponement of Elections) Order 2005,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_702">copies of which were laid before Dáil Éireann on 22 November 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">I welcome the opportunity to discuss the motion and, more generally, the Government's proposals for the restructuring of the inland fisheries sector. I gave an assurance at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources last week, following a request by Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the Green Party, and the Taoiseach also gave this assurance on the Order of Business, that the new structure of the boards issue will be debated during the next session.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">The management and development of the inland fisheries sector resides with the Central Fisheries Board and the seven regional fisheries boards. Elections to the regional boards are due to take place on 20 December 2005. However, I propose, subject to the approval of the Dáil and the Seanad, to make an order postponing elections for one year. If this is not done, the boards will fall.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">In 2003, a consortium of expert consultants led by FGS Consulting was appointed to undertake a significant review of the inland fisheries sector. While a number of reviews and reports on the sector had been completed in the past, many of these focused on selected aspects or particular dimensions of the sector. It was, therefore, decided, in light of a number of new opportunities for adopting a new approach to the sector, including the implementation of the EU water framework, to undertake a review which would be holistic in nature and which would involve a root and branch examination of the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">The Department was firmly of the view that to secure the future of the very valuable and unique inland fisheries resource, it was critical to identify and address in a comprehensive manner the issues that have detracted from the optimum operation and development of the sector and threatened the long-term sustainability of the resource. During the consultation undertaken as part of the review process, the consultants found that there was a unanimous view among various interests that the current sectoral model was in need of a fundamental change.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">On 15 November 2005, the FGS report on the review of inland fisheries was published and details were announced of Government policy adopted on the restructuring of the sector. There are differences between the report's recommendations and Government policy. The Government has decided that a fundamental restructuring of the sector will take place on an incremental basis, in two phases, between 2006 and 2008. This restructuring process is based on four key principles as follows: subject to appropriate regulation, local users and beneficiaries will be empowered to take responsibility for the management, promotion and development of the fisheries; the role of the Department will focus primarily on the protection and conservation of the inland fisheries resource; subject to appropriate regulation, regional management structures, representative of all users-beneficiaries stakeholders, will be created to manage access, development and maintenance of fisheries; and the establishment of a regulatory regime to oversee appropriate mechanisms governing the transfer and use of and access to fisheries, the licensing, including distribution of rights of fishery activities, in the commercial and recreational areas and the determination of fishing effort and total allowable catches etc. in regard to fish stocks.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">The restructuring of the fisheries boards will involve the establishment of a single strengthened national inland fisheries authority, the establishment of strong regional advisory boards and the transfer to the Marine Institute of the current resources and responsibilities of the inland fisheries sector relating to research. The second phase of development will involve a move to a model to give effect to the principles underpinning the reform, whereby local users and beneficiaries of the inland fisheries sector will be empowered to take responsibility for the effective management of fisheries and the fisheries resource, subject to appropriate regulation. Phase 2 will be the subject of an extensive, open and inclusive consultation process designed to achieve optimum buy-in from all stakeholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">A question was raised about licence increases. It was generally accepted by all parties that a fee increase of 2.1% should be sanctioned this year. That is reasonable as it is in line with the consumer price index. We can also avoid the big bang, which occurred a number of years ago. The increase was accepted by the joint committee without a division.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnPerry" eId="spk_272">
          <from>Mr. Perry</from>
          <p eId="para_710">The motion is before the House as a result of the inland fisheries review, which is seriously misguided and needs to be rejected in full. The review proposes to centralise power and sell the State fisheries. The changes put forward in the review will not save money and will not make the system more effective. They will, instead, remove executive power from regional boards and will base power in one central unit, which runs totally contrary to decentralisation. The Minister of State also proposes to sell valuable fishery resources. This is a ridiculous suggestion and the review does not expand on how this would be done. It is unworkable and it is not in the best interest of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">Problems exist in the current inland fisheries model but the staff involved are doing an excellent job considering the lack of funding provided by the State. While the allocation increased this year, stacked up costs and the lack of funding to invest in restocking has negated its impact. The boards operate a highly efficient and effective service with a small budget compared to that of other State organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">While the Minister of State has said restructuring is required, he has not detailed why or in what areas, which is remiss of him. More uniformity is badly needed in the system. The regional boards have followed Government guidelines but the Minister of State and the Government have not given direction in many areas. The review also recommends that ownership of the fisheries be transferred from the State to local interests but no detail is given in this regard or direction offered as to how these management structures will be formed and how they will operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">Angling tourism contributes significant revenue to the Exchequer. Our fisheries should never be ceded from State control. This notion is unworkable and it is not in the best interest of the State economically, nor is it in the interest of the long-term protection of fish stocks. Many other recommendations are grossly unsound. Under the proposed policy, the scientific unit of the Central Fisheries Board will be transferred to the Marine Institute. Given that the unit is widely acknowledged as a major success, why is the Minister of State moving it?</p>
          <p eId="para_714">The review also creates enormous uncertainty for staff of the fisheries boards over the next three years. What will happen to the seven regional directors? The review does not specify whether there will be staff reductions or redundancies or what will happen to staff in autonomous positions.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">The second phase of the policy will involve consultation and will take place from 2006 to 2008. It took two years to publish the Farrell Grant Sparks report and it has been on the Minister's desk since last February. It is now December, so why did it take so many months to publish it? During the duration of the second phase staff of fisheries boards will be left in limbo for at least another two years while the Minister consults on their future. That is not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">It is ridiculous that it took so long to publicise this policy. The review was commissioned two years ago and has been finished since February. What was the hold-up in publishing it? The policy pulls power back into the middle. Responsibility will be taken out of the hands of the current governing regional boards and they will become regional advisory boards. Their power will be totally diminished and they will just be talking shops. That is a retrograde step. It means that those working on the ground in a given area will have to go to the central unit to make a decision. The nature of a board's work is such that decision-making needs to be carried out at local level, but that will not be the case. The proposals are illogical. They run contrary to decentralisation and do not bode well for our fisheries. They will have a significant impact in the north west and throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">The implementation of this policy needs to be blocked as it needs further discussion. I am disappointed at the limited consultation with the fisheries boards prior to publication of the report. There was obviously consultation with Farrell Grant Sparks on the report, but many of those involved in the fisheries boards did not know what was coming. It is a pity, when we have an autonomous effective system working in regional boards, that there was not more consultation and investment by the State. The fact that the policy is being deferred for another two years will mean there will be inaction. The Minister of State now says it will be two years before we will have an overall policy. He says he is bringing about uniformity by bringing in one central director, but that takes power from people who have delivered effectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">I am disappointed there was not more consultation on this. The deferment of elections is only a stop-gap measure to keep people on board. The real power is being taken and there is no commitment to people who are working effectively. The rug is being pulled from under their feet.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_273">
          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_719">It is regrettable that the Farrell Grant Sparks review of the inland fisheries sector and the issue of the postponement of the elections to the fisheries boards were not brought before the Dáil last spring when the report was available so that Members would have a full opportunity to give proper and careful consideration to measures proposed to bring about a massive transformation of how our inland fisheries are managed.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">A significant number of our people — perhaps a minimum of 100,000 — take part in angling, a sport that is supported by young and old. There are grave concerns, particularly with regard to the regulator and the perceived possible sell-off of our valuable inland fisheries resources. It will be much more difficult for local communities to manage inland waterways.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">I welcome this belated debate and thank the Minister of State for his part in bringing it about, but the 25 minutes allowed for it do not permit adequate discussion of this important aspect of our national life. Anglers and other stakeholders wonder whether the abolition of the central and regional fisheries boards and the subsuming of their executive functions into the national inland fisheries authority, the proposed new authority to be based in Carrick-on-Shannon, flies in the face of the Government's decentralisation policy. We saw last week that this policy is in grave difficulties with few people wanting to move from Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">Attention has been drawn to the fact that the existing organisation of the central and regional boards will be replaced by regional advisory committees once the consultation period is over. There is grave concern as to what extent valuable local knowledge which has been built up over decades and generations about water catchment areas, water quality and, most importantly, fishery stocks will impact on the new centralised agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">There is a feeling among the inland fisheries community that there has not been sufficient consultation. The Minister of State said he would have this year for that, but it would have been a better approach to launch the report in the House when it was published, have a full debate and then put it to the boards during the past six months for consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">It is bizarre that at the same time as we have the dismantling of the marine section of the Department, with different functions of the Department being split into two or possibly three sections, the Minister of State talks about a new joined-up strategy for inland fisheries. I agree with that, but the Department does not seem to be pursuing it in a coherent manner. Members and stakeholders would like to see the legislation for the national inland fisheries authority as early as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">The Minister of State announced last week the establishment of the regulatory regime to oversee mechanisms governing the transfer, use of and access to fishery licensing in the commercial and recreational areas and the determination of fisheries effort and total allowable catches etc. The gravest concern arising from this is the possibility that a situation may evolve whereby valuable resources will be hived off and privatised.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">Like my colleagues, I am concerned about the abolition of the research role of the Central Fisheries Board and its absorption into the Marine Institute. The Marine Institute has done incredibly valuable work, but so too has the Central Fisheries Board. When I first became spokesperson for my party on this issue, the board's Indecon report was invaluable to me and informed all I thought and said on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">The detailed Farrell Grant Sparks report raises some important issues, particularly regarding fishing effort and stocks. However, people's concerns about the maintenance and preservation of our inland fisheries far outweigh these. The report refers to the integration of the conservation and preservation of inland fisheries species and their habitats into the wider ecological and environmental heritage. It focuses on the water quality agenda for the country as a whole. These are valuable ambitions and policy objectives. However, in a year when we have seen a dramatic fall-off in numbers of visiting anglers and when we have had ongoing debate within the angling community across Europe on salmon conservation, the report seems to be a diktat in that it recommends the implementation of a dictatorial policy for inland fisheries.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JerryCowleyIND" eId="spk_274">
          <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
          <p eId="para_728">I will share my time with Deputies Eamon Ryan and Ó Caoláin.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">This is a serious issue. This policy throws out the baby with the bath water. It will result in our fisheries being totally unprotected. When fisheries are handed back to the stakeholders, they will not be able to afford to keep the staff to continue the good job they do — we can see the good job the staff does in the Moy fisheries in Ballina, for example.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">When the fisheries boards confined their activities during the foot and mouth disease crisis, there was a total take-over by illegal anglers. That situation will recur when the people doing such a good job are removed. The Government should reconsider the situation carefully. Similar centralisation happened with the health boards and democracy was taken out of the equation. How will the IFA and other people currently on the boards be represented? We will end up in the same position as with the HSE where democracy has been thrown out the door.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">The good work that has been done, such as deprivatisation of fisheries and their return to the State, will be eroded and other resources will no longer be available. This report is no panacea for lack of resources. There are hardly sufficient resources to do the job currently, but taking the path the report recommends means the stakeholders will not be able to cope. The resources will not be there and the staff will not be available. There will be chaos, just like during the foot and mouth disease outbreak when fisheries officers could not do their job and poachers took over.</p>

          <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_732">I will try to be brief, given the 100 seconds I have to speak. I would welcome a longer debate so we could discuss the merits and demerits of the range of proposals that are being considered. I am not a supporter of keeping the system as it is currently. While local knowledge has worked well, other aspects of it have not been so successful. I refer to cronyism and poor management of the current structures. We need to change.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">In his presentation, the Minister of State emphasised several times that he is not centralising anything which makes me think he is centralising something because he would not be denying it so strongly if he were not. Clearly, there is a certain amount of centralisation of powers about which my party is concerned. We believe in decentralisation in a real sense rather than the Government allocation of Departments around the country. We are concerned in that regard about the nature of the centralisation that may result from the proposed changes. However, I welcome certain changes such as the lack of duplication in the marine research area. It may be appropriate to have certain areas of strength. There are only so many people in the country with real scientific expertise in this area and perhaps it makes sense to pool those resources. That is a debate for another day.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">Ensuring that we keep in office the same elected people is a poor start to the process. On that basis I am opposed to the motion. I look forward to a debate on the wider issue.</p>

        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_276">
          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_735">I thank the Minister of State for pressing for this debate, albeit a short one. In this brief opportunity, I record Sinn Féin's opposition to the intended changes in the administration and control mechanisms over our inland fisheries arising from the Farrell Grant Sparks report. This postponement of elections order is a facilitation measure and is, accordingly, also being opposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">The Minister of State must note the concerns expressed by many people who enjoy access to the great resource that is our inland fisheries. He stated that local users and beneficiaries will be empowered to take responsibility for the management, promotion and development of our lakes and rivers. Will the Minister of State explain why the reference is to local users only and will he give a definition of "local"? To what beneficiaries does he refer? How would he define the term "beneficiary" in regard to inland waterways as distinct from users of same? I have many questions and so far the answers are very few.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">In the absence of detail, concerns and fears will fill the vacuum. That said, there is enough to give rise to concern about the future control of our inland waterways. Is this the thin end of the wedge of private control over a public natural and national resource? Such questions must be addressed. I look forward to a greater opportunity for debate, in line with the commitment given by the Taoiseach.</p>

        <speech by="#PatTheCope" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_277">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
          <p eId="para_738">I will not have an opportunity to respond to all the questions that have been raised. I repeat the commitment which I gave in committee and affirmed by the Taoiseach today that we will have a full debate in the House in the next session in which I will have an opportunity to go into more detail on the questions asked.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">The purpose of the motion is the postponement of the elections to the regional fisheries boards for a further 12 months. Given the imminence of significant changes to the sector, it is reasonable that I should request the Houses' approval to postpone the elections for 12 months. I do so in line with section 15 of the Fisheries Act 1980 to ensure continuity and a seamless changeover. I hope the legislation to provide for the new authority will be in place by the middle of next year. The regional advisory boards will still continue to play an important part in the development of inland fisheries.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">In my initial contribution I referred to the fact that I did not accept all the proposals made by Farrell Grant Sparks. Two very important points came from the regional boards. The boards will still have responsibility for water quality. I will ask them to work closely in this matter with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Environmental Protection Agency. It was also suggested in the report that we would remove responsibility for tourism angling. Neither I nor the Government accepted this proposal and the boards will still have responsibility for this area. I will ask them to work closely with the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism and Fáilte Ireland. We must take full advantage of the structures in place in that Department and in Fáilte Ireland. They will have to work very closely together. I will monitor developments there together with my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">I received the report in February of last year. It is a long and detailed report and, given my other responsibilities, it took me some time to read it. The next step was to get the views of other Ministers, especially those who will deal with some aspects of it, namely, the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Arts, Sport and Tourism and Finance. That took some time. Following the summer recess and on receipt of the observations of the other Departments I asked the Government to approve the recommendations I made, which it did. Shortly after that I launched the report following it being printed.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">There are two phases to this process. Phase 2 will result in further unhurried consultation that will be completely transparent. All those with concerns will have an opportunity to make known their views. I wish to allay fears in so far as staff are concerned. I did that when I met the chief executives and chairpersons of each of the boards. This phase will have no implications for staff. I accept, as Deputy Perry pointed out, that there is uncertainty. I want to ensure this uncertainty will be removed. However, it may be decided to make some changes. For instance, the boards may in future be based on water districts and this may require changes, but there will be ample opportunity to discuss any such change.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">I believe it is sensible to locate research in the Marine Institute. It provides expert scientific advice to us and the regional and central fisheries boards on salmon fisheries. We are about to commission a world class facility for the marine research institute in Galway. Through both institutes working together we can enhance the limited research capacity of the Central Fisheries Board. I look forward to a full debate some time next year when we will have greater opportunities to flesh out what is in the report.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_22">Question again proposed: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</summary>
        <speech by="#PhilipHogan" eId="spk_278">
          <from>Mr. Hogan</from>
          <p eId="para_870">Fine Gael welcomes the Bill but is at a loss as to why it took so long to come before the House. I know the Minister of State will probably have a plausible explanation for it taking so long to become part of legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">The Bill is a transposition of an EU directive into Irish law and the deadline for submissions from interested parties dates back to September 2003. The original target date for enactment of this law was March 2005, and now we are in December. I am aware that drawing up legislation is a complicated affair and can take some time, but it has taken a very long time to enact this legislation. From time to time we are at the mercy of the European Union with regard to the implementation of EU directives. The publication of the legislative agenda has shown just how light is the Government schedule. The delay in getting this Bill into the House is a timely reminder of just how much remains to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">It has always made good business sense to keep employees fully informed about what is going on in a company. Any manager knows that to keep morale and productivity high, he or she must make everyone feel like a stakeholder, a fully paid up member of the team. I fundamentally believe in the worker shareholding agenda. I recall John Bruton as Minister for Finance in the 1980s introducing tax incentives to ensure that workers would take shareholdings, for their personal benefit, in particular companies. This was the germination of the stakeholder agenda which ensured that workers were part and parcel of a particular company's affairs. In the past few years we have seen in the public sector, in the context of privatisation of those companies, that 14.9% of some of the companies privatised have been assigned to workers and that the dividend for workers from those decisions has been enormous.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">We cannot in a civilised society view a firm's labour force as anything other than an integral part of the decision-making process. Workers are not just a resource to be turned on and off as conditions permit but a vital component in any management team. The provision of information to them is a vital component in any management strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">Under the Bill, employers will have to provide information and consultation on issues such as the probable development of a firm's activities, the structure and future of employment in the business and any decisions likely to lead to major changes in work organisation or contracts. The Bill also obliges employers to provide enough information to enable worker representatives to make adequate preparations for consultation. Employers must begin negotiations to set up information and consultation procedures once 10% of employees make such a request. The Labour Court will be able to investigate disputes about the operation of these agreements. Employers could face fines of up to €30,000 for breaches of the proposed legislation. Those are significant penalties.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">This Bill is part of a suite of worker rights legislation. It is worth reminding the country that those on the far left who oppose the European project are being deceitful when they say that the EU is anything but a social project because it has been a leading force in giving better working conditions for Irish employees and forcing national parliaments, including the Irish Parliament, to bring about better working conditions for our workers. It is interesting to note that in the context of the Irish Ferries dispute, it was the absence of agreement and support from the Government with regard to the maritime directive, the manning directive, that led in some part towards the dispute we now see. If Ireland and other countries had supported the conditions that were inherently important for workers in EU states with regard to that manning directive, that would have made a significant difference in the resolution of the dispute between Irish Ferries and workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">Employers should also be generally satisfied with this Bill. It strikes a fair balance between employers and employees in sharing information. As I said, employees must be part and parcel of the entire management team to have forward-looking and constructive company practice. I share the Minister's belief that the Bill does not tie the hands of business and is sufficiently flexible. For example, employers have the option under the Bill of putting in place agreements before a date to be prescribed following enactment of the Bill, known as pre-existing agreements, which can be tailor-made to suit the culture and circumstances of their company.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">In a press statement of 19 September, IBEC stated that any measures that make Irish business less able to adapt to changing global markets will undermine competitiveness and put jobs at risk. It said that companies that already have successful information and consultation procedures should be supported and allowed to continue without change. I agree and hope that when the legislation is enacted they will see that our competitiveness will not be undermined by this legislation. By the time Committee Stage is concluded, I do not believe it will. There are many Government actions and decisions that have hurt business, and that is not down to lack of employee consultation but because stealth taxes and charges imposed by the Government gave birth to"rip-off Ireland".</p>
          <p eId="para_878">During Question Time in the House today the Minister chose to ignore the fact that we have not got the necessary resources to back up the Competition Authority and investigate, in the interests of the consumer, the anti-competitive practices and cartel agreements, official or unofficial. This Bill has nothing to do with that but it is required to ensure that everyone is in the loop.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">The Bill specifically precludes companies employing fewer than 50 employees. That is important and there are sound reasons for it. Small firms have a particular need to be protected from over-regulation and their distinctive competitive disadvantage means the Government must endeavour to protect them at all costs, not least because they tend to be indigenous. We must ensure that those who work in small firms are not treated as inferior to those who work in large companies. Just because an employer has only 45 staff, for example, does not mean his or her workers should be treated with less than the respect and dignity afforded to those who work for large corporations such as Microsoft and Coca Cola. I am interested to hear the Minister's views on how we can ensure that the provision of information is extended to everyone, notwithstanding that the legislation stipulates a requirement in respect of employers with more than 50 staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">Before the summer recess, my party's deputy spokesperson on enterprise, trade and employment, Deputy Pat Breen, met a number of individuals on my behalf who have formed a support group for victims of workplace bullying. These people have lost their livelihoods and have had to endure severe financial, emotional, psychological and medical hardship as a result of how they were treated by their employers and colleagues. They told Deputy Breen that one of the key ways in which they were mistreated was the withholding of information and the deliberate attempt by their tormentors to keep them in the dark, out of the decision-making process and without the necessary information to do their jobs. What is the Minister of State's views on how we can use legislation such as this to place a legal obligation on employers to ensure nobody can become the victim of an information black hole? It is a tool often used by those seeking to rid themselves of persons they view as more competent, talented and worthy of a particular employment than themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">The discussion of this Bill comes against the backdrop of the Irish Ferries dispute. That the management flatly refuses to recognise the legitimacy of the Labour Court's recommendations is very disappointing. Now that it seems clear Irish Ferries is operating within the law in reflagging the <i>MV Normandy</i> under the flag of the Bahamas, I urge the Minister to lead the way in convincing our European partners to change EU law in this area to protect workers. I note that the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Gallagher, has signalled the necessary U-turn in respect of the Government’s policy on the manning directive which I mentioned earlier. This directive was opposed by the Government in 2004 and that mistake is now acknowledged. The Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, is working hard to undo the damage done on the occasion of the meeting of transport Ministers. I hope he is successful and that it will make a contribution to the Irish Ferries dispute, which has serious consequences for the economy, particularly in regard to exports, employees’ working standards and the future of the partnership process.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">The Bill is opportune in the context of that dispute and I hope we will see it enacted as soon as possible. As spokesman for Fine Gael, my party welcomes the Bill. I am sure we will table some amendments on Committee Stage, however, and I look forward to the ensuing discussions with the Minister. The legislation must be enacted speedily in the context of employers and employees having the fullest possible information available to them. This will ensure we have a strong and thriving enterprise sector and an enterprising economy.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaudgeConnolly" eId="spk_279">
          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_883">I too welcome this Bill, which has taken so long to come before the House. I understand the final date for submissions was September 2003 and the intended date for enactment was March 2005. Prior to that, it took about five years to prepare the corresponding EU directive. The Bill comes at the end of a long process. It will provide for the implementation of EU Directive 2002/14 EC and its transposition into Irish law.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">We regularly complain about EU legislation but it has not all been bad. In terms of workers' rights and women's rights, for example, much useful legislation has come from Europe. The purpose of this directive is to establish a framework for informing and consulting employees. Information is the key issue. It is important to keep people in the loop because it gives them a sense of ownership. Happier workers are more productive. The directive establishes a right to new minimum standards for workforce communication and involvement in a company's operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">The basic case for these new standards is fair play for people at work. It is simply not acceptable for employees to be informed by the media that they are to lose their jobs. We have often seen photographs or footage of shocked workers who are told on a Monday morning that their jobs will be gone the following Friday. In such cases, families often find themselves in the tragic situation where a husband and wife, for example, work for the same employer. Such couples may have taken out a mortgage on the basis of the jobs they believed were secure and arranged their lifestyle around a particular standard of living. To be told all that will be taken away in a matter of days is difficult. If there were an obligation that workers must be put on notice and given some information, they might forego the large mortgage or expensive holiday. Statutory redundancy is no substitute for a good weekly wage. Large-scale job losses are generally accompanied by the establishment of a task force to find replacement jobs. To some extent, however, this is merely a way of making the bitter pill a little easier to swallow.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">The Bill seems to be very much oriented to the business sector and private companies. However, there is great need for these types of provisions in the public sector. I have encountered cases in the health service, for example, where people are kept in the dark about the services to be provided in different areas. This leads to great cynicism about services and lack of trust between workers and management. Public service workers must also be kept in the loop. The lack of emphasis in this regard may be because the public service is supposed to have processes in place that are in keeping with the essence of the EU directive and the Bill, but I do not agree that is the case. In many elements of the public service, the buzz is to have workers involved in partnerships. That is supposed to facilitate communication, but it is simply not working and is another issue that must be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">The general thrust of the Bill seems to be directed towards small and medium sized enterprises. In recent years, local authorities have devised strategic plans in which communications with employers is a major contributory factor in the improvement of performance and productivity in local authorities. A major contributor to the high performing workplace is a climate of mutual trust, confidence and respect. This can only be developed where there is regular and honest communication. There is no doubt that some private sector companies do not have a good record in terms of honest communication. This legislation will help to create an environment where successes can be acknowledged and difficult decisions taken with constructive input from all those affected. If workers are kept informed, it will be found that most have common sense and will bite the bullet when difficult decisions must be made. This legislation can be of benefit in this regard if correctly utilised.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">Naturally, employees wish to get adequate financial compensation for their work and proper conditions in which to perform it. However, their views must be recognised and taken into account in the running of a business. Management and owners would do well to take on board the untapped knowledge that exists among employees. Workers who are included are happier and will offer employers good ideas. Nothing gives a worker a greater sense of pride than the knowledge that his or her idea is used and that he or she is respected as an individual.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">There is a growing realism in employees' perception of the ongoing challenges facing the organisations for which they work. They recognise that the state of employer-employee relations has an impact on the success of the organisation and are, in the main, prepared to play their part. It is vital that employees are part of mature relationships with employers and that there is a supportive culture rather than a blame culture that can impede progress and innovation. There is no point in management pointing fingers at workers or <i>vice versa</i>. That will achieve nothing. The realisation is growing that a culture of constructive consultation is good for both.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">Good information and consultation processes will encourage a sense of belonging and commitment to an organisation. Such a system can contribute to much improved performance in the workplace. There is already a good deal of information sharing and consultation in some companies and that should be left untouched. Such companies already see the value of the type of process we are trying to introduce into legislation. I do not believe it will affect in a negative way any of the good practices which already exist. The legislation will not cut across existing good practice or impose rigid arrangements on many businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">The thrust of the legislation appears to be to give the right to information and consultation to those who want it and, in so doing, to support good existing practice. It is obvious that the level and genuineness of consultation will be important. The more trusting the relationship between an employer and his or her employees, the more likely it is that employees will take on board new responsibilities and help to address the problems of companies. Other benefits which will accrue from the provision of information and consultation will include improvements in employee contributions, such as increased productivity and greater involvement in solving problems and generating new ideas. Direct forms of information and communication include team briefings, newsletters, notice boards and the Intranet.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">While consultation mechanisms normally vary, consultation and negotiation generally take place with representatives of recognised trade unions. If consultation is not firmly based on dialogue, it will be a one-way process and might lead to resentment and a lack of engagement. The biggest obstacle to the development of meaningful dialogue is when both parties enter discussions with entrenched positions and without any interest in reaching agreement. How often have we heard that parties have been locked in Labour Court talks for many months, whereas an official is running between a group sitting in one room at the court and another group sitting in a different room? While that is an extreme example, it beggars belief that such behaviour can be described as dialogue or a form of talks. People should see such behaviour for what it is, which is the opposite of good or useful practice. A great deal of the Labour Court's time is spent dealing with groups which are not engaging in dialogue.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_280">
          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_893">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the Employees (Provision of Information and Consultation) Bill 2005. My colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who is the Green Party spokesman on enterprise, trade and employment, has outlined the party's general support for the Bill as it relates to the implementation of the EU directive, with the proviso that we are concerned that it has taken so long to advance the process of enactment of the directive. We are also concerned that the directive is being implemented in a narrow way, which means that an opportunity to advance Irish labour law could be lost. If there is ever a time when we need to show Irish labour law in the most positive light possible, this is it.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">Deputy Hogan outlined the positive nature of some labour law that has emerged from EU directives in the past. I do not disagree with him in that regard, although I would probably take issue with his implication about those who have opposed various EU directives. The nature of the European Union has changed since Ireland became a member state in 1973. As the EU was largely protectionist in its economic inclinations at that time, its labour protection and equal opportunity legislation was geared to protect people as well as — perhaps I am mistaken — the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">We have since moved to another extreme in the EU's thinking, as it seems to be in favour of unrestricted <i>laissez-faire</i> free market economics. If we examine the Commission’s most recent directives — I refer to labour directives, particularly the services directive — we will have concerns about how they value the role of workers within the economic process. Deputy Hogan also referred to the role of the Government in the most recent debate in this regard. Unfortunately, the Government has been philosophically inclined to support the prevailing view. It specifically opposed the mariners directive, which would have given employment rights to people who engage in their trade on the open seas, in international waters. The Government has taken a far from proactive position on this matter at EU level. It has helped to scupper the attempts to put in place positive legislation in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">The Bill, which is very welcome, will introduce some measures which are badly needed. There is a concern that the Bill seems to have been introduced in isolation, despite the lateness of its presentation. Given that other lacunae exist in employment legislation, I wonder why steps are not being taken to assist whistleblowers. People will trust information on the quality of a workplace or a commercial institution if they know the quality of the work being done is of the highest possible standard. We are introducing legislation that will ensure that people in most enterprises of a particular size are given information they can act upon to make their enterprises better. It is unfortunate that the Government has chosen not to legislate to allay the general concern about the action that might be taken against employees who expose illegal activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">The concerns about the narrow implementation of the Bill relate to the fact that the Government has chosen to stagger the approach being taken in respect of companies with between 50 and 150 employees. The new regulations will not apply to enterprises with fewer than 50 employees. The definition of a small or medium sized enterprise is more appropriate in Ireland than it would be in some parts of Europe. Some SMEs in Germany have up to 15,000 employees, whereas most SMEs in Ireland employ fewer than 50 employees. While I accept Deputy Hogan's point about the need to avoid over-regulation — we should not over-burden SMEs through over-regulation — there is a need to introduce an appropriate culture in businesses of a smaller size. If we do not have a legislative instrument to do that, it is incumbent on the Government to say how it proposes to introduce the values to which the EU directive and the Bill aspire in enterprises of fewer than 50 employees.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">Many larger enterprises in Ireland are not indigenous to this country. They are the companies whose foreign direct investment we have been fortunate enough to attract to Ireland. Many people have the impression that many such companies are operating here with the proviso that they can do so without the involvement of trade unions. While we are obliged, morally and otherwise, to introduce this directive into our legislation, I would be interested to know the degree to which the Government has consulted enterprises which do not operate in this culture. I refer to companies which do not go out of their way to discourage the existence of labour representation. I hope the introduction of this legislation does not conflict with that, but I suspect that it might. The Government needs to state how that difficulty might be overcome in any ministerial order it uses to introduce the Bill in various workplaces.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">The need for all-embracing labour relations is especially pertinent in the present times. Public representatives of the various political parties need to send out a clear message that workers are most valued in all this country's economic enterprises. I fear that a debate is being engineered by those who do not share such values, but instead think that workers are expendable, are there to be used and are units of production. Regardless of whether we have legislation that informs workers of what is going on in the businesses in which they work and of how it is hoped to change and improve such businesses into the future, workers are less secure than ever before in the current employment context. There may be less interest in that at a time of high labour mobility and economic success, but that might not always be the case. Economic cycles occur and we have been more fortunate than most in our history in that this economic cycle has been longer and deeper in a positive sense than others. Despite this, a time may come when the expectation to be employed in an enterprise which guarantees future employment and properly values the individual contribution to the workings of an economic enterprise may no longer exist. If that becomes lost, it will be our collective loss as a society.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Killeen)</from>
          <p eId="para_900">I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate. I am grateful in being facilitated in completing the debate tonight to ensure that the committee can deal with the matter during what is euphemistically referred to as the Christmas recess, which is a time when committees do an enormous amount of their work. I hope that we will be back for Report Stage in the Dáil early in the new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">All sides have acknowledged that the Bill will make an enormous contribution. Virtually all Deputies who spoke referred to the late transposition, as I did in my opening speech. I used the intervening time for consultation, although not as successfully as I would have liked. Parties with opposing views continue to hold those views. However, I believe the Bill is greatly improved for the time and effort that went into the consultation process.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">In transposing the directive we faced a choice between applying the legislation to undertakings with at least 50 employees or establishments with at least 20 employees. A number of Deputies questioned this matter. One of the reasons we decided to go with undertakings with at least 50 employees was that the majority of submissions received on foot of the consultation paper favoured the undertakings route. There were also some other advantages, which I am sure we will thrash out on Committee Stage, regarding establishments that frequently have fewer than 20 employers but may have several employees in their undertakings throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_903">Deputies Perry and Boyle sought clarification on the definition of a small and medium enterprise, SME. Under EU rules, an SME is defined as an enterprise which employs fewer than 250 persons and which has an annual turnover not exceeding €50 million and-or an annual balance sheet not exceeding €43 million. This is quite different from what we understand to be an SME in this country in many respects.</p>
          <p eId="para_904">Deputy Hogan referred to the bullying element when a deficit of information exists. It would have been very difficult to address the entire complex bullying issue in the context of this legislation. However, as I explained earlier on Question Time, we intend to do so in the context of legislative proposals I hope to put to Government. Deputy Connolly questioned the involvement of the public sector, a matter with which we will deal in considerable detail on Committee Stage. We dealt with the matter in the Seanad and I will give further explanation on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">Deputy Boyle referred to the danger of the services directive and what he sees as an EU move away from the protection of employees. I do not find this to be the case when attending Council meetings, one of which I will attend the day after tomorrow. In general the EU has made a very positive contribution to the quality of Irish labour law. He questioned the whistleblower provisions. Anybody who has looked closely at this Bill will agree that the protections for employees in the context of the Bill are extraordinarily strong, perhaps the strongest provisions made in legislation heretofore. The Government's view in this regard is that we should take a sectoral approach, which is what we have done in this Bill and in the health and safety legislation in which the Deputies opposite were involved. We intend to do the same across a range of sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">Deputy Boyle also stated that, in general, foreign direct investment, FDI, companies do not recognise trade unions. I refer Deputies to the considerable amendments made to section 6 of the Bill since it was first published. Many of these amendments deal with trade union concerns in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_907">The transposition of the directive for the information and consultation of employees as provided in the Bill achieves the best possible balance. We should recognise that strongly opposing views exist. I was very impressed by the quality of contributions in this House and in the Seanad which showed a considerable level of information in the intention of the directive. We have tried to transpose it allowing as much leeway as possible for the strong and successful voluntarist tradition that exists in the country to inform the culture which will underpin information and consultation under the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">Deputies Ryan and Boyle had questions about the phase-in application, which is provided for in Article 10 of the directive. It seems to sit very comfortably with our traditional voluntarist approach. A number of Deputies, including Deputies Howlin, Boyle, Healy and Ryan, considered our approach to be minimalist. I would strongly contend that we have struck a particularly good balance allowing the maximum flexibility to both employers and employees to have a system that best suits their own circumstances. If we had attempted to take a one-size-fits-all approach, we would have done enormous damage and would not have adhered to the intent of the directive. It certainly would not have made a positive contribution to Irish labour law in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">A number of Deputies also raised the issue of trade union recognition. We need to recognise this is a fundamentally different issue from the intention of the information and consultation directive. If a case for addressing the issue exists, it is not in the context of this legislation. It would be entirely inappropriate to use the background of this directive to deal with that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">Deputies also asked about the trigger mechanism, on which strongly opposing views exist. The directive refers to the right of employees to be informed and consulted about certain matters affecting them. As such, employees can choose whether to exercise this right. The choice is left to each member state to decide how to trigger this right or whether to provide that it automatically applies. The opt-in trigger mechanism provided for in the Bill ensures that a minimum number support such an arrangement being put in place while avoiding an unnecessary burden on enterprises where the employee demand for such arrangement does not exist. This point was made strongly and lucidly by Deputy Hogan and others and we need to take it into account. Having a minimum number and a maximum number for the trigger mechanism would strike a very good middle ground. It is not just employees who can initiate negotiations. The Bill provides that the employer can also do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">Deputy Durkan referred to agency workers. As was the case in the Seanad, this will be a central element of the debate on Committee Stage. Ultimately it comes down to whether the employee is on a contract of service or a contract for service with the employer as to whether the agency or the principal employer has the obligations under information and consultation. It is important that this is provided in undertakings of a particular size. I am entirely satisfied that the approach we have taken in the Bill provides that people with agencies have the same rights as others depending on the size of the company at the particular time.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">This directive dates from 1997 when the Renault assembly plant in Vilvoorde in Belgium closed and the manner in which the decision was announced. Deputies on all sides pointed to enormous advantages that accrue when enterprises have a good level of information and consultation. During the Seanad debate I felt that people were reading into the intent of the legislation something that goes considerably beyond what was intended. Ultimately this is about information and consultation alone. It provides for a very positive workplace ethos if both employers and employees adopt the principles in the manner for which we have provided. We have tried to give people maximum flexibility. In some circumstances it suits individual employees to have information supplied directly to them. In some enterprises this already happens to an extraordinarily high standard and very effectively. In other cases this does not happen and in some of those cases it is clearly open to individual workers or groups of workers to seek that a representational system be introduced as is provided for in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">The legislation provides for very strong penalties in the event that an employer fails to provide information and consultation. Equally importantly and in groundbreaking terms we have provided for a number of protections for employees going far beyond what is provided for in other legislation. I hope the Bill can be progressed through Committee Stage during the recess and that we will be back in this Chamber for Report Stage. I assure Deputies that I approach this legislation with an open mind. I said that in the Seanad. I accepted a number of amendments in that House having been persuaded during the debate, especially on Report Stage.</p>

          <from>Mr. Timmins</from>
          <p eId="para_921">The purpose of the Good Samaritan Bill 2005 is to protect from liability those who go to the assistance of others who may be ill or injured as a result of an accident or other emergency. This legislation will ensure that those who intervene to give help to others, and who offer this assistance in good faith, cannot be penalised or held liable as a result of their intervention. Health care professionals, acting in the course of their employment, are exempted from the terms of this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">Section 1 deals with the Title of the Bill. Section 2 lays down to whom the Bill is applicable and outlines a defence for damages unless these damages are caused by gross negligence or a health care professional acting in the course of employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">This is a simple and practical Bill, requiring no funding or other resources. It affords a protection to all citizens who wish to render assistance to their neighbour in danger. There are three areas open for consideration when considering the legal concept of the good samaritan: the legal duty of a citizen to assist a person in need, the compensation for loss or injury, or the rights of a good samaritan and the liability or risk assumed by a good samaritan.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">The Bill deals with the latter consideration. I believe it is a good first step. When I raised this issue in the past I was informed it was covered by common law. Common law has several different meanings but it is usually used to refer to the law as developed by the judges since the Norman conquest. It was a combination of the best of all the local systems of law made "common" to the entire country by William I and succeeding kings of England. The Normans sought to centralise and regularise government. Gradually central courts expanded and replaced local ones. In deciding cases judges were asked by lawyers to consider earlier judicial decisions. As the pace of social change quickened the development of law based solely on judicial decisions became inadequate the need for legislation became increasingly necessary and over time statute law became more important than judicial decisions, as common law became rigid and fixed and there were many wrongs for which there was no remedy. The main advantage in passing this Bill is that it will be easily accessible and ready for immediate use, especially when there is no case law and it will also be authoritative, having been passed by the Legislature.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">One may ask if there has never been a case concerning this issue why bring an unnecessary solution forward. I am firmly of the view that the absence of such legislation is prohibiting the involvement of volunteers in some projects and most definitely the roll-out of defibrillators in the community. Only last night Mr. Joe Galvin, the cardiac specialist, outlined on "Léargas" the need for such equipment to be available. We are all familiar with the tragic story of the late Cormac McAnallen, but there are many tragic stories that could have been avoided if this concept was developed.</p>
          <p eId="para_926">In addition there is no modern decision refusing a cause of action in respect of which there was no existing authority on the ground that it was new. Torts have been developed over the centuries and it would be wrong to suppose that the process has come to an end. Historically the origins of many torts lie in particular decisions. As far back as the middle of the 19th century one finds the origins of inducement of breach of contract in Lumley <i>v.</i> Gye, 1853. In Britain the tort of negligence was first established in the historic case of Donoghue <i>v. </i>Stevenson as recently as 1932. It was only in 1964 that the tort of intimidation was definitely established in the same country.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">In this country, if there is no existing duty, for example, between an employer and employee, then the general principle is that there is no liability for a mere omission to act. There is no legal obligation to warn someone who is about to walk into a trap or to rescue him from a dangerous situation when he has done so. However, if one does intervene and adds to the damage, we do not yet know in Ireland if they will be liable. The result of all this may be that the good samaritan who tries to help may find himself or herself involved in damages while the priest and Levite who pass by on the other side can go on their merry way.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">This Bill can give protection and has been shown to do so in various case law in the US. In Boccasile <i>v. </i>Cajun Music Limited 1997, a man suffered an allergic reaction to food he consumed at a music festival. A volunteer medical crew in the first aid tent at the festival provided assistance, but the man died. His family sued the first aid crew. The court found that under the Good Samaritan Act, the family had the duty to come forward with standard of care evidence and affidavits establishing deviations from normal care, or some expert attribution of a connection between negligence and the man’s death. No such evidence was submitted and so the volunteer medical crew could not be found liable.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">In Pamberton <i>v.</i> Dharmani, in a malpractice case in Michigan in 1994, the court found that a physician who in good faith responds to a life-threatening emergency or responds to a request for emergency assistance in a life-threatening emergency even within a hospital is not liable for any civil damages as a result of an act or omission in the rendering of emergency care, except an act or omission amounting to gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct. For immunity to apply, the physician need only have a good faith belief that he is responding to a life-threatening emergency regardless of whether such an emergency actually exists.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">There is a legal maxim of <i>volenti non fit injuria,</i> roughly construed to mean no injury is done to one who consents. It has its origin in the process by which Roman Law validated the act of a free citizen selling himself into slavery. In the 19th century it found its way into the law of tort. The principle is that a person may not sue in tort if he had given his express or implied consent to the act complained of. In many of the situations I envisage that this legislation may be of use, consent may not be possible due to the condition of the injured party. Even knowledge may not be possible. However knowledge in itself is not consent.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">The biblical parable of the priest, the Levite and the good samaritan is often used to teach the virtue of helping someone in need. There is a desire in virtually all of us to help a person whom we perceive to be in immediate danger. This can range from saving a person from drowning to helping with the change of a car tyre. However, with the evolution of society this desire takes other issues into consideration. How often have we read about someone who stopped to render roadside assistance and ended up as the victim of a mugging? Concern has also been expressed, particularly by health care professionals, that if they seek to voluntarily assist a person who is injured and add to that injury, they may be the subject of a claim for damages. I am not aware of any case in this jurisdiction where such a claim has been made and some may argue that this Bill is premature.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">The primary motivation for this Bill is to assist in encouraging the availability of defibrillators in the community, through sporting clubs, commercial outlets, schools and any location where large crowds are likely to gather. For the last couple of years I have been involved in trying to expand this concept in such areas, but the fear of litigation, whether justified or not, has acted as a barrier. This simple legislation can address this problem. We need to ensure the virtue of the good samaritan concept carries over to our legal system.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">While the original motivation for this Bill was to deal with sudden cardiac arrest, there are several other important aspects to it. It frees up the medical professional whose concerns about intervention can be reduced. The mountain rescuer and the voluntary searcher can know that legislation is in place that can assist them if the need arises and most important it paints a clear picture of a society that wishes to protect people who wish to assist those in danger.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">The good samaritan issue is not a concept that has been discussed widely in Ireland, mainly because it has not arisen in any tangible form. The claim, often made, that the door was closed after the horse had bolted cannot be made in this case as Fine Gael, by bringing forward this Bill, intends to assist in the development of volunteerism.</p>
          <p eId="para_935">The issue has arisen in other countries. As a general principle, common law does not require a bystander to help someone in danger. The priest and the Levite would not be liable for failing to assist the stranger. However, several exceptions exist where failure to act could lead to damage or criminality. A special relationship may give rise to a duty to assist, such as an employer and an employee, which I previously mentioned, or the nature of one's employment, such as a policeman or fireman.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">However, a bystander is safe as long as he or she does absolutely nothing. It is my firm belief that some time in the future we will see in our legal system a claim for damages where a bystander chooses to intervene and adds to the injury. Our courts have a strong tendency to ensure that someone picks up the cost for injury to a person. Passing this Bill should lessen the chances of the willing bystander being that someone. It is not uncommon to have statutory modifications to the common law.</p>
          <p eId="para_937">In Quebec, Canada, the law imposes a duty on everyone to help a person in peril. The duty to assist a person in danger is evolving in France and Belgium. When Princess Diana's vehicle crashed in France, before medical help arrived for her and her companions, photographers who arrived at the scene allegedly took photographs of her instead of rendering assistance to the injured parties. As a result, several photographers were investigated for possibly violating the good samaritan law in France, which requires that onlookers lend aid to victims in peril. This Bill does not go as far as the French law and the Princess Diana case is in stark contrast to the infamous 1964 case of Kitty Genovese, an American who was stalked and repeatedly stabbed by an assailant in middle class New York. Although 38 neighbours either heard or saw her being attacked, no one came to her aid or even called the police until more than half an hour after her attack, by which time she was dead. No one was investigated or prosecuted for failing to help because it was not a crime in New York. One must ask which is the better social model. While the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, may argue that inequality is necessary to drive the economy, what philosophy can refuse a good samaritan law.</p>
          <p eId="para_938">The French law with respect to omissions started to take its present shape in 1941 under the Vichy Government, and was codified after 1945 in Articles 62 and 63 of the French Penal Code. Modern French law implemented these articles. The American system pales in comparison to that of France, yet it is far ahead of ours. This Bill affords us an opportunity to catch up.</p>
          <p eId="para_939">Ireland, it is said, is one of the most litigious societies in the world, second only to the United States of America. Without doubt, this is a very dubious accolade and presents us with many problems that we cannot ignore. These days, how do we ensure that our legal system does not act as a disincentive to people to get involved in voluntary work to the benefit of their communities and society as a whole? How do we ensure that a person who gives of their time to assist with a volunteer cardiac response unit is not left without legal protection?</p>
          <p eId="para_940">One of the phrases used repeatedly by the Government is "social capital". The decline in what is referred to as "social capital" is frequently lamented by the Taoiseach and is a phenomenon witnessed by all of us in the new more prosperous Ireland of the 21st century. The concept of social capital recognises that social networks have value and the term encapsulates within it a wide variety of specific benefits that flow to society where people are empowered to engage with community and society to work together, to build trust and valuable relationships, and all for the common good. In this way, social capital is not just a woolly "feel good" concept. It has tangible benefits for people and families and there are tangible actions we should take to protect it.</p>
          <p eId="para_941">While speaking of the general importance of promoting social capital, the Government has not taken concrete action to match those words. Plaudits given to those who volunteer to serve communities are all well and good, but they do not address the specific difficulties faced in the Ireland of 2005. We must acknowledge that social capital cannot be supported by words alone. Action is needed from the Government, and I identified an area where we can support social capital and social engagement through legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_942">Under our legal system, if a person goes to the assistance of someone who is ill or injured as a result of an accident they have no protection in legislation if something goes wrong. Even if this person acted quickly, compassionately and with the best motives, he or she has no protection from legal action. This is a serious problem for those who work with voluntary organisations as well as individual members of the public who may go to the assistance of an injured person. Off-duty health care workers may be worried about the consequences of offering assistance to an injured person. People who would like to volunteer with cardiac self-help groups may be discouraged and members of sporting bodies may find themselves in a legal limbo.</p>
          <p eId="para_943">Volunteers are recognised as unsung heroes, from the medic dashing on to the remote football pitch to the off-duty nurse attending a collapsed elderly person on the side of the road. This service is almost always free of charge, the only gain being one of personal satisfaction. Non-profit organisations are rarely sued — as I stated, I am not aware of any volunteer who has been sued in this country. However, the litigation perception and the lack of protection for volunteers has acted as a barrier to the involvement of volunteers. In the US in 1997, Congress passed the Volunteer Protection Act to deal with this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_944">I now wish to return to the original motivation for the Bill. Cardiac Self Help Wicklow is a voluntary group established in the autumn of 2003 with a view to making defibrillators available in the wider community. Every year, several thousand people die in Ireland from sudden cardiac arrest. There are many causes, genetics, illness, heart attack, environmental conditions and even physical contact. A hard blow to the chest can knock someone, even a fit young athlete, into cardiac arrest. Dehydration or heat exertion can do the same. Anyone at any age can be the victim of sudden cardiac arrest. We spend much time here maligning various failures in the health service. However, this evening I want to acknowledge the excellent work of the ambulance service under Pat McCreanor in the HSE eastern region and the excellent work it has done in recent years. I also acknowledge its training officer Shane Mooney.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">Thanks to the ambulance service working with voluntary groups in County Wicklow, a first responders scheme is up and running in approximately 20 areas. This comprises trained local volunteers who assist the ambulance service if someone in the area suffers or is threatened with cardiac arrest. Several other communities are in the process of setting up a scheme and it is our intention, with the co-operation of communities, to extend this service throughout the country. In addition, local groups and schools can privately purchase a defibrillator and have it available in their immediate area. This is known as targeted defibrillation. Some shopping centres, airports, schools and sports clubs have these on site and have trained people in their use. The scheme in Wicklow went into operation in spring of this year and to date local community groups have been called upon on more than 60 occasions. The scheme is extremely successful and provides assistance and assurance, particularly for those who reside in isolated areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_946">I am aware that a Government task force, chaired by Dr. Brian Maurer, reported on sudden cardiac death and I am confident he will strongly recommend a roll-out of a first responders scheme similar to the one in operation in Wicklow. I hope he will also make a recommendation similar to the Good Samaritan Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_947">The resources needed to establish and maintain the scheme are minimal for the return. However, human resources must be specifically allocated to the project. The Garda Síochána, fire brigades and other statutory bodies can also play a role. I welcome the fact that the Garda Síochána operated two pilot schemes in Kilkenny and Blanchardstown and I look forward to their roll-out throughout the country. Planning guidelines must be amended to provide for the inclusion of defibrillators in commercial developments. The Department of Education and Science has a role to play in including CPR in the school curriculum.</p>
          <p eId="para_948">To assist in the concept of targeted defibrillation, legislation will be necessary to deal with the concerns of volunteers who have a fear of litigation. This is such a Bill. The Minister for Health and Children repeatedly calls for ideas from this side of the House. Here is one, and its implementation will greatly improve our health service at virtually zero cost. We must establish legislative intent such as that "an automatic external defibrillator may be used by any person for the purpose of saving the life of another person in cardiac arrest".</p>
          <p eId="para_949">Tomorrow, the Government of which the Minister is a member will swagger in here and spend the people's money like a child that has raided the piggy bank. It is relatively easy to do. How the Minister approaches this Bill will tell me a lot more about how the Government views society than what is done tomorrow. In his capacity as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister has a vital role to play with respect to this Bill. I hope he will adopt a positive and progressive approach. He can play the part of Santa Claus to the many volunteers and would-be volunteers or he can be the cold icy face of an administration that is more concerned with adding the half pence to the pence and placing the rare penny in the old man's hat.</p>
          <p eId="para_950">I do not know if the Minister has made up his mind to accept this Bill. I ask him, based on what I stated and what my colleagues will say, to give serious consideration to accepting it. It would cost nothing and people would not be clambering at the gates complaining that we passed it. We can quote common law to argue this Bill is not necessary but history has shown it is. I commend this Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_288">
          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_951">I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Timmins, on preparing this legislation. No county in Ireland better understands the importance of personnel available to provide first aid than Monaghan given that Monaghan General Hospital is being wound down by the Health Service Executive as a trial run for the Hanly report. The hospital's needs are being ignored by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, who accepts no responsibility for the services necessary to the area. Privatising and advice from so-called experts is more important than the harsh reality of life and death in the stony grey soil of Kavanagh or the rolling hills of north Monaghan.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">This legislation is drafted to assist those who go to the assistance of a person ill or injured as a result of an accident from being sued as a result of intervention. The current legal situation is that a person who intervenes to help those ill or injured as a result of an accident could be sued if something goes wrong. While all of us feel a keen obligation to give assistance to an ill or injured person, the potential for legal action against those who act in a compassionate way exists. Fine Gael believes the public should be encouraged to take on the role of the good samaritan with the assurance that members of the public will not be victims.</p>
          <p eId="para_953">In the Monaghan section of my constituency it is estimated that up to 16 lives would have been saved if Monaghan General Hospital had been open and on call. I know several individuals whose lives have been saved through being brought to hospital either by car while off call or by ambulance since this service has been brought back on call for medical purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_954">Deputy Timmins addressed a meeting in Ballybay town to encourage self help by setting up properly structured voluntary groups with a view to making defibrillators available in the wider community. It is clear that his work with the ambulance service personnel has set up a tremendous structure in Wicklow.</p>
          <p eId="para_955">The number of young people who have died in the area of sport in recent years is shocking. We must congratulate those doctors and nurses who have intervened in such situations and brought people back to life. This happened recently to a young man on Clones football pitch. We still have people such as that young doctor who are prepared to jump in and do what is necessary for people in the same situation as the young man.</p>
          <p eId="para_956">It is necessary that this legislation be passed so that people acting in good faith will not be exposed. People properly trained with the support of the health board and attached to a health board scheme are insured for the use of defibrillators. In Ballybay, County Monaghan, the local community, with financial support of the credit union, has purchased a defibrillator. A number of people have been trained in its use and more are in line to receive training. A number of football and community clubs are considering undertaking similar measures. We must examine the structures in Wicklow where those trained in first aid with defibrillators work in consultation with the ambulance service.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">Carrickmacross also needs a community group to get involved in this. I hope the Government accepts this Bill as it stands or with whatever amendments are necessary. I hope sufficient funding will be provided to local health services to train and provide the necessary back-up services to these community groups. In this way people in rural areas will have an active back-up service and some assurance that help is available.</p>
          <p eId="para_958">The recent death of Mr. Walsh in Monaghan General Hospital demonstrated how personnel were anxious about insurance liability. They had been warned never to take part in self help. This is a clear example of the anxiety people have about doing what should be done. In a constituency such as mine where there is a doctor on call, there is major anxiety about when and how one can locate a doctor on weekends or late at night. The structure promoted by Deputy Timmins is something we wish to see nationwide. This legislation is necessary to support this structure.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulConnaughton" eId="spk_289">
          <from>Mr. Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_959">I congratulate Deputy Timmins on the timely tabling of the Good Samaritan Bill. This legislation will have a positive impact if it concentrates legal minds and the minds of those in the voluntary sector. It will greatly assist people in the way they react when called upon to give assistance at a crucial point.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">Ireland was a more compassionate country when it was not as affluent as it is today. When I was first elected to this House, people were more compassionate to each other and the Good Samaritan Bill addresses this. The manner in which people interact has changed from an understanding of the decent thing to do to a shrug of the shoulders. This has major consequences for people in certain circumstances. If the Bill had been published 20 or 30 years ago, no one would have been concerned about helping a person in difficulty, irrespective of conditions. A bond of goodness existed in all people but because of the way we live and the nature of human interaction in this era, that bond has been lost.</p>
          <p eId="para_961">Many will say they fared badly by their well intentioned intervention. They may think people did the wrong thing. If this attitude has seeped into society, enacting a Bill may not change it. Nonetheless, this legislation is a vital measure to assist the voluntary sector to do what has been taken for granted. The first responder scheme, to which Deputy Timmins referred, has been running in Mountbellew for some years. It is excellent but I do not have time to speak on it. Would it not be a disaster if people refused to join this movement because they did not think they were legally covered? This is the central theme of this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">The Irish Nurses Organisation received a brief from an eminent barrister. A professional nurse referred to driving to Dublin and seeing a crashed car. As the nurse was about to help an ambulance arrived. The nurse continued on the journey but questioned if that was correct or if it would have been better to stop. The barrister responded that under Irish criminal law, no nurse is obliged to stop at the scene of an accident. In some countries it is a crime for nurses, doctors and paramedics to refuse to stop at the scene of an accident, even when off duty. Ireland is not one of these countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_963">What if no ambulance had been there? The answer was that the same holds true — even if there is no one else around for miles, no law requires one to be a good samaritan. The next question was, am I ethically obliged to stop? Most nurses would feel obliged to stop to see if they could help, but An Bord Altranais has no specific rule about acting as a good samaritan. Finally, the question was asked if one could go to jail for refusing to stop, be found guilty of misconduct or be sued for anything else. The answer given was that one cannot be sued for refusing to stop. To succeed in a case like that, it would have to be shown that one owed the injured party a duty of care.</p>
          <p eId="para_964">The Minister can see where we are coming from, that there is a possibility that someone who performs a good act could be held liable in court.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_290">
          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_965">I compliment Deputy Timmins on introducing this Bill. I am in the process of organising a first responder training day in Listowel, to be held in approximately four weeks' time. The people involved in providing that service have asked about the progress of this Bill. These are professionals from the Health Service Executive who feel that this Bill is essential to facilitate the successful roll-out of the first responder scheme across the country. They are seeking the protection that this legislation will afford people. The first responder training days have been very successful.</p>
          <p eId="para_966">With regard to Kerry, there was a tragic event there today, when a very distinguished sportsman died from a heart attack. Kerry has the highest rate of heart disease in the former southern health board region. That region has the highest rate in Ireland and Ireland has the highest rate among the EU countries. For that reason, the first responder scheme is very important. However, there is a fear among people that if they act or get involved when someone falls ill or is injured, they could then be the subject of litigation. That is a genuine fear.</p>
          <p eId="para_967">As someone who is still involved in sport, I have seen people suffer serious injuries on the field. Usually, unless someone knows what he or she is doing, the response is to leave the injured person alone and to call an ambulance. If people had the confidence to intervene, they could save the injured person, who could have suffered a heart attack, cardiac arrest or some other injury. Simply putting a person in the recovery position can make a real difference. A person could swallow his or her tongue, for example, but if there is immediate intervention, by placing one's finger behind the tongue and releasing it, that could prevent someone from choking and save his or her life. The same applies to people who are bleeding profusely from the head. If such people are left lying on their back and cannot get rid of blood in their mouths, they could smother. I came upon an accident one time, where people were looking at a woman on the side of the road. I suggested that she be put in the recovery position — I had some first aid training when I was a physical education teacher — and that saved her life. She thanked me afterwards and any time I meet her she says that but for my intervention, she would not be alive now.</p>
          <p eId="para_968">The Minister probably knows the law in this area better than the rest of us but if such a provision works in America and Canada, why can it not work here? There are moves all over the country, initiated by Deputy Timmins in Wicklow, to roll out the first responder schemes as part of the overall cardiovascular strategy and they are working very well. There are defibrillators in golf clubs and GAA grounds all over the country. In the past few years, a number of people have died playing golf and now most clubs in the country have defibrillators. However, people need to be trained and to have the confidence that, should they intervene, they will not be subject to litigation subsequently.</p>
          <p eId="para_969">I commend the Bill highly. I know the Minister is a rational and pragmatic individual and I appeal to him to accept this legislation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnPerry" eId="spk_291">
          <from>Mr. Perry</from>
          <p eId="para_970">I compliment Deputy Timmins on bringing the Good Samaritan Bill before the House. It is important legislation and reflects the fact that there is a constant need for us, as legislators, to look at what is happening abroad. We can certainly learn from the failings and successes of our neighbours in the EU and in countries further afield. When Deputy Timmins was drafting this Bill, he examined the situation abroad. He discovered cases in the United States where people were sued for coming to the aid of others who had become ill. Fine Gael realised that this could become an issue in Ireland, which is far more litigation conscious than was the case in the past. A total of 49 states in the US have enacted similar good samaritan legislation. It makes logical sense for Ireland to act before a problem emerges.</p>
          <p eId="para_971">In publishing this Bill, we are raising awareness of a very serious issue, namely, that every year between 6,000 and 7,000 people die from sudden cardiac arrest. In recent years we have seen the tragic deaths of several very talented young sports people from sudden cardiac arrest. Defibrillators have a strong role to play in preventing death from sudden cardiac arrest. When a person has a heart attack, his or her chance of survival drops by 10% every minute, and time is obviously of the essence in such cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_972">Deputy Timmins has been involved with a voluntary group in Wicklow which has been very effective. It has engaged in fundraising, as well as purchasing defibrillators and making them available throughout the area. I represent people in Sligo and believe there is an urgent need to involve communities and voluntary groups in the provision of defibrillators in regions where they would not be otherwise available. There are several areas in County Sligo that have no service whatsoever at present. I am certain the commitment and fundraising required to obtain such devices exists in those areas. However, there are concerns about litigation and the operation of defibrillators, although local people could work with Sligo General Hospital in the area of training.</p>
          <p eId="para_973">The pilot group that was set up two years ago in Wicklow aims to make defibrillators available to the wider community, which is an admirable objective. The group has been very successful to date. As a representative of a mostly rural constituency, I see that such action is vital to help to save lives. The availability of defibrillators is of critical importance when time is precious and people cannot afford to wait for an ambulance to arrive. To have a local person who is trained in the operation of a defibrillator would be of enormous benefit to every community. This Bill will allow people to help each other. We must not forget that the community and voluntary sector is the backbone of every town and village in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_974">The terms of the legislation are exact. I compliment Deputy Timmins on a very detailed Bill which has been scrutinised with every fault in mind. The Bill exempts health care professionals working in the course of their employment. It will help those who, in good faith, come to the aid of people who have fallen ill. Unless he or she damages the ill person as a result of gross negligence, the good samaritan will be protected under Irish law for the first time. People should be able to give assistance to others without fear of litigation or a court summons. I fully support this Bill and commend Deputy Timmins and the Front Bench on bringing it forward. I appeal to the Minister to support it because, as previous speakers have said, it can save lives and will empower people to get involved in their local community.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">The voluntary sector and the fund-raising activities people become involved in show that they are prepared to give of their time. Irish people are good samaritans because they consistently help others but with the wealth being created in our boom economy, the risk of litigation has increased. If that could be prevented and the Minister took Deputy Timmins's Bill on board, it would be a good day's work. It has been successful in the US, and the fact that it has been enacted in 49 states shows how important it is.</p>
          <p eId="para_976">Deputy Timmins has researched the Bill carefully and has operated the defibrillator service successfully in County Wicklow. It will be well received in County Sligo because it will empower communities to save lives by the provision of defibrillators and will remove the possibility of claims for litigation arising from negligence on the part of good samaritans.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_292">
          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_977">Deputy Timmins's speech presenting this Bill unsubtly suggested I should accept it in the spirit of Santa Claus and that I would be hard-hearted to reject it, but the Bill is very badly drafted, badly thought through and would create more problems than it would solve. Section 2 provides that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_978">Notwithstanding the rules of common law, a person other than a health care professional acting in the course of employment who-</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_979">(<i>a</i>) provides emergency first aid assistance to a person who is ill, injured or unconscious as a result of an accident or other emergency,</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_980">(<i>b</i>) provides the assistance at the immediate scene of the accident or emergency, and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_981">(<i>c</i>) has acted voluntarily and without reasonable expectation of compensation or reward for providing the services described,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_982">is not liable for damages that result from his or her negligence in acting or failing to act while providing the services, unless it is established that the damages were caused by the gross negligence of the person.</p>
          <p eId="para_983">This is the nub of the matter. A person is not liable for damages for failing to act unless there is gross negligence. In effect the Bill creates an obligation to act to save somebody unless it would be grossly negligent not to do so. It creates a duty to intervene by the back door because one would not be liable for damages for a failure to act unless it arose from gross negligence. It makes it compulsory for everybody to intervene unless it would be grossly negligent of them not to do so. That is a very serious change to bring about in our law. It is serious to tell somebody they must intervene in an emergency and may be liable for damages but that failure to act may constitute a basis for suing. The only exception is where one's intervention is negligent but not grossly negligent. In effect this Bill overturns the common law. Is it a good idea to cast on people by statute a duty to intervene in first aid situations?</p>
          <p eId="para_984">The Bill goes on to say:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_985">For the purpose of <i>subsection (1)</i>, a health care professional is acting in the course of employment if he or she is providing emergency health care services or first aid assistance to a person who is ill, injured or unconscious as a result of an accident or other emergency, having been summoned or called to provide services or assistance for payment or reward.</p>
          <p eId="para_986">I will ask a simple question. If somebody telephones the local doctor to say a man has been knocked down on the road and the doctor runs down the road with his bag, his defibrillator, his stethoscope and emergency kit, has he been summoned or called to provide services or assistance for payment or reward? The people who drafted this Bill must answer that question.</p>

          <p eId="para_1012">That is an interesting point of view because it means one can sue the person in the ambulance but not the doctor summoned to an emergency in a street. One's own general practitioner can be sued after being called out. If I call a GP to my house for an injured family member, he will not be able to avail of this because he would expect a payment, but if somebody calls to a local GP surgery, there is a different duty of care.</p>

That is a good point but it is not what the Bill is about.

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_1028">Then we have another concept. A doctor who knows a great deal at a scene is effectively exempt unless he or she engages in gross negligence and a paramedic who is paid to be there can be sued because the paramedic, who is less expert, is there for reward because he is being paid. Do we want to go down that road? It would not improve our law.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029">When the court and civil liability Bill was being composed, we looked at these provisions. The point made by Deputy Timmins at the outset about volunteerism was raised. Volunteerism is under stress and I contemplated introducing a differential negligence test for those who provided facilities such as children's playgrounds so they would not be liable every time a child got a splinter. Those who run gymkhanas or horse shows on a regular basis for the community should not have to insure against myriad things happening. Many voluntary activities attract punitive insurance costs. I consulted the Attorney General on the issue and decided it was such a complicated point and the way in which it was phrased would have to be so carefully done that I could do more damage than good by altering the common law position that exists now.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030">For the first time in Irish law, the last paragraph of section 2(1) would create a liability for failing to act in circumstances when dealing with an emergency and would provide that failing to act could give rise to a claim for damages unless gross negligence could not be proved. That is what I am most worried about. For hundreds of years the law has stated that good samaritans are good because they do not operate under a duty. This Bill for the first time introduces the concept of people being sued for failing to act in respect of others and only gives the out that gross negligence would have to be proved against them. I am worried about doing that on the hoof. We should not blunder into such a new legal concept without careful consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">Law like this exists in some continental countries, where a person can be sued for failing to rescue someone else and he or she must prove that his or her actions were reasonable. Do we want to do that?</p>

          <p eId="para_1038">I know, and that is the point. We are dealing with a problem that has never existed in the past, where a volunteer offering first aid to someone else in good faith has been sued. Is it a good idea to address a situation that has never arisen in terms that would introduce the idea of people being sued for failure to offer first aid? I worry a great deal about that concept. We should not lightly go down the road of making failure to act actionable without carefully thinking out its implications.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039">My problem is with the Title of the Bill. I am told I would be hard hearted and not Santa Claus like if I did not accept it but I do not agree with the principle underpinning it. It is a two section Bill fraught with difficulty. It provides for different standards of care for people in almost identical scenarios. A humble paramedic owes a much greater duty of care to somebody he or she takes charge of at an accident scene while on duty than an expert doctor who comes across the same scene. The Bill distinguishes between doctors who are treating their own patients and patients of other doctors and it differentiates between a doctor who is on duty in a hospital and who finds somebody who has been brought to the hospital lying injured in the back of a car and the doctor who is off duty and is on his way home when he encounters a similar scene.</p>

          <p eId="para_1069">With regard to group practices, is somebody providing a service for payment or reward if he or she is called out to treat an accident victim using the same telephone system or GMS list of the practice? Will a differentiation be made between them and members of other group practices or sole general practitioners in an area who come on the scene of an accident? These are legitimate concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070">The Cabinet earlier considered the legislation. It is not worthy of support in its present form but the issue of voluntarism is worthy of study. The legislation deals only with first aid in limited circumstances where it must be administered at the scene of an accident or emergency. That is another unintended limitation of the Bill. The Cabinet decided to ask the Law Reform Commission to examine this issue in a broader sense and deal with the questions of differential liability among health professionals, whether we should, in any circumstance, make actionable a failure to intervene, whether the scope of legislation in this regard should be confined to first aid cases or should be underpinned by broad principles and whether cases where people who engage in voluntary activities for the good of their communities should be covered. If this law was introduced and failure to act became actionable, is a person who finds somebody on a cliff ledge covered? If the person is not ill or unconscious and is not in receipt of emergency first aid and a rope is fed down to him or her, the Bill is of no use because its scope is so narrow. If one began to pull up the rope and toppled down on top of the person, injuring him or her due to one's negligence, the Bill would not apply. This Bill does not even deal with somebody who jumps into a river or takes out a boat to save somebody from drowning, something which has nothing to do with first aid.</p>

          <p eId="para_1076">Some people have a neck. This is a hole dug by the draftsman. I am asking the Deputies not to dig the hole any deeper, but to agree with me that there are broader questions that should be studied by the Law Reform Commission. It would be foolish to proceed with or accept this Bill which is fraught with difficulty and riven with internal contradictions.</p>

          <from>Ms McManus</from>
          <p eId="para_1077">I will share my time with Deputy Lynch. I pay tribute to Deputy Timmins, a fellow Deputy in my constituency. I am conscious that over recent years he has been deeply involved in the development of community services and the provision of defibrillators throughout a largely rural community that is not the most accessible in terms of health services. His contribution has been considerable in terms of both impact and effort and it is important that this is recorded in the House because much of it is behind the scenes. I noted that in his speech he did not talk about the extent of the important work in which he is involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078">This issue leads inevitably to questions being raised about litigation. The growth of litigation, especially in connection with the health services, is terrifying. If we look to the United States we can see the direction in which we are headed, but the Minister may not be uncomfortable with that. In health services across Europe there has been a development over recent times of alternatives to litigation and we could learn much from these. The advantage of litigation is that people stay on their toes and standards are maintained. However, many people, especially lawyers, make huge profits as a consequence of litigation being so central in our lives, especially when the health service cannot provide, people make mistakes or there is deliberate negligence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1079">The issue of what happens to the good samaritan came up in the negotiations for the State indemnity scheme. The matter was raised by doctors because they felt the scheme would prevent them from going to the scene of an accident because of having no previous contact with the patient. They were concerned about the risk in which they would be putting themselves by doing so. The matter was resolved. I was not party to the negotiations, but know it was an issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080">It is unfair of the Minister to state that this Bill somehow creates a new differential. It is different if a doctor goes to see his or her patient because they have established a relationship. Even if it is a crisis a general practitioner is called to, he or she knows the patient. On the other hand, a person driving along who sees somebody lying unconscious on the road has no prior connection with that person. It is a fact of life that this is a different relationship and it is important to recognise that. We cannot say the two experiences are the same. A health professional dealing with one of his or her patients has a different relationship, but this does not mean he or she will never be negligent in that situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1081">I agree the Bill is flawed, but I had hoped there would be a more positive critique from the Minister. However, he did make amends somewhat at the end of his speech. I welcome the fact that he overcame his natural arrogance——</p>

          <from>Ms McManus</from>
          <p eId="para_1083">——and decided that perhaps there was something in this Bill and he could be kind to us with Christmas coming and refer it to the Law Reform Commission. That is worthwhile. I do not know whether this will create a delay, but it is welcome and is positive. I hope this debate assists in the process of coming to some conclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084">I find the constant lecturing of the Minister very hard to take. He is the Minister who produces legislation with so many amendments being pushed through at the last minute that Opposition Members barely get the chance to read them. He is the Minister who is part of a Government that tried to impose legislation by way of a constitutional referendum that would prevent a doctor from treating a woman who would die if a doctor did not intervene and carry out a termination of pregnancy. If it did not happen in a hospital, the Bill the Government produced would have meant a doctor was barred from treating such a woman in an emergency. That seems far more barbaric than any deficiencies in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085">If the Minister wants to give lectures, he may have to listen to them as well. Let us look at the record. If that legislation had been agreed and the people had voted for it, it is very likely that at some point a woman would have been dependent on a doctor to save her life and he or she would have had to break the law to save it. If the Minister does not recall it, he should read it again. It is imprinted on my brain. I remember clearly that the requirement was that the procedure had to be carried out in a hospital. Therefore, if a dying woman was outside the hospital context and needed a termination to save her life, that was too bad.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086">We can look at this legislation in another way in terms of how it can be improved. It is worth looking at it from the point of view of victims rather than from that of health professionals. I was concerned that there was no way of gaining compensation or that the immunity of the health professional was complete in terms of the rights of the victim. The victim of negligence would be without redress, despite suffering because of another's negligence. Should this be the case and should the victim be protected from the consequences or should the care giver be protected from the consequences of his or her negligence?</p>
          <p eId="para_1087">I suggest a compromise. The law could state or clarify that instead of immunity, where a person provides good samaritan assistance, a court, in determining any claim of negligence against that person, must consider the factor or circumstances in which the emergency care was provided, the degree of emergency involved and the bona fides of the good samaritan. The law could also employ a principle that a person ought not be penalised for assisting a person in an emergency. Such changes as these would ensure that good samaritans are not penalised for acting as such and would recognise their value while not protecting those who are negligent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088">I had hoped the Minister would have adopted a more positive approach to this legislation, allowed it to go forward and provided the necessary amendments. He has been in Opposition and must recognise that it is not a simple task to produce watertight legislation. It is not simple, even when in Government. When it comes to flawed legislation the Minister only has to look at his own body of work to find many examples. None of us always gets things right, even the Minister, Deputy McDowell. I hope he will examine the Bill and table amendments to it, and we can take it from there. It is imperative we deal with this important issue. I commend Deputy Timmins for initiating the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_1097">The point I am trying to make is that when the Opposition gets proposed legislation wrong the Government does not accept it. The Government does not accept Bills proposed by the Opposition, except on rare occasions. However, when the Government gets it wrong, it usually just forces the legislation through anyway. That is the major difference between the two types of proposed legislation. This has consequences for us all, not just the Opposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098">I listened on the monitor to the Minister's interpretation of the last line of the Bill. I was told he was deliberately misinterpreting it. The Minister is shaking his head because of course he would not do that. He is probably the most tolerant person I have ever met. There is no need for a Good Samaritan Bill in his view because he regularly stops on his way home to help people and they would not dare sue him. After giving them the essential help they need at the side of the road he probably gives them a lecture on why they should not be there in the first place and who they should have called for help, gives them the number and reels off exactly who they should be involved with. After getting all that out of the way he would ask himself why we need this type of legislation. Why is it necessary to have legislation to protect people who come to the aid of others in distress in the Ireland of 2005?</p>

          <from>Ms Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_1100">We need it because people are afraid of becoming involved in cases where they could be sued. Society is so litigious that even people who are being assisted could well consider suing. I found this concept difficult to take on board and asked myself who would do such a thing. I cannot imagine suing someone who came to my aid if I was involved in a crash. However, I heard of a case which involved two patrolmen who came to the assistance of somebody involved in a car crash. The accident victim sued them because he blamed them for the paralysis from which he suffered following the accident. While he did not win the case, he sued them. The finding of the court was that the patrolmen did not have a duty of care to him and they were not obliged to rescue him. However, word gets out and one could imagine it happening here. Gardaí could end up being sued if they attempt to prevent further injury to the victim or victims of an accident.</p>
          <p eId="para_1101">It is a horrible vista that in this day and age we might need such legislation. Introducing such a Bill is an attempt to ensure that people no longer feel the threat of being sued in the event of coming to the aid of others. I must hold up my hands and say that I am not the kind of person to jump in with a defibrillator. I would probably be like the Minister, stand on the footpath and lecture——</p>

I am not that type of person but there are people who have a degree of knowledge and believe they could be of some comfort to an accident victim and at the very least prevent him or her from further injury. People who work in the emergency services go off duty and are out and about in the same way as the rest of us. Some people are prepared to give assistance when it is necessary and we should protect them. Giving assistance may be part and parcel of their duty when they are at work but they can give worthwhile assistance outside that. We should examine this matter carefully.</p>
          <p eId="para_1104">I agree with the Minister, this is a much wider-ranging issue than what is encompassed in this Bill.

          <p eId="para_1108">All I say to the Minister is that the Good Samaritan Bill is so called for a very good reason. It should engender in all of us the need to do good. As I said, I am not certain the Minister has reached that level of enlightenment, or that he ever will, but he should at least be tolerant and recognise that the Bill is worthwhile. It aims to protect people and put in place a particular set of values which we should try to uphold.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109">Up to yesterday I might have had a different view of this matter but I came across a situation which involved a man who has been a volunteer in his community all his life. I am not good at guessing ages but I imagine he is in his late 50s or early 60s — perhaps he is not that age. All I will say is that he had to appear in a forum that related to an issue in an area in which he was a volunteer. The work he did was unpaid but he was berated and belittled for not being good enough as a volunteer. Whatever the merits of the case before the forum, the manner in which he was treated beggared belief. Afterwards he mused as to why anyone would be a volunteer or donate time to his or her community. It was awful to watch how he was treated. In a different context, the Bill is about protecting people who still have that spirit within them and ensuring that when they volunteer their time or service in an unpaid capacity they are protected from somebody who may take a different view. That is what this is about, no more and no less.</p>
          <p eId="para_1110">I know the Minister does not do so, but I decry the loss of certain values in society. We all recognise the value of people who care for their neighbours, who are good samaritans. The Minister should look at the issue from that point of view. When the Minister looks again at the last paragraph of the Bill he will recognise that he is misinterpreting it. I am sure that was always the case.</p>

            <p eId="para_1120">I want to put the case for a CT scanner in the Portlaoise General Hospital, also known as the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise. Has funding been provided in the 2006 Estimates for such a scanner? Recently, Estimates providing for record levels of funding have been approved by this House. I specifically direct my questions to the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children so they will not be re-directed to the HSE. When the Tánaiste presented her Estimates as part of the overall Estimates process, she must have known the composition of the figures. From the point of view of people in County Laois, it will not be sufficient to claim it is a matter for the HSE. Either proposals have been brought and funding provided for a CT scanner in Portlaoise or they have not. I hope the Estimates, when they are produced, are based on factual information rather than providing for matters that may or may not transpire.</p>
            <p eId="para_1121">Significant improvements have been made in recent years at Portlaoise General Hospital. It now has an excellent paediatric unit and the year on year growth in the number of births in the hospital is a sign of increased activity. Next year, the accident and emergency department will move to a new unit, for which funding has already been put in place. In recent days, people in Portlaoise have been told that the final €600,000 of the more than €4 million needed to equip the new unit has been provided. In the coming months, work will commence on a much improved accident and emergency facility for Portlaoise General Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1122">However, a CT scanner, which is a vital ingredient, will be missing. Of the three hospitals in the HSE midland regions, Tullamore and Mullingar have CT scanners but Portlaoise does not. I understand Tullamore also has a MRI scanner.</p>
            <p eId="para_1123">Each week, between 20 and 25 people have to be transported by ambulance from Portlaoise to Tullamore for CT scans. In some cases, the patients involved are in a post-operative state and in the intensive care unit. In addition to the ambulance crew and nurse who accompany most patients, those travelling from the intensive care unit may require the presence of an anaesthetist if they are under anaesthetic. While all these staff are taking patients to and from Tullamore, they are not available in Portlaoise for emergency medical cover. This has compromised the emergency medical services in County Laois because, on a daily basis, ambulance crews have been tied up with the transport of patients for routine CT scans which should be available in Portlaoise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1124">Approximately 1,000 journeys are made from Portlaoise to Tullamore for scans and, at an estimated cost of €500 per trip, they cost €500,000 per year. That amount would help to pay for a CT scanner in Portlaoise. While a CT radiographer would also be needed, the modest sums involved would provide for a better health service in Laois and neighbouring counties. I want the Tánaiste to confirm whether such a sum is included in the Estimates for 2006 and to tell me when a definitive answer will be given with regard to funding. It would make no sense if €4 million is invested in a new accident and emergency unit next year if funding for a CT scanner follows two or three years later. Next year is the time to provide all these facilities within the new accident and emergency unit in Portlaoise and I call on the Tánaiste to provide the funds.</p>

            <p eId="para_1131">The decision of the EU Council of Ministers to overhaul the Irish sugar industry poses serious questions about the negotiating position of the Minister for Agriculture and Food in those talks. I am disappointed that she is not present. I call on her to make a full statement on the stance she took in negotiating the Irish position. It seems the negotiations were concluded too easily and, once talk of compensation started filtering through, it appears the towel was already thrown in.</p>
            <p eId="para_1132">Workers in the Mallow plant deserve a full and frank account from the Minister as to her negotiating stance. In the past few weeks, we have heard nothing from her about the impending plight of workers. We are told the Irish sugar industry will get a compensation package worth €310 million under a deal. What percentage of that compensation package will go to the workers? The Minister must make some of the €44 million special assistance package available for workers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1133">The decision to wipe out a whole industry with the stroke of a pen in Brussels surely poses questions about the nature of our relationship with the EU. North Cork has seen the steady erosion of its industrial base in the past two years. The future for food production in this region looks unsteady. This issue has to be addressed by the Government. It is not enough to state we have become victims of global trends. We have always been model Europeans. The manner in which these proposals were rammed through further undermines our manufacturing base. Is this the model of European integration and social solidarity that we signed up to in 1973?</p>
            <p eId="para_1134">Furthermore, against the background of rapidly rising oil prices and our obligations under the Kyoto Protocol, there is a stronger case than ever for exploring the biofuel option. We must consider alternative products for the Mallow plant to manufacture.</p>
            <p eId="para_1135">The facilities exist within the Mallow plant to produce biofuel. We must put in place a viable alternative to ensure production continues within the Mallow plant, which has the capability to produce alternative fuel. I am calling on the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to extend the biofuels mineral oil tax relief scheme to allow for greater tax relief on the production of biofuels.</p>
            <p eId="para_1136">This year alone the Government has failed to comply with the European Commission directive on the development of alternative fuel sources, which aimed for all EU states to ensure biofuels make up a minimum of 2% of their fuel mix by the end of 2005. The Government has opted instead for a 0.06% biofuels target for the same period. We have the wherewithal and resources to produce such a fuel in Mallow. Now is the time to act, in advance of the final overhaul of the sugar regime.</p>
            <p eId="para_1137">The Minister must tell us clearly whether she thinks Mallow sugar factory will be producing sugar beyond 2008 and whether that decision hinges on whether the IFA will accept the compensation package. Furthermore. Mallow has produced sugar since 1933, 40 years before we joined the Common Market and 40 years before a subsidy was ever paid to a beet grower. Why is it not possible now to produce beet in light of a change to the sugar regime? Are we to assume that if the profit margin to beet growers is not high enough in a changed regime, they will opt instead for the compensation package and cease production of beet?</p>
            <p eId="para_1138">The Minister must tell us whether she has directed Greencore to state whether the compensation package will be more beneficial to it in financial terms through closure or whether it is more feasible to keep the show on the road.</p>

            <from>Mr. Hayes</from>
            <p eId="para_1139">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving us the opportunity of discussing this important item. For many people, it is not easy to make a living from farming in the Ireland of 2005. The price of beef hovers at a dangerously low level, so much so that many farmers barely break even when selling beef. The latest development in Irish farming is the eradication of the Irish sugar beet industry following the decision of the European Council of Ministers to cut the price of sugar beet by 36%. Such a slashing of income means that farmers who make their livelihood from sugar beet production must now kiss that livelihood goodbye. As with beef imports, Irish farmers are being pushed aside to make way for cheap sugar cane from countries such as Brazil. They cannot hope to compete with countries whose production costs are vastly less than in European countries such as Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1140">What seems to be forgotten by Ministers in Europe discussing economics is that at the heart of farming lie families and a way of life that is very important to nations such as Ireland. Some 3,700 farming families will be affected by the loss of the beet-producing sector in Ireland. That sector has existed since 1925 when engineers in Carlow began to mark out ground for what was to become the Carlow sugar factory. The development of other factories at Mallow, Thurles and Tuam proved that high quality sugar could be produced economically in Ireland from home grown material. It gave farmers the opportunity to diversify their production and gave them much-needed income.</p>
            <p eId="para_1141">Now, sugar beet production in Ireland, which has been a part of our history since shortly after the foundation of the State, has been signed away for a compensation package of €145 million. The upset at the destruction of the Irish beet sector was voiced recently in my constituency when hundreds of angry farmers met in Cahir. Many of them, from all over the beet-growing areas, including Wexford, Laois-Offaly, Carlow and Tipperary, implored the Minister to do something about their livelihood.</p>
            <p eId="para_1142">The Minister of State is in the enviable position of having discretion in the allocation of that European compensation fund and I appeal to him to consider as his first priority the 3,700 farming families which have recently seen their beet-producing days ended by the stroke of a pen in Europe. If any other sector had lost a similar number of jobs in one fell swoop, the Government would have responded with great urgency, not with the non-committal attitude that it reserves for farmers. Some 1,500 non-farmers employed in the sugar beet sector in Ireland will also shortly find themselves jobless. This is the bleak situation that must be considered by the Minister for Agriculture and Food when choices are being made about the allocation of the €145 million EU compensation package. The beet farmers who, at the end of the day, are the ones who will suffer most from this latest disaster must be properly and responsibly looked after by the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1143">I ask the Minister of State to clarify his intentions in respect of the distribution of the €145 million EU compensation package provided to compensate for the loss of the Irish sugar beet sector and to give his views on the viability of farming in Ireland in the future.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Agriculture_and_Food" eId="spk_407">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Browne)</from>
            <p eId="para_1144">I thank Deputies Sherlock and Hayes for raising this important issue. The recent agreement by the Council of Agriculture Ministers on reform of the EU sugar regime was the culmination of a protracted and difficult negotiating process. I am satisfied that the outcome from Ireland's perspective was the best possible deal in the circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1145">The reasons reform of the sugar regime could no longer be postponed are well known. As well as the increasing internal EU pressures to bring sugar into line with the other agricultural sectors, there were also strong international pressures. These fell under three main headings: the everything but arms agreement, EBA, the WTO Doha round of trade negotiations and the ruling by the WTO panel against aspects of the EU sugar regime, following a complaint by Brazil, Thailand and Australia. The recent decision by the WTO arbitrator that the EU must implement the panel ruling by next May added to the pressure for early action. There was considerable support for the ambition of the UK Presidency to achieve political agreement ahead of this month's WTO ministerial meeting in Hong Kong. In any event, the sugar regime in its current form expires at the end of June 2006 so there was need for an early decision on future arrangements to avoid a legal vacuum from next July.</p>
            <p eId="para_1146">While it is over a year since the Commission first outlined its thinking on the future shape of the sugar regime, the formal legislative proposals only emerged at the end of June 2005. These proposals turned out to be even more severe than anybody had anticipated and they went even further than the Commission had initially envisaged.</p>
            <p eId="para_1147">From the outset, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, availed of every opportunity to highlight the serious repercussions that the reform proposals would have for the Irish industry. Beet growing has long been a valuable cash crop for Irish farmers, as well as playing an important role in the tillage cycle as a break crop. In Brussels, Ireland played an active role in a group of 11 member states which had common cause in opposing the Commission's proposals. With her ministerial colleagues from these countries the Minister made joint submissions to the Agriculture Commissioner, the most recent one just before the formal discussions of the proposals at the October Council meeting. Furthermore, the Minister engaged, as did our officials, in an intensive round of discussions with the Commission, the Presidency and other member states with a view to modifying the proposals to take account of Ireland's particular circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1148">On 24 November, after three days of intensive negotiations in Brussels, the Minister had to make a judgment on what was the best possible deal for Ireland, taking account of the negotiating positions being adopted by other member states. The outcome of the negotiations represents the best possible deal that could have been achieved and is a considerable improvement on the Commission's initial proposals of last June.</p>
            <p eId="para_1149">From Ireland's perspective, the main features of the agreement, as already announced, are a lower reduction in the support price of sugar than originally proposed — 36% instead of 39%, a phasing in of the corresponding reduction in the minimum sugar beet price over four years instead of the two-step reduction originally proposed, an increased rate of compensation for beet growers of up to 64% of the price reduction to be paid in the form of direct payments worth approximately €121 million to Irish beet growers over the next seven years, a once-off payment worth almost €44 million exclusively for beet growers in the event that sugar beet production ceases in Ireland, and an aid package of up to €145 million for the economic, social and environmental costs of restructuring of the Irish sugar industry involving factory closure and renunciation of quota.</p>
            <p eId="para_1150">The entire compensation package has an estimated value in excess of €300 million. It will be a matter for beet growers and Irish Sugar Limited to make decisions about sugar beet growing in light of the reformed sugar regime.</p>

            <p eId="para_1154">In the event that sugar production ceases in Ireland, a once-off payment of almost €44 million would be available for growers. In addition, the restructuring fund of up to €145 million would become available to provide compensation for the economic, social and environmental costs arising from factory closure. The agreement provides that at least 10% of the fund shall be reserved for sugar beet growers and machinery contractors to compensate notably for losses arising from investment in specialised machinery. This amount may be increased by member states after consultation with interested parties as long as the financial breakdown of the elements of the restructuring plan is kept balanced according to a sound economic proposal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1155">The formal legal texts giving effect to the agreement will be adopted by the Council of Ministers early next year after the opinion of the European Parliament has been received. The Commission will then come forward with proposals for detailed implementation rules. Pending the adoption of the relevant regulations, it is not possible to give definitive information but, as with the earlier phases of the Common Agricultural Policy reform, my Department will make timely arrangements for implementing the new regime in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_1156">In reply to Deputy Sherlock, my Department has been working closely with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to bring forward proposals as quickly as possible in the biofuels area. I am sure the Minister for Finance will take a direct interest in further exemption of the excise area. Deputy Hayes referred to a recent angry meeting of farmers in Cahir.

          <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_413" as="#Acting_Chairman">
            <from>Mr. Naughten</from>
            <p eId="para_1158">The pig and poultry industries account for 6% of total nitrogen usage and 10% of total phosphate usage in Irish agriculture. In 2002, the Department of Agriculture and Food published a report, Eco-Friendly Farming, which noted that in regard to the rural environment protection scheme, which had been in place since 1994, we had gone far beyond the minimum level of compliance required under the EU scheme at that time. The Department made its own admission in that regard and acknowledged that there was a high level of enforcement in Ireland. On that basis, the proposals on the nitrates directives go beyond what was set out in the REPS plans and the good farming practice guidelines. They also go beyond Teagasc's green book which was last revised in 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1159">I am disappointed that nobody from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government thought it worthwhile to come to the House to respond to these issues. That Department has clearly gone to ground on this matter. Why has it gone further than the scientific basis provided by Teagasc? The recommendation on the phosphorous threshold rests at a P index of three on the basis of REPS plans, the good farming practice codes and the Teagasc green book. The new recommendations reduce this level to a P index of two. In regard to phosphorous, a farmer could in the past choose to operate either on an index of two or three. It was up to the farmer and based on the type of farming practice. For example, a farmer who wanted early grass would opt for a P index of three.</p>
            <p eId="para_1160">At last week's meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food, Mr. Tom Quinlivan from the Department of Agriculture and Food said that practically everything set out in the table regarding the P index corresponds with Teagasc recommendations. He went on:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1161">As I said, some elements were introduced to bring clarity and allow for enforcement. There were some amendments but they were generally minor and reflect the Teagasc recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1162">Last Friday, however, Dr. Seamus Crosse, the chief technical officer of Teagasc, sent an internal memo to the Departments of Agriculture and Food and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, stating that Teagasc would not be in a position to substantiate this report legally or otherwise. This is based on what Mr. Quinlivan had said earlier in the week at the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food.</p>
            <p eId="para_1163">The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government rejects that letter from Dr. Crosse on the basis that it did not come from the director of Teagasc. The reality, however, is that the Department has cooked the books on the issue of the nitrates directive and is not prepared to provide any shred of scientific evidence to support the restrictions it proposes under the nitrates directive. As they stand, the proposals will make every REPS plan illegal. REPS is supposed to be the benchmark for good farming practice and in terms of environmental protection. However, all that is being thrown out the window along with all the scientific evidence Teagasc has to back it up. Figures are now being plucked out of the sky by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. There is no scientific evidence to support its position. Teagasc has stated clearly that it has not provided the scientific evidence to support these proposals and is withdrawing its support.</p>
            <p eId="para_1164">It is unbelievable that representatives of both Departments have acknowledged that pig and poultry producers will have a significant problem early next year with the transition from the current system to the new one as set out by the nitrates directives. However, nobody is prepared to do anything about it or provide any flexibility. It is a damning indictment of both Departments.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" eId="spk_414" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Agriculture_and_Food">
            <from>Mr. Browne</from>
            <p eId="para_1165">I thank Deputy Naughten for raising this issue. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, would like to thank him and apologise for his absence. The nitrates directive was adopted on 12 December 1991. It has the objective of protecting waters against pollution from agricultural sources, with the primary emphasis on the management of livestock manure and other fertilisers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1166">The European Court of Justice delivered a judgment in March 2004 that Ireland was non-compliant with the directive by reason mainly of failing to establish an action programme, including regulations to protect waters against pollution by farming. After lengthy negotiations and consultations with all relevant interests and partners in farming organisations, Ireland's national action programme under the nitrates directive was formally submitted to the European Commission on 29 July 2005. In October, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, together with the Department of Agriculture and Food jointly issued a consultation paper regarding draft regulations to give legal effect to the action programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1167">A total of 76 submissions have since been received from a wide range of stakeholders. Both Departments have reviewed these submissions and the possibility of amending the regulations is being pursued with the European Commission. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government expects to make the final regulations this month. This will allow Ireland to pursue its case for a derogation with the European Commission and other member states.</p>
            <p eId="para_1168">Ireland's original proposal for a derogation from the general livestock manure limit laid down in the directive, 170 kg of nitrogen per hectare per year, was submitted to the Commission in November 2004. This has now been updated and submitted informally. Our proposal is designed to allow certain farmers to operate, under appropriate conditions and controls, up to a level of 250 kg. The scope of the derogation being sought will cater not only for intensive dairy farmers, but also specifically for grassland holdings importing manure from intensive pig and poultry farms. Officials from the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Agriculture and Food will give an initial presentation on Ireland's case for a derogation to the EU nitrates committee on 12 December next, with the aim of securing agreement on a derogation by mid-2006. The Minister, Deputy Roche, is aware of the concerns which have been expressed about the pig and poultry sectors. He has had a series of meetings with the farming organisations to discuss the concerns of all farmers and the challenges which arise from the directive. The fertilisation standards for phosphorus proposals to the regulation are firmly based on Teagasc's nutrient advice.</p>
            <p eId="para_1169">The Government has put proposals to the Commission which will mean that pig and poultry farmers will be eligible for the first time for grant aid for additional manure storage facilities. The level of grant aid, which is being increased for all farmers, will be as high as 70% in some counties. The Minister for Agriculture and Food has announced her intention to introduce a scheme to support the demonstration of new technologies, such as anaerobic and aerobic digestion systems, to help the agriculture sector to meet the requirements of the nitrates directive. The purpose of the scheme is to look at new and emerging technologies for the treatment of livestock manure, particularly from the pig and poultry sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1170">The Government recognises the importance for pig and poultry farmers of having land on which they can spread manure. Other farmers need to recognise that the various forms of manure are valuable nutrients which can be used to replace expensive chemical fertilisers. Farmers can help themselves and each other by using manure. I understand that the Minister for Agriculture and Food will ask Teagasc shortly to undertake an active promotion campaign to demonstrate the nutrient value of slurry and the savings that farmers can achieve by using it instead of chemical fertiliser. The Minister, Deputy Roche, has asked me to reiterate that Teagasc fully assisted in the preparation and development of the fertilisation tables contained in the draft regulations. On 21 November last, Teagasc provided observations on the draft regulations which did not address or call into question the proposed phosphorus standards. The fertilisation standards proposed in the regulations are agronomically sound and will support optimum crop yields while providing the necessary environmental safeguards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1171">There has been some confusion about the precedent set in the Dutch rules and regulations on fertilisation standards for the purposes of the nitrates directive. The standards operating in the Netherlands have a proper legal basis in that country and are not merely recommendations or guidelines. I understand that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government spoke today to the director of Teagasc, who confirmed that Teagasc's information on the non-binding nature of the application limits in the Netherlands was based on a non-final draft of the Dutch regulations. Teagasc has since confirmed that the fertiliser limits in the finalised Dutch regulations are mandatory. Teagasc will write to the Minister to confirm that this is also its understanding of the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_1174">Following the Minister's announcement on 12 April last there are now 31 inspector posts sanctioned for the labour inspectorate. This represents almost a doubling of inspector personnel in the past 12 months and is indicative of a determination to ensure compliance with employment rights legislation. Following a recent selection process the labour inspectorate now has its full complement of 31 inspectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1175">When the full complement of officers are fully operational they will concentrate on those employment sectors that have traditionally required considerable attention from the inspectorate. These would be the services sectors that are covered by employment regulation orders such as, hospitality, cleaning and agricultural work. It is notable that many migrant workers are employed in these sectors at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_1176">The latest CSO statistics indicate that the current number of workers in the workforce is now more than 2 million. In addition to the labour inspectorate, it should be noted that there is a wide corpus of employment rights legislation administered by various State organisations and services. These include the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the redundancy and insolvency sections of this Department, the rights commissioner services provided by the Labour Relations Commission and the services provided by the Labour Court. The labour inspectorate is a unit within the employment rights compliance section which also includes the employment rights information unit and a further separate unit that administers the referral of cases for prosecution and legal enforcement of orders. Between them, these various services have a complement of staff in excess of 150 people.</p>

            <p eId="para_1181">No distinction is made in employment rights legislation between Irish and migrant workers. For the avoidance of doubt section 20 of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 provides that all employee protection legislation on the Statute Book in Ireland applies to workers posted to work in Ireland in line with Directive 96/71/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 16 December 1996. This directive relates to the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services and applies also to a person, irrespective of his or her nationality or place of residence, who has entered into a contract of employment that provides for his or her being employed in the State or who works in the State under a contract of employment. Thus, all employee legislation applies to migrant workers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1182">The general approach adopted by the labour inspectorate to employment rights enforcement is to seek compliance and rectification of any breaches identified, including payment of any arrears due to employees. Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and seek redress for the individual or individuals concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated. Successful prosecution can be dependent on adequate support from witnesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_1183">Following the Minister's announcement on 12 April last there are now 31 inspector posts sanctioned for the labour inspectorate. This represents almost a doubling of inspector personnel in the past 12 months and is indicative of a determination to ensure compliance with employment rights legislation. Following a recent selection process the labour inspectorate now has its full complement of 31 inspectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1184">When the full complement of officers are fully operational they will concentrate on those employment sectors that have traditionally required considerable attention from the inspectorate. These would be the services sectors that are covered by employment regulation orders such as hospitality, cleaning and agricultural work. It is notable that many migrant workers are employed in these sectors at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_1185">Work has been progressing with regard to the discussion document prepared in connection with the mandate and resourcing of the labour inspectorate. The discussion document covers the full dimension of issues that impact on the operation of the labour inspectorate ranging from the legislative framework right through to the operational aspects and staff development. The social partners, together with representatives from the Departments of the Taoiseach and Finance, are members of the Employment Rights Compliance Group, ERCG, that is considering the discussion document. It is anticipated that the ERCG will conclude its business in January 2006.</p>

        <b>Mr. Connaughton</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</b>
        his views on the fact that Ireland’s expenditure on research and development, according to the European innovation scoreboard and cited by the National Competitiveness Council, stands at just over 50% of the EU 25 average; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1187">I believe the Deputy is quoting from a table in The Competitiveness Challenge 2005 produced by the NCC. That table comprises some 13 measures of Ireland's innovation performance relative to the EU 25. We do well on some of the suite of indicators and less well on the others. In five areas, Ireland is above the EU average, in some cases such as hi-tech manufacturing output and science and engineering graduates, we are around the 200% mark. In another three areas, namely, high tech manufacturing, early stage VC investment and hi-tech patents, we are close to the EU average.</p>
            <p eId="para_1188">In addition, I can advise the House that, according to the latest figures from Forfás, which are estimates for 2004, the overall total research and development expenditure — GERD, representing public and business expenditure — for Ireland has increased to 1.43% of GNP, compared with the EU average of 1.85%. On the basis of these latest statistics, Ireland stands at 77% of the EU average research and development spend.</p>
            <p eId="para_1189">The process of comprehensively addressing the research and development agenda was commenced under the current NDP, with science, technology and innovation becoming a major plank of this Government's policy, underpinned by significant resources. However, I acknowledge that this remains a challenging issue for Ireland. This was fully recognised and reflected in the national research and development action plan last year and is being comprehensively addressed in the context of a long-term strategy for science, technology and innovation being prepared for the Cabinet subcommittee on STI, which I chair. I hope to bring that strategy forward shortly. In the interim, a number of initiatives have already been put in place to raise both public and private investment in research, including the research and development tax credit, and steady progress is being made from our 1.32% GERD figure in 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1190">The business sector is, however, the predominant player in GERD, contributing about two thirds of the total. Significant improvement in GERD will depend critically on raising levels of research and development in industry. Achieving this is a major policy goal of my Department and of the development agencies under its remit. IDA Ireland is now concentrating its efforts to attract new research and development projects to Ireland and to raise significantly the levels of research and development performed by foreign-owned enterprise in the economy. Recent announcements have been very positive in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1191">There remain significant challenges ahead, Ireland has been playing catch up against our international competitors in this field and we need to make the next quantum leap forward. This will require strategic investment and I propose to lead that investment, to ensure that within the next decade Ireland will become internationally renowned for quality research, using new knowledge for economic and social benefit.</p>

            <p eId="para_1193">The Construction Federation operatives pension scheme, generally referred to as CFOPS, has been established on foot of a registered employment agreement for the construction industry. A separate registered employment agreement in the construction sector provides for the establishment of statutory rates of pay and related working conditions of employment. The terms of both agreements apply to a range of categories of workers in the industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_1194">Compliance with CFOPS has been an issue of concern for some while and it prompted the Pensions Board to engage Mercer Consultants to carry out a review. The terms of reference for the consultants were formulated by a steering committee that included representatives of the social partners. The report, which was recently published, sets out a range of recommendations that have policy and operational implications for various Departments that are being examined at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_1195">Enforcement of compliance with the CFOPS is a matter primarily for the Labour Court. In pursuing the matter the Labour Court can be assisted by the labour inspectorate. Acting on specific information from the court, the employment records of an employer will be examined by an inspector and any relevant information gathered is communicated back to the court subsequently. The inspectorate has no other function in the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1196">In the meantime, work has also been progressing with regard to the discussion document prepared in connection with the mandate and resourcing the labour inspectorate. The social partners, together with representatives from the Departments of the Taoiseach and Finance, are members of the Employment Rights Compliance Group, ERCG, that is considering the discussion document. Among the issues being examined is the simplification and streamlining of employment rights compliance monitoring and the redress system. This includes the limited role for the Inspectorate in regard to the CFOPS. Those recommendations of the Mercer report that impinge on the activities of the labour inspectorate will be considered by the ERCG.</p>

            <p eId="para_1198">The reduced Exchequer allocation to Enterprise Ireland under grants to industry does not represent a reduction in the agency's activities. The reduction was sought by my Department in light of various factors, in particular the agency's funding needs and its ability to generate its own income.</p>
            <p eId="para_1199">It should be noted that Enterprise Ireland expects to generate significant own resources in 2006 which will more than compensate for the reduction in the grants to industry Exchequer Estimates. Enterprise Ireland is expected to increase its expenditure on grants to industry in 2006. The increase in expenditure reflects the recent new activities undertaken by Enterprise Ireland including the productivity improvement fund and the pilot project to source and develop increased levels of sales and marketing talent in Ireland, which the agency initiated in conjunction with FÁS. Enterprise Ireland will continue to formulate new proposals for addressing the needs of its clients.</p>
            <p eId="para_1200">In regard to Enterprise Ireland's funding needs, the provision in the 2006 Estimates, while it is less than the 2005 provision, exceeds the likely 2005 outturn for Exchequer supported expenditure which is currently estimated at €45.8 million. The agency will not utilise its full 2005 budget due to a reduced demand by clients for equity investment as well as delays arising from infrastructural projects and investment into seed and venture capital funding. The delays arising from infrastructural projects and investment into seed and venture capital funding are temporary and funding has therefore been provided for these activities in the 2006 Estimate. The reduction in demand for equity may reflect a change of emphasis by client companies towards equity investment in support of research and development, which Enterprise Ireland reports as having a strong demand.</p>
            <p eId="para_1201">Enterprise Ireland also receives substantial funding from subhead F which provides funding for research, technology and innovation activities. The 2006 Estimates provides €100.9 million towards subhead F an increase of €9 million on the 2005 Exchequer expenditure Estimate.</p>

            <p eId="para_1206">Under the Government's mainstreaming policy, my Department through FÁS is seeking to increase the participation of disabled workers through a three-pronged approach involving, first, facilitating progression into sustainable employment through skills development; second, stimulating awareness among employers of the contribution that disabled people can make and encouraging them to recruit them; and third, providing specific employment supports for disabled people and employers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1207">The Department, through FÁS, provides a range of schemes and grants aimed at promoting or facilitating the employment of people with disabilities within the private sector, including: the disability awareness training support scheme; the workplace-equipment adaptation grant; the personal reader grant; the job interview interpreter grant; the employee retention grant scheme; and the supported employment programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1208">A number of significant projects have also been undertaken to promote both the employment of disabled people and awareness of the supports available. These projects include, first, the funding of the Workway project which was an IBEC and ICTU initiative under Sustaining Progress. The aim of Workway was to promote the employment of disabled people in the private sector. Second, FÁS co-sponsored an RTE television series in 2004 and 2005 called "Three 60", which explored and challenged the attitudes about disability in Ireland through a wide range of stories and issues. The series included specific features particularly relevant to FÁS, outlining the employment grants and schemes available to employers. Third, FÁS is one of the sponsors for the O2 Ability awards granted to employers for best practice in the employment of disabled people. Fourth, in 2004, FÁS launched its Ability in the Workplace media campaign to highlight the abilities of disabled people in the labour market; and fifth, and most recently in July 2005, the new FÁS wage subsidy scheme was launched which provides progressive financial incentives for employers to take on additional workers with disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1209">FÁS promotes its training and employment supports for disabled people on a systematic basis through such channels as its website, selected mail shots, presentations to relevant groups, publications, articles in magazines and newsletters, brochures and employer packs.</p>

This capacity is significantly greater than the number of apprentices recruited by employers in County Clare.

Recent legislative initiatives in this regard are: section 27 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, which came into effect from 1 September 2005 and provides for protection against dismissal and penalisation of employees who, in good faith, take steps to protect themselves or others in a workplace situation; and section 124 of the Garda Síochána Bill 2004, which provides for regulations relating to the reporting of corruption and malpractice in the Garda Síochána.</p>

            <p eId="para_1222">I welcome last month's publication of the National Competitiveness Council, NCC, Competitiveness Challenge 2005. The challenge, which builds on the analysis and benchmarking of the Annual Competitiveness Report 2005, is an important contribution to our policy making and thinking on strategic development issues. The purpose of the Competitiveness Challenge is to highlight the main challenges facing the Irish business sector and identify the policy responses to support and further improve Ireland's competitiveness position.</p>
            <p eId="para_1223">The Competitiveness Challenge 2005 recognises the remarkable success of Ireland's economic strategy over the past 20 years and acknowledges that we are currently in a position of economic strength. The report also identifies a vision for the future of the country as a dynamic, flexible economy. We are already on the path towards achieving that vision. The new work permits regime, our skills and training initiatives, investment in research and development and in infrastructure through Transport 21 and the considerable steps by the Government to strengthen competition provide the essential building blocks for the dynamic, flexible economy called for by the NCC.</p>
            <p eId="para_1224">However, the NCC also highlights several challenges to be addressed to sustain our competitiveness in the medium to long term. These challenges include increased global competition; our increased cost base; the need to manage the shift from manufacturing to services; and the need to further develop our knowledge economy. To address these challenges the council is proposing policy initiatives in the following four areas, tax and regulation, infrastructure, education and training and entrepreneurship and innovation. Of particular importance are the proposals on increased investment in research and development, education, the need for increased vigilance in ensuring value for money and promoting competitive markets. All the policy initiatives suggested by the NCC will be given careful consideration by Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_1226">The success of the Irish labour market over the past decade has been unparalleled in the recent history of Europe. Since 1997 more than 522,000 jobs have been created, unemployment has more than halved and long-term unemployment has fallen to 1.4%. Over the same period, the number of young persons in employment has increased by approximately 20% while the number of unemployed youths has fallen by 27%. This impressive labour market performance has continued this year with the latest CSO figures showing an increase of 5% in the numbers employed. The most recent EU data show our youth unemployment rate of 8.5% is the second lowest in the EU and well below the EU 25 average rate of 18.1%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1227">The report referred to by the Deputy states that the youth unemployment rate has fallen in recent years and that the rate generally tends to be higher than the overall unemployment rate. This is not unique to Ireland and is mainly due to factors such as seasonal employment and a greater level of frictional unemployment. Young persons in the labour market tend to be more mobile and switch jobs more often.</p>
            <p eId="para_1228">A wide range of labour market measures specifically designed to help young people access the labour market are available through FÁS. FÁS systematically engages with unemployed young people early in their unemployment spell, to prevent a drift into long-term unemployment. These persons are accorded priority by FÁS in the allocation of places on its training and employment programmes. In addition, FÁS has a specific programme of action designed to provide early school leavers with basic skills and work experience to aid progress towards further training or employment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1233">The company in question has announced that it intends to close its Sligo operation by the end of 2006. I understand that the company has commenced an extended staff consultation process of 60 days and the outcome of this process is likely to be a phased transfer of the operation outside of Ireland next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1234">The company was acquired earlier this year and, I understand, the parent company considers that there is a need to consolidate operations as there is not enough business to support the operation of a number of facilities that make similar product. A review of the operations at Sligo has led to the conclusion that the Sligo business should be relocated. The review was the direct result of the competitive pressure being experienced by the company's customers and a requirement to continue to reduce manufacturing costs. While the most likely scenario is a phased shutdown of the Sligo operation beginning in spring 2006, nonetheless, IDA Ireland will continue to work closely with the company while the review process is under way.</p>
            <p eId="para_1235">Job losses are of ongoing concern and the Government is doing all in its power to create structures through its enterprise development and training agencies to facilitate those who lose jobs to gain new ones, particularly ones that offer more opportunity in terms of skills and permanence. While FÁS has already visited the company, the agency is awaiting confirmation as to when it can commence the process of interviewing the staff. The full range of FÁS services will be offered to the staff if the staff wish to avail of those services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1236">There have been two particularly significant job announcements for Sligo in recent times. These are Abbott Ireland, which is to add 350 new jobs to its existing facility, and IDT Toucan, which is to create 300 new jobs at its customer service centre. I can assure the Deputy that the State development agencies under the aegis of my Department will continue to work closely together and with local interests in promoting Sligo for further job creation and investment.</p>

            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1244">The Deputy will be aware that there have been significant job announcements in Donegal recently with more than 210 new jobs announced in September 2005 by Zeus Industrial Products, Letterkenny and PowerBoard, Burnfoot. These projects are being supported by the Industrial Development Agency and Enterprise Ireland, respectively. This was in addition to 423 jobs I announced earlier this year for the north west region.</p>
            <p eId="para_1245">The State development agencies under my auspices, IDA, EI, FÁS and Donegal County Enterprise Board, are fully committed to supporting and promoting job creation and job retention in Donegal. In addition to recent job announcements, this commitment is also evidenced by ongoing development and support by the agencies for a number of business parks and enterprise centres in Donegal. These include the completion of the IDA Letterkenny Business Park, the provision of a 25,000 sq. ft. advance office building at Windyhall, the completion of site development work at Ballyshannon for a new facility and also a development at Buncrana where IDA is working with a local developer to provide new manufacturing and office buildings. In addition to providing support for nine community enterprise centres in Donegal, Enterprise Ireland has provided substantial support for the expansion of the Letterkenny Institute of Technology Business Development Centre and the development of a Marine Biotechnology Centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_1246">The development agencies will continue to work together to promote Donegal in order to attract investment and to foster job creation there. However, I also recognise that there have been significant job losses in Donegal in recent years, and I have visited the county twice since becoming Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I have met many groups and companies on these visits to discuss both the county's difficulties and opportunities. My colleagues in Government also recognise the particular difficulties in Donegal and we will work together to assist in improving the overall environment to increase the attractiveness of Donegal as a location for enterprises. In that context, I established an interdepartmental group on Donegal chaired by the Secretary General of my Department. I assure the Deputy that support for job creation in Donegal will continue to remain a priority for the State development agencies under the auspices of my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_1251">I propose to take Questions Nos. 90, 290, 294 and 295 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1252">Maintaining Ireland's attractiveness as a competitive and profitable location from which to do business is a key priority of the Government. Ireland's economy is undergoing fundamental change and we are no longer in the business of competing as a low cost location for basic manufacturing investment. We are now a modern, advanced European economy, typified by all the associated advantages of high incomes, living standards, employment growth and social services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1253">Given the continuing transformation of our economy, high value added services and related activities have increasingly become the wealth and employment drivers in the economy. With this evolution, it is inevitable that some low technology and labour intensive activities will be replaced by alternative higher value added and more sophisticated activities. This is the nature of a flexible market economy where well-executed and supportive enterprise policies enable structural adjustments to take place without significant economic or social disruption. This has been a feature of our economy particularly over the past ten years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1254">Despite increasing global competitive pressures, the latest quarterly national household survey shows that the number of persons in employment grew by 96,200 in the year to reach almost 1.99 million in the third quarter of 2005. Moreover, we have seen employment increase in most sectors of the economy, not only construction, with financial and business services showing strong growth. The latest data also point to a slight upturn in the numbers employed in industry. These facts demonstrate that we remain a competitive economy for both foreign and indigenous enterprise and retain a strong capacity to generate and sustain employment while managing the transition to a more knowledge and services oriented economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1255">Sustaining national competitiveness is a priority for Government. To give effect to this in my Department I have assigned more resources and given more powers to the Competition Authority. We abolished the groceries order and have undertaken a comprehensive reform programme of the insurance sector. This led to the establishment of both the Motor Insurance Advisory Board and the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB. The PIAB has been particularly successful in reducing the cost of litigation and decreasing insurers' premiums. In relation to research and development, I am pleased to say that all elements of the new co-ordination and governance system for Science Technology Ireland, STI, are now in place and fully operational. Over the lifetime of the current national development plan we will have invested €2.5 billion in research, technological development and innovation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1256">At wider Government level public capital investment in infrastructure is being prioritised through the rolling five-year multi-annual capital envelopes introduced in budget 2004 under which public capital investment is maintained at around 5% of GNP. This level of investment is currently about twice the EU average. The Minister for Finance also recently announced a 12 point plan to ensure value for money to build on existing initiatives that are already in place such as administrative budgets, the expenditure review initiative and the new capital appraisal guidelines.</p>

            <p eId="para_1262">I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 113 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1263">Sixteen investigations into company law matters were initiated by my predecessor in the period since 1997. In three cases, the High Court appointed, on an application by the Minister, inspectors under section 8 of the Companies Act 1990. The inspectors appointed to Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited presented their report to the High Court on 10 June 2002. The report was subsequently published and referred to the DPP.</p>
            <p eId="para_1264">The inspectors appointed to National Irish Bank Limited, and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited, presented their report to the High Court on 12 July 2004. The report was subsequently published. The court ordered that a copy of the report be referred to several relevant authorities, including the DPP. Earlier this year, the Director of Corporate Enforcement initiated proceedings in the High Court under section 160(2) of the Companies Act 1990, as amended, seeking the disqualification of nine persons against whom adverse comment was made by the inspectors. I welcomed the director's action in this case. I note that last October the High Court granted a disqualification order against one of the nine persons. The proceedings against the other eight remain before the court.</p>
            <p eId="para_1265">One investigation under section 14 of the Companies Act 1990 was completed in 1998. The report on this was referred to the DPP. One investigation was undertaken under section 59 of the Insurance Act 1989. The report on this was referred to the DPP as well as to the inspectors who undertook the section 8 investigation into that company.</p>
            <p eId="para_1266">Eleven investigations were initiated by the Minister under section 19 of the Companies Act 1990. Six of these have been concluded. Of the six investigations completed, two of the reports were referred to the DPP. A number of summary prosecutions have since been successfully concluded in one case. One report provided an input into the successful application to the High Court for the appointment of inspectors under section 8 while the fourth report was passed to the relevant High Court inspectors. One report was completed in September 2002 and a further report was completed in March 2003. Both reports have been referred to the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1267">Two of the 11 section 19 investigations were held up in legal appeals. These inquiries are now the responsibility of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. In relation to the three remaining section 19 investigations, the current position is that following the completion of the review to which I referred in response to a previous parliamentary question on 31 May 2005, I directed the authorised officer to place at the disposal of relevant public authorities, including tribunals, whatever information arising from his investigative work was required for the purpose of the performance by those authorities of their statutory functions. This process is currently in progress and I hope it will be completed within a reasonable time. My objective in giving this direction is to achieve the earliest possible pursuit by the appropriate authorities of any matter which may require action by them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1268">The costs incurred since 1997 on company investigations initiated by or on behalf of my Department currently amount to approximately €11.1 million. This amount does not include the salary costs of Civil Service staff working on a number of these investigations or the legal costs which are primarily being borne by the Vote of the Chief State Solicitor. Of the €11.1 million expended, €1.8 million relates to section 19 investigations by authorised officers and the remaining €9.3 million was incurred by High Court inspectors appointed under section 8 —€5.8 million in the case of National Irish Bank Limited-National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited and €3.5 million in the case of Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited.</p>
            <p eId="para_1269">The question of recovering costs from the section 8 investigations does not arise until such time as the inspectors complete their investigations. In the case of the Ansbacher inquiry, the High Court proceedings taken by the State to recover the costs of the inquiry were settled out of court for the sum of €1.25 million in favour of the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1270">In the case of National Irish Bank Limited-National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited, the court ordered that National Irish Bank pay the full costs of the investigation. I understand that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which had borne the costs of the investigation, has recouped the full cost from National Irish Bank. Section 19 as originally enacted did not provide for the recoupment of costs. This has now changed with the enactment of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001.</p>

            <p eId="para_1289">I propose to take Questions Nos. 97, 105 and 110 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1290">The purpose of competition law is to prohibit anti-competitive practices by "undertakings" such as price fixing and-or the abuse of a dominant position. The Competition Act 2002 applies to all sectors of the economy in the State. An "undertaking" is defined in the Act as "a person being an individual, a body corporate or an unincorporated body of persons engaged for gain in the production, supply, or distribution of goods or the provision of a service". This definition has been in use in Irish competition law for some time and is supported by EU case law.</p>
            <p eId="para_1291">The authority's decision, which describes how it came to its view on this case, is published on its website, <i>tca.ie</i>. It states that while it is perfectly legal for Equity to represent employed actors in collective bargaining with their employers, its trade union mantle cannot exempt its conduct when it acts as a trade association for self-employed contractors. In this case the authority determined that the actors in question were self-employed contractors and not employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_1292">In considering the question of whether an exemption from competition law should be provided for actors, musicians, film crews and freelance journalists, therefore, we need to bear in mind that a similar argument could be made for almost any group of self-employed contractors, such as barristers, publicans, doctors or pharmacists, who, by coming together, adding union to their name and getting a negotiating licence, could circumvent the protections afforded to consumers by the Oireachtas in the Competition Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_1293">I understand, however, that the view expressed by the Competition Authority was in respect of this particular case only. The parties to the investigation have entered into undertakings with the authority in settlement of the case, thereby avoiding the necessity of going to court. It is only the courts who can interpret the law. I have no plans to amend current legislation in this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_1295">National aviation policy, including the establishment of the new Shannon Airport Authority and changes to the Ireland-US bilateral air services arrangements fall within the policy remit of my colleague, the Minister for Transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_1296">My Department and the development agencies under its remit, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and the city and county enterprise boards, are committed to the economic and industrial development of the Shannon region, in line with national enterprise policy goals, and the achievement of balanced regional development, within the framework of the national spatial strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1297">The House will be aware that I recently announced details of a new mandate for Shannon Development. Under the terms of the new mandate the company is being given a more focused regional economic development remit that will complement the roles of the national agencies, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, in attracting foreign direct investment and developing the indigenous enterprise base in the region. The city and county enterprise boards will continue to provide supports to stimulate economic activity at local level and to promote the establishment of micro-enterprises in the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_1298">The new mandate is based on Shannon Development's own future strategy proposals and has the support of the board and other stakeholders in the region. It is also in line with the recommendations of the Enterprise Strategy Group and the decision to decentralise the headquarters of Enterprise Ireland to Shannon. The new arrangements will provide for a more logical delineation of responsibilities between the enterprise development agencies in the mid-west region and for greater clarity in relation to the economic development aspects of Shannon Development's remit. I have asked the company to prepare a new three-year corporate plan to give substance to the mandate and I hope to receive this in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1299">IDA Ireland's strategy for the mid-west region places an emphasis on the gateway and hub locations of Shannon-Limerick, Tralee and Ennis. The location of new overseas investment in the gateway and hub locations not alone brings high wage jobs to these locations but has knock-on benefits in other sectors such as supply, distribution and transport, thus creating further investment-employment opportunities for local people in the immediate vicinity and surrounding areas. IDA Ireland's sectoral emphasis in the mid-west region is on attracting new knowledge intensive projects in information communications and technology, international services, medical technologies and life sciences.</p>
            <p eId="para_1300">The airport provides a strong selling point for the region and all of the agencies and stakeholders in the region agree that the successful development of Shannon Airport is vital to its economic success. They are already working together to enhance the potential of the region in fora such as the Atlantic Technology Corridor and the Atlantic Way. IDA Ireland works with the airport to monitor routes, schedules, etc., to ensure ease of access and timeliness for potential inward investment opportunities. Shannon Development, in conjunction with other stakeholders, has also initiated work on the possible development of an agile logistics hub at the airport. The company also has responsibility for tourism development in the Shannon region.</p>

            <p eId="para_1302">There are 13 county enterprise boards operating in the BMW region. These boards deliver the micro-enterprise measure under the Border, midlands and west, BMW, regional operational programme 2000-2006. The BMW region's Objective One status allows the use of comparatively better rates of incentives to business and assists the region in promoting and developing indigenous micro-enterprises.</p>
            <p eId="para_1303">The specific types of CEB assistance available to micro-enterprise from the measure is broken down between measure one — project support expenditure, including grants for feasibility studies, employment grants and capital grants, and measure two — soft supports activities such as business advice, management and e-commerce training, enterprise education and programmes aimed as assisting and promoting women in business.</p>
            <p eId="para_1304">I have allocated total Exchequer funding of more than €10.8 million to the CEBs in the BMW region for the current year. This represents an increase of nearly 7% on the 2004 allocation. The CEBs apply this allocation to fund their activities in support of micro-enterprise, that is, businesses with fewer than ten employees. Their function is to develop indigenous enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity at local level. In providing support to enterprises, the CEBs are required to have regard to the quality, local relevance, cost effectiveness and viability of proposals. They must also seek to avoid supporting projects that would displace existing jobs or businesses. In this regard, the boards are required to give priority to manufacturing and internationally traded services companies, which over time may develop into strong export entities. The local base of the CEBs which is responsible for the delivery of the micro-enterprise measure in the BMW region means that the projects supported are tailored to the particular needs of the local economic environment.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Killeen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1306">The labour inspectorate is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, including immigrant workers. The inspectorate operates without any differentiation with regard to worker nationality as statutory employment rights and protections apply to immigrant workers in exactly the same manner as they do to native Irish workers. Accordingly, the labour inspectorate does not have a statistical breakdown of the number of employers who employ migrant workers. Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the inspectorate seeks redress for the individual or individuals concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated. A total of 4,225 workplace inspections-visits have been undertaken by the labour inspectorate since the commencement of 2005. An important measure of the effectiveness of the labour inspectorate is to look at the arrears of pay collected on behalf of employees. Almost €400,000 has been recovered by the inspectorate in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1307">Following the Minister's announcement earlier this year, there are now 31 inspector posts sanctioned for the labour inspectorate. This represents almost a doubling of inspector personnel in the past 12 months and is indicative of a determination to ensure compliance with employment rights legislation. Following a recent selection process the labour inspectorate now has its full complement of 31 inspectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1308">When the full complement of officers is fully operational they will concentrate on those employment sectors that have traditionally required considerable attention from the inspectorate. These would be the services sectors that are covered by employment regulation orders such as hospitality, cleaning and agricultural work. It is notable that many migrant workers are employed in these sectors at present. I urge anyone who has specific evidence of the mistreatment of workers to furnish all the relevant details and any related materials to the inspectorate with a view to pursuing the matter.</p>

This new mandate envisages an active, focused role for the company, complementary to that of national agencies in line with Government policy on regional development. It is also broadly in line with the company's future strategy proposals submitted to me in March 2005. In approving the new mandate, I asked the company to give priority to activities that would address the needs of the less developed parts of the Shannon region. I have asked the company to prepare a three year corporate plan for the period 2006-2008 which would reflect the substance of the new mandate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1311">In so far as the needs of the less developed parts of the region are concerned, I have not formally designated any specific areas.

            <p eId="para_1315">The county and city enterprise boards, CEBs, continue to play an extremely important role in developing the small business sector in Ireland and, to support them in delivering their programmes, some €30 million in Exchequer funds was allocated to fund them in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1316">The CEBs have been co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund under the current National Development Plan 2000-2006. While it will be some time before we will know what level of EU funds, if any, will be available to support the CEBs programmes in the next round of funding, I can confirm that it is my intention that an appropriate level of funding for the CEBs will be maintained for the foreseeable future. However, as with any programme of expenditure, the amount to be provided each year will have to be determined in the context of the usual budgetary constraints.</p>
            <p eId="para_1317">As regards structures, the Government has approved a recommendation of Enterprise Strategy Group for the establishment of a new central co-ordination unit within Enterprise Ireland, which will provide the CEBs with central direction, technical support, shared services and quality assurance with a view to enhancing the effectiveness, efficiency and impact of the CEBs. Discussions are taking place between my Department and the relevant agencies regarding the steps necessary to implement the ESG's recommendation in this regard. It is my intention to have this new unit established in early 2006.</p>

            <p eId="para_1319">The proposed acquisition by UPC Ireland BV — ultimately owned by Liberty Global Inc. which also owns Chorus — of MS Irish Cable Holdings Limited, trading as NTL, was notified to the Competition Authority on 24 May 2005. This proposal constituted a "media merger" under the Competition Act 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_1320">The Competition Authority carried out a full competition assessment of the case and on 4 November 2005 determined that the acquisition would not substantially lessen competition provided the parties comply with the conditions set out in its determination. While the authority found no significant overlap between the merging parties' businesses since both Chorus and NTL serve different geographic regions, nonetheless competition concerns arose because of cross-ownership issues involving Chorus and BskyB, which were compounded by the acquisition of NTL. While these cross-ownership issues are complex, the matter was resolved to the satisfaction of the authority through the imposition of 19 conditions in its determination.</p>
            <p eId="para_1321">Under the media merger provisions in the Competition Act, my role in the regulatory process is confined to considering the acquisition in the context of the relevant criteria listed at section 23(10) of the Act. These criteria essentially relate to media plurality and cross-media issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1322">In addition to its competition assessment and determination, the authority provided me with its opinion on the impact of the acquisition in respect of the relevant criteria. The authority essentially considered that the acquisition would not raise concerns in respect of these criteria. Having considered the advice of my Department on 2 December, I decided not to make any order prohibiting the acquisition. The proposed acquisition of Meteor by Eircom was notified to the Competition Authority on 12 August 2005 and cleared by the authority on 18 November. However, as this acquisition did not constitute a media merger under the Competition Act, I had no role in the regulatory process.</p>

            <p eId="para_1324">Within the past two years my Department, through Forfás, commissioned a review of the role and functions of the CEBs in the development of micro-enterprises. The review represents the most comprehensive examination of the role and functions of the CEBs since their inception over ten years ago. It largely endorsed the activities and operations of the CEBs and concluded that there is justification for continued State support to micro-enterprises and that the CEB network can continue to play a useful role in the overall national enterprise development policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1325">The review recommended that: in providing assistance to micro-enterprises, CEBs should focus more on economic, rather than social or local development, objectives; that there should be a renewed focus on the core enterprise mission; that the issues of potential deadweight, displacement and duplication should be more systematically and rigorously addressed; and that there should be a move away from grants to repayable finance as well as to soft supports. My Department has been working with the CEBs in respect of the reorientation of their focus in line with this recommendation. Taking account of the foregoing factors, I am satisfied that the current eligibility criteria are appropriate and I have no plans for any further review of them at this time.</p>

            <p eId="para_1329">The number of older workers in employment has increased by 33% over the past ten years and the employment rate now stands at close to 51%. This is above the EU target of 50% to be reached by 2010. This increase was mostly due to those outside the workforce returning to employment. In addition, the average exit age from the labour force is now the highest in the EU at 64.4 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1330">Government policy is to facilitate those who wish to extend their working lives to do so. A number of measures are in place to ensure that the participation of older workers in the labour market continues to improve. Equality legislation safeguards older workers from discrimination in the labour market and the Equality Authority makes employers aware of the benefits of employing older people through age awareness campaigns. In addition, a guide, which provides advice on attracting and retaining older workers, is made available to employers by IBEC.</p>
            <p eId="para_1331">Inflexible working arrangements can encourage early retirement and also discourage older workers who have retired from coming back into the workforce. Work-life balance policies are helpful in attracting older workers into the labour market and in this regard, the National Framework Committee for Work Life Balance, comprising represetatives of Departments, the social partners and the Equality Authority, support and facilitate the development of work-life balance policies at the level of the enterprise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1332">The likelihood of re-entering employment is strongly influenced by educational attainment levels and length of time out of employment. In this regard, investment in measures to develop the skills and working capacity of workers is being increased.</p>
            <p eId="para_1333">The OECD has recently undertaken a review of policies in relation to older workers in Ireland and this report was formally presented yesterday. Its findings and recommendations will be central to our consideration of what further actions are required to encourage greater labour force participation by older workers.</p>

            <p eId="para_1342">I propose to take Questions Nos. 109, 122, 129, 138, 147, 151, 291, and 292 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1343">On 4 December 2005 the National Implementation Body made a series of recommendations to the social partners and the Government regarding the maintenance and protection of employment standards in the Irish labour market. The National Implementation Body also made recommendations in respect of the dispute at Irish Ferries. The Irish Ferries recommendations were as follows: that Irish Ferries should suspend its application to re-register its vessels on the register of Cyprus; the efforts to arrive at an agreement regarding the terms and conditions of employees who wish to remain in the employment of Irish Ferries should continue and be brought to a conclusion not later than 7 December; the terms and conditions of employees who are recruited to work on these Irish Ferries vessels in the future should reflect, <i>inter alia</i>, Irish minimum wage arrangements, in the context of the unique nature of the contracts of employment which typically operate in the maritime sector, and to the competitive pressures faced by the company; and in the event that the outcome of this process was that these vessels were not maintained on the Irish register, then the terms of any agreement with regard to existing employees, and the standards which would apply to employees who are recruited to work on these Irish Ferries vessels in the future, should be reflected in an agreement of binding character which would not be vitiated by any subsequent change in the country of registration. The NIB urged the parties, without prejudice to their respective positions, to engage fully with the Labour Relations Commission over the period ending on 7 December with a view to finalising an agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1344">Last week I met the management of Irish Ferries and representatives of SIPTU and ICTU to convey to them the Government's concerns as to the gravity of the situation and the wider implications of the ongoing dispute. I urged all sides to engage in the Labour Relations Commission process with a view to achieving a resolution to the issues in dispute. I welcome the fact that the parties to this dispute have entered into negotiations facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission. The work already undertaken by and with the National Implementation Body, the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission provides a firm basis for resolution. I hope the parties succeed in the process to resolve this dispute quickly and without further disruption to ferry services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1345">In so far as the terms and conditions of employees on an Irish registered vessel are concerned, I am advised that if the owner of the vessel is an Irish individual or body corporate that the employees on the vessel are subject to the provisions of Irish law.</p>
            <p eId="para_1346">While recognising the exceptional situation that has arisen in the maritime sector, it is important to remember that there is already a comprehensive body of employment rights legislation in place, which has as its objective the protection of employees against arbitrary behaviour by employers; provision for the safety and health of workers; and to foster labour market harmony by promoting policies that minimise conflict and maximise fairness. In general, this legislation mirrors the broader EU social protection framework in the area of employment rights. In this regard, and in line with the principle of subsidiarity, enforcement of employment rights legislation derived form EU directives is a matter for each member state to determine. This body of law is, and will continue to be, enforced by Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1347">Following my announcement on 12 April last there are now 31 inspector posts sanctioned for the labour inspectorate. This represents almost a doubling of the complement of inspectors in the past 12 months and is indicative of my determination to ensure compliance with employment rights legislation. Apart from the strengthening of staff resources, other initiatives are under way also. Arising from a commitment in Sustaining Progress, and in order to assist in the preparation of proposals for consideration by Government, a discussion document was prepared by the labour inspectorate in relation to its mandate and resourcing. The discussion document covered the full dimension of issues that impact on the operation of the labour inspectorate ranging from the legislative framework right through to the operational aspects and staff development. The discussion document has been well received among the social partners and the parties are well advanced in their consideration of the proposals that exceed 40 at the moment. The objective is to formulate a set of recommendations for consideration by Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1348">On 24 May last, the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, announced a programme of action in response to the report and recommendations of the review group on the role and functions of the employment rights bodies and following consultations with the various interested parties. This included the establishment of an Employment Rights Group, ERG, comprising representatives of my Department, the employment rights bodies and the social partners. The ERG pursues the Government mandate to guide and drive the implementation of Government decisions on the role and functions of the employment rights bodies and to ensure the complexity of employment rights legislation does not impede understanding and compliance. The objectives of the exercise are to ensure streamlining of the roles of the employment rights bodies and simplification and consolidation of the corpus of employment rights legislation. Its work should be completed by the end of next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1349">The concerns about the protection of workers' jobs, pay and conditions of employment raise complex legal and policy issues. The Government is committed to taking whatever steps are feasible, through legislation or otherwise, to develop, in partnership with congress and employers, a meaningful package in the area of enhanced employment standards generally. These issues can best be advanced through dialogue in the context of the partnership process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1350">Matters in relation to pension rights, PRSI and PAYE are matters for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners. Matters on the availability of ferry services operating from Ireland are a matter for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</p>

It provides a range of services to Irish industry including free one-to-one advice on environmental issues by phone or e-mail. Free site visits are available to Enterprise Ireland client companies. Another service provided is a one stop environmental website for industry at <i> www.envirocentre.ie</i>. The website, established in 2002 and part-funded by my Department, provides information including details of EI’s supports for industry and guides to environmental legislation. Further services provided are: eco-efficiency audits of active Enterprise Ireland client companies; environmental events and regional fora to update business on environmental developments and address shared environmental problems on a regional or sectoral basis; financial incentives to assist companies in meeting environmental management systems standards to ISO 14001, and to develop more environmentally friendly products known as the environmentally superior products scheme; monitoring emissions to atmosphere and air quality, water and wastewater analysis, aquatic toxicity and respirometry testing and advice on biological effluent treatment. Fees are charged for these services and they are available to all Irish industry.

Following consultation with my Department, Forfás undertook, in conjunction with EI and IDA Ireland, a study to ascertain how the development agencies could make best use of environmental aid and fiscal incentives to promote sustainable enterprise development, based upon analysis of best practice in a number of leading EU member states. The current EU guidelines on State aid for environmental protection are in place until the end of 2007. The EU Commission has commenced a consultation process in relation to amending the guidelines. Forfás and the development agencies have provided observations through the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and will continue to liaise and engage with the Department as the review process continues. In relation to the issue of climate change, Forfás represents the development agencies on the National Allocation Advisory Group, NAAG, which considers issues regarding the drawing up the second national allocation plan, NAP, for the EU emissions trading scheme. Last year my Department requested that Forfás undertake an impact assessment study of REACH, the EU chemicals legislation proposal, on Irish industry. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the potential impact of REACH on key sectors of the Irish economy, and this analysis informed Ireland's national negotiation position on REACH. Forfás is currently undertaking an assessment of national nanotechnology investment options for Ireland. One of the areas of focus is nanomaterials, and their impact on the development of more environmentally friendly products and processes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1357">I consider that my Department has an appropriate level of resources at its disposal to ensure that the range of environmental issues affecting business are effectively addressed.</p>

          <speech by="#TonyKilleen" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_452">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Killeen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1361">I propose to take Questions Nos. 112, 125 and 145 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1362">There have been 12 fatalities in the workplace and 1,623 reported accidents since the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 came into operation on 1 September 2005. There also have been 70 fatalities in 2000, 64 in 2001, 61 in 2002, 67 in 2003, 49 in 2004 and 66 in the first 11 months of this year. I will circulate to Deputies an analysis of the 2005 figures. However, I point out that the construction sector has the highest figure at 22 so far this year and the agriculture, hunting and forestry sector has the next highest at 16 fatalities. Although there has been a downward trend in the rate of workplace accidents as a proportion of the overall number employed in the workforce, nonetheless, the figures are unacceptable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1363">The Health and Safety Authority recently expressed concern over the number of deaths involving non-nationals this year. I share this concern. Provisional figures indicate that eight non-nationals have died in work-related accidents out of the total of 66 so far this year. The authority considers that these figures may be indicative of a worrying trend and has called on all employers to ensure they are adequately communicating the risks and providing appropriate safety training for all employees, including those who are non-English speaking. Of these eight fatalities this year, four have occurred in construction, two in manufacturing, and two in wholesale and retail trade. The Health and Safety Authority has been working on a programme of information resources aimed at non-English speakers and specific provisions relating to such workers are now included in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1364">The Health and Safety Authority recognises the new challenges that the growth of non-English speaking people within the workforce brings. The authority launched earlier this year an initiative entitled Safe System of Work Plan aimed at reducing injuries and deaths on construction sites. This initiative relies heavily on pictograms to explain and clarify hazards and controls, thereby creating a wordless document where safety can be communicated to all workers regardless of literacy or language skills. The Safe System of Work Plan aims to focus on those in the construction industry who are most at risk and empowering them to ensure that all necessary safety controls are in place prior to the commencement of planned work. The plan will shortly be available in a number of different languages, including Turkish and Polish. The authority's Safe System of Work Plan, SSWP, for construction was recently awarded the innovation prize for good prevention practices in the construction industry by the International Social Security Association, ISSA, during the recent World Congress on Safety.</p>
            <p eId="para_1365">In 2004, the authority, in conjunction with Bord Glas, recognised the multicultural nature of the horticultural workforce, with the launch of The Essential Health and Safety Guide for Horticulture, which aims to promote health and safety awareness and accident prevention in the workplace. As a labour intensive industry, horticulture is an established employer of migrant workers and 30% of these originate from the accession states, including Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Poland. The guide is available in five different languages English, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish and Russian.</p>
            <p eId="para_1366">The authority is currently considering submissions received on foot of the public consultation process for draft updated Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations and draft new Safety, Health and Welfare (General Application) Regulations. The latter proposals are designed to revoke and replace in a single text the remaining provisions of the General Application Regulations 1993 as well as seven full sets of other regulations made under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, together with certain other provisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1367">To fully implement the recently enacted 2005 Act, I have asked the board of the HSA to consult the social partners and other interested parties and to bring forward proposals as soon as possible to give effect to provisions in the Act in relation to on-the-spot fines, codes of practice for the various sectors where an employer has three or less employees, and the promotion of joint safety and health agreements between employees and employers in the various sectors. I have also secured the approval of the Department of Finance to increase the financial resources of the HSA by €1.75 million this year. This increase is mainly attributable to the extra activity of the authority under the new 2005 Act.</p>

Persons aged between 50 and 55 years normally leave the programme after three years. However, approximately 20% of participants, including persons less than 55 years of age, may benefit from an additional year on the programme under the flexibility guidelines introduced in August 2001. The increase should help to ensure that there will be sufficient people to fill the places on offer.</p>

            <p eId="para_1419">I am not aware of the reports of research to which the Deputy refers nor is my Department carrying out research in this area. There are many factors which impinge both on job satisfaction and separately mental health. Equally there are a range of factors which impinge on depression, anxiety and absenteeism.</p>
            <p eId="para_1420">My Department and the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, actively promote the prevention of occupational stress at the workplace. Stress has a significant bearing on job satisfaction which influences wider health. Where there is a risk of stress in a workplace it is important that it is identified as such, assessed, and a strategy put in place to have it dealt with.</p>
            <p eId="para_1421">The HSA has recently established a steering group which is developing proposals for a strategy for managing occupational health. This will include issues such as work related stress and well-being of employees. Also, the HSA in partnership with the British Health and Safety Executive and Health Scotland have developed Work Positive, which is an audit tool with guidance material for in-house application. Work Positive is a comprehensive risk management tool that incorporates a risk assessment template covering the known causes of workplace stress. It provides a step-by-step guide to assessing risks of stress, outlining the aims of each step and thereby helping managers eliminate these risk factors in their organisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1422">On a wider front, research has also been carried out in the context of work life balance and flexible working under the ESF funded EQUAL Community initiative, which is an EU-wide programme co-financed by the European Social Fund, ESF, and managed directly by my Department. One such project, the Work Life Balance Network has developed a toolkit for firms to address information deficits-awareness of work-life balance issues and to assist organisations to adapt policies and adopt new approaches. The toolkit has been piloted in some semi-State companies and disseminated through the national framework committee on work-life balance, which was established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and continued under Sustaining Progress on the recommendation of the social partners. Another project, the National Flexi-Work Partnership has published extensive research related to the specific needs of diverse groups in the workforce, including working parents and carers, older workers and those with mental health problems.</p>

            <p eId="para_1424">As I advised the House in previous replies to parliamentary questions on this matter, the core recommendation of the Consumer Strategy Group is that a new statutory body, the National Consumer Agency, be established to be an advocate on behalf of consumers. The Government fully approved this recommendation and has agreed to establish the new agency as soon as practicable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1425">The establishment of the NCA will require primary legislation. My Department has already commenced the necessary preliminary legislative and organisational work to ensure that the NCA is established as soon as possible. The Government has approved members to the National Consumer Agency to act in an interim capacity until such time as the agency is established on a statutory footing. The board, which is comprised of a chairperson and 12 other members, has held four meetings to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1426">Given its non-statutory status, the interim board does not have any staff. However, it has the assistance of Forfás in carrying out its activities. Forfás has currently assigned 4.5 staff to assist the interim board. This number will increase considerably in 2006 to cater for the significant increase in activities which the interim board intends to undertake in the course of next year. In this regard the Deputy may be aware of the consumer awareness campaign initiated by the board yesterday and which will continue in the course of 2006 in order to raise consumer awareness about their rights and how to enforce them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1427">It is not possible at this stage to give a precise estimate as to what staff the NCA might have when it is formally established. It is the case, however, that one of the interim board's priority tasks is to prepare a detailed estimate of staffing, resource and budget requirements of a fully operational and statutory based National Consumer Agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_1428">I very much welcome the Government's decision to approve the establishment of a National Consumer Agency. I am certain the agency will have a key role in advocating the consumer case and in the development of future consumer policy. I am also of the view that the appointment of an interim board until the NCA is formally established is most important. The interim board will ensure that the momentum of the Consumer Strategy Group's report is maintained, that the consumer's voice will be heard and that the construction of a fully operational NCA can begin.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_456">
            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1430">I have nothing further to add to my previous answer to this question where I pointed out that I can only comment on that part of the question relating to my remit. The Government facilitates the creation of an environment attractive to businesses and business creation. Government policies in this regard have helped propel economic growth and employment expansion and these have encouraged deeper and stronger links to both the enlarging EU markets and internationally. Clearly, having an open economy has greatly assisted Ireland's economic development and has benefited the country. However, an open economy also presents threats especially where the country no longer operates as a low cost location for investment. Our strengths and competitive advantages have inexorably changed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1431">High output and productivity together with high returns to labour in the form of wages, salaries and better living standards now typify Ireland's economy. The low technology production that characterised our economic output in the past is being replaced by higher technology and services enterprises. A more attractive cost environment abroad will inevitably entice some firms that are unable to generate their required return from the modern enterprise economy into which we are transforming ourselves. A continuing structural evolution of our economy is both unavoidable and necessary to maintain present levels of growth and low unemployment. Part of this evolution entails some inevitable plant transfers and other adjustments, but where relocation has occurred to date, it has largely been limited to relatively low-technology, labour-intensive activities. It is imperative that our companies survive and grow. If high value functions such as research and development, design, marketing and management are retained in Ireland then outsourcing a low value activity, which has no hope of being profitable, is a viable business decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1432">That is not to say that we can do nothing. The opposite is true — to counterbalance the competitive threat from lower wage competitor economies, our policy is to encourage a move to higher levels of productivity and value added products and services. We are continuing to develop those infrastructures, both physical and intellectual, to create and maintain an attractive environment for investment and expansion in Ireland. Such investment will be sourced by a combination of developing existing clients and new investors in existing or new activities or sectors. Given the critical mass of FDI in Ireland and its links with indigenous companies, one of the greatest potential contributions will come from developing companies already operating here. The enterprise development agencies have a clear mandate to align their operations around this policy objective and are continuing to encourage companies into more sophisticated activities, reducing the likelihood of our competitive advantage being eroded by cost based competition.</p>
            <p eId="para_1433">Enterprise Ireland will continue to work and co-operate with all agencies in the region on any initiatives deemed appropriate for the area. Enterprise Ireland has approved funding support of more than €22.3 million and paid more than €16.8 million to companies in the west region in the period 2003 to date. Of this, EI client companies in County Mayo have been approved funding of €2.6 million and received payments of €2.4 million. This financial support will enable the companies to fund their plans for innovation and new product development. As further support to client companies Enterprise Ireland has arranged for staff from each of its 33 overseas offices to be available both in Galway and Dublin in January 2006 to meet clients who wish to develop their exports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1434">The campus incubator units at the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology in both Castlebar and Galway together with the units at National University Ireland Galway received approval for capital grants of €5.45 million from Enterprise Ireland, together with grants of €0.314 million towards the cost of centre managers. The centres will serve the needs of the west region, with companies starting at these centres moving out in time to locate in other areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1435">I am advised by IDA Ireland that it has not disposed of any factory buildings that are, or have been, used as car showrooms. IDA owned buildings are normally sold to clients on a freehold basis with a restricted use covenant attached. However, there are instances in County Mayo where IDA clients have, as part of their restructuring, sold their building which then was used as car showrooms such as the Volex building at Castlebar. This was constructed by Volex on a site it acquired from a third party and as such could be disposed of as it wished.</p>
            <p eId="para_1436">The enterprise development agencies are focusing attention on the elements of investment that now best fit Ireland's competitive characteristics and which will provide the maximum positive sustainable benefit to the economy at both a national and regional level.</p>

            <p eId="para_1438">The Competition Authority carried out a full competition assessment of this case and on 4 November 2005 determined that the acquisition would not substantially lessen competition provided the parties comply with the conditions set out in its determination.</p>
            <p eId="para_1439">As regards cable TV, the authority found no significant overlap between the merging parties' businesses as both Chorus and NTL serve different geographic regions. While certain competition concerns arose because of cross-ownership issues involving Chorus and BskyB, the matter was resolved to the satisfaction of the authority through the imposition of 19 conditions in its determination.</p>
            <p eId="para_1440">The acquisition should have a positive impact on the provision of broadband Internet access for consumers.

I am certain the NCA would have the necessary national focus, be sufficiently representative in its nature, have the required capacity to meet the obligations and demands arising from membership of the partnership process to ensure that its membership would add value to the process to deal with issues more effectively as required of those who seek to become members of the partnership process.</p>

            <p eId="para_1449">My Department's recent report on the groceries order did not estimate the precise extent of savings that will accrue to the average family's weekly shopping bill following the Government's decision to abolish the groceries order. What my Department has said in essence is that, since 1987, the price of the average weekly shopping basket has been maintained at an artificially high level directly as a result of the groceries order.</p>
            <p eId="para_1450">The precise extent of any such price reductions will, ultimately, be a function of a variety of factors including the amount of off-invoice discounts available for transfer back to the invoice, the actual level of net margin obtaining in the retail trade currently, and the extent to which resulting competitive forces will drive efficiencies at all levels of the production and distribution chain. Other extraneous factors, including input costs and consumer demand, also impact on retail prices and make it difficult to isolate the impact of any one factor such as the groceries order.</p>
            <p eId="para_1451">On the other hand, the Competition Authority has indicated that the order is directly costing the average household up to €481 per year. I hope, however, that the impact of the resulting competition in the market following the revocation of the order will bring about decreases in the retail prices of goods covered by the order, although it may take time for such savings to filter through to consumers.</p>

The Government has since committed to increasing the authority's resources further in 2006 and funding has been secured for the doubling of its cartels' resources from seven officers to 14 officers.

            <p eId="para_1468">The declaration adopted at the fourth WTO ministerial meeting held in Doha, Qatar, in November 2001, provided for a new global round of multilateral trade negotiations aimed at liberalising trade across a broad spectrum. The declaration, called the Doha Development Agenda, DDA, provided that the negotiations should pay particular attention to the needs of developing countries. The Sixth World Trade Organisation Ministerial Conference will take place in Hong Kong on 13-18 December next and will consider progress to date in the DDA.</p>
            <p eId="para_1469">Ireland's priority in the DDA negotiations has been, and is, to see that the process of trade liberalisation continues in a fair and balanced manner and that the WTO continues to provide a stable and constant framework for the regulation of world trade. Central to our approach, and that of the EU, is a commitment to respond positively in the negotiations to the concerns of the developing countries. This is considered to be an essential part of the DDA. Ireland sees early and appropriate agreement on development issues as critical to the success of the DDA and to the positive impact that trade can have on reducing poverty in developing countries, particularly the least developed countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1470">There is a strong development dimension to the core DDA negotiations on the reduction of industrial tariffs. Requests by the EU, to other WTO members, to make tariff reduction commitments are being modulated to reflect the level of development of the WTO member to whom the request is directed. The EU approach is not designed to disadvantage poorer developing countries. In the first place, the EU is proposing that there should be differentiated tariff reduction commitments between developed and developing countries. Additionally, poorer developing countries are being offered flexibilities such as less than formula cuts and-or increased periods for implementation. Least developed countries are not being asked to reduce their tariffs. This differentiated approach, and, in particular, that of non-reciprocation in the case of least developed countries, represents key elements of the EU's determination to deliver the development dimension of the DDA negotiations, which Ireland fully supports.</p>

            <p eId="para_1476">Arising from audits by the European Commission in 2000, the Commission took a decision in February 2003 to reduce ESF aid to Ireland by €15.614 million in respect of three operational programmes from the 1994 to 1999 period, namely, the human resources development operational programme, the tourism operational programme and the industrial development operational programme. The sum involved represents less than 1% of the amount allocated to these programmes for the period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1477">Arising from the audits, the Commission alleged that the National Training Development Institute, NTDI, had not declared the total amount of national resources available for its operations and, as a consequence, the NTDI had overclaimed the contribution due from the ESF. The Commission also found that my Department, after applying the ECU conversion rate to expenditure declared in Irish pounds by various implementing bodies, carried out adjustments to the ECU amounts to maximise its ESF drawdown in respect of three programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1478">I should emphasise that the Commission accepts that all expenditure under the programmes in question was eligible and no allegation of fraud has been made. My Department has always believed that our approach in these matters was valid and that the expenditure was eligible for ESF co-financing. Our belief in the procedures was such that, supported by legal advice, we pursued this matter all the way to the European Court of Justice where, unfortunately, that court finally agreed with the Commission's technical arguments.</p>

The operation of companies under their relevant memorandum and articles of association is a matter for determination by the company members, who are the owners of the properties in question.

            <p eId="para_1490">The European Parliament and the Council are in the final stages of a proposal for the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals, REACH. The Parliament agreed its first reading opinion on REACH on 17 November 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1491">On registration, the Parliament agreed a compromise package of amendments which aims to target resources at the substances of highest concern. These amendments include lowered information requirements for existing substances manufactured or imported in the one to ten tonne range to minimise the risk of withdrawal of these vulnerable substances; so-called one substance one registration, OSOR, which will require manufacturers and importers of the same substance to register jointly, but with criteria included to allow separate registration for reasons of business confidentiality, for example; and more flexible provisions for exemption of substances used in research from registration.</p>
            <p eId="para_1492">On evaluation, the Parliament voted in favour of shifting more responsibility to the central agency which will lead to a more harmonised system across Europe. On authorisation, the Parliament has voted for a much stricter and more rigorous approach than in the Commission's original proposal. The substitution principle is much more strongly enforced which would mean that substances of high concern may only be authorised where suitable alternative substances or technologies do not exist.</p>

            <p eId="para_1496">To date in 2005, my Department has been considering the issue of green consumerism in the context of the EU environmental technologies action programme, ETAP.  ETAP is a broad ranging programme which is designed to stimulate the development and uptake of environmental products and services. Raising consumer awareness is a key action in ETAP, with a particular emphasis on product labelling to ensure consumers have the necessary information to make informed choices. In addition to my Department's participation in the EU high level steering group for ETAP, and in the national ETAP stakeholder group, Enterprise Ireland recently participated in an ETAP seminar specifically targeted on raising business and consumer awareness of environmental products and services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1497">Another way in which my Department is seeking to promote green consumerism is by promoting the uptake of environmental management systems, EMSs, by SMEs through a multi-stakeholder working group which it has established. EMSs facilitate more informed consumer choice, as the EMS is a clear demonstration of a company's commitment to reducing its environmental impact.</p>

            <p eId="para_1507">The Deputy will be aware that audit exemption was first introduced in Ireland under the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1999 and came into effect in February 2000. A review of the limits was undertaken in 2003 and as a result of that review the turnover limit was increased to €1.5 million with effect from 1 July 2004. Statistics supplied by the Registrar of Companies shows that fewer than 5,000 companies availed of the audit exemption in the first ten months of this year. This represents around 3% of the total number of companies on the register of companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1508">In line with Government policy, Better Regulation, it is appropriate that all regulatory requirements, including auditing requirements, should be kept under review in consultation with all relevant stakeholders. An ongoing reform and consolidation of the Companies Acts is well under way and it may be appropriate to address the audit exemption limit legislatively in that Bill.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Killeen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1510">We have a comprehensive body of employment rights legislation which has as its objective the protection of employees against arbitrary behaviour by employers, provision for the safety and health of workers and to foster labour market harmony by promoting policies that minimise conflict and maximise fairness. The full panoply of Irish employment law applies to all persons employed in Ireland, regardless of nationality. This body of law is and will continue to be enforced. In this regard the number of labour inspectors has recently been increased from 17 to 31. This will add significantly to the capacity of the labour inspectorate to ensure compliance with the law and to investigate complaints. In addition, I wish to outline a number of initiatives which are being undertaken at present and which focus specifically on the improvement of our employment rights framework, both in the short and medium term.</p>
            <p eId="para_1511">The employment rights compliance group consists of representatives of the social partners and several Departments. It is engaged in the consideration of 40 proposals contained in the report on the mandate and resources of the labour inspectorate and seeks to establish the degree of consensus which exists in respect of those proposals as well as a couple of others made by the social partners. This group is working towards the formulation of a thoroughly revised model of employment rights enforcement that will see redress mechanisms streamlined and a level competitive environment for those employers who are fully compliant with employment rights legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1512">An independent review of the joint labour committees was completed recently. Arising from this review and following bilateral consultations with social partners and stakeholders, my Department is now preparing a paper that will be used as the basis for implementation of the review in further consultation with the social partners and stakeholders.</p>
            <p eId="para_1513">The employment rights review group comprises representatives of several Departments, the employment rights bodies and the social partners. It pursues the Government's mandate to guide and drive the implementation of Government decisions on the role and functions of the employment rights bodies and to ensure the complexity of employment rights legislation does not impede understanding and compliance. The objectives of the exercise are to ensure streamlining of the roles of the employment rights bodies and simplification and consolidation of the corpus of employment rights legislation. It is expected that the work under way will feature in any forthcoming social partnership negotiations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1514">A major investment in education, particularly of migrant workers, and in the general dissemination of employment rights information is planned. This will consist of the strategic targeting of information at those who need it most. The delivery mechanisms and content will be formulated in consultation with social partners and others.</p>
            <p eId="para_1515">Employment rights compliance will be a feature in what may be the next round of social partnership and discussions with the social partners are well advanced, both in respect of the development of the legislative framework and the approach to adopt with regard to ensuring compliance. I am confident that an effective and more user-friendly structure will be achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1516">In addition, I am carrying out a review of the Employment Agency Act 1971. In June 2005, my Department issued a policy paper as part of this review and invited submissions to be made by 15 July 2005. A total of nine submissions were received. At present, my Department is examining the various matters raised by the respondents. It is my intention that, following further consultations with various interests and completion of the deliberative process, the heads of a Bill will be prepared and Government approval will be sought to have a Bill drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government. It is my intention that a Bill should be published in the first half of 2006. I believe the above initiatives, taken as a complete package, will improve workers' rights.</p>

            <p eId="para_1518">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is structured in a way which recognises that enterprise and employment are not competing but, in fact, complementary factors. Calls for alternative configurations appear to stem from a flawed concept that places jobs and welfare at work in competition with enterprise. We have a different and more positive view — one that seeks to grow the quality and number of jobs by growing trade and enterprise. Only by growing our competitiveness, by increasing our trade performance and by expanding enterprise performance can we produce sustainable high quality jobs. Similarly, only by ensuring that we have a well trained and confident workforce, which enjoys the protection of our health and safety and employment rights legislation, can enterprise flourish.</p>
            <p eId="para_1519">Since 1993, when the Department was established in its current formation, we have seen jobs and real wages growing at unprecedented levels, we have introduced the national minimum wage and seen a significant improvement in the legislative framework protecting workers. The welfare of workers, especially those most exposed to low incomes, has been transformed during this period. However, this has also helped sustain, and be sustained by, a parallel and unprecedented improvement in trade and enterprise performance. Evidence, therefore, that our pro-enterprise and pro-jobs policies have made a real difference is incontrovertible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1520">While the factors supporting this transformation are manifold and social partnership clearly played its part, it is clear that the current configuration of my Department is right for Ireland and this was affirmed by Government following the previous general election.</p>

            <p eId="para_1522">Economic migration policy is formulated within a context where the focus on meeting our skills needs is, first, on upskilling our resident workforce, second, on maximising the potential of European Economic Area nationals to fill our skills deficits and, third, with a new green card and revised work permit system, to meet those skill needs which cannot otherwise be addressed. The Central Statistics Office publication, Population and Labour Force Projections, estimates that Ireland will experience net inward migration of between 20,000 and 30,000 per annum between 2006 and 2011. Labour force demand will be a key determinant of migration over the projection period.</p>

            <p eId="para_2605">Applications for intercountry adoption are processed by the Health Service Executive, HSE, under the Adoption Acts 1952-1998, as amended by the Health Act 2004. The length of time it takes to complete the necessary assessment and the allocation of resources within the HSE is a matter for the management of the HSE. My Department's latest figures for intercountry adoption statistics relate to the third quarter ended 30 September, 2005. At that time figures show that the average duration of assessment — the time from beginning of preparation stage to date of decision by placement committee — was 10.2 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_2606">The process of assessment of applicants for intercountry assessment is set out in a framework for intercountry assessment introduces in 1999 to streamline assessments and to provide a transparent system centred on the child's best interests. It involves a number of stages and would generally include an initial assessment, a considerable level of education and preparation work, including an exploration with prospective adoptive parents of the challenges and issues that are likely to arise when undertaking adoption, and a home study assessment. The length of the assessment process can vary between applicants depending on the particular circumstances of each case, bearing in mind at all times the best interests of the child. Applicants found to be suitable to be adoptive parents are granted a declaration of suitability by the Adoption Board, and may then pursue the adoption of a child abroad with the selected sending country. It should be noted that difficulties may arise in sending countries that can also cause delay.</p>
            <p eId="para_2607">The Adoption Board has bilateral adoption agreements with China, Belarus, Romania, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines. Belarus and Romania have, however, ceased intercountry adoption. A draft revised protocol between Ireland and Belarus is before the Attorney General for his advices. The board is also actively pursuing the issue of an adoption agreement with the Russian Federation. It is important to note, however, that it is not possible at this stage to confirm either a timeframe for the completion of the negotiations or whether or not such negotiations will result in a successful outcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_2608">The heads of the Adoption (Hague Convention, Adoption Authority and Miscellaneous) Bill which, when enacted will ratify the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption 1993, are being drafted into a Bill in the Parliamentary Counsel's office. I hope that the Bill will be published in the earlier part of 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2609">An upper age limit of 50 years of age for people who wish to be assessed for intercountry adoption is one of the proposed provisions in the new bill being drafted. This age limit would apply to sole applicants and to the younger of a couple at the time they apply to be assessed for intercountry adoption.</p>

            <p eId="para_2617">The Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction was established in March 2000. Its terms of reference were to prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all aspects of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy in this area. The commission was comprised of persons with expert knowledge spanning the medical, scientific, social and legal domains. This expertise was a prerequisite to a precise examination of the issues concerned. In addition, the chair invited a number of additional experts with complementary expertise in specific areas to join work groups. These groups were established to explore particular aspects of assisted human reproduction, AHR. They included experts and academics from sociology, philosophy, ecumenism and theology. The commission was independent throughout in carrying out its work.</p>
            <p eId="para_2618">The commission has conducted an intensive and analytical examination of AHR issues and its conclusions derive from this wide research. Its report was prepared after 23 meetings. It also consulted widely and sought submissions from the public. The commission's report was published on 12 of May last and as I indicated at the time, the Government decided to refer the report to the Joint Committee on Health and Children. This will allow for further public and political consideration of the complex issues involved.</p>

            <p eId="para_2634">Both the Tánaiste and I are aware of, and acknowledge, the services provided by Lucan disability action group. The Tánaiste has met this group in recent months. This group has been in receipt of funding for the past numbers of years from FÁS under the social economy programme and I understand that there is potential for the organisation to seek continuing funding from FÁS, albeit at a reduced rate, for 2006. While the Lucan disability action group has not been in receipt of funding from the Health Service Executive, HSE, to date in respect of the services that it provides, these services complement the range of supports already provided by the HSE to persons with disabilities in the Lucan area. Accordingly, it is appropriate that the group should engage with the HSE with a view to entering into an agreement for the provision of services to be funded by the executive in accordance with its functions under the Health Act 2004. The group has been made aware of this.</p>

            <p eId="para_2683">The Government is committed to exploring fully the scope for the private sector to provide additional capacity in the health system. The key objective is to provide the required extra capacity, whether this is in the public or private sector. In July this year, my Department issued a policy direction to the Health Service Executive which is aimed at freeing up additional beds for public patients in public hospitals through the development of private hospital facilities on public hospital sites. The initiative will provide up to 1,000 additional beds for public patients over the next five years. Private developers will be responsible for the construction of the private hospitals and public capital funding will not be provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_2684">Attached to the policy direction was an assessment framework which the HSE has been requested to follow in regard to proposals to locate private hospital facilities on public hospital sites. It requires that the evaluation should have regard to a detailed assessment of need, and existing and planned capacity on a particular site and within the relevant region. It should also provide for a rigorous value for money assessment of any proposal which would take account of the value of the public site and the cost of any capital allowances. In addition, it makes clear the need for adherence to public procurement law and best practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_2685">The Health Service Executive has been asked to develop an implementation plan to progress this initiative.</p>

            <p eId="para_2692">The management and delivery of health and personal social services are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. Child health examinations are provided by health boards to children attending national school in accordance with section 66 of the Health Act 1970. Section 67 of the Health Act 1970 provides for dental treatment and appliances to be made available by the Health Services Executive in respect of defects noticed at an examination under the service mentioned in section 66.</p>
            <p eId="para_2693">Section 1 of the Health (Amendment) Act 1994 provides that the Health Service Executive shall make dental services available without charge, for children who have attended a national school or a school standing specified in an order under section 66(3) of the Health Act 1970. The 1994 Act also provides for the specification of the services to be provided and the ages of children who are to be eligible for such services. The regulations made under this Act — the Health (Dental Services for Children) Regulations 2000 — specified that 15 years of age is specified for the purposes of section 1(1) of the Act of 1994 and the following dental health services are specified for the purposes of section 1(1) of the Act of 1994: a dental health screening service; a preventive dental treatment service, and a primary care dental treatment service in respect of defects noted during a screening examination carried out under paragraph (a) of this regulation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2694">My Department commissioned a survey of children's oral health in 2002. The report of this survey is due to be published shortly. Preliminary results of the survey indicate that children's oral health has improved significantly since 1984. The number of decayed, missing or filled teeth, DMFT, in children has decreased significantly over the period. For example, the survey shows that for children of 12 years of age and who live in fully fluoridated areas the DMFT score has dropped from 2.6 in 1984 to 1.1 in 2002. The survey shows that for children of 12 years of age and who live in non-fluoridated areas the DMFT score has dropped from 3.3 in 1984 to 1.3 in 2002. In addition, the survey shows that 53.5% of 12 year old children living in fully fluoridated areas are completely caries free and 48.7% of 12 year olds living in non-fluoridated areas are caries free.</p>

            <p eId="para_2702">Prior to the establishment of the Health Service Executive, parliamentary questions concerning access to services, by individuals or in specific geographic areas, were referred to the chief executive officer of the relevant health board-ERHA for direct reply. Pursuant to the Health Act 2004, the functions of the health boards-ERHA were transferred to the HSE. Under the Act, the HSE has responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to have delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. The establishment of the HSE brought into being a new unitary system for the delivery and management of health services at local, regional and national level. The move to the new structure presented an opportunity for an improved service for providing information to Oireachtas Members. Last April, the HSE established a parliamentary affairs division which provides a central contact for all Oireachtas requests for information relating to matters within the statutory remit of the executive.</p>
            <p eId="para_2703">The executive has guidelines in place as to the timeframe within which final replies should issue direct to Deputies in regard to queries raised in parliamentary questions. In that connection, the executive aims to operate within a timeframe of 20 working days from the date of answer of a parliamentary question. This timeframe reflects the arrangements which the former health boards-ERHA had adopted prior to the HSE's establishment. This is a starting point and the HSE is committed to reducing this period as it develops its organisational and information capacity going forward. The HSE endeavours to provide more immediate responses in instances where the information sought in the question is of a routine nature or is readily available.</p>

            <p eId="para_2736">The provision of modern, well-equipped, accessible premises will be central to the effective functioning of primary care teams and networks.

            <p eId="para_2737">To ensure that appropriate facilities are developed on the required scale, resources other than those of the Exchequer will be required and this is line with the historic practice, whereby there has been a mix of public and private facilities provision, with, for example, general practitioners in many cases funding their own practice premises. In this regard, the primary care strategy emphasises the need to gain full benefit from existing buildings and to fully explore opportunities for private investment and public-private partnerships in implementing the development programme. The Government is committed to developing policy in such a way as to encourage innovative approaches to the provision of primary care facilities and services in line with the objectives of the primary care strategy. The Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations 1996, which were revoked by my predecessor in January 2002 following advice from the Office of the Attorney General, set out the criteria and procedures for granting community pharmacy contracts in the HSE areas. The effect of the revocation, for the awarding of new community pharmacy contracts, is that there are no restrictions on granting new community pharmacy contracts in terms of location, population or viability of existing pharmacies. The revocation did not affect the operation of the community pharmacy scheme, and existing contracts at that time remained in place. The opening or establishment of all new pharmacies continues to be governed by the Pharmacy Acts, subject to restrictions imposed by non-pharmacy legislation such as the Planning Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_2738">The Government has accepted the recommendation of the pharmacy review group that there be no beneficial interest between prescribing and dispensing. Currently, a community pharmacy contract may not be awarded to a pharmacy in which a GP practising in the area has a beneficial interest.</p>

            <p eId="para_2740">The Government has accepted the recommendation of the pharmacy review group that there be no beneficial interest between prescribing and dispensing. A Government decision was taken in June 2005 to introduce new pharmacy legislation. The legislation will take the form of two Bills. The first will remove the "derogation" on EU-EEA qualified pharmacists, introduce fitness to practice regulations and give an appropriate statutory basis for the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland. It will also address the problems with the current adjudication route for registration of pharmacists. I intend to have the first Bill introduced as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_2741">It is proposed to deal with most of the recommendations of the pharmacy review group in the second pharmacy Bill, dealing with pharmacy practice and the delivery of pharmaceutical services. The opening or establishment of all new pharmacies is governed by the Pharmacy Acts, subject to restrictions imposed by non-pharmacy legislation such as the Planning Act. There is no statutory prohibition on the provision of pharmacy and general practitioner services from co-located facilities.

            <p eId="para_2751">The issues raised by the Deputy are dealt with under sections 31 to 33 of the Health Act 2004. These sections provide for the preparation, submission, approval and implementation of the Health Service Executive's service plan. The plan should set out the type of health and personal social services to be provided by the executive during the period to which the plan relates. In developing the service plan, the executive must have regard to section 31(12) of the Act which requires that the estimate must be consistent with the Vote for the executive as published by the Government in the Estimates for supply services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2752">The Deputy will be aware of section 7 of the Education Act 1998 as amended by section 40 of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 and the Health Act 2004. That section allows for the Minister for Education and Science in carrying out his or her functions in respect of the provision, planning and co-ordination of support services, following consultation with the Minister for Health and Children, to request the assistance of the Health Service Executive. While my Department is in regular communication with the Department of Education and Science regarding this and other issues, the consultation procedure in regard to this process has not yet been completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2753">The remainder of the Deputy's questions relate to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.

            <p eId="para_2755">The Government has taken a planned approach to building up capacity in the area of multi-disciplinary support services for both adults and children with disabilities. This includes, in addition to the provision of additional financial resources, various initiatives related to the training, recruitment and retention of key allied health professionals as follows: the expansion of the number of training places available for speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, psychologists, nursing and other key professionals; national and overseas recruitment initiatives and enhancement of career opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2756">The level of support available from these health-related support services to children with physical, sensory and intellectual disabilities and autism has been incrementally increasing annually in recent years as a result of the additional funding which has been made available by the Government. As part of the national disability strategy, further additional funding amounting to €11.5 million in 2006 is being made available to the Health Service Executive in respect of the provision of health-related support services for adults and children with physical, sensory and intellectual disabilities and autism, with a priority in 2006 on enhancing assessment and support services for children with disabilities. Additional funding amounting to €17.5 million is also being provided in 2006 to enhance the level and range of multi-disciplinary support services available to adults and children with mental illness.</p>
            <p eId="para_2757">This ongoing investment in multi-disciplinary support services for persons with disabilities, including those with mental illness, together with specific initiatives to be taken in the area of recruitment, will assist the process of building capacity within these services in a very significant manner.</p>

            <p eId="para_2772">The position is that charitable tax exemption is provided for under section 207 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. To be eligible for charitable tax exemption a body must be established solely for charitable purposes and the exemption applies only in so far as the funds are applied for charitable purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2773">The administration of the scheme is the responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners and it is not their practice to comment on the tax affairs of individual bodies. However, the Revenue Commissioners have informed me that they have appropriate procedures in place toward ensuring that each body that applies for charitable tax exemption meets the necessary criteria before the exemption is granted. Bodies which are granted charitable tax exemption are also subject to periodic review with a view to ensuring their continued compliance with the terms of the exemption.</p>
            <p eId="para_2774">Being granted charitable tax exemption does not mean that the charity has charitable status other than for tax purposes or is a registered charity. As the Deputy will be aware, there is no register of charities in the State at present.

            <p eId="para_2787">When the Government's decentralisation programme was first announced, it was stated that the overall objective would be to ensure that property being acquired at a regional level is matched as closely as possible, both in time and in cost terms, by the disposal of property currently held in the Dublin region, whether held on lease or otherwise. In November 2004 the implementation group prepared a report, which was subsequently published, on the procurement methodology and financial assessment of the property aspects of the programme, including a financial model, based on a property finance study carried out by the Office of Public Works. While the prevailing property market conditions in each area will have a bearing on cost, this model indicates that the break even position in relation to property will be reached in about 20 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2788">In terms of actual outlay to date, the total amount committed in principle by the OPW on site acquisition costs, excluding VAT, is approximately €35.7 million. Expenditure to date this year is €8.1 million and overall expenditure since the start of the programme is in the region of €8.3 million. The overall site acquisition cost of the entire decentralisation programme is expected to be in the region of €75 million to €100 million, excluding VAT.</p>
            <p eId="para_2789">As part of the OPW's ongoing programme of transforming State assets, the amount recouped to date through land and building disposal is €128 million. In addition, the Deputy will be aware of the recent disposal of the former veterinary college in Ballsbridge, though the receipts in respect of this disposal may not be lodged in the Exchequer by the end of this financial year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2790">In relation to the non-property costs of the programme, the decentralisation programme is being implemented on a voluntary basis, so as on previous occasions, the payment of removal or relocation expenses will not arise. A study was commissioned by the decentralisation implementation group which provides a model for identifying non-property costs and savings that arise both during the relocation phase and in the context of a post-decentralised Civil Service. Decentralising organisations have been asked to use this model to make periodic reports identifying non-property costs incurred and savings made both since the programme was announced and in its implementation in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_2814">From the outset both the Government and I have made it clear that participation in the decentralisation programme is voluntary. Because of the nature of the programme it is not possible at this stage to estimate the number of civil and public servants who do not wish to leave Dublin, as individual circumstances are open to change and therefore figures can fluctuate. The picture will become clearer over the coming period as staff are assigned to decentralising organisations. As people who have applied to decentralise continue to be transferred into decentralising organisations, the posts they vacate are available to those wishing to remain in Dublin. People wishing to remain in Dublin are currently availing of these opportunities and are moving to the Dublin-based posts as they arise. It is hoped to extend these arrangements over the coming months.</p>

In September 2001, the Government accepted the thrust of the commission's report, and the period since then has been marked by the progressive implementation, in consultation with the public service unions, of individual commission recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2835">In September 2004, following discussions with ICTU, the Government ratified an agreed approach to the remaining recommendations of the commission. These were aimed at reforming public service pensions in terms of provision for low-income groups, flexibility and modernisation. As part of this approach the Government mandated further study of a number of the commission's recommendations, including the feasibility of implementing four specific recommendations in relation to public service spouses' and children's schemes. These, in summary, are: recommendation No. 29, public service spouses' and children's schemes should be modified to allow payment of a survivor's pension to a financially dependent partner in certain circumstances and a system for the nomination of partners put in place; recommendation No. 30, the provision which requires a spouse's pension to cease on grounds of remarriage or cohabitation should be removed; recommendation No. 32, where a dependent child is orphaned and both parents are members of the same spouses' and children's scheme, two children's pensions should be payable; and recommendation No. 33, an appropriate system for nomination of death gratuity should be introduced into public service pension schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2836">A joint union-management working group was established in January of this year to examine each of the above recommendations and report to the Minister for Finance on the implementation of same. The working group comprises representatives from various Departments, ICTU public services committee and Garda and Permanent Defence Forces representative associations. The group has met on a number of occasions to date and there have also been a number of bilateral meetings with various Departments and private sector pension scheme experts. An interim report was completed in July 2005. A draft final report is currently being considered by the group and it is expected that this will be finalised in the near future for submission to me.</p>

Full relief is available where the proceeds from the disposal do not exceed €500,000; otherwise, marginal relief may apply. I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are prepared to extend the relief where an individual is unable to continue in business due to severe or chronic ill health and sells his or her business assets within 12 months of his or her 55th birthday.</p>

            <p eId="para_2848">The Irish Maritime Development Office provides strategic support and advice in regard to the Marco Polo programme. On 11 October 2003, the first call for Marco Polo proposals was published. A total of four Irish projects were submitted and deemed eligible under that call. These were applications from Eucon, Dublin Port Company, Shannon Foynes Port Company and Euroferries. Eucon's project was the only project selected and recommended for funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_2849">The second call for Marco Polo proposals was published on 15 October 2004. A total of four projects with Irish partners were submitted and deemed eligible for funding. The Irish partners were Shannon Foynes Port Company, Rosslare Europort, Euroferries, and Port of Cork Company. None of the proposals was selected for funding. The third call under the Marco Polo programme was published on 24 November 2005. The closing date for this call is 30 January 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2850">The Eucon proposal is the only Irish transport project, to date, to successfully finalise contract negotiations under the EU Marco Polo programme. The total amount of subsidy awarded by the Commission for the project was €1 million. The main objective of the project is to convert at least 10% of the ro-ro landbridge traffic moving on and off the island of Ireland to the lo-lo mode. By routing such traffic through the ports of Antwerp and Rotterdam, in particular, road haulage into Belgium and Germany will be reduced, by obviating the need to route traffic through the relatively remote Port of Calais. The estimated modal shift, generated over the life of the Eucon project is 1,180,015,020 tonne kilometres, tkm. In the context of the Marco Polo programme, this modal shift equates to environmental benefits in the region of €18,118,675.</p>
            <p eId="para_2851">Given that the modal shift produced by the Eucon project affects only United Kingdom and European roads, a change in modal split in Ireland will not occur as a direct result of the project. The existing modal split is expected to remain the same. The substantial environmental benefits accruing from the Eucon project will benefit Ireland's European partners.</p>

            <p eId="para_2870">The closure of post offices is, in the first instance, an operational matter for the board and management of An Post and one in which I have no statutory function. As an operational matter, the issue of post office closures is not one which the company consults with me.</p>
            <p eId="para_2871">As clearly set out in the programme for Government, the Government and the board of An Post are committed to the objective of securing a viable and sustainable nationwide post office network and the challenge for all stakeholders in An Post is to generate sufficient profitable business to maintain the network at its current size. The An Post network comprises the single largest number of retail outlets in the country. In the European context, Ireland still has the highest number of post offices per head of population. In recent years some network restructuring has been undertaken. This activity is in line with similar trends across Europe. In addition to the post office network, An Post has also established 2,864 PostPoint outlets in retail premises of which 600 can be used for bill payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2872">Specifically, in regard to the closure of post offices or sub-post offices, it is only when a suitable candidate for a vacancy cannot be found or where there are no applicants, that a post office is closed. I understand that during the 12 months to 1 December 2005, 30 post offices closed and were replaced with postal agencies providing core post office services including social welfare payments and the sale of stamps. In the same period, a further 17 post offices closed and no longer provide a service because no suitable applications were received in the company following advertisement campaigns for these contracts. In these instances, customers were re-directed to other post offices in the local vicinities. The above closures and conversions occurred countrywide except in counties Kerry, Tipperary, Louth and Carlow.</p>

            <p eId="para_2878">Security threat assessments on the risk level to Ireland of terrorist attack are furnished by the Garda authorities at regular intervals to my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who briefs the Government as appropriate. The Garda authorities maintain an up-to-date assessment of the threat of attack from international terrorist groupings through analysis of intelligence gathered from domestic and international sources.</p>
            <p eId="para_2879">On numerous occasions I have set out Government policy on the use of Shannon Airport by the US military. It is important that the public, including the Muslim community, are aware of the Government's position, and I am satisfied that this is the case. The use of Shannon is a long standing arrangement which has been in place for more than 50 years and which has been extensively discussed in, and is supported by, Dáil Éireann. The presence of international forces in Iraq has been mandated by a succession of UN Security Council resolutions, most recently renewed in UN Resolution 1637 of 8 November last. Resolution 1546 of June 2004 requested member states to provide assistance to these forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_2880">The Government has maintained the strong view from the outset that the international community has an obligation to assist in the reconstruction of an independent, democratic and sovereign Iraqi Government, which can take responsibility for the stability and security of the country. We have been very clear that the central involvement of the United Nations would be essential to the success of these efforts.</p>
            <p eId="para_2881">This overall approach was embodied in Security Council Resolution 1546 of 8 June 2004, which set out a roadmap and timetable for the political reconstruction of Iraq. This process will approach completion with the holding of democratic elections on 15 December, under the new constitution which was approved by referendum in October. The Government has supported the process, both nationally and in cooperation with our EU partners. The EU has provided vital support for the political process, for the holding of democratic elections, for physical and economic reconstruction, and for the restoration of essential services. Bilaterally, Ireland has supported humanitarian relief, reconstruction of the education sector and assistance to the Marsh Arabs. Ireland has also contributed financially to the force established to protect UN operations in Iraq.</p>
            <p eId="para_2882">It is clear that the restoration of a sovereign Iraqi Government will not of itself solve all of Iraq's problems, in particular the continuing high level of violence directed at innocent civilians. Progress will depend on the establishment of effective Iraqi security forces and political action to reconcile the various communities in Iraq. The Government, and its EU partners, will continue to work in co-operation with the international community to support the efforts of the Iraqi people to rebuild a peaceful and prosperous society.</p>

            <p eId="para_2888">Workplace regulations are currently either being finalised or advanced in regard to a number of areas of local staff conditions of employment. As mentioned in my reply of 18 October to the Deputy, the protections afforded by the Civil Service anti-harassment, sexual harassment and bullying policy, A Positive Working Environment, are being extended to all unestablished employees at diplomatic missions overseas. A circular to this effect will be issued before the end of the year. In addition to the above grievance procedures, it is also intended to introduce a local staff disciplinary code in all missions by the end of 2005. The purpose of this code is to ensure that locally recruited members of staff at missions abroad are dealt with in a fair and equitable manner in regard to disciplinary matters. A circular to this effect will issue later this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_2889">As regards the Labour Court's expression of concern that no formal mechanism exists for locally recruited staff in Irish missions abroad to pursue grievances with regard to pay, grade and related matters, the Department has been examining ways to introduce a more formal procedure, which would provide a framework for dealing with these issues. As I said in my reply of 18 October, the introduction of such a procedure raises certain legally complex questions. The Department is, therefore, actively conducting a wider review of all the issues in question, including best practice among other foreign ministries. It is hoped to be in a position to introduce a new procedure in all missions in 2006.</p>

            <p eId="para_2891">Since becoming Minister with responsibility for the arts, I have consistently maintained that the arts and culture are for everyone, and that a crucial element of maximising access is optimal access for people with disabilities. Accordingly, my Department applies this principle in the context of our participation at various EU fora in discussions on EU funding for cultural projects. Further, it is carried through in a practical way to our funding of cultural facilities, both where co-funded by the EU, and funded from the national Exchequer.</p>
            <p eId="para_2892">For example, the CDIS scheme, which commenced in 1994, provided grants for cultural infrastructure facilities, and was co-funded by the EU. It was a condition of the scheme that physical accessibility to all projects had to be ensured in the design of the facility. This requirement was deepened and made more specific in the subsequent ACCESS scheme, which from 2001 provided funding of €45.7 million for 44 arts and culture facilities throughout the country. It was a condition of the scheme that all projects would be accessible to people with disabilities both in terms of general access and their participation in the practice of arts and culture activity. This scheme was funded by the Exchequer.</p>
            <p eId="para_2893">It is worth mentioning that in a press release of 1 December 2005, the EU Commission signalled its intention to ensure that the disability issue is mainstreamed, that is, taken into account in all EU decisions and actions in all areas. The Commission's overall aim is to improve the active inclusion of disabled people through a range of initiatives and measures, including awareness raising, training and equalisation of opportunities for disabled people, and promoting the concept of independent living for disabled people.</p>

            <p eId="para_2909">Ireland has a comprehensive body of employment rights legislation, which has among its objectives the protection of employees against arbitrary behaviour by employers. It also has wider aims such as provision for the safety and health of workers and the fostering of labour market harmony by promoting policies which minimise conflict and maximise fairness. Specific areas covered by such legislation include working time, the payment of wages, holidays, the national minimum wage, unfair dismissal, redundancy payments, the protection of young persons and the transfer of undertakings. Irish legislation mirrors the broader EU social protection framework in this area. One would usually expect the composition of a workforce to reflect the broad population of the local catchment area, provided that appropriate personnel are available for the specific vacancies which arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_2910">It should be borne in mind that Ireland is now part of an EU labour market, which means that nationals of other member states have the same right and freedom to work in Ireland as Irish nationals. It is important that it is appreciated that employers can choose to hire such workers without regard to nationality. Concerns about the protection of workers' jobs, pay and conditions of employment to which the Deputy refers raise complex legal and policy issues. New challenges are being posed by population movement, the changing structure of the economy, new work practices and increasing international economic integration. The continuing full employment is evidence that the Irish economy has adapted very successfully to such challenges in recent years. Deputies are aware that the Government has communicated its intention to engage fully and effectively in the process of devising policies and measures which protect employment standards and arrest the race to the bottom in employment practices. I am confident that a successful response to such issues can be found in our economy, where the exceptional legal and other characteristics of the maritime sector do not apply. Such a response can be best put in place in the context of the social partnership system, which continues the stability and progressive modernisation of our labour force and employment practices to sustain jobs and living standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_2911">I view with great concern the potential social implications of the displacement of workers on established conditions in favour of those willing to do the same jobs on much poorer conditions. The Taoiseach has said he wants to see greater productivity and enhanced competitiveness, based on new products and services, the upskilling of staff, new work practices and technological innovation. We do not want to see people building competitive advantage based on poor wages, casualisation of labour, low health and safety standards or other poor compliance practices. Not only is it wrong, but it is also simply unsustainable. While recognising the exceptional situation that has recently arisen in the maritime sector, it is important to remember that the full panoply of Irish employment law and social protection continues to apply to people employed in Ireland, regardless of nationality. This body of law is and will continue to be enforced by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p>

            <p eId="para_2915">As the Deputy may be aware, the community employment programme was restructured in 1999 to limit participation by new participants within three years, with effect from April 2000. The change was introduced to discourage repeated participation in community employment schemes and to encourage unemployed persons to avail of training-education and employment options where possible. The three-year cap was amended in August 2001 to allow particularly disadvantaged persons to remain on the programme for a further period. In general, approximately 20% of participants, including persons under 55 years of age, may benefit from an additional year on the programme under the flexibility guidelines introduced in August 2001. I announced in November 2004 on foot of a review of the FÁS employment schemes — the community employment, job initiative and social economy programmes — that the three-year cap would be removed for community employment participants over the age of 55. This category of participants is now eligible to participate on community employment schemes for a maximum of six years. The extended participation on such schemes by older workers will help to secure the continuity of community services of the type referred to by the Deputy and will ensure that the existing community service support framework will be maintained.</p>

            <p eId="para_2919">Under the country of origin principle, which is a central feature of the draft services directive, if a service provider is not established — does not have an office — in a member state to which it provides a service, the rules governing the provision of the service are those of the member state in which it is established. The principle would give legislative effect to a treaty right on the free movement of services within the internal market. Ireland broadly supports the country of origin principle, subject to further detailed technical work on its application. In that respect, while considerable progress has been made at a technical level on the original Commission proposal, more work needs to be done on all its aspects before it is ready for adoption. There are concerns about the perceived link between the country of origin principle and the so-called "race to the bottom" in terms of standards. The directive will not lead to exploitation or social dumping — it would not be supported by Ireland if it did.</p>
            <p eId="para_2920">Concerns have been expressed about the possible implications of the draft directive on the posting of workers. The draft directive provides for a derogation from the country of origin principle for the terms and conditions of employment of posted workers covered by the draft directive. Employees posted to Ireland will be subject to Ireland's minimum wage and health and safety requirements, as well as the other legally binding employment conditions. Recent changes to the text of the draft directive are intended to extend the derogation to all workers. The draft directive provides for other derogations from the country of origin principle, including certain public utilities such as postal services, electricity, gas and water distribution and supply. Further derogations may be added to the list. Ireland favours the adoption of a services directive that combines appropriate opportunities for service providers, many of which are SMEs, to avail of the opportunities of the internal market, while ensuring that employees and consumers are protected.</p>

            <p eId="para_2928">The issue of mandatory energy labelling for electrical goods comes within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. I understand from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources that energy-efficient labels are affixed to goods in the EU in response to a directive under the Single Market framework to equalise the playing field for such goods throughout the EU. Ireland's interest is in ensuring that the population of goods subject to that regime moves into the highest categories to allow users and the national economy to benefit from the reduced demand for energy on foot of savings in energy, energy bills and carbon dioxide emissions. The labels empower purchasers to select a higher level of efficiency when they buy new or replacement goods. There is no compulsion on purchasers to buy more efficient goods but the demand for less efficient appliances has reduced since the information first became available in this fashion in the EU. As the measure is intended for the equalisation of market conditions, it would be counter-productive for Ireland to take an individual stance and set different standards which could be seen by the European Commission as a non-tariff barrier.</p>
            <p eId="para_2929">EU directive 2005/32/EC, which was adopted in July 2005, establishes a framework for setting ecodesign requirements for energy-using products. The aim of the directive is to improve the environmental performance of such products by encouraging manufacturers to design products in an environmentally conscious manner, with a particular focus on making products more energy efficient, thus contributing to the security of energy supply. The directive seeks to ensure the free movement of such products, based on a coherent EU-wide framework that is designed to prevent market barriers. The framework directive in question provides that the Commission may adopt implementing measures on specific products by specifying environmental aspects and ecodesign requirements. It will be possible to place such products on the market if they comply with the agreed specified criteria. Conformity will be implemented using the existing CE conformity marking scheme. The directive applies to any product using energy to perform its function. Products with high carbon dioxide reduction potential are likely to be targeted first by the Commission in selecting products to be included in the implementing measures. Priority product groups likely to be targeted first include heating and lighting, electric motors, domestic and office appliances, consumer electronics and air conditioners. When the implementing measures have been adopted, they will lead to significant improvements in energy consumption and, therefore, carbon dioxide emissions associated with a wide range of energy-using products.</p>

            <p eId="para_2934">I propose to take Questions Nos. 293 and 300 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2935">The Forfás employment survey tracks employment levels in agency-assisted companies on an annual basis. However, factors influencing a decision to relocate all or part of a firm's function are many, varied and complex. Many of these are outside the direct influence of Government policymakers and may include business takeovers or consolidations, changes in product or market focus, in addition to relative wage rates and other costs and incentives. Relocation is just one factor in the many enterprise-related issues that determine employment levels — the life cycle of companies also influences the ebb and flow of employment. Accordingly it is not possible to determine the employment change arising from relocation or indeed the destination countries for any such relocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2936">Ireland no longer operates as a low cost location for investment. Our strengths and competitive advantages have inexorably changed. Ireland's economy is now characterised by high output and productivity, together with high returns to labour in the form of wages, salaries and better living standards. Low technology production, which dominated our economic output in the past, is being replaced by higher technology and services enterprises. Inevitably, more attractive cost environments abroad will entice some firms that are unable to generate their required return from the modern enterprise economy into which we are evolving.</p>
            <p eId="para_2937">A continuing structural transformation of our economy is both unavoidable and necessary to maintain present levels of growth and high employment. Part of this transformation entails some inevitable plant transfers and other adjustments, but where relocation has occurred to date, it has largely been confined to relatively low technology, labour-intensive activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2938">To meet the challenge from lower cost competitor economies, our policy is to encourage companies' development to higher levels of competitiveness and value added products and services. Our priority is on the creation of sustainable employment. Such employment will be driven by companies that have higher profitability, are more technologically advanced and prove a better fit with the competitive characteristics of our economy. Such companies are consequently less likely to move on the basis of simple cost influences. We are continuing to develop those infrastructures, both physical and intellectual, to create and maintain an attractive environment for investment and expansion in Ireland. Such investment will be sourced by a combination of developing existing clients and new investors in existing or new activities or sectors. Given the critical mass of FDI in Ireland and its linkages with indigenous companies, one of the greatest potential contributions will ensue from the development of companies already operating here. The enterprise development agencies are continuing to encourage companies to undertake more sophisticated activities, reducing the likelihood of our competitive advantage being eroded by cost based competition.</p>

            <p eId="para_2942">As part of its operational responsibilities, FÁS engages closely with companies whose workers are made redundant. The agency assists affected workers to plan new careers, identify training needs and secure alternative employment. It also refers workers to training programmes and establishes special or customised programmes where necessary. In this regard, I understand that FÁS has been very actively involved with both of the companies in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_2943">The company in Naas announced a major restructuring and upgrading of its operations earlier this year. However, its commitment to Naas continues and this is evidenced by a new €4 million investment designed to ensure that the company becomes a centre of excellence for its core electro-chromic mirror product. While loss-making products have been moved away from Naas, I understand from IDA Ireland that the company has no further plans to relocate any of its operations at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_2944">Kildare continues to thrive across a broad range of activities in the housing, commercial, services and industrial sectors. As a result, many job opportunities are being created within the county. Some 25 IDA client companies are located in County Kildare employing 10,109 permanent staff. In 2004, significant developments in overseas investment were announced including multi-million euro investments in wafer fabrication and a technology development centre by Intel and Hewlett Packard respectively. The announcement last January by Green Isle Foods of a €22.6 million expansion investment, which is now under way, will lead to the creation of 130 additional jobs in Naas from a current base of 630. This project is supported by Enterprise Ireland and, employment in EI client companies in the county has increased by 46% over the past ten years, from 3,972 to 5,784. This growth is significantly better that the national average.</p>
            <p eId="para_2945">On 5 May last, I performed the official opening of the office of International Fund Services (Ireland) Limited at Naas, County Kildare. Located in Millennium Park, the Naas facility is on target to employ 140 people by the end of 2005 and 240 by the end of 2006. In September, I opened the first phase of a new €40 million business park in Athy. While it will be known as the Athy Business Campus, I expect that it will have positive implications for both Athy and the wider Kildare region.</p>

            <p eId="para_2949">The National Competitiveness Council, NCC, in its Annual Competitiveness Report 2005, found that of the 16 countries benchmarked, Irish expenditure on non-life insurance was the fourth highest. However, the NCC also found that the rate of growth in the cost of insurance has slowed down substantially in recent years. This can be attributed to the series of initiatives the Government has pushed through to reform the insurance sector. The action taken by Government to ensure healthy competition in the insurance sector had already seen benefits for consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2950">Sub-indices calculated from the all-items consumer price index at mid-October 2005 show that since the insurance reform programme began in October 2002, there has been a reduction of 23% in car insurance. The Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, which was one of the key initiatives of the Government's insurance reform programme, published its first annual report on 13 of September 2005. This shows that PIAB assessments to date have been delivered approximately three times faster and at a delivery charge four times cheaper than under the litigation system. As well as being a major benefit to victims of accidents this is a significant reduction in the cost to insurance companies for the delivery of compensation and hence facilitates reductions in insurance premia.</p>
            <p eId="para_2951">Supervision of insurance undertakings is the responsibility of the Financial Regulator, formerly known as the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. The Financial Regulator has a wide regulatory remit covering consumer protection and prudential supervision of practically all of the financial services industry, including insurance, and the services provided by it. The Financial Regulator comes under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</p>

            <p eId="para_2953">Ambitious Irish companies continue to win market position in a range of existing and new markets throughout the world. This is no easy task. Building market share is challenging but success in harnessing the extensive opportunities that exist will drive their future success. The developing global economy is creating new competitive challenges from places such as China and the Far East, India, and eastern Europe. However, these economies are increasingly becoming fast growing markets for the high-tech goods and services output of the Irish economy. Consequently, exploiting these fast growing major new markets has become a key factor in determining the continued success of the activities being carried out in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2954">In 2004 the value of Irish merchandise exports reached €84.3 billion. This represents a 2.6% rise from 2003 and a 26% rise from 1999. The sectoral composition of Irish exports remains highly concentrated, with 71.6% of total exports coming from just two sectors, chemicals, which includes organic chemicals and pharmaceuticals and machinery and transport goods, which include ICT products.</p>
            <p eId="para_2955">Pharmachem exports expanded 4.8% in 2004, and have witnessed dramatic growth over the past six years, expanding in aggregate by 77.6%. The sector containing ICT goods continued to decline in 2004 with exports falling by 2.8%. Computer products, accounting for €13.4 billion of exports, experienced a fall of 10% in 2004. Exports from food and beverages reached €7.1 billion in 2004, a rise of 3% from 2003 and 13% from 1999. Its share of total Irish merchandise exports stood at 8% in 2004, a drop of one percentage point from 1999. Meat exports rose 10.5% from 2003 to reach the €2 billion mark for the first time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2956">The USA remains Ireland's largest export market, taking 20% of Irish exports in 2004. Exports there fell by 2.2% from 2003 but have risen by 60% from 1999. The UK accounts for 18% of Irish exports and is a particularly important destination for food and beverage exports. Exports there rose by 1.9% from 2003 and by 3% from 1999. In 2004 14.6% of Irish exports went to Belgium, an increase of 258% from 1999. This is mainly due to Belgium becoming a European distribution centre for pharmaceutical companies based in Ireland. Exports to other euro zone countries have fallen by 6.4% since 1999.</p>
            <p eId="para_2957">With regard to exports to the rest of the world, exports to Pacific Rim countries grew strongly in 2004, with impressive increases in Australia, 14%; China, 9%; Japan, 11%; South Korea, 15%; Hong Kong, 21%; and Singapore, 18%. Decreases in exports to countries such as Malaysia, 23%; Mexico, 11%; and Sweden, 16%, showed steep year-on-year declines.</p>
            <p eId="para_2958">Work to expand Irish markets has included recent overseas trade missions and trade fairs to countries in Europe, North and South America, the Middle East, Australia and Asia. New market opportunities were targeted in China, Korea, Japan, Iran and the Gulf and New Zealand and Australia, leading to direct sales, partnering and distribution opportunities for client companies. Of particular significance was the trade mission to China last January, which was led by the Taoiseach. This was Ireland's largest ever trade mission involving a total of 121 companies in a range of sectors and led to contracts involving a sum of the order of €125.8 million.</p>

            <p eId="para_2960">I understand from FÁS that ex-prisoners qualify for the full range of FÁS services and at any given time a number of ex-prisoners attending FÁS courses may not be identified as such.</p>
            <p eId="para_2961">In addition, the high support process has recently been extended to include ex-prisoners who would benefit from such support. The high support process is an inter-agency response for people who are remote from the labour market. The high support process has a flexible training fund for employment support of up to €2,500 per person, to purchase employment supports not readily available through mainstream providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2962">FÁS and the probation and welfare service also collaborate on a number of justice workshops for youths at risk who may be ex-prisoners or ex-offenders. The aim is to prevent custodial sentences and rehabilitate ex-prisoners. At present there are 13 joint FÁS-probation and welfare justice workshops. Furthermore links are continuing between FÁS and the training and education officers of the linkage programme. The linkage programme was initiated in 2000 by the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is funded by the probation and welfare service to provide an access service to clients referred to the programme by the probation and welfare service for training, education and employment opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2963">Time spent in prison counts as part of the eligibility period for the community employment and social economy programme and ex-offenders do not need to be on the live register at the time of recruitment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2964">FÁS is represented on the board of the Educational Trust, an all-Ireland body that funds the educational needs of ex-prisoners and their families, both North and South of the Border. FÁS is also a partner in the "You are Equal" project. The aim of this project is to enable participation in society in a positive way through removing barriers to employability and job readiness of prisoners and ex-prisoners. The project will support the group to get and keep employment. FÁS with other partner agencies in this project, including the Irish Prison Service and the probation and welfare service, recognises the need for a stronger and enhanced cross agency approach, which will lead to a more integrated approach to meeting such clients' needs. Ongoing contact continues between FÁS, the Prison Service, and the probation and welfare services in addressing the employment needs of ex-prisoners.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Killeen)</from>
            <p eId="para_2966">As part of the "One Step Up" initiative implementing a key element of the Government's response to the enterprise strategy group's recommendations, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is funding a wide range of supports and services to raise the skill levels of those in employment. Over the period 2005 to 2007 funding for these supports and services will total over €150 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_2967">FÁS is using part of this funding to provide and facilitate targeted training programmes and services to employers and employees. The budget for these programmes for 2004 was €8.8 million. For 2005, this will be €35.6 million. Twenty projects for the use of these funds have been approved.</p>
            <p eId="para_2968">The training falls into four broad categories — basic skills provision specifically targeted at low skilled employees, for example, literacy support, contract cleaning; occupationally specific upskilling for operative and technical staff in individual sectors, for example, engineering, motor, food; management training for managers; and entrepreneurial development.</p>
            <p eId="para_2969">Skillnets Services Limited is also receiving funds from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to manage a networking programme that involves approximately 100 companies. It addresses general training needs, as well of those of particular economic sectors. The public budget for this training in 2005 is €7.5 million and, when allied to matching funds provided by the employers, total funding available is significantly more. Next year's budget will increase to €8 million and to €10 million in the years up to 2010. Skillnets is also managing the ACCEL, accelerated in-company skills, initiative on behalf of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. This has a public budget of €16 million over the next two years. Approximately 72 proposals for funding were received in response to a recent promotion, 25 of which are starting up now. The balance of those approved will commence in the spring.</p>
            <p eId="para_2970">Enterprise Ireland is also providing in-company training. Some 20 projects have been funded under its auspices since 2004. Approximately €6 million has been provided and the programme will run into 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_2971">In addition to these initiatives, specific funding has been made available from the national training fund for dedicated training purposes. This includes support for the continuing professional development of engineers, for promotion and training in the ICT sector and for developing the range of skills required to work to greatest effect in the community and voluntary sector. There has never been such a concentration of public funds devoted to training and skills development for those in employment. The Government has been consistently generous in promoting the importance of continuing training to upskill those in employment.</p>

Under current rules, weekly means of €7.60 per week are disregarded and all means in excess of that figure, including those from earnings from employment, are assessed in full.

            <p eId="para_2980">In May 2000, a special half rate old age, contributory, pension was introduced to enable people with pre-1953 insurance, who could not qualify for a payment under normal qualifying conditions, to receive a pension. People already qualifying for pensions at less than half rate could also benefit from the new scheme. In order to be eligible for the payment, a person requires 260 paid contributions at the appropriate rate, which can comprise a mixture of pre and post-1953 contributions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2981">There are just over 28,700 pre-1953 pensions in payment with about 67% of these being paid to residents of the UK and other countries. The estimated cost for 2005 is €135 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_2982">One of the difficulties in estimating costs in this case was that the form in which records relating to pre-1953 contributions were available in the Department of Social and Family Affairs did not allow for ready estimation of the numbers of contributions.

            <p eId="para_2984">A representative of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul was quoted in the press last week stating that the society's big concern was that some people would need to juggle between paying for heat and eating this winter. He called for a doubling of the social welfare fuel allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2985">Fuel allowances are supplementary entitlements payable over the winter months to people in receipt of pensions and other qualifying social welfare schemes. Some 274,000 people receive this allowance at an aggregate cost of €85.4 million this year. Fuel allowances are incorporated in weekly pension and other basic payments. The adequacy of the total amount paid each week to an individual is what matters most to them, that is, the total value of the basic pension plus the fuel allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2986">The Government's objective is to ensure that a social welfare recipient's total weekly income is sufficient to meet all of their basic living needs, including food and heating costs. In recent years, very significant budget resources have been concentrated on providing real increases over and above inflation in all primary social welfare pension, benefit and assistance rates. This is a more costly approach than increasing fuel allowances because the increase is paid for the full year and not just for the 29 weeks of the winter heating season. This approach delivers a better outcome for pensioners and others by substantially increasing their income in real terms over the whole year, to better assist them in meeting their normal basic living costs, including heating.</p>
            <p eId="para_2987">In addition, the household benefit allowances for electricity or gas, costing €109 million in 2005, have also been increased fully in line with electricity and gas prices in the period. They are payable all year round to assist eligible pensioners, carers and disabled people with their heating and related costs. I acknowledge that some home heating costs generally have increased significantly over the past year in particular. For that reason, I am keeping the adequacy of the overall system, including the fuel allowance scheme, under close review. Given the significant potential extra scheme costs involved, any increases in fuel allowance rates are matters that have to be considered in the context of the forthcoming budget and the scale of general social welfare rate increases to be provided then.</p>

        <b>Mr. Broughan</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
        if he will examine the situation of a job initiative worker (details supplied) whose deserted wife’s benefit is being cut due to the operation of a very low income disregard for deserted wife’s benefit recipients after 30 August 1992; if this disregard will be increased to encourage women to be able to provide better for their families by taking up work.

            <p eId="para_2992">The job initiative programme is one of a number of FÁS schemes in which lone parents may participate. Under the programme full-time employment is provided in the social economy for individuals who are over 35 years and fulfil certain criteria. With effect from 1 January 2005, job initiative employees earn a minimum of €346.40 for their 39-hour week, which is substantially more than the national minimum wage. In addition to their basic income earned, job initiative employees with families may be entitled to family income supplement, a weekly payment for families, including one-parent families, at work on low pay. All employees working a minimum of 19 hours per week and with at least one qualifying child are entitled to apply, provided the family income is below the qualifying income limit. For the current year, qualifying income limits for families start at €446 per week for a family with one child and increase to €623 per week for families with eight or more children.</p>
            <p eId="para_2993">The Deputy is correct in that job initiative employees who were in receipt of deserted wife's benefit and whose initial claim for benefit was made after 30 August 1992 will lose entitlement to their social welfare payment from 1 January 2006 provided their employment income for 2005 is more than the upper income threshold of €17,776.33 per annum. This income limit in itself is higher than that currently enjoyed by recipients of the one parent family payment.</p>

This rate was based on her household circumstances as then known. However, as there were indications at the appeal hearing that her household composition may have changed, the executive wrote to the person concerned on 9 November 2005 seeking further details.

            <p eId="para_3016">The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over. All carers in receipt of carer's allowance and carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance, regardless of their age, receive a free travel pass. It is also available to people under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person's pension.</p>
            <p eId="para_3017">The household benefits package of free schemes, including the free travel scheme, was introduced during the period from 1967 to 1977 for those in receipt of old age pension from this Department. In the period 1973 to 1977 the age at which a person became eligible for old age pensions was progressively reduced from age 70 to age 66 and the age at which a person received the household benefits package and free travel was reduced accordingly. The Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1993 defines "pensionable age" as being 66 years of age. Any reduction in the pension age and, consequently, the age at which a person becomes entitled to free travel would have expenditure implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</p>
            <p eId="para_3018">Significant improvements have been made to the household benefits package of free schemes, including the free travel scheme, in recent budgets in terms of both the qualifying conditions and the coverage of the schemes. I will continue to review the operation of these schemes with a view to identifying the scope for further improvements as resources permit.</p>

            <p eId="para_3052">The concept of weeks of insurable employment plays a key role in the operation of the social insurance system and is provided for in legislation. The system provides that social insurance contributions are paid by employees and employers on earnings exceeding €38 for each week of insurable employment. These contributions progressively build towards entitlement to a range of short and long-term benefits.</p>
            <p eId="para_3053">The specific pattern of work could potentially impact on a person's contributions record depending on the alignment of the working pattern with the legally defined contribution week. Many shift workers, for example nurses, work a condensed working week. They compress their working hours into one week while being paid over two weeks in respect of that employment; each of these are valid as weeks of insurable employment. As such, employees in the scenario do not lose any social protection coverage.</p>
            <p eId="para_3054">Two questions need to be considered in addressing the issue, that is, what impact do these working arrangements have on their entitlement to social welfare benefits and to what extent does the employee benefit from the social insurance arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_3055">In terms of entitlement to social welfare benefits, changes were made to the homemakers scheme to allow for the award of credited contributions where an eligible person who is in atypical employment such as job-sharing or on shift-work and the week off coincides with the PRSI contribution week. These credits maintain entitlement to old age contributory pension thus protecting their long term entitlement to that pension. The contribution requirements for unemployment, disability and maternity benefits were relaxed in 2001 providing an alternative test to the normal requirement. The usual test requires 39 contributions paid or credited in the relevant tax year while the alternative test requires 26 contributions paid in both the relevant tax year, and 26 the previous year also. This easing of the contribution requirements benefited all those work-sharing, working part-time, seasonally or intermittently. Employees may also be entitled to additional PRSI contributions on the basis of entitlement to public holidays under the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_3056">In terms of the benefits of the system for atypical workers, in the years when the contribution weeks are not aligned with the calendar week and the working week spans two contribution weeks, provided they earn €38 or more, she-he gains two weeks PRSI allowances; pays less than half what is being paid by the other full-time workers and is awarded 52 contributions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3057">The issue was discussed by a social partnership group which considered possible developments towards a fully inclusive social insurance model. In its report, which was published in June this year, the group concluded that the potential incidence of a problem with people not qualifying for benefits would not warrant a fundamental review of the weekly contributions system, while also suggesting that the situation be monitored and information on atypical working arrangements be collated to inform future developments. The situation reflects the contributory principle which is at the heart of the social insurance system and there are no plans at present to review fundamentally the weekly contribution basis of the social insurance system.</p>

            <p eId="para_3066">The taxi hardship payments scheme was based on the recommendations and parameters set out in the taxi hardship panel report, as approved by Government. The report recommended the establishment of a scheme to provide payments to individual taxi licence holders who fell into one of six categories that the panel assessed as having suffered extreme personal financial hardship arising from taxi liberalisation. The categories in question included two based on age, that is, taxi licence holders aged over 65 with no pension provision and taxi licence holders aged between 50 and 65 with no pension provision. The other categories, that is, widows, widowers or separated persons with or without dependants, wheelchair accessible taxi licence holders, taxi licence holders with certain large loan repayments and disabled taxi licence holders who were unable to work, did not have any age related criteria. Payments have been made to taxi licence holders under 50 years of age under the scheme in these latter categories. In addition, payments have been made to a small number of individuals under 50 years of age with no pension provision where their particular extenuating circumstances were taken into account by ADM.</p>

            <p eId="para_3069">The primary investigative role in relation to road accidents is vested in the Garda Síochána. Such investigations seek to determine the causes of road accidents including, where appropriate, road construction or surface standards. The Garda reports on these investigations are forwarded to the National Roads Authority and subsequently to each local authority for the purpose of the establishment of accident trends and causes generally and to facilitate the carrying out of remedial works relating to road infrastructure where such action is deemed to be necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_3070">The safe management of road improvement works is a matter for the road authorities involved and their contractors. I understand that requirements and standards in relation to pavement improvement works and resurfacing are set out in the NRA specification for road works. I also understand that two circular letters were issued by the NRA in March and May 2002 and that the NRA has since consolidated and reissued these circulars supplementing, where appropriate, the previous guidance. Requirements on the provision and deployment of traffic signs at road works are set out in the Traffic Signs Manual 1996. A major review of that manual is being pursued. The timely completion of road improvement works in accordance with these requirements is a matter for the local authority concerned and, as part of its overall supervision of the national roads programme, the NRA.</p>
            <p eId="para_3071">Furthermore, section 10 of the Road Traffic Act 2004 provides that a county or city manager may make a road works speed limit order for the application of a speed limit on any road or part of a road, including a motorway, where road works are being carried out. A road works speed limit order can be applied for any period of not more than 12 months and the minimum speed limit that may be put in place by such an order is 30 km/h.</p>
            <p eId="para_3072">Before making an order under section 10, a manager must give notice of the proposal to the Garda Commissioner and consider any representations made by the Commissioner. The consent of the National Roads Authority must be given in respect of any proposals to apply a road works speed limit on any part of a national road or a motorway. Notice of the making of a road works speed limit order must be published in one or more newspapers in circulation in the county or city where the road in respect of which the order is to have effect is located.</p>
            <p eId="para_3073">I have no plans at present to propose alternative arrangements for investigating road accidents or for the requirements and standards in relation to road improvement works.</p>

The primary purpose of bus lanes is to facilitate and promote bus based public transport.

            <p eId="para_3099">My Department funds a number of projects which either directly or indirectly provide Traveller support. The details are given in the appendix. I am not aware of any difficulties experienced by members of the Traveller community in accessing these services. However, if the Deputy is aware of any particular difficulty experienced, I would be glad to examine this.</p>

              <i>Appendix</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_3101">Community Development Programme, CDP. Travellers are one of a number of target groups that benefit under the community development programme. While a significant number of the 185 projects within the programme would identify Travellers as beneficiaries of their activities, services, etc., to a greater or lesser extent, 20 projects are funded that specifically focus on providing Traveller support. Training courses, support groups, provision of information and child care provision are examples of the type of supports typically made available.</p>
            <p eId="para_3102">The local development and social inclusion programme, LDSIP, aims to counter disadvantage and to promote equality and social and economic inclusion through the provision of funding and support to local partnerships.</p>
            <p eId="para_3103">Area partnerships and community partnerships across the country run programmes and courses that specifically target the Traveller community under the LDSIP. These include projects that meet the needs of Traveller men in relation to stabling, training and economics of their horses — this also acts as a forum for development work with Traveller men; primary health care training — preparing Traveller women to be health promotion workers in their community — it also works with Traveller men, through training; dedicated homework clubs for and youth workers for Traveller children; projects that aim to provide family support and educational opportunities for Travellers; and active citizen initiatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_3104">Under the funding scheme to support the role of federations, networks and umbrella bodies in the community and voluntary sector funding to the Traveller community is as follows: National Traveller Women's Forum —€141,000 over three years 2003-06, €47,000 per annum. The Irish Traveller Movement is being funded on a yearly basis. In 2004, it received €143,065 in two tranches. In 2005, it received €150,220 in two tranches.</p>
            <p eId="para_3105">Under the training and supports scheme the National Association of Travellers Centres is being funded for three years also to the sum of €105,000. Annual payments of €35,000 are made to the group.</p>
            <p eId="para_3106">My Department has also provided funding under the programme of grants for locally-based community and voluntary organisations. This programme supports the activities of local voluntary and community groups addressing disadvantage in their community. The programme consists of two schemes — one makes funds available for the purchase of essential equipment and for the small scale refurbishment of premises. This is complemented by a second scheme to provide education, training and research grants.</p>
            <p eId="para_3107">Grants of up to 90% of the cost are available under this programme. The maximum grant for refurbishment is €40,000; equipment is €10,000; and training, education and research is €10,000. I approved grants of €98,000 to groups working with Travellers across the country under the 2004 programme and I have approved grants of €33,000 so far under the 2005 programme to such groups.</p>

            <p eId="para_3111">The Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Act 2005 provides for significant changes in regard to the disbursement of funds from dormant accounts and for a reconstituted board. The Act was commenced on 1 September 2005. Under this new legislation, the Minister is required to consult with appropriate Ministers for the purpose of developing a proposal for submission to Government for approval. This proposal will include the programmes and types of projects in regard to which applications for disbursements will be invited, as well as the criteria to be applied in assessing applications made in response to the invitation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3112">Last week, the Government approved proposals for projects and programmes to address social and economic disadvantage under the next round of funding. The Minister will be making a further announcement shortly when the details and operational procedures are finalised. The consultation process with regard to proposals under the education disadvantage and disability categories is not yet finalised and the Minister hopes to be in a position to make proposals to Government under these headings shortly.</p>

As I already informed the Deputy, the granting or otherwise of planning permission for the development of lands is a matter for the planning authorities. I understand, however, that under the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 — S.I. No. 600, section 28.1 — the planning authorities are obliged to seek the views of the Irish Aviation Authority prior to making a decision on any planning application, the granting of which may have an impact on the safety of the approach to an airport runway. I should add that I support the application of any guidelines aimed at ensuring the safety of approaches to airport runways in the Gaeltacht and on the islands.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_3194">I propose to take Questions Nos. 347 and 349 to 351, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3195">The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Ireland's national action programme under the nitrates directive was formally submitted to the European Commission on 29 July 2005. Following a consultation process, regulations giving legal effect to the action programme are being finalised. Ireland is proceeding with a case for a derogation designed to allow certain farmers to operate, under appropriate conditions and controls, up to a level of 250 kg N org/ha/annum. The derogation proposes to cater largely for grassland holdings.</p>
            <p eId="para_3196">The action programme will inevitably have implications for some pig producers. Throughout the discussions on Ireland's proposals, the European Commission took a firm position on the minimum storage capacity required for this sector. It has also insisted that such storage facilities must be put in place at the earliest possible date. The nitrates action programme consequently provides that a storage capacity of 26 weeks is required for pigs and must be in place by 31 December 2006. However, a lesser storage requirement applies to smaller holdings on condition that they have adequate spreadlands to utilise all the manure on the holding, without exceeding nitrogen and phosphorus limits.</p>
            <p eId="para_3197">While implementation of the action programme will certainly have implications for some pig producers, I believe that the level of anxiety expressed in some quarters is excessive. I put proposals to the European Commission for a substantially improved farm waste management scheme to which, for the first time, pig producers will have access. Among other new elements, the scheme will provide for grants for specialised equipment with specific environmental advantages. I also intend to introduce a scheme to support the demonstration of new technologies to help the agriculture sector meet the requirements of the nitrates directive. The purpose of the scheme, details of which are being finalised at present with a view to an early introduction, is to examine new and emerging technologies for the treatment and possible use in bio-energy production of livestock manures, in particular from the pig and poultry sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_3198">The other issue facing pig producers is access to enough land to spread the quantities of slurry produced on their holdings in a way that meets the nutrient limits and other requirements of the action programme. I am acutely conscious of the need for pig farmers to continue to have adequate spreadlands for pig slurry. In that context I ask Teagasc to undertake an active promotion campaign to demonstrate the nutrient value of slurry and the savings farmers can achieve by substituting it for chemical fertiliser. I will urge REPS planners to encourage their clients to use pig manure on their farms. I will also seek to ensure that the necessary record-keeping and inspection regimes are kept to what is strictly necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_3199">Furthermore, there is much that farm organisations and individual farmers can do to promote the use of imported organic fertilisers such as pig slurry. It is in the interests of other farming sectors, such as the tillage sector that provides feed, to assist intensive pig producers by considering the use of manure on their crops. Pig producers also need to be proactive in identifying and encouraging suitable recipients to take and utilise their manure. I encourage the farm organisations to explore these possibilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_3200">While substantial grant aid is offered to help farmers comply with the nitrates directive, European Union legislation will not allow compensation to be paid to a farmer or any other person whose enterprise becomes unviable as a result of environmental legislation. A buy-out scheme was introduced in the Netherlands because of the extremely high pig numbers in that country. My understanding of the UK scheme, which dates back several years, is that it concerned a fundamental restructuring of the pig industry in that country rather than any specific issue relating to environmental legislation. The Irish pig industry, however, continues to generate income not only for producers but also for a significant processing industry that depends on a sustained and stable level of pig production for its future viability. There is a ready market for the amount of pigmeat being produced at present. It is important that we maintain existing levels of pig output, as reduced output would lead to lower export levels and more imports.</p>

            <p eId="para_3202">The decision to adopt a whole territory approach was taken by the Government, and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government made the necessary regulations to this effect on 29 May 2003. The recommendations in favour of adopting the whole territory approach were based on consultation between the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, my Department and Teagasc. It was considered that this approach was the better option in terms of ensuring environmental protection on a national scale. The whole territory approach also had the merit of equity in that it would apply the same principles of good agricultural practice in all areas, whereas farmers located within designated nitrate vulnerable zones would be at a significant competitive disadvantage. It allowed for the regulatory burden on farmers to be kept to the minimum necessary. It was also compatible with Ireland's on-going obligations to implement other EU directives, such as the groundwater directive, which must be addressed on a national scale.</p>
            <p eId="para_3203">I am satisfied that all of the reasons for that decision remain valid. While substantial grant aid is offered to help farmers comply with the nitrates directive, European Union legislation will not allow compensation to be paid to a farmer or any other person whose enterprise becomes unviable as a result of environmental legislation. A buy-out scheme was introduced in the Netherlands because of the extremely high pig numbers in that country.

            <p eId="para_3205">The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The licensing of pig farmers is a matter for the Environmental Protection Agency where the numbers of pigs are greater than the thresholds specified in the Protection of the Environment Act 2003. I understand one pig unit in County Kerry is licensed by the Environmental Protection Agency and two more are at application stage.</p>

I will seek to ensure that any application procedures, record-keeping and inspection regimes arising in connection with a derogation are kept to what is strictly necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_3207">Throughout the discussions on Ireland's proposals, the European Commission took a firm position on the minimum storage capacity required for pig producers and also insisted that such storage facilities must be put in place at the earliest possible date. Accordingly a storage capacity of 26 weeks is required for pigs and must be in place by 31 December 2006. However, for small units a lesser storage requirement, 16, 18, 20 or 22 weeks depending on the zone, applies to holdings with 100 pigs or less, conditional on the holding having adequate spreadlands to utilise all the manure on the holding without exceeding nitrogen and phosphorus limits.</p>
            <p eId="para_3208">The implementation of the nitrates action programme will inevitably have implications for pig producers. Regarding the availability of land to spread slurry, however, I believe the level of anxiety expressed in some quarters is excessive. I will ask Teagasc to undertake an active promotion campaign to demonstrate the nutrient value of slurry and the savings that farmers can achieve by substituting it for chemical fertiliser, and I will urge REPS planners to encourage their clients to use pig manure on their farms. I will also seek to ensure that the necessary record-keeping and inspection regimes are kept to what is strictly necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_3209">There is much that farm organisations themselves and individual farmers can do to promote the use of imported organic fertilisers such as pig slurry. It is in the interests of other farming sectors, such as the tillage sector that provides feed, to assist the intensive pig producers by considering the use of manure on their crops. Pig producers also need to be pro-active in identifying and encouraging suitable recipients to take and utilise their manure. I would encourage the farm organisations to explore these possibilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_3210">To assist farmers meet the additional requirements of the nitrates action programme, I announced details of a proposed revised farm waste management scheme for which EU approval is now sought. I hope early approval of the scheme will be forthcoming from the European Commission so that it can be introduced quickly. Under these proposals, pig and poultry producers will be eligible for the first time for on-farm investment aid, and grants of up to 70% will be available. Among other new elements, the scheme will introduce a new 40% grant rate for specialised equipment with specific environmental advantages subject to maximum eligible investment of €80,000 in the case of decanter centrifuge systems and dry feeding systems for pigs and €40,000 in the case of specialised slurry spreading tankers and related equipment. The scheme will increase the maximum eligible investment for standard mobile equipment from €11,000 to €15,000 with a grant rate of 20%.</p>
            <p eId="para_3211">I also intend to introduce a scheme to support the demonstration of new technologies to help the agriculture sector meet the requirements of the nitrates directive. The purpose of the scheme, details of which are being finalised at present with a view to an early introduction, is to examine new and emerging technologies for the treatment and possible use in bio-energy production of livestock manures, in particular from the pig and poultry sectors.</p>

            <p eId="para_3221">Ireland is continuing to implement a scrapie control and eradication programme under the terms of EU legislation.

The compensation arrangements also include provision for a hardship payment in the case of breeding ewes compulsorily depopulated. I am reviewing aspects of the compensation arrangements.</p>

            <p eId="para_3243">I presume the Deputy's question is prompted by the recent publication of research commissioned by my Department and completed by the Economic and Social Research Institute on earnings inequality and the wage gap between young male and female graduates.</p>
            <p eId="para_3244">This research builds upon work undertaken in the context of the social partnership agreements by a consultative group on male-female wage differentials, chaired by my Department and which reported in late 2003. This group was specifically established to develop proposals for actions to address the issues raised in the ESRI report, How Unequal?, which had been published in 2000, again supported by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_3245">This 2000 research had shown that the gender pay gap was mainly explained by differences in labour market experience and that the unexplained remainder was not attributable to any one factor. A number of factors are considered to contribute to gender pay inequalities including: differences in accumulated work experiences and years spent outside the labour market; occupational segregation including both vertical and horizontal segregation; educational and training differences; promotion practices within firms; the availability of child care; the availability of maternity and parental leave; and the availability of family-friendly work practices. The research also suggested that women themselves did not have experience of female role models in senior positions in certain professions or in higher level management within some organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_3246">The 2003 report of the consultative group on male-female wage differentials made specific recommendations on these factors and all either have been fully implemented or are being implemented as ongoing Government policy. The recommendations span a wide range of policy domains and cut across several Departments and State agencies. The Deputy will be aware of the significant progress which has been made in all of these areas with increased investment in child care; better provision of parental and maternity leave, and wider availability of family friendly policies. Other Departments are actively pursuing the implementation of recommendations which fall outside the remit of my Department, such as better access for girls to certain school subjects.</p>
            <p eId="para_3247">The most recent research on the topic, published last week, looked at the gender pay gap among graduates who had left third level education three years ago and found that a gender pay gap had already emerged within this relatively short time span. There is agreement at international level that the issue of the gender pay gap is complex and multifaceted. In Ireland the current, internationally comparative, rate of the gap is about 16% which coincides with the EU average.</p>
            <p eId="para_3248">The gender pay gap still requires an ongoing, multifaceted response and will be further addressed in the national women's strategy, which my Department is developing with all other relevant Departments at present. I will be bringing proposals for this cross-departmental national women's strategy to Government early next year and I am confident that my Cabinet colleagues will collaborate in finding further solutions to this cross cutting issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_3250">Applications for certificates of naturalisation were received from the persons referred to by the Deputy in the citizenship section of my Department on 19 October 2004 and 29 April 2005 respectively. Both are children of a naturalised Irish citizen.</p>
            <p eId="para_3251">The average processing time for applications for naturalisation is approximately 24 months at the present time. The first person, who is an adult, is a refugee. In accordance with the Government's obligations under the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of 28 July 1951, every effort is made to ensure that applications from persons with refugee status are dealt with as quickly as possible, having regard for the general volume of applications on hands. It is likely that the application of the person concerned will be finalised in the early part of 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_3252">The second person referred to by the Deputy is a minor. Due to the fact that such applications are more straightforward than standard adult applications, it is usually possible to finalise them in a shorter period of time. I cannot be specific on the exact time it will take to process this application, but it is unlikely to be finalised before the second quarter of 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_3253">I will of course be in touch with both the Deputy and the applicants when the cases are finalised.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_3257">I take it that the Deputy has tabled the question to me in the light of concerns which I have expressed about the position of Mr. Frank Connolly, the executive director of the Centre for Public Inquiry — Fiosrú An Phobail.</p>
            <p eId="para_3258">According to its website, the Centre for Public Inquiry was established in February 2005. The Centre for Public Inquiry is funded by Atlantic Philanthropies, which has provided funding of €4 million over five years to assist its work. The centre's claimed mission is "to independently promote the highest standards of integrity, ethics and accountability across Irish public and business life and to investigate and publicise breaches of those standards where they arise." The board of the centre is chaired by Mr. Justice Fergus Flood and includes Professor Enda McDonagh, Damien Kiberd and Greg O'Neill.</p>
            <p eId="para_3259">The board of the centre has appointed Frank Connolly to be its executive director. I have said publicly that Mr. Connolly has many major questions to deal with in respect of his travel to Colombia under an assumed identity with a known subversive in advance of the subsequent visit of the Colombia Three.</p>
            <p eId="para_3260">I am informed by the Garda Síochána that, following the arrest in August 2001, of James Monaghan, Martin McAuley and Niall Connolly — who became known as the Colombia Three — the Colombian authorities established that on 10 April 2001 three people in possession of false Irish passports had earlier entered the FARC controlled region in Colombia. The three persons who entered in April were subsequently identified as Frank Connolly, Niall Connolly and Pádraig Wilson.</p>
            <p eId="para_3261">Niall Connolly, who was identified as being part of both parties, is the brother of Frank Connolly and was described by the Government of Cuba in August 2001 as the official Sinn Féin representative to it and as resident in Havana. The Garda authorities have informed me that they are fully satisfied as to the accuracy of the identification of all the members of both parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_3262">Concerning the party that travelled to the FARC zone in April 2001, investigations have revealed that false passports were obtained for each of the members of the party as follows: an Irish passport bearing the photograph of Pádraig Wilson had been issued in the name of James Edward Walker on 19 May 2000; an Irish passport bearing the photograph of Niall Connolly had been issued in the name of Ralph McKay on 18 December 2000; and an Irish passport bearing the photograph of Frank Connolly had been issued in the name of John Francis Johnston on 1 November 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_3263">Regarding the Colombia Three party arrested in August of the same year, the three persons in question, James Monaghan, Martin McAuley and Niall Connolly, formally admitted in the course of legal proceedings in Colombia that they were in possession of three false passports as follows: James Monaghan was travelling on a British passport bearing his photograph and issued in the name of Edward Joseph Campbell; Martin McAuley was travelling on a British passport bearing his photograph and issued in the name of John Joseph Kelly; and Niall Connolly was travelling on an Irish passport bearing his photograph and issued in the name of David Bracken, a deceased person.</p>
            <p eId="para_3264">I do not propose to rehearse here the gravity of the charges against the Colombia Three but it clearly strains credulity to suggest that the two visits were unconnected. This is all the more so when the persons on both trips had access to false passports which could only have been obtained in such quantities as part of a well organised, sinister enterprise. Niall Connolly, the brother of Frank Connolly, travelled on both occasions on a false passport. I do not accept that the purpose of the visit on either occasion was to study the peace process in Colombia.</p>
            <p eId="para_3265">Pádraig Wilson was a known senior IRA member and has been convicted in Northern Ireland of explosives offences and conspiracy to murder, and of IRA membership. James Monaghan was a known senior IRA member and has been convicted of numerous explosives and firearms offences, in this jurisdiction and in the UK, and of IRA membership. Martin McAuley was a known IRA member and has been convicted of possession of a firearm.</p>
            <p eId="para_3266">On the basis of intelligence reports furnished to me, the visits appear to have been connected with an arrangement whereby the Provisional IRA furnished know-how in the use of explosives. The consideration received by the Provisional IRA under the arrangement is believed to be the payment of a large amount of money by FARC which finances its activities by its control of the cocaine trade in the area of Colombia which it controls.</p>
            <p eId="para_3267">I am aware that, despite the commitment of the Centre for Public Inquiry to "independently promote the highest standards of integrity, ethics and accountability", Mr. Connolly has proved very reticent in answering any detailed questions about the subject of his presence in Colombia.</p>
            <p eId="para_3268">I believe many people will find it surprising, given the public attention that this matter has received, that no adequate and sustained attempt appears to have been made by the board of the Centre for Public Inquiry to address the genuine issues of public concerns that arise.</p>

In that context, they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.

Those conditions are that the applicant must be of full age, or by way of exception, be a minor born in the State, be of good character, have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years, intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation and have made, either before a judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister, for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.</p>

Members of the community policing unit are assigned to the Ballymun area and have an excellent rapport with the local community and offer advice, support and assistance. The area is also patrolled by the divisional task force and traffic corps and additional foot patrols have also been assigned in the area as part of operational anvil.</p>
            <p eId="para_3380">Garda management further states that current policing plans for the area are designed to address the issues of anti-social and public order offences, the prevention of crime, including violence against the person and property and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of quality of life of the residents. This strategy is regularly reviewed by local Garda management and continues to be central to the delivery of a policing service to the area.</p>

            <p eId="para_3403">I am informed by the Garda authorities, which are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that local Garda management is aware of the concerns of the community about crime and anti-social behaviour in the Killinarden estate and its environs. I am further informed that members from the community policing unit are assigned to the area and carry out routine patrols. This unit is supplemented by the Garda mountain bike unit and by uniform and detective unit patrols. Additional patrols are carried out by the divisional crime task force, traffic corps units and drug units. Particular initiatives, involving patrols by the Garda mounted unit, the Garda dog unit and the air support unit are concentrated in the Tallaght area on a regular basis. Under Operation Anvil, additional checkpoints are also being carried out in the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_3404">Local Garda management states that it is satisfied that resources in Tallaght are presently sufficient to police the area and this is subject to monitoring and regular review. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible policing service is provided for the general public.</p>
            <p eId="para_3405">On Garda resources generally, the accelerated recruitment campaign to reach a record force strength of 14,000, in line with the commitment in the agreed programme for Government, is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of 2006. The Garda Commissioner will now draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of the Tallaght area will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda areas throughout the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_3407">I refer the Deputy to my Department's detailed correspondence with him dated 3 June 2005. This correspondence stated that it was necessary to refuse the application on grounds of insufficient finances, potential cost to public funds and potential impact on public resources. As stated in this correspondence, the applicant was entitled to submit the appeal within two months of the decision date forwarding any additional documentation that she may have felt were relevant to the appeal. The decision date was 2 June 2005 and the deadline for lodging the appeal was 2 August 2005. To date my Department has no record of an appeal.</p>
            <p eId="para_3408">The Deputy has indicated that the circumstances of the applicant have changed. If this is the position, it is open to applicants to make fresh application supported by current documentation. My Department will be happy to consider this new application.</p>

Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and on appeal by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. She was informed by letter dated 20 April 2005 that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of her and afforded three options under section 3(3)(<i>b</i>)(ii) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, namely; (a) to make representations to the Minister setting out the reasons she should be allowed to remain in the State; (b) to leave the State voluntarily or (c) to consent to the making of a deportation order. I have been informed by my officials that to date no representations under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 have been received.</p>
            <p eId="para_3411">The person concerned submitted an application for permission to remain in the State on the basis of being the parent of an Irish born child born prior to 1 January 2005, under the revised arrangements announced by me on 15 January 2005. The child in question was born on 17 March 2005. Following the citizenship referendum of 2004 and the subsequent Immigration and Citizenship Amendment Act 2004 which came into effect on 1 January 2005, a child born in Ireland after 1 January 2005 is no longer automatically entitled to Irish citizenship by virtue of being born in Ireland. The applicant parent does not qualify to be considered for residency under the revised arrangements because the child in question was born after 1 January 2005 and her application was returned to her.</p>

Anglesea Street Garda station is the divisional headquarters for the Cork city division. It is also the regional headquarters for the southern division. As Anglesea Street station polices Cork city centre and relates to the resident population only, it does not include people who socialise, shop or work in the city centre area.</p>
            <p eId="para_4405">I have been further informed that the personnel strength of the Garda stations in Cork city and county as at 31 December 1997 was 972, all ranks. The personnel strength of the Garda stations in Cork city and county as at 18 November 2005 was 1,106, all ranks. This represents an increase of 134 or 13.8% on the number of personnel allocated to the Garda stations in Cork city and county since that date.</p>
            <p eId="para_4406">On Garda resources generally, the accelerated recruitment campaign to reach a record force strength of 14,000, in line with the commitment in the agreed programme for Government, is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_4407">The Garda Commissioner is now drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. In this context the needs of Cork city and county will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda areas throughout the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_4409">The accessibility to all of the three European education programmes, Socrates, Leonardo da Vinci and Youth, is a goal which I strongly support. Targeting disadvantaged, including disabled, groups is one of the long-standing priorities of the current EU programmes. People with special needs will continue to be targeted under the new EU lifelong learning programme. One of the objectives of the new programme is to contribute to increased participation in lifelong learning by people of all ages, including those with special needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4410">Specific measures are undertaken during the current programmes. Under Socrates, school and adult education action, the programme is promoted to targeted groups and associations dealing with learners with disabilities. Moreover, potential applicant organisations with disabled or disadvantaged members are particularly encouraged and given support throughout the application process.</p>
            <p eId="para_4411">Schools with special needs students applying for funding are given priority in the selection process and additional funding may be provided for disadvantaged schools. In the case of students with physical disabilities, additional funds may be allocated to cover their travel and subsistence costs. Projects involving disabled adult learners in mobility activities may receive additional funding. Both school and adult educators may also apply for funding to attend in-service courses on the area of dealing with learners with special needs in the classroom.</p>
            <p eId="para_4412">The Erasmus higher education action of Socrates reserves 0.25% of mobility allocations, specifically for students and teachers with special needs and this is promoted widely in higher education institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_4413">Under the Leonardo da Vinci vocational training programme, there have been a number of both mobility and pilot projects involving the target group of disabled persons, which have been explicitly included in the national objectives of the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4414">In the Youth programme, more than 12 organisations working with young people across the disability sector at national, regional and local level have received support and development in delivering travel and networking opportunities to young people with disabilities.</p>

            <p eId="para_4417">I propose to take Questions Nos. 408 and 418 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4418">My Department funds the provision of adult literacy and community education, through its annual adult literacy and community education, ALCES, grant to the vocational education committees, VECs. These programmes are delivered locally by the VECs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4419">The national development plan committed €93.5 million to the service in the period 2000-06. While figures for the estimated number of persons in each county with literacy problems are not available, the national development plan set a target of providing adult literacy supports to 113,000 people in the 2000-06 period. This target will be met.</p>
            <p eId="para_4420">Funding for adult literacy has been increased incrementally in recent years from just under €1 million in 1997 to over €22 million this year. Client numbers rose in the same period from 5,000 in 1997 to over 33,000 in 2004. With the increase in funds, a number of initiatives were put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_4421">Referral networks with FÁS, local employment services, local development partnerships, health centres, welfare and community groups, playgroups, schools and school parent committees, libraries etc. are being expanded and strengthened. Family literacy groups, involving adults and their children, are running successfully. Staff development programmes are under way on a modular in-service basis for tutors and literacy organisers and a quality framework for the adult literacy service has been developed and published.</p>
            <p eId="para_4422">FÁS and VEC community employment joint literacy programmes are being expanded to all regions. These programmes enable participants on FÁS-funded community employment to be released half-time from their work experience programme to avail of intensive literacy tuition by the vocational education committees. A national referral directory on adult literacy services has been published and disseminated showing where services are located, what options are offered and the contact points and phone numbers.</p>
            <p eId="para_4423">My Department commissioned a number of TV series in literacy awareness and tuition for adults. They were broadcast by RTE One in the years 2000 to 2005. Each series was supplemented by a national freefone helpline provided by the National Adult Literacy Agency and learner workbooks and resource packs. Videos of the series were sent free to literacy schemes, public libraries, training centres and video outlets.</p>
            <p eId="para_4424">A number of tutors have been trained to provide literacy training in the workplace. The programme is available to local authority outdoor staff nationwide. There are also successful workplace literacy programmes in two hospitals and a trade union. In 2005, FÁS was allocated €2 million for workplace literacy measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_4425">An assessment framework for the adult literacy service has been developed in order to bring national consistency and objective standards into the initial diagnosis of a learner's starting points and subsequent progress.

The local distribution of funds provided by my Department for community education is undertaken by the VECs.</p>

            <p eId="para_4429">The school to which the Deputy refers was awarded designated disadvantaged status under the disadvantaged areas scheme in 1994. Under this scheme the school benefits from the services of a home-school-community liaison teacher post and each year is in receipt of additional supplementary capitation at the rate of €38.09 per pupil and a refund of the television licence fee. Schools included in the disadvantaged areas scheme in 1994 were included for capitation grant purposes only and were not allocated a permanent disadvantaged concessionary post.</p>
            <p eId="para_4430">Since 2001, the Giving Children an Even Break programme subsumes the previous process of designation of schools that serve areas of educational disadvantage and my Department's approach is now refined to ensure that individual at risk pupils are targeted. Rather than the old method of designating additional schools, under this scheme my Department provides support that is commensurate with the levels of concentration in schools of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school-leaving. The school to which the Deputy refers receives additional financial resources to provide educational supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils and retained its entitlements as a designated disadvantaged school.</p>
            <p eId="para_4431">The recommended guideline for the maximum class size for schools that are designated disadvantaged is 29:1. When a designated disadvantaged school exceeds this guideline an additional mainstream teaching post, referred to as a maximum class size post, is sanctioned by my Department. The school referred to by the Deputy has a maximum class size post.</p>
            <p eId="para_4432">A key element of DEIS, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, the new action plan for educational inclusion, is the putting in place of a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage in our primary and second level schools for the purposes of qualifying for resources, both human and financial, according to the degree of disadvantage experienced. This standardised system will replace all of the existing arrangements for targeting schools for participation in initiatives to address disadvantage. As a result of the identification process, approximately 600 primary schools, comprising 300 urban or town and 300 rural, and 150 second level schools will be included in a new school support programme, SSP. The SSP will bring together and build upon a number of existing interventions for schools and school clusters and communities with a concentrated level of educational disadvantage. Existing schemes and programmes will be integrated into the school support programme on a phased basis in the implementation period.</p>
            <p eId="para_4433">We anticipate being in a position to notify participating schools of the outcome of the ongoing identification process by the end of the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_4456">It is important from the outset to emphasise that the Traveller community is entitled to the same education provision as all others. In addition, to assist members of the Traveller community to successfully access educational services there are a number of special provisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_4457">At departmental level, a high level official co-ordinates provision of education for Travellers. An advisory committee on Traveller education was established as a direct result of a recommendation in the 1995 report of the task force on the Traveller community. A national education officer for Travellers, appointed in 1992, identifies the educational needs of Travellers, provides advice on policy and educational provision and actively promotes the integration of provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_4458">The Department's regional office service has, since March 2005, taken over responsibility for managing and supporting the visiting teacher service for Traveller education. This service consists of 40 visiting teacher posts. The visiting teachers are located through the country and, in 2004-05, worked with approximately 8,000 Traveller pupils and their parents and with pre-schools, primary and post-primary schools to assist in maximising participation and attainment levels and to promote an interculturally inclusive education for all.</p>
            <p eId="para_4459">At local level there are 45 pre-schools for Travellers located throughout the country. There are over 500 resource teacher for Traveller, RTT, posts in primary schools throughout the country. At post-primary level, each school which has Traveller students enrolled is provided with an additional 1.5 ex-quota teaching hours per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_4460">Primary schools with an RTT are provided with an enhanced capitation grant for each Traveller pupil enrolled. At post-primary, a supplementary capitation grant is available for each Traveller student enrolled.</p>
            <p eId="para_4461">Traveller pupils have the same entitlements to school transport as other children attending primary and post-primary education. In addition, in special circumstances, Traveller children are provided with special transport, where deemed necessary, and are included in programmes which aim to combat disadvantage, for example, the home-school-community liaison scheme and school completion programme. They will be included in the provision under the action plan for educational inclusion, DEIS, which was announced earlier this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_4462">There is one special primary special school for Travellers and three junior education centres for Travellers. To cater for the needs of Travellers aged 15 years and upwards there are 33 senior Traveller training centres located throughout the country. These centres provide a programme of general education, vocational training, work experience, guidance, counselling and psychological services. Approximately 10% of students at these centres are from the settled community.</p>
            <p eId="para_4463">Travellers have access to mainstream adult and further and higher education in the same manner as others. For example, Travellers may choose from mainstream literacy provision or they may attend Traveller specific literacy programmes which 19 VECs provide.</p>
            <p eId="para_4464">In the education equality initiative, administered by the further education section, one of the 18 projects targeted at educationally disadvantaged adults was a leadership skills for Traveller women initiative in Letterkenny, County Donegal. This initiative targeted urban and rural Traveller women in Donegal.</p>
            <p eId="para_4465">The number of Travellers in third level is low. To help improve enrolment of Travellers in third level the National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education has identified Travellers as a target group as it implements its Achieving Equity of Access to Higher Education in Ireland, Action Plan 2005-07.</p>
            <p eId="para_4466">In 2002, the Department published guidelines on Traveller education in primary schools and guidelines on traveller education in second level schools. These guidelines highlight the Department's policy on integration, give information on Traveller culture and provide advice on responding to the educational needs of the Traveller students. In May this year, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment published guidelines on intercultural education in primary schools. This publication, with the guidelines on Traveller education in primary and second level schools, will provide information and help for schools to increase their understanding of diversity. The NCCA is due to publish guidelines on intercultural education for post-primary schools in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_4467">The Department is about to publish a report of a survey of Traveller education provision. This survey, undertaken by the inspectorate, evaluated provision in a number of primary and post-primary schools. The report will provide recommendations on policies and strategies that will facilitate schools in enhancing the education provision for Travellers at a national level.</p>
            <p eId="para_4468">I am expecting a report on the recommendations for a five year Traveller education strategy early in the new year. This report spans the full spectrum of lifelong learning from pre-school to adult and further education.</p>
            <p eId="para_4469">The needs of the Traveller community are a high priority for me and the recommendations of the survey of Traveller education provision and the report on the recommendations for a five year Traveller education strategy, which are imminent, are evidence of the importance which my Department and I attach to ensuring meeting the educational needs of Travellers is given high priority.</p>

            <p eId="para_4477">There are a number of activities under way which will inform any review of the weighting given to the various assessment components in Irish in the junior certificate and the leaving certificate examinations. The inspectorate of the Department has carried out an evaluation of the teaching and learning of Irish in the junior cycle in 10% of schools and a report on the findings will be published in 2006. In addition, the Department has invited the Council of Europe to carry out an analysis of language education in Ireland. Irish is one of the specific areas for consideration in this process and a report is expected in 2006. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, is also carrying out a review of languages in the post-primary curriculum and this includes a focus on Irish.</p>
            <p eId="para_4478">As the Deputy will be aware, I am anxious to have more emphasis placed on oral Irish. I have already asked the NCCA to make recommendations to me in this regard as one of its next steps in developing its proposals for senior cycle reform.</p>

        the number of primary and secondary schools offering the Stay Safe programme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_707">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_4480">An initial one day in-service training seminar on the Stay Safe programme has been provided for all primary schools. Since the programme was introduced, 99.7% of primary schools have participated in this training. Approximately, 80%-85% of primary schools are teaching the programme to their students. The issue of child protection and ensuring that all children in every primary and post-primary school are aware of child protection issues are high priority areas for the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_4481">The Stay Safe programme is a personal safety programme for children. It is designed to give children the knowledge and necessary skills to help them deal with potentially abusive or threatening situations. However, it is also recognised that the programme must cover those individuals closely involved with children on a daily basis: parents-guardians and teachers. To this end, professional in-service courses for teachers and parent awareness seminars have been put in place at individual school level. This is in addition to the teaching of a personal safety skills programme to pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_4482">The training of teachers, parents and boards of management in the Stay Safe programme and the development of guidelines and procedures for a school policy on child protection is provided by a network of 31 regionally based teachers who are available to the programme on a part-time basis. This support supplements the assistance provided by the Department of Health and Children which maintains an administrative office for the Stay Safe programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4483">Although it should be noted that the Stay Safe programme is not mandatory, the teaching of the overall issue of child protection is now an integral element of the subject of social, personal and health education which is part of the primary curriculum taught in every school. The introduction of SPHE as a subject on the revised primary school curriculum, combined with the implementation of the national child protection guidelines, Children First, gave an additional impetus to the Stay Safe programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4484">It is a priority of the Department to ensure a high level of awareness and necessary skills to address child protection issues, which includes the implementation of the Stay Safe programme, is maintained in all schools. For this reason, the Department will continue to support the promotion of child protection within the context of the social, personal and health education curriculum.</p>
            <p eId="para_4485">At post-primary level, social, personal and health education is a required subject in the junior certificate programme since September 2003. SPHE is provided in ten modules, including one on personal safety. Learning outcomes for students include to be able to recognise situations in which personal safety might be threatened; to have a greater awareness of safety-enhancing behaviours and to have a knowledge of help agencies and how to contact them. In addition, skills associated with staying safe are addressed in other modules such as communication skills, relationships and sexuality, influences and decisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_4486">Schools are assisted in the implementation of SPHE by the SPHE support service which was established in 2000. A comprehensive in-service programme for teachers of SPHE is offered and approximately 1,400 teachers attend every year. In addition, extensive school-based support is offered. Schools are provided with multiple copies of the SPHE curriculum and teacher guidelines, together with an SPHE handbook advising on good practice and classroom resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_4487">As further support to post-primary schools in the area of child safety and protection, the implementation of the Department's child protection guidelines was facilitated by the regional development officers of the SPHE support service and the relationships and sexuality co-ordinator. The SPHE support service of the Department with assistance from the Health Service Executive designed a one day in-service for designated liaison persons and deputy DLPs in post-primary schools to brief DLPs on the guidelines and their role. A total of 38 one day in-service workshops were offered during the 2004-05 school year in collaboration with the education and support centres.</p>
            <p eId="para_4488">To accommodate the schools that did not participate, 18 further workshops were organised through the education centre network in the autumn of 2005. These schools were invited to one of the planned autumn workshops and the invitation was supported by a circular from the Department in September 2005. Approximately 90% of post-primary schools have availed of the in-service programme. It is estimated that about 70, 10%, schools may not have availed of it. It is the intention of the Department to write to these schools when they have been identified with the assistance of the education centres.</p>
            <p eId="para_4489">In addition, the Department funded an additional resource of telephone line support through the respective school management bodies. The Department, with assistance from the HSE, also facilitated the development of an A to Z resource pack of materials for staff briefings in child protection issues. As a follow-up, the Department has issued a circular to schools advising them of a second day of in-service in 2006 and planning, in conjunction with the HSE, has started. The Department has also sent additional copies of the child protection guidelines to schools to ensure each school has a copy for all school personnel.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_4493">I propose to take Questions Nos. 423, 427 and 470 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4494">This Government is strongly committed to improving participation and achievement at every level of education. We have put the resources and supports in place to ensure there is a wide range of course options available in the further and higher education sectors for young people who wish to continue their studies after second level and for people returning to education later in life.</p>
            <p eId="para_4495">Post-leaving certificate, PLC, courses represent one such option. The Government's support for this hugely important sector is clear from the fact that we have increased the number of PLC places by 60% since 1996-97. The number of PLC places approved for 2005-06 is up by more than 1,600 on the 2004-05 level. The number of approved places in the sector now stands at 30,188. Government support for the sector is evident not only in the expansion of approved places and teachers, but also in the introduction of maintenance grants for students with effect from September 1998. Tuition fees for PLC courses are waived. The PLC maintenance grants scheme operates on the same basis as in higher education. There are nearly 8,000 PLC grant holders in 2005 and they will receive some €23 million in direct support.</p>
            <p eId="para_4496">Other developments funded by the Department of direct benefit to the PLC sector include the provision of national certification under the Further Education and Training Awards Council and the development of progression links with higher education in the institutes of technology. PLC students are included in the calculation of non-pay budgets issued to schools in respect of running costs. A supplemental non-pay grant towards running costs specifically for PLC schools is also payable and this will amount to €5.5 million in 2005. Government commitment to the sector, by reference to the resources applied in teachers' pay, non-pay running costs, student support and certification costs is very significant.</p>
            <p eId="para_4497">The McIver report contains 21 overarching recommendations, incorporating 91 sub-recommendations. Having regard to the number and scope of the recommendations in the report, extensive consultations have been held with management and staff interests with regard to such issues as the prioritisation of recommendations, the structural changes envisaged in the report, their implications and associated costs in the context of the overall provision of resources for further and adult education.</p>
            <p eId="para_4498">Active consideration is being given to all the issues involved. While this work is ongoing, extra investment has been provided in the 2006 Estimates to develop the PLC sector further and to improve supports for other aspects of further-adult education. The Estimates include provision for the cost of the extra 100 teaching posts being provided for the post-leaving certificate colleges in the current academic year. They also provide for an increase of 19% in the VTOS non-pay grant in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_4499">The Government has shown a sustained determination to expand and improve further and adult education in recent years. We believe strongly in the value of this sector and will continue to prioritise it for resources and supports in the years ahead.</p>

            <p eId="para_4501">Under the terms of the third level student support schemes, clause 7.6 of the higher education grants scheme, maintenance grants are not payable to candidates who already hold an undergraduate degree and are pursuing a second undergraduate degree. Similarly, tuition fees are not payable in respect of a second period of college attendance at the same level.</p>
            <p eId="para_4502">The student referred to by the Deputy already holds an arts degree and is, therefore, ineligible for a higher education grant and is also unable to benefit under the free fees initiative in respect of any further studies at undergraduate level. As the rules governing the schemes are of general application, exceptions cannot be made in individual instances.</p>
            <p eId="para_4503">Tax relief, is however, available in respect of undergraduate fees paid in publicly funded colleges here and in other EU member states, as well as in private colleges in the State. This relief applies at the standard rate of tax and is available to full-time students and part-time postgraduate students. Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from local tax offices.</p>

            <p eId="para_4511">The Deputy will be aware that at the start of this year I established a task force on student behaviour. I have been particularly impressed with the ability of the task force to focus on the core issues. The task force has indicated to me that it is on target to produce a final report and detailed recommendations by the end of this year. I was greatly encouraged by the interim report and look forward to receiving the final report and its recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_4512">In establishing the task force on student behaviour I stressed that this would be no talking shop and that the issue will be addressed. Providing the best possible learning environment at second level is important, as is the need to ensure a positive atmosphere in all of our schools and to have effective procedures in place to deal with negative student behaviour where it occurs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4513">I expect to receive the final report of the task force by the end of this month and will arrange for its publication in due course. I have made the determination to act very clear by providing €2 million in the 2006 Estimates to ensure we can begin implementing its recommendations straight away. I am sure this will be strongly welcomed by second level teachers who know they have my support in creating the best possible environment in which to nurture the talents of all of their students.</p>

            <p eId="para_4771">The Deputy should be aware that significant improvements have been made in the pupil-teacher ratio and in average class size in recent years at primary level. The most recent figure available for average class size at primary level refers to the 2004-05 school year, when the average class size was 23.9, down from 26.6 in 1996-97. The pupil-teacher ratio at primary level which includes all the teachers, including learning support-resource teachers, has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.1:1 in 2004-05.</p>
            <p eId="para_4772">As I indicated in the statement on the recently published Estimates, I have secured sufficient funding to provide even smaller classes in our primary schools in the next school year. The Minister for Finance has committed to a further reduction in class size in the following year.</p>
            <p eId="para_4773">The system for allocating teachers to primary schools is based on ensuring an overall maximum class of 29 in each school. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_4774">To ensure openness and transparency in the system an independent appeal board is now in place to decide on any appeals on mainstream staffing. The criteria under which an appeal can be made are set out in Department primary circular 19/02 which is also available on the Department's website.</p>

            <p eId="para_4776">The information in the format requested by the Deputy is not readily available. However, on PE facilities in primary schools generally, the PE curriculum has been designed on the basis that facilities in schools may vary. Many primary schools have a general purpose room and practically all schools have outdoor play areas which are used for teaching different aspects of the physical education programme. In addition, many schools use adjacent local facilities, including public parks, playing fields and swimming pools.</p>
            <p eId="para_4777">The Department fully recognises the key role of physical exercise within the school environment and continues to respond to the need to improve PE facilities. The provision of such facilities is an integral part of the design process for new school buildings or where an existing school building is undergoing major refurbishment. New PE equipment such as balancing benches and gym mats are funded as part of any major building programme. In addition to this, the school planning section of the Department is working proactively with some local authorities to explore the possibility of the development of school provision in tandem with the development of community facilities. This enhanced co-operation has the effect of minimising the Department's land requirements and thus reducing site costs while at the same time providing local communities with new schools with enhanced facilities such as sports facilities, playing pitches etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_4778">The Deputy may also be aware that the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism is undertaking a national audit of sports facilities in communities around the country, which will also provide useful information on facilities available to schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_4818">Schools with an enrolment of up to 298 pupils must satisfy the following criteria: minimum increase of 25 pupils on the enrolment of the previous year and the enrolment must be five or more above the required appointment figure for the post sought. Schools with an enrolment of 299 pupils and over must have a minimum increase of 30 pupils on the enrolment of the previous year and the enrolment must be ten or more above the required appointment figure for the post sought.</p>

Schools seeking the appointment of the second mainstream class teacher projecting a minimum numerical increase on 30 September of 25 pupils on the previous 30 September enrolment are not required to meet the stipulated excess number of five pupils on the appointment figure. The minimum projected enrolment of 50 pupils must be achieved to secure a second mainstream class teacher. Schools seeking the appointment of more than one developing school post must meet the requirement of a minimum numerical increase of 25 or 30 pupils, as appropriate, for the first developing school post depending on their enrolment on 30 September of the previous year. The stipulated excess number of five or ten pupils on the appointment figure must be met for each post sought thereafter.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_4823">The funding my Department provides for Educate Together as a school management body is on a par with that provided for Foras Patrúnachta na Scoileanna Lán-Ghaeilge, the Church of Ireland Board of Education, the Islamic Board of Education and the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education. However, following discussions with Educate Together my Department has provided additional funding for Educate Together in 2005 to meet the immediate issues of concern to that body. The amount provided in 2005 was €81,133. As I indicated in my statement on the publication of the Estimates for 2006, extra funding will be made available to the primary school management bodies, including Educate Together, and I will be in touch with them in the coming weeks about this.</p>
            <p eId="para_4824">In accordance with the provisions of the Education Act 1998, as Minister, I am obliged to have regard to the need to reflect the diversity of educational services provided in the State. Applying this provision to the development of multi-denominational education, at primary level, my Department has supported the establishment of a significant number of new multi-denominational schools in recent years. Of the 24 new schools granted provisional recognition in the past three years alone, 12 are multi-denominational. At post-primary level, the requirement for multi-denominational education is met by the State sector through non-designated vocational education committee schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_4825">To underpin the establishment of new schools, my Department has made a number of changes in recent years, which have assisted patron bodies in the provision of accommodation. One of these changes, which was strongly welcomed by the patron body for multi-denominational schools, was the abolition of the local contribution to the building costs for State-owned school buildings, which had cost up to €63,000 per school. Other innovations include the development of the design and build model to provide permanent accommodation much faster such as in the case of the new multi-denominational school in Griffeen Valley, Lucan, County Dublin, which was designed and built in less than 13 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_4826">Many multi-denominational primary schools are established in areas of rapidly expanding population growth. School building projects in these areas are assigned a band 1 rating under the published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects. This is the highest band rating, which results in the delivery of permanent accommodation in the shortest timeframe achievable. These measures are a strong indication of my Department's commitment to supporting an educational diversity agenda, including multi-denominational education provision. It will continue to do so as part of its own statutory obligations and in the context of the national development plan, which is structured to support the development of all educational sectors regardless of ethos.</p>

            <p eId="para_4838">All primary and post-primary schools in County Meath have access to psychological assessments for their pupils through the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, or the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, SCPA, administered by NEPS. Schools that do not have a NEPS psychologist assigned to them may avail of the SCPA. This scheme allows the school to commission assessments from members of a panel of psychologists in private practice approved by NEPS. The fees for these assessments are paid directly by NEPS to the psychologist. Details of this process and the conditions that apply to the scheme are available on my Department's website. As of October 2005, NEPS provides a dedicated service for 61 out of 107 primary schools, 57%, and 17 out of 18 post-primary, 94%, schools in County Meath. The balance of schools may access psychological assessment for their pupils through the SCPA as set out above. NEPS also provides assistance for all schools in the event of critical incidents, regardless of whether they have a NEPS psychologist assigned to them, and processes applications on behalf of students with specific learning disabilities for reasonable accommodations in certificate examinations. The number of NEPS psychologists has increased almost threefold, from 43 on establishment to 123. The Public Appointments Service recently established new recruitment panels for the service. Regional panels are in place and the Department is in the process of appointing psychologists. Priority will be given to filling vacancies in areas of greatest need.</p>

            <p eId="para_4840">Individual school management authorities are not required to report to my Department on incidences of bullying. The information requested by the Deputy, therefore, is not available in my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_4841">I am acutely aware of the issue of bullying in schools and my Department has in place a multifaceted strategy to tackle the issue. The education of students in both primary and post-primary schools about anti-bullying behaviour is a central part of the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum. SPHE is a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools. The SPHE curriculum provides for the development of personal and social skills, including self-awareness, respect for others, self-esteem and communication skills, all of which are important elements in addressing the issue of bullying. In primary education, the issue of bullying is addressed in the SPHE curriculum in the strand, Myself and Others, from infant classes onwards. In second level education, the issue of bullying is addressed from first year onwards in the SPHE curriculum at junior cycle, in the module, Belonging and Integrating.</p>
            <p eId="para_4842">My Department, in its guidelines on countering bullying behaviour in schools, has provided a national framework within which individual school management authorities may meet their responsibilities for implementing effective school-based policies to counter bullying. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school. Each school is required to have in place a policy, which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the framework of an overall school code of behaviour and discipline. Such a code, properly devised and implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools. The school development planning initiative plays an important role in supporting schools to raise awareness of the need for anti-bullying measures. In addition, my Department funds a number of support services and pilot initiatives which provide direct assistance for schools in dealing with the issue of bullying.</p>

            <p eId="para_4852">I propose to take Questions Nos. 448 to 453, inclusive, and 461, 468 and 469 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4853">The information regarding the number of special education teachers in County Meath in the years 2002 to 2005 is not readily available within my Department and it would take an inordinate time to compile. However, at primary level, approximately 5,000 teachers in our primary schools work directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to fewer than 1,500 in 1998. One out of every five primary school teachers works specifically with children with special needs. At second level, approximately 1,628 whole-time equivalent additional teachers are in place to support pupils with special educational needs. This compares with approximately 200 teachers in 1998. In addition, 532 whole-time equivalent learning support teachers are in our second level schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_4854">In recent years the number of teaching posts allocated to cater for pupils with special needs at post-primary level has increased as follows:</p>

            <p eId="para_4870">Approximately 261 whole-time special needs assistants, SNAs, in primary and second level schools in County Meath support children with special needs. Applications for special needs teaching and SNA supports are dealt with by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, which processes all applications for such support from schools and communicates the decisions directly to the schools. Where it has been established additional SNA posts are required, these posts are continuing to be allocated on an ongoing basis. The Deputy may be aware that the Government has put in place unprecedented support for children with special needs. Since 1998, the number of SNAs has increased from under 300 to more than 6,000 nationally. I am confident the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring all children with special educational needs, including those in the counties referred to by the Deputy, receive the support they require when and where they require it.</p>

            <p eId="para_4885">My Department does not have a direct function in assessing speech and language requirements in national schools. The provision of speech therapy services is a matter for the Health Service Executive, HSE, and funding is provided to the HSE for such purposes. The Deputy may be aware that the National Council for Special Education, which became operational on 1 January 2005, now processes applications for special educational needs supports, including requests for supports for pupils with speech and language requirements. The council has a key role in the development and delivery of services for persons with special educational needs, including children with speech and language disorders. The council has a local area presence through a network of 71 special educational needs organisers, SENOs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4886">Pupils may be supported in an integrated setting in a mainstream school with resource teaching hours. A number of special classes for children with specific speech and language disorders have also been established. Such classes are established where a need has been identified and supported by up-to-date psychological and speech therapy reports. Each class caters for a maximum of seven children and each class requires the services of a speech therapist. The speech therapy service is provided by the relevant health service executive. There are currently in excess of 60 speech and language classes in primary schools nationally. Three of these classes are based in County Meath including two classes in Trim and one in Dunboyne.</p>

            <p eId="para_4892">I propose to take Questions Nos. 463 to 466, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4893">My Department's main role in the area of early childhood education focuses on preschool provision for children from disadvantaged areas, for Traveller children and for those with special needs. Research has indicated that high quality early education, prior to entry into formal schooling, leads to lasting benefits that persist throughout life and that early childhood education is particularly beneficial for children who are disadvantaged and for children with special needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4894">My Department currently funds 46 preschool classes for Traveller children. In addition, a total of 1,680 places are provided for in early start preschool centres at an annual cost of some €5 million. In the special needs sector there are currently 14 preschool classes for children with autism located throughout the country. In addition to this ten stand-alone autism facilities that provide an applied behavioural analysis, ABA, model of response to children with autism cater for a number of children of preschool age. My Department has also sanctioned the establishment of a preschool for six children with hearing impairment on a pilot basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_4895">The new action plan for educational inclusion, DEIS, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, which I launched in May this year, aims to concentrate early childhood education actions on those children, aged from three up to school enrolment, who will subsequently attend the 150 urban-town primary schools, participating in the new school support programme, and identified as serving the most disadvantaged communities. The early childhood education actions under the new plan will be well targeted and my Department will work in partnership with other Departments and agencies with a view to meeting the overall care and education needs of the children involved in an integrated way. A strong emphasis will be placed on adding value to the work of other providers by embedding quality early learning within child care provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_4896">The bulk of preschool places are financed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which has provided unprecedented levels of funding for child care in recent years under the equal opportunities child care programme, EOCP, 2000-06. Funding of over €15 million has been approved for County Meath to date under this programme. These grants, when fully expended, will lead to the creation of almost 1,700 new child care places and are supporting a further 650 existing child care places in County Meath.</p>

        if, in view of the dangerous circumstances in which pupils and teachers in one-teacher schools find themselves, she will appoint an additional staff member to a school (details supplied) in County Tipperary and to the other 19 one-teacher primary schools in the country; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_4903">The mainstream teacher allocation of all primary schools, including one-teacher schools, is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The staffing schedule is outlined in a circular which is issued annually to all primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_4904">Under the current staffing schedule for primary schools, an enrolment of 12 recognised pupils at the end of September 2004 is required for the employment of a principal and one mainstream classroom teacher. However, the provisional enrolment figures, which have been submitted to the Department, indicate that a minimum of 12 recognised pupils were enrolled in a number of schools which currently have one teacher and, on this basis, the schools concerned would qualify for the appointment of a mainstream teacher in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_4905">Following detailed consideration of the position of these schools, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, as an entirely exceptional matter, I have decided that a mainstream class teacher may be appointed in those schools immediately rather than with effect from 1 September 2006 which is the position which would normally apply in these circumstances. The boards of management of the schools concerned are being notified accordingly. A detailed review of the position of the schools with less than 12 recognised pupils is being undertaken and will be completed as speedily as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_4906">With regard to the particular school referred to by the Deputy, the position is that the enrolment in the school at the end of September 2004 was 14 and, on this basis, the school has a staffing of a principal and one mainstream class teacher for the 2005-06 school year.</p>

            <p eId="para_4919">At an extraordinary general meeting of ITE, held on 18 July 2003, the company agreed to initiate a process of voluntary liquidation. This decision was a matter for the members in accordance with their memorandum and articles of association and relevant company law. I understand that a meeting of the executive committee of ITE on 5 December 2003 agreed a timetable for the appointment of a liquidator, who was subsequently appointed on 9 January 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_4920">My Department has given a commitment to provide every assistance to the company in giving effect to its decision, in partnership with the staff of the institute, and has been working closely with the liquidator since his appointment in this regard. This includes exploring possible arrangements for the continuation of certain research activities previously carried out by the institute and, in the interests of assisting with an orderly wind-up, facilitating appropriate redeployment or other appropriate arrangements for staff in line with general public service policy in these matters and subject to agreement with the Department of Finance. A total of seven staff remain employed by ITE. The entitlements of those employees for whom appropriate redeployment arrangements are not made will be determined in accordance with the terms of their contracts.</p>
            <p eId="para_4921">There are a number of projects and publications to be finalised in ITE. As part of the completion of the liquidation process the liquidator is also progressing these matters. In early 2005 the liquidator advertised for a researcher to assist in a specific project which was ongoing at the institute. A researcher was appointed in late March and that contract will expire in December 2005 and will not be renewed. There are no proposals to advertise for a further researcher. While no date has yet been formally set for completion of the liquidation, I understand that considerable progress has been made in recent months towards resolving a number of complex issues which have arisen and I am hopeful that early in the new year it will be possible to set a date for completion of the liquidation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4922">From 1 January 2005 to 5 December 2005 a total of €100,000 has been paid to the liquidator of which €50,200 relates to the work carried out for 2004.</p>

            <p eId="para_4924">Section 8 of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002, provides that applications may be made to the redress board within three years of the establishment of the board. This means that the statutory closing date for receipt of applications by the board is 15 December 2005. The board has made arrangements for applications to be received at its offices up to midnight on that date and it has placed advertisements in the media recently highlighting this arrangement.</p>
            <p eId="para_4925">Under section 5(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Act, the redress board is required to make all reasonable efforts through public advertisement or otherwise to inform potential applicants of the board’s functions. Over the past three years, the board has conducted an extensive advertising and publicity campaign which, as well as giving general information on the redress scheme, has specifically highlighted the closing date for making applications to the board. Advertisements have been placed in all the national broadsheet, tabloid and main provincial newspapers, on RTE 1 television, Network 2, Sky 1, Sky News, TV3 and TG4, and on all national and major local radio stations. The board also has had a website in operation for three years providing regular newsletters, media releases and general information on the redress scheme, including reference to the closing date for making applications to the board.</p>
            <p eId="para_4926">For the benefit of Irish emigrants resident in the UK, the board held 12 information days in the UK in 2004 and placed advertisements in the Sunday newspapers, daily newspapers and other publications there aimed specifically at the Irish community. It has also distributed 7,500 leaflets and 7,500 pamphlets to the network of Irish societies in the UK.</p>
            <p eId="para_4927">For persons resident in other countries, the board has made arrangements with the Department of Foreign Affairs for information on the redress scheme, including the closing date for applications, to be sent to Irish embassies abroad requesting them to distribute this information to all relevant Irish organisations with whom they have contact.</p>
            <p eId="para_4928">Last month, the board placed additional advertisements in the main Irish newspapers, selected UK publications and Irish publications in the U.S.A. and Australia drawing particular attention to the closing date for applications to the board.</p>
            <p eId="para_4929">The extensive advertising and publicity campaign conducted by the board in relation to the redress scheme has ensured that the board and its activities retain a high public profile. I am satisfied, therefore, that the board has made all reasonable efforts to publicise the scheme to potential applicants and draw attention to the closing date for receipt of applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_4930">My Department has provided funding for victim support groups at home and in the UK, including funding for five outreach centres in the UK, to facilitate the provision of information and advice on the redress scheme and other Government initiatives for survivors of child abuse.</p>

            <p eId="para_4991">The person referred to by the Deputy was granted restricted recognition by my Department in 1999. Restricted recognition entitles a teacher to teach in special schools and classes and in resource teaching posts for children with low incidence special educational needs in mainstream schools. I understand that this person has been teaching as a resource teacher in a primary school since September 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_4992">As the Deputy may be aware, my Department introduced the general allocation system for allocating resources to schools for children with learning support and high incidence special educational needs from September of this year. As the posts created under this new system, LS-RT posts, involve an element of learning support, teachers taking up such posts must be fully qualified and probated, as has always been the case for learning support posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_4993">However, in order to ensure that teachers with restricted recognition who held full-time resource teaching posts in schools prior to the introduction of the general allocation system would not lose those posts under the new system, my Department has put interim arrangements in place allowing such teachers to fill general allocation posts for this school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_4994">The eligibility of teachers with restricted recognition to access LS-RT posts going forward is currently being considered by my Department in conjunction with the management bodies and the INTO. Discussions have already taken place on this matter and it is hoped that decisions regarding their eligibility for such posts will be made early in 2006 and notified to schools well in advance of the 2006 to 2007 school year.</p>

            <p eId="para_4997">The scheme is not designed to facilitate parents who choose to send their children to a post-primary centre outside of the catchment area in which they reside. However, children who are fully eligible for transport to the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside may apply for transport on a concessionary basis to a post-primary centre outside of their own catchment area — otherwise known as catchment boundary transport. These children can only be facilitated if spare seats are available on the bus after all other eligible children travelling to a post-primary school in their own catchment have been catered for. Such children will have to make their own way either to the catchment boundary or to the nearest pick up point within that catchment area.</p>
            <p eId="para_4998">My Department understands from the transport liaison officer for County Cork that following a re-organisation of transport services in the catchment area concerned, all fully eligible pupils, and the vast majority of pupils who applied for concessionary catchment boundary transport to the school referred to in the details supplied were accommodated this school year.</p>

            <p eId="para_5005">There are currently no plans to include a specific module on trades unions in the junior certificate civic, social and political education, CSPE, syllabus. This is because the potential already exists for teachers to incorporate teaching about trades unions into the course of study they undertake with students. The CSPE syllabus is a concept-based syllabus with highly flexible units of study. The concepts for study include those of democracy, rights and responsibilities, human dignity and interdependence. The units of study include in unit 1, the individual and citizenship; in unit 2, the community; and unit 3, the State — Ireland. Both these concepts and units of study allow the teacher to take a thematic approach towards teaching and learning in these areas. The theme can involve trades unions, community development, Government, etc. The course was designed in this way to avoid a topic-led approach dominating the teaching of the subject, which was a criticism often levelled at civics as a subject in the past.</p>
            <p eId="para_5006">The role of trade unions and industrial relations issues, together with the rights and responsibilities of workers is featured specifically in the vocational preparation and guidance aspects of the leaving certificate applied programme. The role of trade unions, industrial relations, handling conflict and human resources issues ar also features of the business syllabus at senior cycle. In addition, a resource pack for schools entitled SWAY — Skills Work and Youth — has been developed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in collaboration with the education sector, FÁS, IBEC and trade unions from abroad for use in the transition year, leaving certificate applied, leaving certificate vocational programme and guidance programmes in schools. The pack aims to promote an awareness among students of what is expected in the workplace, the need for lifelong learning in the context of rapidly changing needs, the role of trade unions in a national and European context, and the importance of recognised qualifications to a successful career.</p>

International Civil Aviation Organisation standards and recommendations in regard to obstacle limitation surfaces for airports as well as considerations in regard to public safety in the vicinity of the aerodrome were taken into account in determining the size and shape of the red safety areas at Casement Aerodrome. The Snow report prepared in 1999 recommended in the case of Casement Aerodrome that the approach areas be retained for security and safety reasons because of the large proportion of training, including single-engine or solo flights by inexperienced pilots, carried out at the aerodrome.

            <p eId="para_5023">My Department's function in regard to Travellers is to ensure an adequate legislative and financial framework is in place within which local authorities, relevant voluntary bodies, and Traveller organisations may provide, or be assisted in the provision of, management and maintenance of accommodation for Travellers.</p>
            <p eId="para_5024">The legislative framework for the provision of accommodation for Travellers is set out in the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998. That Act requires the establishment of structures, at departmental and local level, which support the improved provision of accommodation for Travellers. These structures include the establishment of the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee, the role of which is to provide me with advice on all aspects of the provision of accommodation for Travellers. This committee is composed of representatives of my Department and the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform as well as representatives of both councillors and officials from local authorities and representatives of Travellers and Traveller support groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_5025">At local level the 1998 Act requires that local authorities adopt and implement Traveller accommodation programmes and establish local traveller accommodation consultative committees. The first Traveller accommodation programmes covered the period 2000 to 2004. All relevant local authorities have now adopted new Traveller accommodation programmes for the period 2005 to 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_5026">In terms of financial provision, my Department provides 100% of the capital funding required by local authorities to meet the accommodation needs of Travellers. This funding is provided through the local authority housing programmes and also in the form of a separate allocation for provision and refurbishment of Traveller specific accommodation. Funding is also provided to support local authorities with the costs of the management and maintenance of Traveller specific accommodation and with the employment of housing welfare officers and social workers to provide appropriate services to Travellers in regard to accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5027">Under the first Traveller accommodation programmes, a total of €130 million was expended on the provision of new Traveller specific accommodation and on the refurbishment of existing Traveller specific accommodation to modern standards. It is expected that expenditure on Traveller specific accommodation in 2005 will be higher than in previous years.</p>
            <p eId="para_5028">Substantial progress was made during the first Traveller accommodation in providing Travellers with improved access to accommodation. Under these programmes a total of 1,371 additional families have been accommodated in permanent accommodation and the number of families on unauthorised sites has been reduced from 1,207 at the start of the programmes to 610 at the end of 2004. While this progress is welcome it is clear that further improvements are necessary. I look to the new Traveller accommodation programmes to deliver on that improvement.</p>

            <p eId="para_5056">Houses sold under the various affordable housing schemes at a discount from market value contain a clawback provision, which is necessary to ensure that there is no short-term profiteering on the resale of a house. In the traditional circumstances where local authorities were the sole supplier of mortgage finance for affordable housing, authorities registered the clawback as a charge on the mortgage deed or, in the case of shared ownership transactions, inserted it as a clause or condition in the lease. This allowed them as lenders to readily enforce the clawback.</p>
            <p eId="para_5057">Following extensive discussions with my Department, two of the main financial institutions have introduced schemes of mortgage financing for persons who wish to access affordable housing. These mortgage products were introduced consequent to agreement with the institutions on the rankings of the various charges, which included provision for a clawback as a charge on the property. Discussions are under way with several other leading private lenders with a view to initiating similar products.</p>
            <p eId="para_5058">Since the introduction of these mortgage products, some difficulties have been encountered by persons wishing to remortgage with the private lenders. It is reasonable for a local authority to allow remortgage through a private lender provided the clawback provision is fully protected and it would be a matter for the local authority in such cases to ensure that the clawback can be imposed as provided for in legislation. However, with a view to achieving a widely agreed solution for this kind of case, my Department is in communication with the private lenders about standardising arrangements. I hope that these will be finalised and put in place as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_5080">Local authorities and the Health Service Executive are responsible for meeting the accommodation and health care needs of homeless persons. The Government's integrated and preventative strategies on homelessness provide the framework within which the agencies fulfil these responsibilities. Under the terms of the integrated strategy, homeless fora attended by representatives of the statutory and voluntary homeless sectors were established at local authority level and the homeless action plans which were adopted under their aegis are being implemented. These developments have resulted in the provision of a wide range of additional accommodation and services for homeless persons.</p>
            <p eId="para_5081">Significant progress has been made in the Dublin area over the last number of years in providing for and improving services to homeless persons. Rough sleepers have been enabled to access emergency accommodation and homeless persons have been facilitated to move out of emergency accommodation into accommodation more suitable to their needs. Increased levels of day care facilities, together with specific provisions to meet the needs of homeless ex-offenders and people with addiction problems who are sleeping rough.</p>
            <p eId="para_5082">Rough sleeping is the extreme manifestation of homelessness and statutory and voluntary agencies work in close co-operation to minimise it. In Dublin, where the largest incidence of rough sleeping occurs, Dublin City Council operates a night bus service where clients are given access to accommodation and appropriate outreach services. This service, which originally operated as a cold weather response, now operates on a year-round basis. An online system to facilitate the prompt identification of vacant emergency accommodation on a nightly basis has recently been introduced by the Homeless Agency, with funding from my Department. This will ensure optimum use of the accommodation to meet the needs of rough sleepers. Rough sleeping initiatives also operate in the other main urban areas with specific measures put in place during colder weather as necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_5083">The continued implementation of a cold weather strategy in the Dublin area by the Homeless Agency with the co-operation of the voluntary service providers serves to minimise the risks posed during this time through the provision of additional shelter and services for rough sleepers. The statutory bodies continue to monitor the level and capacity of service required and seek to ensure that harm reduction measures are at an optimum level at all times.</p>
            <p eId="para_5084">The continued provision of adequate funding is of major importance. While the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons is the responsibility of local authorities, my Department recoups 90% of their expenditure in this area. In 2004, a total of €45.7 million was recouped to local authorities while the allocation for 2005 is €51 million. This brings to €240 million the total funding made available for this purpose since 2000. The Department of Health and Children has provided an additional €30.2 million in the same period to meet the care needs of homeless persons. The outcome of the review of the implementation of the homeless strategies and their associated local homeless action plans will inform future policy developments in this area.</p>

The implementation of local homeless action plans, in this case the action plan on homelessness for Dublin 2004 to 2006, Making it Home, is a matter for the relevant statutory agencies in the Dublin area.</p>
            <p eId="para_5089">With regard to accommodation, capital funding is available through my Department's capital assistance scheme to voluntary housing bodies providing accommodation to meet special housing needs, including accommodation for victims of domestic violence. My Department recoups to the local authorities 90% of their current expenditure on accommodation related costs arising in respect of homeless persons including, where appropriate, victims of domestic violence. The remaining 10% is provided from the revenue resources of the local authorities. Decisions on funding for accommodation of victims of domestic violence, including refuges and transitional accommodation, are matters for the local authority in whose area the accommodation is situated. Associated care costs are the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_5097">The Government's commitment to addressing the housing waiting lists is reflected in the 5% increase in the provision for social and affordable housing for 2006 in the recent Abridged Estimates Volume, AEV. This is the first step in the Estimates process and does not take account of any further adjustments, particularly with regard to capital provision, which may be announced on budget day. The 5% increase in the 2006 provision for housing announced in the AEV corresponds to an investment programme of €1.3 billion in 2006. This is a significant financial commitment and maintains the momentum of a sustained period of investment in housing in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_5098">Since 1997, over €7 billion in funding has been provided under a range of social and affordable housing programmes and at the end of this year that investment will have met the needs of some 100,000 households. The 2006 provision will reinforce this progress and it is anticipated that the needs of over 13,000 households will be met next year including some 5,500 completions under the main local authority programme. Some 1,850 units will be completed by the voluntary and co-operative sector and there will be a continued focus on the regeneration and delivery of some 3,000 units of affordable housing.</p>

            <p eId="para_5100">The Part V provisions are now fully operational in all local authorities and I am satisfied that they are contributing significantly to the provision of social and affordable housing. The manner to which local authorities avail of Part V arrangements for social and affordable housing is a matter to be determined by individual local authorities based on the housing needs of identified in their housing strategies. It is open, for example, to local authorities to specify in their housing strategies different percentages for the number of social and affordable housing that will be subject to Part V requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_5101">It is not intended that Part V should be the only mechanism for the provision of social housing. The main local authority housing construction programmes, along with voluntary and co-operative construction programmes, continue to be the major contributors to the national social rented housing stock. Taking account of new local authority housing, vacancies arising in existing houses and output under other social and affordable housing measures, I anticipate that the needs of in excess of 13,000 households will be met in 2005.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_5104">I propose to take Questions Nos. 518 and 519 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5105">Local authorities and the Health Service Executive are responsible for meeting the accommodation and health care needs of homeless persons. It is, therefore, a matter for individual authorities to determine the level of bed and breakfast accommodation to be provided, having regard to the need for such accommodation within their areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_5106">While the use of bed and breakfast accommodation is seen at present as essential for the provision of emergency accommodation, it is recognised that it is not suitable as a long-term solution to homeless accommodation and that its use should be phased out, particularly for families. I am concerned to ensure that high standards prevail in the operation of the sector and that it is used only as a short term response to homelessness. At the request of my Department, Dublin City Council, which is a major user of bed and breakfast accommodation, and the Homeless Agency are conducting an ongoing review of this type of accommodation. This has led to increased monitoring, improved co-ordination and better management practice within the Dublin area. The council is continuing to address the issue so that continuous improvement of services will be offered to those whose needs dictate that it is the most suitable type of accommodation for them at a particular point in time.</p>
            <p eId="para_5107">While the emphasis was initially on the provision of emergency accommodation options, there is now general agreement that there is sufficient emergency accommodation available for those who wish to avail of it and the emphasis must now move to more long term solutions. My Department recoups to local authorities 90% of their expenditure on the provision of accommodation related services for homeless persons, including those in move-on accommodation. In 2004, recoupment was made in respect of 586 move-on units.</p>
            <p eId="para_5108">In addition, if it is suitable in individual circumstances to do so, accommodation can be accessed for formerly homeless persons by means of social housing units provided directly by local authorities or voluntary bodies. Units can also be sourced in the private sector by users of homeless services themselves, by resettlement services provided by the statutory and voluntary services and by the housing access unit operated by Threshold on behalf of the Homeless Agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_5109">Renewed focus is now being placed on the provision of long term accommodation together with the supports necessary to enable homeless persons to move into independent living. Local authorities are being urged to address this issue both with regard to their own accommodation and in discussions with the voluntary sector active in the housing area. Initiatives currently being undertaken in a number of areas in terms of provision of tenancy sustainment services will assist in this process. I am confident that we will see a significant increase in assistance to homeless persons under these headings in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_5110">The funding available from my Department for recoupment to local authorities of costs incurred in the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons in 2005 amounts to €51 million. This brings to €240 million the total funding available from my Department for this purpose since the implementation of the integrated strategy in 2000. In addition, some €106 million was provided by the Department of Health and Children for care related services in the same period.</p>
