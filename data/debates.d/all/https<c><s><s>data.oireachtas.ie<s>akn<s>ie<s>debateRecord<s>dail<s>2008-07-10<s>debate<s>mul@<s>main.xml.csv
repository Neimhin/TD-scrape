#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the urgent need to have a full discussion on the failure of the Government to provide sufficient funds to cover the subvention needs of the elderly and disabled in nursing homes.  The increased nursing home charges imposed for 2008 are not being covered, causing serious grief and hardship to the most vulnerable.  Nursing homes must bear the increased cost of food, oil and other services the same as everybody else.  This issue must be dealt with before the Dáil rises.

It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 10 and 10a shall be decided without debate and that the Dáil shall adjourn forthwith on the conclusion of Question Time until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 24 September 2008.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20206	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	9	It appears the Government has something to hide.  It is leaking information, the latest instalment of which has been to RTE.  I searched in the Oireachtas Library and asked other media contacts but cannot find this document.  It seems the Department of Finance wants us to conclude our business today and only then will this document will be revealed.  That is no way to treat the House.

I also asked about the detailed report from the Department on the proposed budgetary changes.  We had many arguments yesterday about how the savings of €400 million for this year and €1 billion for next year can be found.  The issue is that while the Taoiseach said yesterday that tax revenues will be down by €3 billion next year, he has only told us where savings of €1 billion will come from.  We are entitled, as a democratic Parliament, to know the intentions of the Government in regard to the other €2 billion in savings that must be found in 2009.

There can be only one intervention from each party.  I am being perfectly fair.  There cannot be a second intervention, even from the Member who represented that party in the first instance.  The Tánaiste replied to the questions put by the Fine Gael Member and the Labour Party Member and I then asked whether the proposal was agreed.  I declared the question carried and nobody called a vote.

I welcome the fact that it has come before the House and will be approved.  This is something that has been going on for a long time, since the original victims’ commission was established in 1998 under the former Tánaiste, John Wilson.  Mr. Justice Hamilton and later Mr. Justice Barron presided over the investigation.  Much work has been done in both Houses of the Oireachtas on the matter and it is welcome that the motion is being transmitted to the House of Commons with a request for access to the relevant documents through a judicial figure.  I am concerned, however, that the motion will be taken without debate.  When we transmit the matter to the House of Commons its Members might ask how it came from the Dáil on the last sitting day without a debate but with the background information.  While there has been all-party agreement on it, I do not think we can do anything about it at present but we should debate the issue in the autumn.  I ask the Government Chief Whip and the Tánaiste if that can be agreed.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20206	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	53	No, it is definitely not agreed.  More than anyone else, the Ceann Comhairle will be aware that we are presiding over a period of extraordinary economic uncertainty.  Unemployment has risen faster in the past few months than in a whole generation.  We see prices in our shops which, as the Tánaiste admits, are 31% higher than in Northern Ireland.  We see the worst deterioration in the public finances in the history of the State and, in addition, access by air to this country is almost collapsing, while there is no back-up to deal with it.  This is no situation in which to adjourn the House until September without a facility to address these issues.  The adjournment is being sought by a Government that is sticking its head in the sand.  The debate we have had over the past two days has only the most tenuous connection to the serious economic challenges we face.  There is no strategy to address the decline in competitiveness, tackle unemployment or address inflation and its effect on families.  We expect people to agree to moderate pay agreements in the country's interest, but the Government is not putting in place a strategy in which we can have the confidence to manage our finances, protect families and build a strong economy.This is not a time to adjourn the House on the back of a debate that is being conducted without any proper documentation from the Government side.  The Government is clearly running for cover.  It reminds me of a cork bobbing helplessly in the ocean.  All we have heard from Ministers are bewildered mumblings that they are in control of our destiny, but they are not in control of what is happening.  Everyone is beginning to see that.  At last, the PR cuts are showing through because the spin the Government has tried to present is finally falling asunder.  The notion that it has any strategy to deal with these huge challenges has just been dismantled.  Fine Gael does not support the adjournment proposal.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	54	Three weeks ago, the Labour Party proposed a motion that the Dáil should continue in session until the end of July and return in early September.  We argued in favour of that on the grounds that the country is facing serious economic and political difficulties.  The Government needs to be accountable to the House in a way that it has not been before.  I acknowledge that as a result of that motion we are sitting this week and it appears that we will be back a bit earlier in September than is normally the case.  However, given the circumstances in which the country now finds itself, the Government proposal to close down the Dáil from today until 24 September is simply unacceptable.It is particularly unacceptable today because as we sit here, passengers in Dublin Airport do not know when their flights will take off.  It is the second day of chaos at the airport.  The country is becoming a disgrace.  We have a bad economic situation and the Government does not know what to do about it.  It now wants to run away, get back in the bunker and introduce slashing cuts of one kind or another over the next couple of months.  In addition, people cannot get into or out of the country.  It is an absolute disgrace, yet in those circumstances the Government wants to close down the Dáil until the end of September.  It is not acceptable. The Labour Party does not agree to this proposal.

At this stage, ten of them have not even been published.  That is an indictment of the Government's inability to manage its business.  In the middle of 2008, it must be noted we have the worst record of legislation in the history of the State.  It shows there is no one on the other side of the House in control and coherently managing the legislative programme.The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment promised legislation for the introduction of on-the-spot fines for breaches of consumer law.  She has pronounced there have been tremendous changes in the prices in shops.  Will she elaborate on these tremendous changes?  Will she also indicate when this new legislative power, which she believes is necessary and consumers feel is long overdue, will be introduced onto the Statute Book?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	76	I presume the Deputy is referring to the Fines Bill from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	80	It is not one of the priorities.  I must deal with several legislative measures which have been agreed with the social partners.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20206	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	81	The Government's record to date is that it has not dealt with the legislative measures which were to be introduced this year.  There is the employment protection Bill which was to be introduced in this session but still has not surfaced.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	82	The year is not over yet.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20206	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	83	These high priorities do not seem to be getting much attention either.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	86	Apparently, the Government cannot legislate at all.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	87	Since the general election last year, we have had the poorest legislative performance by any Government since the foundation of the State.  The lowest number of Bills have been put through the Dáil.  In the course of 24 hours, we have the usual exercise by the Government where it attempts to rush Bills through at the last minute.  The Intoxicating Liquor Bill was passed the other night when only seven out of 56 Committee Stage amendments were debated and there was no Report Stage debate.  The Dublin Transport Authority Bill was passed with only 15 out of 108 Report Stage amendments debated.Many of the amendments on the Intoxicating Liquor Bill were tabled by the Government.  Our experience in this House shows us repeatedly that where the Government runs amendments through and guillotines the legislation, we end up with a problem being discovered in the courts with the legislation.  This ends up with amending legislation having to be introduced.The Central Statistics Office has just released the latest inflation figures which are back up to 5%.

#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	90	An indifferent Government.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	91	It cannot introduce legislation on time to ensure it is fully debated in the House.  It uses the guillotine at the last minute and is now running for the bunker.Will this practice of the Government bringing in legislation and amendments to it in the last week of the Dáil session end in September?  Will we have a real legislative programme for the full year where the Dáil can deal with legislative proposals?  I do not know how many times in the past year the Government could not keep the normal business of the House going and had to bring in one type of padding or another to fill the time.  Then in the last week, the Government rushes legislation through.  This is about a Government that not only cannot manage the economy, it cannot plan its legislative business from the beginning to the end of the year.  There are incompetent Ministers who are not able to cut it in legislative debate, arriving in the Chamber at the last minute to amend their legislation and order the business so it cannot be debated.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	92	On many Thursdays when I take the Order of Business, I have been asked to give Government time to discuss other issues over legislation which has been provided for, such as this afternoon.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	94	Since the Government came into office, 29 Bills have been enacted and 28 Bills published.  In this session, nine Bills have been published and in 2008, overall, 19 published.  A number of items of legislation will be published during the summer months, which I am sure, given the exuberance of the Deputies, will be carefully read, in preparation for an exhilarating debate next session.  We will have the legislative programme for the autumn over two days next week.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	95	I want to raise the issue of pylons on foot of the information that came out yesterday.  When will the electricity transfer of assets Bill be introduced in the Dáil so we can fully debate the whole issue of how electricity pylons are erected or the underground option?

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	97	There is no definite date as to when that legislation will be available.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	98	I want to address the same theme as previously raised, in the context of promised legislation.  This Government has essentially been castrating the House as a legislative Assembly.  It seems intent on undermining our constitutional duty to hold the Government to account.  In the context of that, will the Minister say when will the adoption Bill, which has been promised for eight years and is part of the legislative programme, be published?When will we have the child care Bill, which has been promised to provide a new statutory scheme for children with special needs who require special orders in the High Court?  That forms part of the current promised legislative programme.When will we have the following promised four items, which were to come before this House for debate?  The first is the report of the national review committee on the "Children First" guidelines, designed to ensure that children at risk are being properly protected.  Second is the report into the reason for the delay, from 1999 until November 2007, in the completion of the report on abuse of intellectually disabled children in Brothers of Charity institutions.  There is an investigation into why it took eight years to produce that report.  This House was promised that by 8 July, the report would be completed, and published.  It has not been made available.Third is a report of the independent inquiry to examine the full circumstances of the tragic deaths of the Dunne family in Monageer, County Wexford.  That report was to be completed by 7 July.  Finally, there is a report into the development of the national children's information system.  In this House we established that there is no up to date information with regard to the child protection duties being undertaken by the HSE.  There is a report designed to ensure that it produces its information on time.We were promised by the Minister of State with responsibility for children that we would see the HSE report before this House on the child protection services, just covering the years 2006 and 2007.  We are now in the middle of 2008 and we do not know how well the child protection services functioned in 2006.  It is a disgrace.  Will the Minister tell us when we will have those two items of legislation, when the reports will be laid before the House and the reason for the delay in providing all of them?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	99	The adoption Bill will be available in July, as will the child care Bill.  On the matter of reports, I will have to revert——
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	100	This is July.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	101	This is July.  Maybe when the Deputy is on the first learning curve he might discover that there are a couple of days left in the month.  I shall ask the Minister of State with responsibility for children to revert to the Deputy on the specifics of the report.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	102	The Tánaiste will not be here.

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	110	I want to ask about two items.  On the day that inflation went up to 5%, it is disappointing to hear the Tánaiste is not going to proceed, as a priority, with further legislation to protect consumers.  Earlier, she told us she has other legislative priorities that have been agreed by the social partners.  It is my understanding that the Employment Law Compliance Bill 2008 has not been agreed by the social partners, which is why it has been published but not brought before this House.  Also, the employment agency Bill has not been published.  Perhaps the Tánaiste might clarify her comments in that regard and tell the House exactly what legislation has been agreed by the social partners that she is prioritising because I do not believe that is correct.As regards State agencies, we have had a little bit of bluster recently from the Government, where it has suddenly expressed an interest in rationalising them.  In that regard, will the Tánaiste at least confirm that the following Bills on the legislative agenda that established new quangos are going to be withdrawn: the Curragh of Kildare Bill, the Irish Sports Council Bill and the education Ireland Bill?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	111	There is no intention to remove any of those Bills from the list, in so far as I am aware.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	112	Three of them are quangos.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	114	The compliance Bill has been published and there will be further consultation, presently, as there has not been a meeting of minds on this between employers and unions.  I have given an undertaking that we will follow through during the summer and discussions will take place with the social partners.  On the agencies Bill, as the Deputy knows, that matter has only been completed at European level.  The text is awaited, and we shall hopefully proceed with that as quickly as possible, in the context of agreement between both sides, which I believe will happen.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	115	What the Tánaiste said earlier, therefore, was untrue.  There are no Bills.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	119	Perhaps it would be best if we did not complete this session with Deputy Varadkar indicating untruths.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	120	I object to that.  The person who has indicated untruths here is the Tánaiste.  She has told the House that she cannot proceed with consumer protection legislation because she has other legislation which has priority over that, which has been agreed with the social partners.  She is now confirming this is not the case.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	121	We cannot have an argy-bargy about it now.  Deputy Timmins, please.

We should let the Government continue with the untruths.  That is the way it started the session, and let it continue with it.

When can we expect to see the company law (consolidation and reform) Bill?  I also want to ask her about 70 hectares of IDA Ireland land in Wicklow that have not had a site visit since 2006.  Will she able to get the officials in her Department to do something about it?

Does she intend to make a preservation order on the site or has she any proposals for it?  It has been lying idle, and for a quarter of a century——

He cannot raise it now.  If I were to allow every Deputy to raise such matters we could never get to the next debate.  I am sorry about that.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	129	Although we do not have a particular date for the consolidation Bill, it is more than likely to be 2009, as it will take a considerable amount of work.  The Deputy can discuss the other matter privately with me.

#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	168	I wish to deal with two matters in this debate on the economy.  One is the decision of the Government to suspend the implementation of two important reports, one being A Vision for Change on the development of the psychiatric services and the other is Reach Out, the expert group's recommendations on reducing the incidence of suicide.  In June, the independent monitoring group in its report on implementation of A Vision for Change in 2007 states, in the absence of clear identifiable leadership within the HSE to implement A Vision of Change, the monitoring group considers that the Health Service Executive was mistaken in its decision not to implement the recommendations to establish a national mental health service directive to drive the changes recommended in the report.  It also states that the monitoring group does not believe that the administrative arrangements that the HSE has put in place are appropriate to the scale of the changes required.  It further states that the monitoring group notes that the HSE appointed a director of cancer services in 2007 to lead the implementation of the national cancer strategy.  The report states that the reform of mental health services requires a similar approach.What is proposed is an indictment of the approach and the resources put in place for the development of our psychiatric services.  No additional funding was put in place this year for the implementation of the recommendations, as proposed by the report, A Vision for Change.  Of the €51 million allocated in 2006 and 2007, only €27 million was allocated for the purpose the Minister responsible directed and the balance was hived off by the HSE for its own reasons.In regard to Reach Out, the expert group's recommendations for reducing the incidence of suicide, only €3.05 million was allocated last year and only the same amount was allocated this year.  Effectively, no further initiatives can be taken to reduce the incidence of suicide because no further resources have been made available.  Furthermore, it could be argued that with the effect of inflation, the value of the resources allocated has been reduced.Some £3 million sterling was allocated to the equivalent office in the North of Ireland.  Taking account of population differences and the exchange rate, €10 million is the amount that should be allocated here if we were to match what is being done in the North to reduce the incidence of suicide.  It is an indictment of the Government that one of the first areas to suffer cuts is in the area developing services for one of the most needy groups in society, those suffering from a psychiatric illness and in need of intervention and those who are in danger of taking their own lives.Second, I would like to deal with the neglect of my area, the mid west, under the national development plan.  The 2007 NDP report was revealing.  Representatives of the National Roads Authority were available to meet us yesterday.  I discussed my area with them and came away from the meeting with little hope of anything being done for County Limerick.  One of the first projects I raised was the bypass of Adare, which is crucial for my constituency.  The representatives admitted that they have seen the traffic in Adare, which can be backed up for three to four miles at peak times.  Adare is a brilliant tourist product, but it is being destroyed by the level and congestion of traffic going through it.  Not alone were the representatives not able to give me any encouragement that the bypass, which was mooted many years ago, would be completed in the near future, they informed me that the national parks and wildlife service of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has now decided that a section of the area identified for the bypass has been deemed a special area of conservation, which will create more difficulties for the completion of the project.  I was totally depressed with the response I was given regarding the bypassing of Adare, Newcastle West and Abbeyfeale.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	169	Since my election to this House and, essentially during the past ten years, there have been many years of economic growth during which money was squandered.  Having regard to that, what is happening as a result of the announcement of the savage cuts inside and outside this House is frightening.The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have said that the most vulnerable in the community will not be hit by the cuts, but I can assure them that our most vulnerable people, the elderly, are being hit.  The home care packages and the home help service, which were very much welcomed by the elderly, have been totally cut in my county in recent months.  Anybody, having left hospital, who has sought a home care grant or a home help service has been told to go away because such grants are not available due to a funding crisis within the HSE in the south eastern area.  Our elderly are the most the most vulnerable and dependent of our people.  We all have elderly parents, aunts, uncles or grandparents and they all appreciate the welcome support of the home help service.  It is a scandal that this service has been cut.  People who had a home help for six hours a week have had the number of hours reduced to four.  It is a scandal that this has happened.  It was a lie for the Minister for Health and Children to come into House and say that the delivery of these packages is not being cut.I was interested to hear the Ministers for Education and Science and Finance say there would be no cutbacks in the education sector, but the Minister responsible asked the VECs to cut their funding yesterday.  We all know that primary schools, secondary schools and VECs are hard pressed to cope.  The Government recently introduced water charges for schools.  Schools have had to fundraise to pay for items they should not have to pay for.  It was great when the Government was able to blame Europe in this respect.  It is great pass the buck and to blame somebody else, but these are front-line education services.  This has affected the school building programme.  Many school extensions and new schools have been promised in my county.  The school authorities in a school in Crossabeg were promised that a project would proceed a year and a half ago, but they are still no closer to the project being delivered and now they have been told to hold off in respect of it.  I met the Minister for Education and Science last week and I hope he will have some good news on that project.  There is nothing as bad as promising something to a local school board and then having to tell its members that the project will not be delivered.The decentralisation programme was announced, with great fanfare, in the House in the 2004 budget.  I remember that day when all the Government backbenchers and Ministers raced out the door of this Chamber to go their constituencies, local radio stations and local newspapers to tell them, with great fanfare, of all the jobs that would be coming to their constituencies.  I will give an example of what is happening in regard to that programme in my town of Enniscorthy.  Enniscorthy Town Council paid huge money for an old convent on Nunnery Road in recent years.  The OPW promised to buy it off them for the purposes of decentralisation.  The decentralisation programme has been shelved and now Enniscorthy Town Council has been left holding the baby.  This is typical of what this Government has been doing over the last number of years.  If the Tánaiste is going to come down and give more money to the estimates for Enniscorthy Town Council she is very welcome but, like all Governments over the last number of years, this one has refused to fund local authorities.  It will ensure it will bring in plenty of stealth taxes over the next while.  The Government has announced a 3% cut in the payroll of all local authorities.  The Minister knows this 3% will be taken off the overall budget and sewerage and water schemes, roads and house building will be affected.  I would love to go on for the next hour, but unfortunately, I had only five minutes.  I would like to take the opportunity to criticise what has been happening in this House over the last while.

What intrigues me is that the Government seems to be surprised at the situation in which it finds itself.  The braver dogs in the street have been barking the economic issues for the last five or six years, not the last couple of weeks.  The few unembedded, economic journalists spoke out and got little credit for it.  They were accused of being unpatriotic and talking down the economy.  The evidence was there; from the time the first benchmarking was introduced there was a clear indication that things were gone wrong.  That was introduced because a short time after the partnership agreement, it was found that it was falling asunder.  That was the signal seven years ago.  I cannot understand why it took the Government so long to recognise it.  It is because it was getting in the lolly.  It was coming in piles from the housing and development sector because of VAT and other taxes.The Government did nothing.  It waited and milked the economy for everything it had.  The building industry boomed, the Government had more money to spend and it splashed it around.There is nothing corrective in the proposals that have come before the House in the last few days.  I have listened carefully to all that has come from that side of the House and not a single correction to the economy has taken place.  There are cuts, just a little hurt to remind the public that this is severe and will hurt them more for a little longer.  "Health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped" was an election slogan some years ago.  It may have been even before the Ceann Comhairle's time.  I remember it well.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	176	It has nothing to do with the economy.  No corrective measures, good, bad or indifferent have been taken.  The amazing thing is that we have not heard in recent days about the high wage economy.  Do Members remember the high wage economy about which the former Tánaiste used to boast?  We were a special country, international marketeers and competitive.  We have not been competitive for the last five years.  That signal was starkly visible.  The economic fundamentals are not in order.  That is the sad part about it.  Wherever the Government is getting its figures, it is wrong.  Government members are codding themselves.  They are gone off the wall.  It is worse than it has been portrayed.Sadly, if the Government thinks this is the full extent of the problem, it has another thing coming.  Let it watch the markets and shares and see what is happening.  Does the Government realise that what it is doing does nothing to address those issues to restore confidence in the economy?  We have an economy that was driven by the construction industry.  The Government was creaming off money in taxation, VAT, stamp duty and all the other ways and that is why it was doing so well.  However nothing is being done to correct it.  There are building sites all over the country locked up.  No houses are being sold because the public cannot afford to buy them.  Houses are being repossessed from people who bought them four or five years ago.  Action was not taken because of a fear of negative equity.  As we all know, negative equity is not a great idea but does not affect individuals unless they have to sell.There is thinking in Government that everything will be restored in a short space of time and things will start flowing again.  Unfortunately, they are not and the Government does not realise it.  I cannot understand the economic basis on which the Government places its premise.  Nothing will happen.  The banks cannot or will not lend.  The construction industry is stuck on the other side and can go neither forwards nor backwards.  That is the kernel of the problem.  Tinkering around the edges of it will not solve the problem.  The Government can cut the health and education services and cause as much hardship as it likes but it is not addressing the underlying economic issues as borne out by Deputies Kenny, Gilmore, Bruton and Burton in the last few days.Yesterday the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance mentioned management.  That is what we have not got.  There has been no management.  Any fool could have recognised that when we had low interest rates, as we had over the last seven, eight or nine years, people would automatically speculate in property, as they are now speculating in oil, hoarding it and driving the market wild.  The Government did nothing about it, but said interest rates are set by the ECB.  That is correct but credit rating is not set by the ECB.Sadly, my time has expired.  It is sad that we get only five minutes on an issue as important as this with the economy as it is.

In the last few days I wrote to the Minister for Transport advising him of the hardship likely to be caused to a poor provisional licence holder who has driven the family, for whom she cares, all of whom have special needs.  The Ceann Comhairle will like this one.  He wrote back to me and said he had referred it to Mr. Noel Brett, who is responsible.  Who is responsible in this House?  Is there nobody responsible on that side?  What has gone wrong with them?  They failed to live up to their responsibilities and running away from it will not solve the problem.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	179	I am glad of this opportunity to say a few words on the economy.  I will try to be as constructive as possible because we collectively have a serious responsibility for trying to drive our economy forward.  Before we do that, the Government side of the House must start being realistic and honest to see exactly where we are.  We need a bottom line, to know exactly where the cutbacks will be and to be honest with the Irish people.  For example, on Tuesday we heard there would be no cutbacks in education and health, but on the previous Friday there has been talk in Letterkenny General Hospital, which is local to me and the Tánaiste, of 20 beds being taken off the list.  There are cutbacks.  Special needs assistants are being cut back in the special needs and disability sector.  The cutbacks have been coming down here fast and furious in the past few months.We need to begin listening to where wastage is still ongoing.  In 2007 in the primary school sector we spent €35 million on rental of prefabricated buildings.  That is a complete and utter disgrace and waste of money.  The wastage is there and we must tackle it.  This Government must use every resource to tackle the ongoing wastage.  The HSE has paid €1.75 million for late payments to suppliers.  That is centrally controlled.  In the north west that equated to €500,000.  That is not the responsibility of local managers or hospitals but is centrally controlled by the HSE.  We must target that kind of wastage where payments can be made on time, avoiding this waste of Exchequer funding.We still have a role to play in our export market, and this is where the Tánaiste comes in.  Last week Germany started taking back production it had outsourced to China and has started producing quality German products instead.  These are mass produced products that Germany can produce better at home.  We must begin to become competitive and introduce that resilience in producing and manufacturing which we had in this country and start to instil that confidence that we can bring up our exports again.The export market has not just fallen in the past six months, it has been falling for the past five years.  The construction sector has been camouflaging the decline in the manufacturing sector in my neck of the woods and in export growth for the past ten years.  Basically, it was a band-aid in terms of providing employment but now we have nothing to drive the economy forward.I wish to ask the Tánaiste a specific question about counties Kerry and Donegal.  There are two Coast Guard stations in situ in those counties, providing an excellent service, although they need upgrading and additional investment.  The Tánaiste sits at the Cabinet table with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, who is responsible for this area.  In light of the economic downturn, will a new Coast Guard station be built in a different area, involving the procurement of land and a considerable financial outlay?  Will a new facility be built and will the stations at Valentia and Malin Head be closed down?The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, who is sitting beside the Tánaiste, has displayed leadership which should be followed.  He is considering the possibility of retraining redundant fishermen to enable them to work in the merchant navy.  I welcome measures such as that, which may look small, but which could have a very positive impact.  We must find ways of building our capacity, retraining workers and being inventive in moving forward.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	180	I wish to share time with the Deputy Brendan Smith.Without doubt, the key consideration in addressing the challenges in the environment we now face is to maintain and enhance our competitiveness in the fullest sense; competitiveness that will enable our economy to develop on a path of sustainable export-led growth; competitiveness in terms of enabling us to remain an attractive location for foreign direct investment and to provide the right conditions for building a strong indigenous industrial base; and competitiveness that will underpin our development as a knowledge-based, innovative economy capable of sustaining high quality employment.  Such an ability underpinned the impressive growth of the recent decade and this Government is committed to creating the same conditions to allow us to be competitive when the current challenges abate.Against that background, I am happy to provide clarification to the House of the savings to be achieved by my Department during the remainder of 2008, following the recent Government decision on the need to curtail Exchequer spending in the current year.  Minimum savings amounting to €24.551 million on a total budgeted spend of almost €2 billion will be achieved across all areas of my Department's Vote as required by the Government decision.  However, a number of key principles arise.  First, I am determined that the key agencies of the Department will remain sufficiently resourced to ensure strong delivery in terms of inward investment, growth of the indigenous sector, research and development and upskilling the workforce.  These are all areas of productive investment that will ensure that Ireland is well placed to capitalise on the economic upturn that will inevitably arise.Second, the savings have been designed to ensure that the most vulnerable in our society are protected.  Thus, there will be no reduction in places on community employment or jobs initiative schemes and no savings are being sought on programmes for people with disabilities.A sum of €19.15 million of the 2008 savings will be from the FÁS allocation which is the largest single spending area within the Department's Vote.  In general, the savings include areas where spending requirements will be less than budgeted due to lower apprenticeship entrants, lower dependant allowance costs and savings already yielded by lower than expected activity in the first half of the year.  A small saving of €440,000 arises as a result of reduced training provision by Skillnets.  Combined savings in the order of €2 million have been identified across the Competition Authority, the National Consumer Agency, the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, the Companies Registration Office, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Health and Safety Authority, while administrative savings will also be delivered by the development agencies operating under the aegis of my Department, including IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and Science Foundation Ireland.  A saving of €1 million will arise on my Department's administrative budget and remaining savings required will be spread across other smaller areas of the Department's budget.It would be wrong to suggest that delivering these savings will be painless.  They will require stringent measures and tight controls. However, they will be managed in a manner designed to minimise the impact on programme delivery by exploiting natural savings arising from reduced activity and delays in filling staff vacancies.  As required by the Government decision, savings will include a reduced spend on areas such as consultancy, advertising and public relations.  The measures identified are prudent and targeted to have minimum impact on frontline services and reflect the Government's commitment to take determined action on matter within our control.Of course, some of the factors impacting negatively on the economy and on our competitiveness are beyond our control.  Therefore, it is all the more vital that in areas where actions can influence our cost environment, we act responsibly and work together to ensure that we safeguard and enhance our competitiveness. This is our best route to job creation and increasing living standards in the medium term.The Government is committed, through the national development plan, to investing in competitiveness, through funding for training and upskilling, science and research and the attraction of new industry, as well as the growth and development of our existing industry.  This agenda goes hand in hand with maintaining and enhancing standards in the workplace and employment rights through the partnership process.  We do not and cannot seek to advance one at the expense of the other.At the outset, we should not forget where we are.  On overall competitiveness, Ireland stands out in a number of important categories.  The world competitiveness scoreboard as recently as May this year ranked Ireland at 12, up from 14 last year.  The Centre for European Reform ranks Ireland 6th among the 27 EU member states for overall competitiveness in 2008.  WTO data show that Ireland is now the 12th largest exporter of commercial services in the world.  The Lisbon Council's European jobs and growth monitor ranks Ireland as the second most competitive economy in Europe in 2008.  Our GDP expanded at an annual average rate of 6.5% over the period 1997 to 2007, which has facilitated a substantial improvement in living standards.As Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the central thrust of my Department's policy will be to continue to strengthen and build on our competitiveness through the provisions of the national development plan.  The ability to create and exploit knowledge is an essential feature of an advanced economy and therefore Ireland has placed research and development at the heart of its economic development effort.  The Government, through the strategy for science, technology and innovation, recognises the importance of moving our economy to a knowledge-driven one.  The objective of the strategy is to provide the opportunity to achieve convergence, coherence and synergy in our national innovation system.  The current national development plan provides for a very significant increase in the investment in technology, innovation and scientific research, amounting to a commitment of €8.2 billion over the period 2007 to 2013.  The aim is to build the skills needed for a modern knowledge-based economy and to strengthen Ireland's research base.As a result of significant Government investment, multinational and indigenous companies now see Ireland as a location for world-class innovation activity.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	182	Ireland's overall innovation performance remains strong according to the latest evidence released jointly by Forfás and the Central Statistics Office.  The level of product and process innovation activity is above the EU average for manufacturing and service sector firms.A strong research and development and innovation performance is one of the many elements in ensuring that Ireland remains a competitive location for attracting foreign direct investment. Such investment has played and will continue to play an important role in the development of our economy.  In recognition of this, the foreign direct investment subgroup of the national development plan, involving IDA Ireland and Shannon Development in the Shannon Free Zone, will invest €1.6 billion over the lifetime of the plan to promote new foreign direct investment and the expansion of existing foreign direct investment in Ireland.  While international competition for foreign direct investment is relentless, Ireland continues to punch above its weight when it comes to attracting overseas investment.The level of foreign direct investment in Ireland, relative to the size of the economy, is one of the highest in the world.  Today, there are in the region of 1,000 overseas companies employing more than 136,000 people in this country.  These include many of the leading companies in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, medical technology, financial services, international services, digital media and information and communications technology.The economic impact of foreign direct investment in Ireland is pervasive and goes much deeper than just job creation.  Foreign owned companies are at the cutting edge of demand for high skills, of advanced management training and business processes, which permeate the wider business community.  These companies are leading contributors to the national research and innovation agenda.  They have contributed greatly to the broadening of the economic base in Ireland by fostering entrepreneurship and promoting the start-up of indigenous enterprises.In addition, during 2007 these companies have put €15.87 billion in direct expenditure back into the economy.  Of this €5.7 billion was spent on services and €3.43 billion on material and components from Irish sources.  In addition, the corporation tax generated by these companies was €3 billion or almost 50% of the total corporate tax take in the same year.In line with the national spatial strategy and the national development plan, IDA Ireland is actively enhancing the potential for regions to prosper.  It has been instrumental in the development of high quality flagship technology parks in the gateway and hub locations, ensuring full integration into the surrounding business and economic environment.  Over the lifetime of the NDP, IDA Ireland will maintain a strong focus on maximising the capability of regional locations to absorb a greater proportion of high-quality FDI.  Last year alone, IDA Ireland secured 114 new investments, amounting to more than €2.3 billion in capital investment.  A total of 64% of the investments secured by IDA in 2007 were located outside of Dublin.Ireland's competitiveness is based not on Irish tax benefits and costs alone but on knowledge, innovation, flexibility, and connectedness — how everything works together.  Ireland continues to be one of the most attractive places in the world as a location for global business.  With our highly educated, skilled and adaptable workforce; our strong focus on research and development and knowledge; and our "can-do" responsive and open attitude, we remain a location of choice.  As a small open economy, Ireland welcomes the continued strong interest demonstrated by many of the world's leading companies in investing and expanding here.  Ireland has transformed as an economy over recent years and we are well positioned to continue this transformation over coming years.  We are pro-business, pro-European and proud to be always at the forefront of the minds of global business leaders as they make critical investment decisions.Of course, FDI is only one side of the enterprise equation.  A strong and vibrant indigenous enterprise sector is also important to ensure that our economy grows and develops.  An investment of €1.7 billion has been allocated under the NDP for enterprise development in the indigenous sector.Enterprise Ireland has delivered handsomely on its 2005-2007 strategy by meeting or exceeding the publicly stated targets through assisting 221 new high potential start-up companies against a target of 210, 70 of which came into being in 2007.In summary, while the issues facing the economy are challenging, we are starting from a strong position.  Ireland has a good economy, the fundamentals of which are right.  The Government is committed to building on this and ensuring that we remain competitive and in a position to take full advantage of any upturn in the global marketplace.  We do this through our plans and programmes under the NDP and will create the environment whereby we will continue on a path of sustainable export growth, enhancing our attractiveness as a location for FDI and continuing our development as a knowledge-based and innovative economy.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	183	As the Minister for Finance has outlined, the fundamentals of our economy are sound.  Our current difficulty does not represent a return to the 1980s.  Indeed, the economy has changed dramatically over the past 20 years.  Our public debt is the second lowest in the European Union.  The general Government debt has declined from over 100% of GNP in the 1980s to 53% of GNP in 1998 and to a forecast of around 25% of GNP this year.  This means that provided we continue to follow sound economic principles and policies, Ireland will return to higher economic growth when the difficult economic conditions pass.  The Government has demonstrated that it is prepared to take difficult decisions in the short term in order to ensure an early recovery from the current problems.The decision by the Government to implement a number of prudent spending measures representing €440 million in savings this year and €1 billion next year signals our resolve to deal with these economic issues now rather than face a more difficult situation in 2009 and subsequent years.  The decision requires a renewed focus on spending public funding wisely while maintaining the investment in infrastructure and the productive sectors of the economy that lay the foundations for future prosperity.The focus of the measures announced by the Government is on administrative expenditure, streamlining the delivery of services and improving efficiencies.  For the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Government decision involves savings this year of €9.1 million.  The savings will be absorbed by the administrative budgets in the Department and its State agencies and will involve savings in operating costs, including salaries.  A saving of €1.04 million will be applied to the administrative budget of the Department and savings of €5.391 million will be sought from among the State agencies, while a further saving of €2.679 million will be found on the cost of consultancies, PR and payroll costs.  Further savings will be sought next year.The Department has, of course, been engaged in ongoing efforts to improve efficiency and has reduced staff numbers significantly in recent years.  As part of the recent efficiency review, the Department again reviewed all aspects of expenditure with a view to identifying further savings on administrative spending.  The exercise included the State agencies under the aegis of the Department.   I will now consider specific proposals, including staff costs — both pay and non-pay — and the possibility of further staff reductions, to realise the expenditure savings this year.  Savings next year will be considered in the context of the preparation of the 2009 Estimates.While the decisions taken yesterday do not target particular schemes for savings, this situation must be reviewed on an ongoing basis, particularly next year.  I must manage the resources available to the Department to best effect.  In that context, I will also be examining every aspect of the Department's programme of schemes and services with a view to ensuring that expenditure is fully justified and that we get the best possible value for public investment.  I would, however, like to clearly state my commitment to the continued development of a modern, efficient and competitive agrifood sector.  I remain fully determined to maintaining a focus on investment and other measures designed to develop productive capacity, protect the environment and ensure the sustainability of the agriculture, fisheries and food sectors into the future.Just last week, the Department published a number of reports on the important contribution which the agriculture, food, forestry and fishing industries contribute to the economy, particularly in rural areas, and to Irish society in general.  The agrifood sector is one of our most important indigenous manufacturing industries.  It accounts for almost 7% of GDP, 8% of employment and 10% of exports.To gain a further understanding of this contribution, a report produced by Brendan Riordan, research consultant, in May 2008 provides estimates of the net inflow of funds to the Irish economy associated with the agrifood sector and makes comparisons with other sectors in the economy.  The report shows that the agrifood sector, more correctly referred to in the report as the "biosector", contributes approximately one third of the net flow of funds into the economy generated by primary and manufacturing industries.  This is at least double the sector's contribution to exports and underlines the importance of the sector to our economy.Policy makers around the world are realising the importance of agriculture and natural resources generally as providing solutions to many of the key problems facing mankind, including challenges relating to food security, energy provision and climate change.  At a time of challenging economic circumstances, both nationally and globally, this report provides a timely indication of the importance of the agrifood sector to our economy.It indicates that in 2005, net foreign earnings of the sector, including agriculture, forestry, fisheries, food and drink industries, amounted to 32% of the total net earnings from primary and manufacturing industries.  This was double the sector's 16% contribution to exports in that year.  These findings are consistent for the period from 2000 to 2005.  It is also worth noting that the report highlights that in 2005, for every €100 of exports from the biosector, €48 was retained in Ireland.  This compares with €19 retained for every €100 of exports in the non-biosector.The reasons given in the report for the sector's disproportionately large net contribution to earnings from exports include the fact that the import requirements per euro of biosector exports were found to be lower than in the non-biosector; foreign ownership, and thus profit repatriation outflows, was lower than in other sectors; and receipts of EU payments were almost entirely in support of agriculture and its exports.I find it interesting that the results are not, however, heavily dependent on EU receipts in any of the years from 2000 to 2005.  Furthermore, global price increases for food, feed and forestry products in the years since 2005 may have further boosted the contribution of the sector and may well have strengthened its position as a major contributor to the future prosperity of Ireland. Finally, this study emphasises the strength of the biosector's linkages with Irish businesses.  These connections are particularly close for the natural resource-based industries of agriculture, forestry and fishing, along with industries using their output, and these linkages demonstrate the importance of these sectors to the economy.Against all of that background, it is more important than ever that we get value for money for public investment in this sector.  The Agri-Vision 2015 report published by the Department in 2005 outlined a number of key challenges if we are to capitalise on the significant potential of the sector to expand and develop.The over-riding objective is the development of a consumer-focused, competitive and sustainable industry capable of meeting the challenges of more liberalised global markets and a range of broader societal demands.  In practical terms, this means delivering high-quality food in which consumers at home and abroad have confidence and which is produced in an environmentally friendly manner for high-value markets and at a competitive price.  This is not something that can be achieved by Government alone. Producers, processors, State agencies and all of those involved also require significant effort.The same underlying objectives apply to the development of the fishing sector.  The strategy for a restructured, sustainable and profitable Irish seafood industry 2007-13 focuses on rebalancing fishing capacity with stocks and on developing strong and vibrant fish processing and aquaculture sectors.This Government is delivering on these objectives through the implementation of a wide range of measures provided for in the national and rural development programmes for the period 2007-13.  Schemes such as the farm waste management and farm improvement schemes, the REPS and disadvantaged areas scheme, grants for afforestation, the breeding and welfare scheme for suckler cows, installation aid and the early retirement scheme, the marketing and processing scheme, the suckler cow scheme and the FIRM and stimulus funds for research and development, involve expenditure by my Department exceeding €1 billion in 2008, and are aimed at improving the structure and productive capacity of Irish farms, protecting the environment, ensuring that primary production methods are sustainable and meet the broader expectations of consumers, and encouraging research and development in processing and primary production and capital investment in the food processing sector.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	189	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to outline and give information on the background to the current situation at Dublin Airport.  I want to bring Members up to date on the air traffic control problems at the airport.  I am satisfied that, since these problems started, the IAA has done everything in its power to resolve the issues that arose.  My Department has been in ongoing contact with the authority since the problem arose.  The IAA has expressed its sincere regrets over the delays to passengers because of the difficulties with the air traffic control software.  It is giving priority to resolve the difficulties.  Once these have been resolved I have asked that it make a full report to me on what happened.The overriding concern of the IAA, which is shared by Members, is to ensure the safety of passengers.  The IAA has assured me that this is the reason it is taking these precautions.  It is not prepared to compromise the safety of passengers until everything is in 100% working order.The IAA was established following the passing of the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993.  It is responsible for the safe operation of Irish air space and is tasked with the provision, operation and management of air navigation services in Irish air space.  The authority has an exemplary record in the conduct of its functions in this regard.  It enjoys an excellent record among peer groups as a safe and efficient service provider.  It is responsible for air navigation at the three State airports and the regulatory oversight of such services at non-State airports, as well as for all air traffic flying in Irish air space.  Some 90% of air traffic on the north Atlantic travels through Irish air space.  As such, the IAA is a major provider of air navigation services to the US and European traffic, as well as to traffic originating in, or destined for, Ireland.Over the past number of weeks there have been intermittent problems with the radar system at Dublin Airport.  It was possible to resolve those problems and maintain the operation of the system at the same time as they arose.  However, further problems arose in Dublin air traffic control centre late yesterday morning.  The nature of the problems led the IAA to reduce traffic to the bare minimum for three hours while it conducted an initial investigation of the problem.  That investigation was undertaken by the IAA engineers and a team from Thales SA, the French company that supplies radars and air traffic equipment.By 4 p.m. yesterday it was possible to increase traffic to 12 arriving aircraft and nine departing aircraft per hour.  Several airlines, including Aer Lingus and Ryanair, cancelled flights because of the delays.  With a view to minimising the impact on the travelling public overnight, the IAA put on additional staff to facilitate airlines in repositioning aircraft at Dublin for the early outbound flights this morning.  Currently, the overarching priority for the provision of air traffic control services is safety.  While the IAA is acutely aware of the inconvenience caused to passengers, and while every effort is being made to minimise disruption, no compromise can be made on maintaining the highest standard of safety.The Department of Transport has been in contact with the IAA since yesterday afternoon and has received assurances that the IAA is doing everything in its power to resolve the problems and restore full operational capacity as soon as possible.  The latest position is that the IAA engineering team and the system suppliers, Thales SA, have identified the software problems and have rectified them.

This is giving rise to delays during the peak morning period.  The process of verifying, diagnosing and testing the repaired system is now under way.  The IAA is satisfied it has found the problem, identified the software problem and now, though it is at 70% capacity, it will continue to test until it is 100% sure that everything is in operation.  The IAA will not return to full operation until it is sure of that.  Protection and safety is always the highest priority for air traffic control.  The system performance and validation that is under way now takes time.  If no further problems are encountered, it should be possible to restore full capability over the next 24 to 48 hours.The present air traffic control system has been operated by the IAA at Dublin Airport for five years.  This was the first instance of a failure of this kind.  While the IAA has arrangements in place for contingencies, it is not practical to maintain a full back-up system to maintain 100% capability.  As evidenced by the fact that this is the first instance of a systems failure in five years, the IAA says there is no safety case for it and the cost to users would be significant.Members are aware that the aviation safety system comprises four key components, namely, airports, airlines, aircraft maintenance and the air traffic management systems.  The IAA is satisfied that all components of the system are safe in accordance with international standards and practices, notwithstanding the present problems.  There has never been any compromise of safety of aircraft or persons.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	195	I thank the Minister for his reply.  However, it is not true that this was the first serious malfunction.  A malfunction with the secondary surveillance radar, SSR, system also occurred on 5 and 6 June.  Today the Irish Independent and The Irish Times report we have had five spectacular failures in as many weeks.The secondary surveillance radar system was supposed to be space-age technology with a related computer management system.  It is extraordinary that we have this rate of failure.  How many times has it failed during the past year?  At the time of the previous major failure in early June, did the Minister order any investigation?  If so, what investigation did he order?  Did he ask the IAA to report in full on this matter, the SSR system, the computer system and all aspects of safety at Dublin Airport?  Was he aware of this, anticipating this and ensuring the safety of travellers?Do we need fundamental changes in the system?  I understand controllers feel they are effectively blind part of the time because the transmission which gives the blip on the screen is late or does not appear exactly as the aircraft is approaching and transmitting the information.Yesterday, holiday-makers and business travellers were bewildered and upset.  Does the Minister agree little information was given to people?  People were left standing in queues.  I received a phone call from a would-be passenger standing in a queue for two or three hours.  He did not receive any information on when he would be able to get a flight to Liverpool.I do not always agree with Michael O'Leary of Ryanair but I do agree with him that what happened yesterday was an unacceptable shambles at the major airport gateway to this country.  Under the European directive, will the Minister ensure all holiday-makers and business passengers will be fully compensated?  Will the Minister ensure the IAA fully compensates all passengers who were so badly treated yesterday?Is it time to order a full safety review of all systems at Dublin Airport?  Will the Minister publish the Irish Aviation Authority's engineering and other reports into the radar system?  Will he give us guidance on whether similar systems at Cork and Shannon airports have had similar problems?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	196	As I stated, the Department is aware of this and has been in contact with the IAA during recent weeks with regard to the intermittent problems with the radar system at Dublin Airport.  It was possible to resolve these and maintain operation of the system generally.  None of these problems was as serious as that which occurred yesterday.  We sought reports from the IAA on what happened and received them at the time.I do not understand how one can have software for five years and suddenly something goes wrong with it.  I am not sufficently technical to know this.  This appears to be what happened and the problem is with the software rather than the hardware.  I must wait until I receive the report to see what happened.This incident was handled well by the IAA.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	198	The IAA has a responsibility for the safety of passengers in the air.  Other bodies and organisations have responsibilities for looking after passengers on the ground.  I do not know what level of communication there was between the IAA, the DAA and the airlines concerned.  It is not the sole responsibility of the IAA to inform passengers of various airlines of what is happening other than that there may be delays.  Where this body is trying to look after the safety of passengers it is not fair that it should be responsible for providing information directly to passengers on the ground.  I do not accept this.If the IAA provided information that these delays would occur, this information should have been passed on to passengers.  I agree with the Deputy on this.  Information should have been more forthcoming to passengers, who should have known the possible length of the delay.  When this started, I am sure nobody knew how long it would last and there may have been initial confusion as the Deputy outlined.  I would not contest this.The matter of compensation for passengers is one for passengers themselves.  I will not make commitments in this House that passengers can be compensated or that the IAA should compensate them.  This is a matter for other bodies.With regard to safety, the way the IAA responded to this incident makes it clear that safety is at the top of its agenda and is a priority for it.  Part of the report I expect from the IAA on this matter will fully deal with safety and the safety of the system in the future.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	199	The Minister made reference to intermittent problems.  Will he confirm that, as Deputy Broughan stated, over the past five weeks five different radar malfunctions occurred?  If this is the case, and as I understand it three of them occurred before yesterday, why did they not sound the alarm bells?  What information was he given on the three radar malfunctions which took place prior to yesterday?In the context of the problem being with software, will the Minister tell the House whether the software operating the radar system has been corrupted?  Has a third party accessed the software through the world wide web?  If the Minister does not understand how software which operated reasonably well for five years stopped operating, has he asked the question of the Irish Aviation Authority?  Did it occur to the Minister to ask this question prior to yesterday's serious malfunctions?Will the Minister confirm that this software system cost €90 million to install?  Will he advise the House what costings he has been given for an appropriate software back-up system should this system fail?  Does the Minister agree that in light of it failing to ensure passenger safety there is an urgent need to have a secondary system which can be utilised should similar circumstances arise again?What is the position with regard to passenger safety and what was the position yesterday in circumstances in which the software failed when flights were in the air and coming into Dublin Airport?  Did it pose a risk to passenger safety?  How were the substantial number of flights which enter Irish airspace and carry on to other countries affected yesterday and how are they affected today by the events which occurred?  Is the safety of those aircraft in any way compromised?  Does the Minister agree that, as the Irish Aviation Authority administers the system, and it is dealing with this after three malfunctions in the past five weeks in conjunction with the firm that installed the software, that will not necessarily give us appropriate answers?  Does he further agree an independent investigation into these events should be conducted, in particular to investigate what went wrong with the software, whether the software has been corrupted and what are the security systems that protect the software from intervention by outside third parties, and an independent report produced on what is required and the likely costings of an appropriate back-up system?Does he concur it is not acceptable that more than 20,000 passengers found their flights cancelled yesterday and congestion is increasing in Dublin Airport today?  On the basis that the system is currently operating at between 65% and 70% of full capacity, will he indicate precisely when the system will be restored to 100% capacity?  When it is restored, how confident is the Minister that an incident such as this will not recur?  What has been done to secure the system and to ensure nothing is corrupting it that will reinstate itself and recreate this problem?Does the Minister agree the events of the past two days are doing profound damage to the image of this country in the context of its tourism industry and other businesses?  Business people looking on at what has happened in the airport will see it as unreliable as a passenger arrival or departure location.  What guarantee can the Minister give to the House that the matter was dealt with properly by the aviation authority prior to yesterday's events and that it is being dealt with properly today to ensure no repetition?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	200	I answered a number of these questions earlier but the Department received assurances from the IAA when previous disruptions took place that the matter had been dealt with and resolved.  I understand the authority is not in a position to say whether the problem detected yesterday was in any way related to the previous difficulties.  That is why I have asked for a full report on this incident and on the system generally.I cannot answer whether the software has been corrupted or whether there is a glitch in the system.  I must await the report to answer those questions.  It has been indicated that the difficulty does not relate to somebody hacking into the system but I did not ask that question.  I asked for a report on exactly what were, and are, the difficulties.The Deputy asked about the cost of the system.  My understanding is the system is in place for five years and it cost €115 million.  As he said, it is one of the most sophisticated and state-of-the-art systems.  It is unusual to install a back-up system but I understand the cost would be at least the same as the current system updated to present day values.  It would, therefore, cost a minimum of €115 million to install such a system, which, for example, would not have been used over the past five years.  The legitimate question arises as to whether that needs to change and whether the IAA needs to consider this.I do not wish to be alarmist but anything that affects the air traffic control system whether it is the software or the individuals operating it — we had problems with work to rules a number of months ago — may cause danger to passengers.  That is why, despite the inconvenience correctly highlighted by the Deputy, the IAA believes it must make sure everything is right before it will allow the system to operate at full capacity.  The Deputy is also correct that the system is operating at approximately 70% capacity.  Staff are still testing the system.  I asked the authority for a more precise timeline than 24 to 48 hours and it said it does not know what will happen.  The system is being tested and everything is working at 70% capacity.  Everything seems to have been ironed out and there have been no problems or difficulties.  The authority will gradually increase capacity and if it can achieve 100% capacity, it will do so.  However, if something happens at 85% or 90% capacity, the authority will be back to the drawing board.  That is why the timescale is as outlined.I do not have an answer to the Deputy's other technical question on overflights.  My understanding is that, where possible, in a scenario such as this, overflights are diverted out of Irish airspace.  Those that are absolutely necessary will be permitted into our airspace but there is no danger to aeroplanes or passengers.  Nothing will be done that could cause danger to passengers on any airline.  That is the primary concern of the IAA.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	201	We all must acknowledge that health and safety is a primary factor and the authority must be congratulated that this prevailed.  However, significant inconvenience is being caused.  The Minister indicated in response to earlier questions that the system attempted to break down during a number of previous incidents.  On receipt of the information that matters had been resolved, did the Minister request a double check?  Did he receive assurances the system would be restored to full working order?  What assurances can he give that, on resolution of the immediate problems, the system will withstand the pressures of time and the rigours of the workload?Was a service contact involved in the installation of the system?  This is a sophisticated system, which is almost foolproof.  There are variations in the purchase contract, which relate to monitoring and ongoing service.  Was that a factor in this incident?  Was a service contract an option?  If so, was it taken up?  What action was taken following the first malfunction in the context of the service contract?  Is it possible to provide a back-up system, given it would cost the same as the original system?Notwithstanding the level of sophistication, technology can always malfunction.  Has it been indicated to the Minister whether the system can protect itself?  It is my understanding that the system is similar to that used in electronic voting in that such systems can be subject to intrusion.  Is protection built into the system to ensure that its technology cannot be externally targeted?
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	202	I will be brief because many questions have been asked.  I could not agree more with the Minister in acknowledging safety as our first consideration.  The annual income of the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, is €154 million.  Last year, it made €15.4 million in profit.  The system, which cost €115 million, is only five years old and has broken down five times in five weeks.  An investigation into this situation is required.  I have been given to understand that the answer may lie in the fact that the IAA upgraded its computer software a number of weeks ago, since when there have been intermittent computer malfunctions.  Will the Minister inform the House whether this is true?  If it is the truth, why has the old software not been put back in place given that normal practice is to keep old software until new software has been proven to function properly?I empathise with the thousands of people who have been delayed, particularly the elderly and those travelling with children at a busy time of the year.  Who will pay and why is there no back-up system?  In radiotherapy, we insist that every facility has two linear accelerators lest one breaks down.An external independent investigation is clearly required because nothing less will reassure the travelling public.  The safety of hundreds of thousands of people is at stake.  We must all ensure that taxpayers' money is spent appropriately.  The Minister should ensure that the investigation is independent and that its report is made available to the House in a timely fashion.

It must also be acknowledged that this problem could not have occurred at a worse time of year, given the peak holiday season.Regarding points that I may not have addressed, a back-up system is available to and being used by the IAA, but a valid question has been asked as to whether the IAA requires an exact duplicate of the system.

The system is the most sophisticated available, but one malfunction in five years is one too many.  The situation gives rise to the issues referred to by the Deputies and I will ask that they be addressed in the report.  The IAA's report will be based on facts and the best people to get those facts are those who operate and know the system.  That is the report that I seek and when we receive it, we can decide whether further reports are necessary.  Since the other points raised by the Deputies are technical in nature, I must await the report before responding.

Inné, d'ímpigh mo chomhghleacaí, an Teachta Morgan, ar an Rialtas an méid atá le déanamh acu go gearr-théarmach chun an gheilleagair a shocrú, a leagan amach go mion agus go díreach.  Níl na mionphointí mínithe dúinn go fóill.  Cad atá molta ag an Rialtas go meán-téarmach i dtaca le plean tárrthála chun iomaíochta an gheilleagair a choinneáil?  Cad iad na céimithe a thógfar láithreach chun oibrithe na tíre seo a athoiliúint — scileanna breise a thabhairt dóibh — os rud é nach bhfuil postanna ann dóibh go léir?  Tá mé chun na héilimh sin a chruthú athuair inniu.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh Airí in ann an méid atá romhainn, maidir leis an ngeillagar, a leagan amach go mion agus go díreach.The cutbacks announced by the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach on Tuesday were scant in detail and economically and fiscally short-sighted and they do not address the fundamental contractions in the economy due to inept policy decisions by successive Fianna Fáil-led Governments.  Refusing to link investment in public services with GDP, as is the practice in other European economies, has led to the State's substantial deficiencies in public infrastructure, namely, school buildings, hospitals, social housing and public transport.During the past two days, Minister after Minister traipsed through the House and minimised the current economic challenges while, in the same breath, defending their low-brow policy making of the past ten years that has led to this situation.  Suddenly, the A, B, C of sound fiscal management ignored to date is the order of the day.  Value for money in public expenditure should always have been a fundamental element of the State's budget management, but clearly it was not.The Taoiseach stated that we are in the same boat as the rest of Europe, but we are not.  Our economic decline is far more acute because Fianna Fáil and its Government partners believed it made sense to draw the State's income primarily from consumption and property.  They have left the Exchequer in the unenviable position of being precariously over-dependent on revenue from both sectors.  For this reason, the State is experiencing an acute decline in public finances.In addition to being unable to manage incoming money, the Government has been equally inept in managing the money going out.  Tuesday's measures testify to the wastage and inefficiencies that have been normal practice to date.  Only now when our back is against the wall does the Government propose to deal with tribunal costs, project cost overruns and the absence of fixed pricing.  One need not be an economist to know that value for money must always be central when public money is being spent.Despite all the obvious failures in managing the public purse, the Government appears intent on continuing its record of bad practice.  Assertions that the most vulnerable will not bear the brunt of the proposed cuts are not credible because experience tells us otherwise.  For example, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, has defended the clawing back of €45 million allocated to overseas development aid, justifying the decision by stating we have reached our overseas aid target for 2008.  This is an appalling tack to take, considering the global food crisis, which is hitting the developing world the hardest.  If there is extra in the overseas aid kitty, it should go to whom it was intended.  It is also worth reminding the Government that the UN target of 0.7% of GDP to be allocated to overseas aid by 2012 is a revised target because Ireland changed it a number of years ago.  If we have reached this year's target of 0.54% and if there is extra money, let us give it to those for whom it was intended and perhaps we will achieve the target of 0.7% this time.In May of this year, preceding a meeting of EU development Ministers, NGOs from all 27 member states launched a report entitled No time to waste: European governments behind schedule on aid quality and quantity.  If other European governments are behind, those of us in front have a responsibility to lead by example.  The Irish Association of Non-Governmental Development Organisations, Dóchas, stated at the time of the launch:In 2005, European governments promised with great fanfare to increase overseas aid.  The targets they set themselves are being missed, and the need to step up international aid is becoming more and more urgent.Dóchas is correct in its assertion.  According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, global prices of staple foods have risen by more than 40% or more in some cases in the past year, causing shortages of food, food hoarding and, in some instances, rioting for food in developing countries.  Rice prices alone have risen by 76% between December 2007 and April of this year.  While the global poorest of the poor have to fight for their food, the Government is withholding overseas aid budget allocations because it has reached an interim target figure.  Shame on the Government.With regard to how Government cuts will affect public services in this State, scant detail has been given with respect to how the Government will achieve €440 million in savings.  How exactly will the 3% cut in payroll costs be achieved in the various Departments?  What impacts will this have on service delivery?  Asserting that frontline services will not be affected by cutbacks is simply not credible in the absence of detailed data.How, for example, will the 3% cut affect the numbers of gardaí on the street and the provision of support services to tackle drug addiction?  Only this week figures were released which show a record number of heroin addicts seeking treatment.  Despite that, in the Dublin mid-Leinster area the HSE has already enforced a 1% cut in funding for addiction services.  Will the 3% cut be on top of that?  The 1% cut is affecting delivery of services already under strain.How many gardaí will be taken off the streets or away from Garda operations that are tackling serious drug and gun crime?  We need the data to evaluate what the Minister has put in front of us.  Will Garda overtime be further cut?  If so, this is a major decision that will have serious consequences, given that many of the major Garda operations against gun and drug crime in this city, such as Operation Anvil, are dependent upon Garda overtime.Cutbacks in key economic and social infrastructure projects will result in the period of recession we are now experiencing being prolonged.  Infrastructure has a critical economic and productivity value and must be protected and in turn delivered.  The social cost of not doing so is immeasurable.  Regeneration plans for the worst off areas in Dublin city are already falling apart with the announcement this week that the Bernard McNamara consortium is pulling out of four key projects.  The publishing of the master plan for regeneration projects in Limerick has been delayed, which does not bode well for delivery of the projects.  My Limerick party colleague, Mr. Maurice Quinlivan, is meeting the Limerick regeneration boards today to seek a commitment on the delivery of those projects on budget and on time.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	212	There has been much discussion about protecting the weakest and most vulnerable in society.  Minister after Minister has come into the House to give assurances that they will be protected.  I need to know how this protection will be ensured given the likelihood of significant cuts.  Not alone will they be unprotected, they are already suffering.  There is a need for home help but not alone is the huge demand for home help not being met, in the case of existing services the hours are being cut back.  I have been contacted by a large number of concerned constituents about this in recent weeks.  I have noticed a subtle shift of emphasis in regard to the granting of medical cards, again in regard to the people most in need of them.  If the people we describe as most in need are not being protected now, how will they be protected when the cuts kick in?  We were told that money for health and education would effectively be ring-fenced.  However, already in the health area people are clearly not being protected.  I worry about the day when the cuts kick in.  We now know that in the case of health, money has not been ring-fenced.During Private Members' business on the past two evenings we debated at length the pulling out of the Bernard McNamara consortium from public private partnerships.  One of those directly affects St. Michael's Estate in my constituency.  For ten years this area has been waiting for that development to go ahead.  It has been brought forward and moved back and there have been various shifts in regard to it.  Now, we know for sure that the developer is gone and these people are left in limbo.  What is the plan in regard to them?  We debated this and the blame is being sprinkled all over the place, but ultimately it comes back to the Government.  Again, we are moving into lean economic times and cuts.  When times were good we could not deliver on the critical housing needs of this very vulnerable sector.  What hope do we have now that the money is no longer available?  I would like a commitment, not platitudes.  Over the past two evenings we heard nothing but platitudes from every Government speaker and promises were made to take effective action.  Let us hear what that action will be and how it will be delivered.There is an ever-growing number of schools in my constituency that are in need of serious refurbishment or new buildings.  Some of those needs date back ten years.  Inchicore national school, Scoil Mhuire Óg in Crumlin, Loreto secondary school and, most recently, Our Lady's in Templeogue have been in touch with me and my constituency colleagues.  All of them are on a waiting list and all have received a "cut and paste" answer from the Minister to the effect that he will be in touch.  That is all they are being told.  We are told there will be no cuts in education.  Can we be assured of the capital programme that is so urgently needed for those schools and for the parents and pupils who have waited patiently?We are told there is no need to panic.  In regard to the threat of job losses, if one receives the number of requests I have received from people looking for advice on financial management and being sent on to MABS, one might start thinking that perhaps there is reason to panic, to be concerned about what people will do when they are unemployedLast week I obtained from my colleague, Deputy Shortall, the figures relating to the numbers on the live register for last year and this year.  In two of the social welfare offices that service my constituency there was an increase of 35% and 27%, respectively, for those two years.  The total number on the live register from the two offices was an extra 1,682 compared to the same time last year.  This information relates to a part of the city that was neglected and was just beginning to improve.  If we are to have chronic unemployment, what chance is there for those people?  What is the Government doing to ensure those people have a future to look forward to?I want to refer to the cuts in arts, sport and tourism.  The savings here come to a proposed €6 million.  The capital programme for the National Sports Campus Development Authority is being deferred.  What will happen to the contracts that were signed in April with the design team and the project management team?
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	213	I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this important motion.  I am also pleased to see the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Mansergh, who should be retitled the "Minister for Cutbacks", in the Chamber.  I understand he will have a central role in the paring back of many projects throughout the public service.If we are serious about cutting out flab and waste, the first action the Government should take is to reconsider the position of the 20 Ministers of State.  There is no case to be made for the continuation of six or seven of those offices, along with their associated entourage of officials.  The three Ministers of State currently in the Chamber, Deputies Mansergh, Hoctor and Curran, have useful roles, but the offices of ten to 13 of their colleagues are a perfect representation of the type of waste and flab the Government has overseen.  If the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the "Minister for Cutbacks", Deputy Mansergh, are serious about reform, they should give serious consideration to abolishing these offices of State, which would yield a saving of at least €6 million or €7 million.The more we have learned in recent days about the Government's new economic measures, the clearer it has become that there will be a vicious assault on current spending and that major capital projects are under serious threat.  We have been assured by a succession of Ministers that the focus of all savings will be a reduction in wasteful spending.  However, it is becoming clear that essential services, including in health and education, are being assailed on all sides by the Government.  Astonishingly, given the great pressures on the health service, €135 million is being cut from the health budget, with more than €100 million of that coming from the further deferral of the already much delayed fair deal scheme.Many citizens are already experiencing the harsh effects of current Government policies, such as the recruitment freeze in the public sector, and of Government mismanagement of resources in the health and education sectors.  In the third level sector, where investment for the future is vital, the Government is shamefully withdrawing resources.  Some years ago, the former Minister for Finance, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, told us of his intention to write a book setting out his achievements as represented by his successive budgets of the late 1990s and the early part of this century.  The most recent chapters of such a book would read as a horror story for the citizens of this State as the consequences of the budgets introduced by the Taoiseach in his previous capacity as Minister for Finance become apparent.We have learned belatedly that at least €22 million will be slashed from the budget of the Department of Transport.  The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, must explain whether these savings will be taken from road safety initiatives such as the promised investment in speed cameras and enhanced testing for drink and drug driving.  Many Deputies attended a meeting in Kildare Street yesterday with all the Transport 21 agencies to hear about their plans for the future.  There should be no delay in the delivery of critical capital projects such as metro north, the Dublin rail interconnector, the western rail corridor, the maintenance and expansion of the Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus fleets and the construction of Luas systems in Cork, Limerick and Galway.  Many stakeholders fear these initiatives are under serious threat.It is of great concern that the Taoiseach declined in recent days to offer a commitment to the House that the metro north project will be not delayed or abandoned as a consequence of the recession which he engineered.  There has been no announcement in this regard but there is an ongoing suspicion that, with a nod and a wink, metro north, the western rail corridor and other major transport projects will be severely curtailed.  The early planning stages for the interconnector, metro north and other projects must take place in the next year or two.  However, they could easily be delayed by the Government through the tendering and other processes.I acknowledge there are grave external factors relating to the "Cowen recession", as I have called it for some months.  I accept, for example, that the sub-prime crisis in the United States has had a grave effect on international liquidity.  I recognise too that we are at an epoch-changing watershed in regard to the price of oil.  We in this House and many others commentators, with the exception of Mr. Paul Tansey of The Irish Times, have not given enough attention to the role of the euro in the current difficulties.  The European harmonised index of consumer prices points to the striking fact that 80% of our loss of competitiveness arises from our membership of the eurozone.It is incumbent on this House to ensure there is no slashing of the funding for key transport infrastructural developments.  Most important, the impact of this "Cowen recession" must not be imposed on those least able to bear it, particularly in the areas of health and education.

In his previous capacity as Minister for Finance for the past four years, the Taoiseach shares the credit for this with his colleagues, predecessors, the social partners and the Irish people as a whole.Employment now stands at 2.1 million compared with  a figure of 1.1 million 20 years ago.  Net general Government debt has decreased in that period from some 122% to 12% of GDP.  Living standards, quality of infrastructure and social provision have all greatly improved.  However, we have not abolished the economic cycle.  Like Ireland, many countries are experiencing economic turbulence.  The challenge is to adjust our sails in time so that we can protect and consolidate our gains and be ready for when conditions improve.The Office of Public Works, which is attached to the Department of Finance, is making capital savings of €75 million, or 11%, from a total gross budget of €680 million.  Some €35 million of this will come under the heading of purchase of sites and buildings.  This saving has been identified from within the €82.5 million allocation for that purpose.  Some €25 million will be saved from the allocation for capital projects.  In the normal course of such a large building programme, some projects will be delayed because of the planning and tendering process.  Recent examples include the headquarters building for the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs at Knock and the Leinster House refurbishment project.  In addition, a saving of €15 million will be achieved under the flood relief works programme.  My officials are examining appropriate measures to meet the Government's targets of achieving savings on payroll of 3% by the end of 2009.  I have also asked them to examine other areas of expenditure such as consultancies, advertisement and public relations to identify opportunities for savings this and next year.Yesterday's announcement by the Minister for Finance that there will be a pause in the acquisition of accommodation for decentralisation is a prudent step which provides the Government with the opportunity to consider in detail two forthcoming reports on the implementation of the programme.  The Government recently agreed to an examination by the decentralisation implementation group, DIG, of the feasibility of phased moves by the State agencies.  This report is being finalised and is expected to be available shortly.  The Government also asked the implementation group of Secretaries General to examine the governmental and cross-departmental issues arising from the need to provide facilities for Ministers, Ministers of State and officials while in Dublin on business.  This report is being finalised and is also expected to be available shortly.  It is likely that further implementation of the programme will be done over a more extended timeframe.  The precise implications will be clearer when the reports to which I referred are to hand.Commitments already entered into in regard to the provision of permanent accommodation under the decentralisation programme will be fully honoured.  Where the building of property has commenced or where contracts to build are in place, work on such properties will be advanced and the programme of decentralisation in regard to those properties will continue.  Commitments already entered into in terms of the provision of advance or temporary accommodation will also be fully honoured.  The decentralisation implementation group has a sanctioning process in place to consider the case for the provision of advance parties and will continue to assess each proposal on its merits.It is not widely understood that there has been a positive net financial return from decentralisation and other related property transactions.  Capital expenditure to date by the OPW in the purchase of sites and procurement of buildings is in the order of €215 million.  Against this, in recent years, the OPW has realised in the order of €575 million for the Exchequer.  Sales of surplus property on the market amounted to the sum of €375 million.  The OPW has also entered into several joint venture deals with owners of adjoining properties to unlock the value of the combined properties concerned in time for the next commercial property upswing.  The net present value of these deals so far totals a minimum of €125 million, which is far in excess of the value of the properties had they been sold outright.  Similarly, the value of property transferred to the affordable housing initiative was in the region of €75 million.  The OPW has always sought to capitalise, where it can, on the rising property values of the last few years and we will continue to maximise the State's interest in obtaining excellent value for taxpayers' money.The Minister for Finance has asked me to establish a joint public procurement operation between the Office of Public Works and the Department of Finance.  I will be progressing this as a matter of urgency.  We will be bringing together officials from both organisations to drive a programme of reform and to produce a business plan to meet the Government's targets in the areas of procurement.  My intention is to bring this innovative plan with specific concrete proposals for savings to Government in the autumn.The Minister for Finance has asked that I target a minimum saving of €50 million for 2009.  In this regard, I will be looking critically at public expenditure on procurement across a wide range of sectors.  The range of categories is quite large involving €15 billion to €17 billion per annum including some €8 billion to €10 billion per annum on goods and services.  This will present a serious challenge to all concerned in this process.  Current levels of expenditure present us with serious opportunities to effect substantial savings in procurement through applying more efficient techniques, through a process of aggregation and a more effective approach to procurement methodologies.All areas will be critically analysed to ascertain where savings can be achieved, mindful of the need to maintain a high level of service across the sectors involved.  I will ask the group to develop proposals in the areas of IT, hardware and software, fleet purchase and fleet management, energy, fuels, stationery, consultancies, uniforms and furniture.My review group will actively consider and bring forward proposals for the improvement of the public sector approach to specialist and general procurement.  There must be a strong qualified cadre of staff dealing with this function, with detailed market knowledge and with the ability to employ hard-nosed techniques and approaches in this competitive market.  I have no doubt that at least €50 million of savings will be identified by the autumn.  The group will also progress the development of a business plan to reform public procurement and to assist other Departments and public service bodies in delivering further savings over the longer term.Following a comprehensive review of progress to date on the various work elements provided for flood relief, I now anticipate that the actual expenditure for the year will be €35 million, or a saving of €15 million.  This reduction in the predicted outturn generally reflects small delays in the progress of projects rather than the postponement or abandonment of any scheme.  These delays arise for a variety of reasons including the complexity of some projects, more time required for the assessment of tenders than anticipated and compliance with approval procedures.Contractors are already on site constructing flood relief schemes in Clonmel, Ennis and Mallow.  Subject to the completion of tender and approval procedures, works will commence in Carlow, Fermoy and Waterford later this year.  The single most significant saving of €4.5 million to €5 million arises from the fact that a project, which OPW was investigating with Ordnance Survey Ireland, to develop a digital terrain map of large areas of the country, is not now considered viable.No one should be in any doubt about the value of the arts as an integral part of the economy and society, not an optional or expendable extra.  Funding to the Arts Council has increased by over 70% and now stands at €82 million over the past six years, while spending on the whole range of arts and culture, including film, national cultural institutions and the capital arts infrastructure, amounts to over €220 million.Substantial employment, community participation and a strong tourism and educational dimension are involved.  All this should be borne in mind when assessing the support that this Government continues to give to the sector in more challenging times.  Overall, the bottom line is to keep moving forward where we can while limiting any avoidable damage.  Our resilience is undoubtedly being tested but I have no doubt that we will pass the test.Some comments were made by Deputy Broughan on the number of Ministers of State.  I am sure he was in the House when the numbers were expanded at the request of the Labour Party which also, for the first time, employed a full complement of programme managers and advisers.  I always find such comments to be more credible if they are a pledge by the party concerned about what it will do on the subject when it next finds itself in Government.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	218	Tá an-áthas orm an deis seo a ghlacadh labhairt faoi chursaí eacnamaíochta na tíre faoi láthair.  Tá an díospóireacht seo an-tábhachtach don sochaí go ginearálta.This debate is taking place against the backdrop of an increasingly difficult domestic and international economic environment.  While we face short-term problems which require action, the future for the economy remains positive.  While global economic conditions are very different to what they were last year, it is important that as a country we take pride in the significant achievements of the past, while setting objectives to secure future economic growth.The National Economic and Social Council has described Ireland's economy in the early 21st century as one that is "in transition to a new phase in its development".  While any such transition would be a challenge, a number of factors have combined this year to make the management of this transition all the more challenging.  The normalisation of new house building, which was signalled for some time, is welcome but the scale and speed of this adjustment is a matter of concern.  The rise in global commodity prices, especially oil and food, is causing major concern.  The euro has appreciated against the dollar and sterling, which impairs our ability to compete in these markets.  We are not alone, however, as other European countries and the United States are experiencing similar challenges.  We must now take corrective steps and I welcome the Government's action this week to restore confidence in the public finances.It is important that we do not talk down the economy.  It is clear that the national development plan is tackling infrastructural deficits with significant investment in the road and rail network.  Resources are also being provided with the upskilling, training and education our workforce needs.  The NDP is also supporting the enterprise and innovation sectors.  In my own constituency, NUI Maynooth has focused on innovation as it charts a new course for the college.  Its work in setting up the Innovation Value Institute ensures that it will become a relevant knowledge provider to local industries.  NUI Maynooth now has increased links with many multinationals and was recently appointed an education partner to Intel.  Nurturing relationships between knowledge providers and industries will assist with overall competitiveness and ensure that we maintain and attract industries to Ireland.  Colleges are now working hand-in-glove with industry to ensure that the research they are pursuing is relevant.  They are being supported, in part, by the Government-funded Science Foundation Ireland.The recent success of Abbott's plant in Clonmel, which last week won approval from the US Food and Drug Administration to sell its stent in the US market, has almost gone unnoticed.  However, the continued success in attracting such businesses to Ireland is down to a number of positive factors, including our track record in regulatory compliance, a talented labour supply and a prudent corporate tax policy.We now apply the lowest tax wedge on workers' incomes in the OECD.  In addition, a competitive corporation tax rate coupled with a young, educated and committed workforce, has led investors to locate here.  Companies such as Intel, HP and Wyeth in my own constituency are a testament to this successful policy mix at play, which is delivering both for enterprises and the country at large.I make these points in order to establish a balance in this debate.  The economy is facing challenges, but it is not closing down.  We need to take corrective action for long-term gain.  We also need to develop policies which will have the potential to stimulate the economy.  Continued investment in infrastructure will help to keep people at work and improve competitiveness.  With this in mind, I feel strongly that the Government should continue a PPP-type programme to build schools where required.  Now might be the time for the Government to obtain best value from the private sector, given the spare capacity that exists in the construction industry.In my own constituency, we are in need of further investment in school buildings.  Some of the required buildings could be bundled together for such a PPP programme, making it attractive for the private sector but, more importantly, good value for taxpayers.I welcome the commitment by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Mary Hanafin, to ensure that the less well-off are not negatively affected by the proposed corrective measures.  Carers, older people and the disabled will be the focus of concern for all Members of this House, so the Government's commitment in this area is welcome.The policies being adopted will ensure that we are well equipped to overcome these problems.  We are investing in human capital and infrastructure to secure future growth, as well as pursuing policies that protect the weaker in society.I commend the Government motion to the House.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	219	I welcome the opportunity to contribute briefly to this debate today.  I listened to the contributions of some of the previous speakers on the opposite side, in which they apportion blame to the Government for the economic situation the country faces.  Many of them have commented that we have simply squandered the boom.  Where have they been for the past decade or more?  Ireland has transformed radically in that period.Between 1997 and 2007 we halved the national debt.  Back then, €1 in every €6 was used to service the national debt, whereas now it is nearly €1 in €30.  When Luas was first mooted, it was considered pie in the sky.  Today it is probably the best transport system in Dublin, with other areas looking for exactly the same.  Deputy Upton spoke about the lack of development of certain projects in her area.  We all recognise that there are problems, but we should acknowledge the progress, be it on schools or rail stations that have been built in my area or upgraded major roads, such as the N7, the N4 and the M50.  The surplus generated over the last decade has been spent on those projects so it has not been squandered.  We have also increased the number of gardaí and teachers and introduced SNAs, which did not exist a decade ago.  It is unfair to say that the boom was squandered.  We invested in it wisely.The economy faces challenging times, but it is worth noting that the economy today is much better prepared than in the 1980s.  There are more than 2 million people working in this country.  Regrettably, unemployment is rising, but the figures compare favourably with the European average.  We should not talk ourselves into a recession.  The real challenge over the next two years is about how we manage the situation so that we can take advantage of global changes.  Oil prices, sub-prime mortgages and so on have had a negative effect, but not just on the Irish economy.The Government recently spelled out its changes in spending.  The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs said yesterday that all savings relate to administrative pay, as well as to agencies under the remit of his Department.  He also stated that there will be no change in the amount of money available for the various programmes.  The section of the Department under my control, namely, community and voluntary groups and drugs task forces, deals with the small groups that benefit directly from that funding.  It is important that they are aware that the commitment given earlier in the year remains.  As there is an onus on the Department to get the best value for money, those agencies that receive money must ensure that they are playing their part too.  The programmes that fall under my remit will remain unchanged.  The Minister and I, with senior staff of the Department, are going through everything line by line to ensure that the savings required will be achieved through the administrative side, not through programmes.I commend the Government motion to the House.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	220	I would like to share time with Deputy Reilly.I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me the opportunity to speak on this motion.  There has been a debate as to whether this has been an international downturn or a domestic downturn.  The reality is that there are elements of both.  There is an international credit crunch under way and we are suffering the effects of rising commodity prices.  However, there are significant domestic factors, but Ministers have not admitted that to any great extent.  The housing bubble has not burst in other countries to the extent that it has happened in Ireland, with the possible exception of Spain.  Rather than dealing with the housing bubble by responding to artificially low ECB rates, by discouraging the level of credit, the Government, particularly the Taoiseach, made it worse.  No measures were taken to deal with the fact that we had artificially low interest rates.  People were given 42% incentives to invest in property, in spite of the recommendation of the Bacon report that they be removed.  The banks were allowed to offer huge amounts of inappropriate credit to people like me, for example, and those people are now lumbered with a 100% mortgage.  No action was taken on stamp duty.The public finances were appallingly mismanaged, even as recently as in the last budget.  At a time when everyone understood that the economy was slowing and when growth was predicted at 4-5%, even though it now looks like there will be no growth, the then Minister for Finance decided to increase public spending by 10%.  Anybody can understand that this is no way to run an economy.  This happened consistently during the Taoiseach's time, and that of his predecessor, in the Department of Finance.We have also seen an appalling loss of competitiveness as Ireland has fallen from being the fourth most competitive country in the world in 1997 to 22nd place under this Government.  That is due to inflation, unjustified pay increases, an absence of public sector reform and an increased cost of doing business.  The cost of doing business has spiralled, through regulation, Government charges, local authority charges and a refusal to bring real competition into the electricity market, among others.  This country is now in a much worse position than most other European countries.  For ten or 15 years, Ireland was fortunate to out-perform the world, through a combination of good policy measures and good luck.The reverse is now happening and we are doing much worse than almost any other country in the OECD.  Growth in GDP has decreased by 5% on last year, something which has not happened in other countries.  Unemployment is rising ten times faster in Ireland than it is in the UK, yet the OECD estimates that unemployment will fall in 25 of its 30 countries.  No country has seen such a rapid turn-around in the public finances as Ireland as we are now going to be at a deficit of 3% of GDP.  Our deficit is about six times the OECD average.The time has come to challenge the narrative of the past ten years.  We have heard a little bit of that narrative from the Minister of State, Deputy Curran.  It may be an over-statement to say that the past ten years were squandered.  Some good things were done, but it was certainly a lost opportunity.  Consider what was done in similar boom periods in other countries, such as the post-war boom during the Adenauer years in Germany, the Atlee and Churchill years in Britain or the Eisenhower period in the US.  They used that incredible boom period to build a modern society.  They built a public sector that works and an economy that functions and they delivered high class infrastructure and public services.  That was not done in the past ten years here.In spite of a 50% increase in spending during the period in which Charlie McCreevy was Minister for Finance, we saw nothing like a 50% improvement in public services.  There was a 300% increase in spending in health, yet there was nothing similar in terms of service improvement.  Nobody can tell me that the health service is three times better than it was ten years ago.Some Members on this side of the House have been accused of talking the economy down, but one cannot talk the economy down.  It is bad policy that does that, not words.  However, if anyone has been talking the economy down, it is the Minister for Finance.  In the greater scheme of things, nobody really cares what I or Deputy Reilly thinks about the economy, but they care about what the Minister for Finance thinks.  The Minister stood up at an international conference in front of developers and investors from all over Europe, complained about the fact that he had the misfortune to be Minister for Finance and then told those potential investors that our economy had come to a shuddering halt.  When I hear Members opposite bleating about economists, journalists and Opposition politicians talking the economy down, I wonder how they can possibly have confidence in their Minister for Finance, especially when he says such things publicly and when he clearly does not want the job he has been given.In the past ten years, the Government should have prepared us for the inevitable downturn that was going to come at some stage.  Unlike any other country, Ireland had the opportunity to prepare for the downturn and generate large enough budget surpluses to now be in a position to reduce taxes, increase spending and invest in infrastructure rather than cut spending and increase taxes, but that was not done.  The fundamental duty of the Government over the past several years was to prepare for the inevitable downturn, lay the foundations for future growth and ensure we had enough resources to weather the storm.  The opposite course was taken which is the real disgrace of the Members opposite, with the possible exception of the Green Party which only came on board recently.The Government has announced plans to reduce spending by €500 million this year and by €1 billion in 2009.  When examined more closely, the savings do not seem credible.  There are some real cuts such as the €50 million in overseas development aid, affecting the poorest people in the world, and €100 million in the nursing home scheme, affecting the elderly.The rest of the cuts seem cosmetic.  There are no details as to which quangos will be abolished or merged.  This morning on the Order of Business, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment confirmed the Government does not intend to withdraw any of the five Bills which will establish new quangos.  Some cutbacks are proposed in departmental advertising and consultancy contracts, which are welcome, but it exposes the reality of the appalling and reckless overspend on advertising and public relations, particularly by the Green Party Ministers.  All over Dublin, billboards tell me not to water my lawn.  It might be appropriate to withdraw this campaign.  I cannot sit in my garden, anyway, because there has been so much rain lately.  To spend large amounts of Government money in the wettest summers in ten years telling us not to water our lawns is a kick in the face to taxpayers.It is proposed to reduce the public sector payroll by 3%.  This makes no sense to me.  The Government will go ahead with a 2.5% increase in public pay in September and obviously another pay increase next year, maybe 4%.  This will be an overall 6.5% increase in public pay.  How does one turn a 6.5% plus into a 3% minus unless 10% of public sector staff are dismissed?  I do not think the Government will want to do that either.  The Government seems to be operating on a wing and a prayer.  It is doing the bare minimum to keep the budget within the Maastricht criteria and hoping something will come up next year.  It will not happen.  The Government is not really tackling the crisis.The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has decided to cut €20 million from apprenticeships and the Skillnets programme in FÁS.  Many savings — even up to €100 million — could be made with FÁS but not with the apprenticeships.  That is one of the few things that FÁS does that is worth holding on to.  During the debate on financial peculiarities at FÁS, I released an extract from an internal audit report which I got from a freedom of information request.  This included comments about the matter in which advertising was placed by FÁS while its advertising agency was bypassed.  Last week on "Morning Ireland", I drew attention to the fact that a €100,000 contract was given to one local newspaper, which was referred to in the internal audit report.  Lest there be any confusion, I believe any impropriety or irregularities in this regard are on the part of FÁS and not on the part of outside advertising agencies or the local newspaper group concerned.  I would like to correct the suggestion that there is any effect in terms of the tickets that may have been exchanged in return for this particular contract.  I want to state once again categorically that to the best of my knowledge this Garda investigation is into FÁS and contractors and not the local newspaper group or any of the advertising agencies.  I look forward to the outcome of that Garda report and hope it produces some good results.I agree with the Labour Party Members that this is the Taoiseach's recession.  It was created by Fianna Fáil and is its legacy.  For the first time, it is being asked to clean up its own mess.  The recession cannot be explained away exclusively by international factors.  No other country is experiencing the job losses, the price increases, the exports loss or housing market collapse we are.  International factors have exposed how badly the economy has been run in the past five years.  This week's savings plan is an ill-conceived and half-hearted attempt by Fianna Fáil to clear up its own mess.  We are entering a tough period.  If the right decisions are made now, we have the prospect of a reasonable recovery in three years time.  If those decisions are not made, we are facing into a long-term downturn and economic decline.  My great fear is that is exactly where we are heading.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	221	I really wanted to address myself to the Minister for Health and Children who is not present although she will be later.  It would have been nice to hear the detail of her plans before I stood to speak.  In 2006, the Minister for Health and Children announced the fair deal scheme to address the inequities in funding of long-term residential care for our elderly citizens.  In December 2007, the Minister said she intended to introduce the legislation and have it passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas before the Christmas recess.  Plans have been put in place to have nursing homes inspected by HIQA to ensure they meet the required minimum standards.  I presume budgets have been provided to HIQA for these plans.In 2007, a sum of €110 million was earmarked for the commencement of the fair deal scheme.  The undue delay and blame game or referring to legal complications does not give our elderly citizens much comfort or confidence that the Government will introduce this scheme.  Is this the first time that the Department of Health and Children has dealt with patients who have diminished mental capacity?  This is an obvious provision that would be in any legislation dealing with elderly sick patients.The fair deal was promised for January 2008 but has now been scrapped by the Government.  We will no doubt be told it will be introduced in 2009.  However, with the Minister's current record and the Government's actions I have little faith the scheme will be introduced as promised.There is now to be a cutback of €85 million from the money ring-fenced for long-term care of the elderly.  On closer analysis, this is really €98 million taken from the elderly because the €13 million allocated for contract beds had already been announced last January and is separate to the €110 million.The first to feel the pinch are the most vulnerable, the elderly in our society who find the Minister picking their pockets yet again.  Many of them are still waiting for the return of the money taken from them and their families illegally by the Government.  These families have had false hopes raised by the Minister since December 2006 when first promised the fair deal legislation. It is always the most vulnerable who are first to be hit as they have the least voice and are the last to be heard by the Government.Moneys allocated in the past two years to mental health and palliative care were shifted into other areas.  Last year, the Minister promised cutbacks would not affect patients in autumn.  They have been felt with operations cancelled, outpatient waiting times lengthening, accident and emergency waiting times lengthening, home-care packages for disabled children removed and home help from the elderly removed.  The elderly have been led a merry dance for the past 18 months to find nothing at the end of the road.I have a constituent whose mother sold her house for a considerable sum of money and has spent €300,000 in nursing home fees.  The money is now gone and he has no idea how his mother will be cared for.  These are the real hardships which the Minister fails to see as she makes announcement after announcement but axes service after service.Many of these cuts are unnecessary due to the waste that occurs through the mismanagement of our health service under the HSE created by the Minister.  We have in recent times heard of redundancies, an action that should have taken before the HSE was formed.  This would have been normal planning in the merging of any two companies, let alone 11.  A management structure was put in place before a chief executive was appointed instead of allowing him to appoint his own.  Failure to bite the bullet on redundancies early on has resulted in large numbers of patients choking on that said same bullet and dying because of it.It was announced recently that some of the structures of the HSE will be dissolved.  While I welcome this, the HSE has been examining this option for the past 18 months but no details have emerged.  I would welcome more regional and local devolution of power across the pillars and more co-operation between the hospitals and the community.  This would get rid of the nonsense of a patient being left in a hospital bed at a cost of €3,500 per week because the primary, community and continuing care services will not take the patient on its budget and would only cost €1,200 a week.Through the lack of proper illness packages for people with diabetes, complications set in costing the State hundreds of millions per annum.  Through lack of detection further hundreds of millions are lost as complications develop in 50% of people by the time they are diagnosed.  Millions could be saved.  I ask the Minister to put in place chronic care packages for patients with diabetes and to talk to the insurance companies also.  In 2001 €350 million was spent on diabetes care; the figure now could be as high as €1 billion.At Cappagh Hospital operations have been cancelled one day a week for the months of July and August.  This will result in longer waiting times, people going to the NTPF and having their hips and knees replaced at three times the cost to the taxpayer — more waste.  The length and breadth of the country hospital wings are idle, as in Mullingar.  In the Taoiseach's backyard there is a new €80 million hospital in Tullamore which was idle up to one week before he became Taoiseach when some patients were placed in it to take the bare look from his backyard.  There is a countless number of wards to which this applies, including in Cavan, Clonmel and Sligo.  In UCH, Galway and Ballinasloe €4.6 million has been spent on intensive care beds, but there is no money to staff them.  The waste is incredible.  An excellent surgeon is standing idle at Monaghan General Hospital, with anaesthetists at the ready and a state-of-the-art theatre, built only five years ago.  However, he cannot operate because every patient must travel to Cavan.  The nonsense is just astounding.With regard to the cancer strategy, in Cork it is proposed to transfer 300 breast cancer cases per year from the South Infirmary Victoria Hospital to CUH which already has an 80% occupancy rate and lengthening accident and emergency waiting times.  We do not have the money to indulge in this shifting of deck chairs on the Titanic.  The service provided in the South Infirmary Victoria Hospital is excellent.  At over 300, the hospital carries out more operations than any other centre in the country and this year the figure is heading towards 400.  Why are we messing about?Where is there more waste than in the Mercy Hospital, Cork, in which I stood only last week, with state-of-the-art ventilators and incubators which are unable to be used?  People are probably dying because of this.  They could be used to improve patient care; we have the facilities but will not staff them.  It is outrageous.The primary care strategy is continually being talked up but, ultimately, it is not delivering any real change in patient care, except in a small number of instances.  A sum of €1.2 million per team was promised, but they will only receive €200,000.  Some 13 staff per team were promised, but they will only receive three.  In effect, nothing is happening.  No improvement is being seen.I said the Minister had allocated funding for palliative care, people with disabilities and mental health services but all of those funds were used for alternative purposes.  Clearly, this is a Government which has no idea of what a promise means, or how to keep it.  It lacks vision or a real reforming agenda and the country now finds itself in a recession.  In the boom years money was wasted.  There were no real reforms and nowhere is this more evident and the pain felt more than in the health service.  Now, because of the approach taken by the Government, the first to be hit will be the old and those with a mental and chronic illness.This is the Taoiseach's recession.  I do not have time to go through all the promises made in the programme for Government, including the task force on obesity.  During the boom the vulnerable and the weak were left behind and nowhere is this more evident than at St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane.  As regards the co-located hospital planned for the Beaumont Hospital site, a new unit was put out to tender in 2005 but has now been thrown at the back of the queue.  The Minister can pursue her ideology of private co-located hospitals, but in 2008 we have 23 men and 23 women in an open ward, with two feet between the beds, one block of three toilets and one shower unit and bathroom.  Now that we have hit bad times they are grabbed and placed at the front to take the hit first.  It is a disgrace.Make no mistake, this is the Taoiseach's recession.  It is the legacy of four years of appalling management on his part.  As my colleague said, it cannot be explained by international factors.  No other country is experiencing such a level of job losses, price increases, loss of exports and a house market collapse.  International factors have exposed how poorly the economy has been run in the past four to five years.  This week we have seen an ill thought out, half-hearted attempt by Fianna Fáil to clear up its own mess but, as usual, it is the old and the weakest, the least influential, who will not be heard by the Taoiseach because he does not listen to those who do not have a voice.

Let us be absolutely honest and clear that we are facing into a real economic storm.  We face difficult times, the likes of which we have not seen in at least two decades.  We must be honest in defining exactly from where it has come and how we can work our way through it, to provide a course for the people that will give them confidence as we face into difficult economic times.The difficulties in the economy are categorised by two fundamentally different problems.  These are the credit crunch and the lending difficulties we are seeing, as well as higher energy prices — a real crisis.  These are the two key driving factors.  We should accept that it is both an international and a domestic phenomenon.  There are features which are at play internationally, as well as here in Ireland.  We should be honest about this.Let us define the problem first.

This brought down inflation across the developed western world which, in turn, allowed central banks to lower interest rates, not just here but also in America, Britain and elsewhere.  This led to easy lending — indeed bad lending — coupled with speculative greed and property crises in——

We received warnings in the 1970s and 1980s, but did not heed them.  China and India required steel, oil and other energy resources.  Eventually the demand for basic commodities started to push inflation upwards which, in turn, triggered the financial crisis and there was no longer any cheap and easy money available.  It was an international phenomenon and it was the same here at home.  Let us be honest with each other.  We bought bigger cars because of the status they gave, built bigger houses with any number of bedrooms and bathrooms, regardless of how they were to be heated.  We flew to New York and, effectively, turned Madison Avenue into Grafton Street.

It was on the basis of cheap energy resources which are no longer available as we face a peak in global oil production.  Those structural problems define the storm we are facing.  This helps us to acknowledge and be aware of the reality in order that we can plot a course and start to deliver solutions.Let me outline a number of principles about the solutions we will deliver for the people.  First, we must recognise that, as a small island nation with an open economy, the solution will require us to be enterprising.  We will have to trade our way out of the problem.  Government solutions will not carry the economy into a new era.  It will have to be done on the back of inventive creative enterprise.  For that reason we will have to be international in our outlook.  It requires us to be active in international co-operation with our European partners and other countries in order that we will be well placed to allow our companies to trade in global markets.  That is a crucial principle.We will also have to have consensus on the path we take.  I am old enough to remember the last difficult period in the early 1980s.  Let us be honest and admit we spent seven years bickering about the solution that we all needed at that time——

It took us seven years until the late 1980s before we reached a consensus here and then we were much more able to deliver the solution that allowed the Irish economy to develop.  We need the same consensus today.  It worked back in the late 1980s and in the 1950s when we were faced with a similar crisis.  Consensus reached then about the opening up of our economy to international trade helped us to deliver the solution.  Let us try to seek agreement on the solution we will provide and not just bicker about what happened during the past ten years.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	245	Crucially, we need to recognise that sustainability is social sustainability and not only environmental and economic sustainability.  We will achieve consensus best when we bring all our society along with us and when we set our planning on the basis that it is not only pro-enterprise but includes the weakest in every section of our society on this new path that we have to take.I am confident that we have the right policies within our grasp, policies which are agreed on all sides of this House.  I do not hear Members opposite arguing against me when I say that developments of renewables and energy efficiency are the best way for us to tackle the energy storm we are entering into.  Nor do I hear anyone on the opposite side of the House disagree with the hypothesis that a new digital services economy and our expertise in ICT can give us the facility to develop our economic opportunities.  I do not believe there is any disagreement on that fundamental point.  The key job in my Department is to organise a fossil fuel retreat and the advance of a new digital economy.I want to give the Irish people a certain confidence that the policies are within our grasp.  One can read reports in the newspapers about the Gate 3 process on the development of wind energy; some 3,000 MW of electricity will be generated on top of the 1,500 MW that will be generated as we proceed with the Gate 2 process.  This process will generate large volumes of power and the fuel price will be zero and will remain zero regardless of what happens on internal markets.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	246	How will that be generated, given that no offshore wind projects will be delivered now?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	247	That is a development that is occurring and one we can progress in these difficult times in terms of energy resources.  We will face difficulties because in the short run electricity and energy prices will be high because of those international fuel issues.We must be linked internationally and on this island to ensure an effective response and build good transmission connections to have an effective electricity market that will result in a decrease in prices.  We are progressing with the east-west interconnector, which will provide international connectivity that will yield solutions.We can lift our construction industry by giving supports to people to retrofit their houses, which were built during the past ten to 30 years with poor insulation, to increase their energy efficiency in this new world.We have everything going for us to deliver ICT as our main fundamental driver of a new economy.  We have 200 of the world's leading ICT companies here, 600 of our own software companies and 400 companies involved in the digital leader services areas.  We have the right policies in place for the development of broadband, the education system and in Science Foundation Ireland to steer that economic development in a way that will help us.I visited one of those international companies in the health care sector — Vistacom, in Limerick — and met its management team of 15 people.  They might as well have been wearing Munster jerseys such was the pride they had in the efficiencies they were delivering each year to make sure their company was one of the main suppliers in the world of a very specialised product.  I walked away from them with a clear sense that the drive they are under every year to achieve 10% efficiency gains should be and could be mirrored by what we do in the public sector to ensure we play our part.  We need to be similarly efficient in how we provide services.The measures announced by the Minister for Finance can be turned to good effect by delivering the public services we want efficiently and effectively, as the private sector is doing.  Our Civil Service can rise to that challenge.  We are all wearing green jerseys in this difficult period.  Such consensus and co-operation in the public service and in the private sector will see us progress in the period ahead.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	248	The Government has clearly signalled its commitment to education by providing more than €690 million more for education in this year's Estimates, with a total allocation of more than €9.3 billion for the education sector.  This considerable investment has been used to continue to implement improvements at all levels of our education system from primary right through to postgraduate level.  Increased numbers are participating in all levels of our education system, including further and higher education.  We are investing in developing and reforming our higher education system and investing significantly in research.  We have targeted provision of resources for children from disadvantaged areas, special education and the language requirements of newcomer children.The additional allocation in 2008 has enabled us to provide for more than 2,000 extra primary teachers since last summer.  Capital investment continues with almost €600 million being spent on school building projects this year alone.  Following the Government's deliberations, my Department is aiming to make savings of €6.6 million this year through efficiency measures across the sector to contribute to the Government's overall adjustment measures.  To put this in context, the €6.6 million represents only 0.7% of the overall allocation of €9.3 billion this year.With changing economic circumstances, this Government must carefully manage the public finances to ensure that as a country we work through the current difficulties and challenges in a manner that ensures past improvements in services can be consolidated and improved upon into the future.We must take action now to ensure that when there is a cyclical upturn and a recovery in economy growth we are positioned to capitalise on that.  The Minister for Finance has made it clear that we must now act to make sure that the financial situation facing us in 2009 is not even more difficult.  He has made it abundantly clear that we are not taking what might appear to be the easy option advocated by some, that we go down the futile and damaging road of trying to deal with the downturn by further large-scale borrowing.I know that the measures being implemented by the Government will help us to ensure that into the future our education system can continue to be improved and play the vital role it has played in the lives of individuals and in the economic and social life of the country.The overall level of administrative costs in the Irish education system is quite lean, relative to international comparisons.  Nonetheless, we must still ensure that efficiencies are achieved by targeting payroll, advertising, consultancy and PR and other costs and by seeking out any other general administrative efficiencies we can make.  This is the challenge for my Department, for all its agencies and for the institutions in the higher education sector.  The measures being adopted now are that vital first step.  By taking them now we are applying immediate corrective action that will produce further savings on a full year basis in 2009.I would like to give some details of the expenditure savings and other measures on foot of the decisions taken in order to deal with the expenditure pressures.  In line with the Government's decision, payroll costs in the education sector will have to be reduced.  This means restrictions on recruitment will have to commence immediately commensurate with ensuring a reduction of 3% on payroll costs in 2009.  This measure will apply to my Department and to all agencies and bodies across the sector, including the higher education institutions.  However, the Government has decided that an across the board adjustment of 3% would not apply to front-line staff in primary and post-primary schools and this includes schools in the VEC sector.  This aspect of the Government's decision exemplifies the prudent and careful approach we are taking in applying restrictions.The increase in teacher numbers in recent years reflects the particular pressures applying to schools as they respond to demographic pressure and accommodating children with special needs.  This requires us to distinguish the position of schools from the rest of the education sector.  However, we need to ensure resources for schools are efficiently targeted in accordance with the criteria for their allocation.  The overall number of teachers and special needs assistants in schools will be agreed by my Department and the Department of Finance.  All schools, including those in the VEC sector, will open next September with their teacher allocation that has already been approved.  Deputy Hayes should take note of that.In line with the Government decision that administrative efficiencies must be achieved across the public sector, the education sector must achieve reductions in spending on consultancy services, advertising and PR this year, by at least 50% in 2009.  My Department will inform all its agencies and bodies of budgetary adjustments that will be necessary immediately and the measures that must be taken to ensure they achieve the payroll reduction of 3% in 2009.In the higher education sector the detailed apportionment of the savings between institutions, core funding and funding for the strategic innovation fund and research programmes will be communicated to the institutions by the HEA following consultation with my Department.  All the relevant budgets for 2009 will be framed and allocations will be determined on a basis that takes full account of the required 3% reduction.  Over and above the specific measures decided by the Government, I must ensure I deal with any emerging pressures.  I will need to exercise tight budgetary control until year end and deal with pressures as they emerge by taking any other measures needed to underpin the Government's overall fiscal requirements, particularly with a view to preparing the budget for 2009 in the context of the new realities we face.This Government has prioritised, and will continue to prioritise, education.  I repeat the reductions to be achieved represent 0.07% of my Department's overall allocation.  I emphasise there is no reduction in capital investment.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	251	What is, perhaps, as worrying in this debate as the economic figures themselves, is that there is no recognition whatsoever from Government that its mishandling of our economy has contributed to this fiscal crisis.  Not for the first time, the Government is in denial, blaming everything and everyone but itself for the state of the public finances.  It is the fault of international factors beyond its control and if it had not been for all those doom merchants talking down the economy, things would not be half as bad.  Unfortunately, the Government has waited, blind to and refusing to accept the reality of deep problems developing in the economy, and doing little or nothing to remedy the situation until now, when we have been confronted with the shocking and undeniable facts that surround the collapse in our financial revenue streams.However in typical Fianna Fáil self-righteous fashion, when we in the Opposition call it as it is and point the finger squarely and directly at the primary cause of this boom to bust fiasco, we are accused of playing politics.  The problem with that defence is that we were also accused of playing politics when, after each of the last three budgets, Deputy Bruton warned of Ireland's waning competitiveness, over-reliance on tax revenue from unsustainable growth in a booming property market and increases in current expenditure that were more than two and half times our economic growth rates.  Deputy Bruton also warned of the Government spending a fortune on setting up more than 250 extra quangos to do the job that many Government Departments could and should have been doing and creating a bigger and bigger public service wage bill without any regard to efficiency gains or ensuring value for money.Our Taoiseach, while Minister for Finance, kept increasing current expenditure as if the boom would last forever.  Now we are all suffering the consequences of having to slam on the brakes, as the Government flounders to find a way to make the savings needed to merely limit the damage in terms of how much this country will have to borrow this year to pay the bills.  Nobody on this side of the House is claiming that international factors do not contribute to the challenges the Government faces.  However, the failure to prepare for an economic shock and the inevitable slowdown, during a decade of unprecedented wealth creation, will be a lasting criticism and indictment of this Government.Other countries are affected by the same international conditions as Ireland but are not suffering to anything like the same extent that we are, despite what Ministers repeatedly say.  Unemployment fell in 24 of the 27 EU member states in the last year.  No other country in the OECD is threatened by negative growth.  So let us nail this lie that Ireland is helpless in the eye of an international storm of economic problems.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	254	The Minister should listen; I am about to outline some.  The time to reform, whether in the public service or even in the way Government itself functions, is in times of plenty when we can afford to do it.  The time to invest in long-term programmes that drive Irish competitiveness is when capital is available to the State.  The time when political leadership is needed to challenge a culture of waste and promote a new ethos of efficiency is when money is freely available to be abused.  Unfortunately, the Government has shown leadership in none of these areas but has contributed to embedding a culture of waste in the provision of public services.  The philosophy has always been, "why take hard decisions when we can throw money at the problem?"  The money has run out, yet we still face the necessity of bringing about that public sector reform that Fine Gael has proposed for years.  We now have to do it against a backdrop of growing unemployment, increasing social discontent and a rapidly shrinking public purse.Despite this reality, even when the Government is on the rack, it still has the neck to come up with a motion like the one we will be voting on later today, "commending" itself "for the substantial investment made in consolidating and enhancing Ireland's economic competitiveness".  Enhancing Irish economic competitiveness — is the Government deluding itself?  Since 2001, we have fallen 11 places in the World Economic Forum standings, down to 22nd, and in terms of overall physical infrastructure we now rank 55th.  In the Institute for Management Development, IMD competitiveness rankings Ireland has dropped seven places since 2001.  Similarly, Ireland's competitiveness ranking in the EU has plummeted from top spot to mediocrity in the middle of the table.  Instead of enhancing competitiveness, we have reduced Ireland's attractiveness as a place to come and do business versus competitor destinations.  What is so frightening is that even when presented with the facts, independently verified, the Government is still in denial, congratulating itself in this motion on what it has done for Irish competitiveness.  It has no credibility on this issue.Deputy Cowen's tenure as Taoiseach will be judged by how he handles the economic and political challenges that face him, which he created for himself.  His response has not been inspiring.  The Government's remedy, announced this week, includes little more than vague proposals for cutbacks in payroll expenditure within Departments, an abandonment of the Government's decentralisation fiasco, a rationalisation of quangos, a reduction in the development aid budget, which is a cheap shot if ever I saw one, and a proposal to reduce staff in the health services.More importantly, despite the vague cutback plans, where is the economic stimulation or revival package that is needed?  Where is the signal from the Taoiseach that he understands how to stimulate growth and drive Ireland back up the competitiveness league table again?The 50,000 people who have lost their jobs in the past year do not want social welfare payments.  They want their jobs back, or at least the assurance that they will be able to find employment in the near future.The Taoiseach said his announcement this week does not represent the Government's full response to the challenges we face, that it was merely an immediate response to Exchequer results.  When will we see the Government's plans to get Ireland back on track?  The country needs leadership right now from the Government but what we have instead is Ministers limping over the line, looking forward to the summer recess.There are few areas, in terms of infrastructural development, where the Government's record is worse than in the rollout of high-speed broadband provision.  With the exception of investing in metropolitan area networks, the Government has shown no vision or urgency in creating what can be described as a "fibre nation"——

I am also delighted that Archbishop Ryan has stayed in the pews to listen to us mere mortals, having delivered his sermon on the mount earlier.  The Government needs to show more humility than it has to date in this debate.The very first thing we need is some straight talking, rather than sermonising or fascinating lectures from mushrooms and the like.  We need to cut out the spin machine so regularly deployed by this Government.  Above all else this Administration, if it is to be taken seriously again by the Irish people, needs to show some humility instead of the arrogant swagger and cockiness that are such hallmarks of Fianna Fáil's years in office.We are in an era of cutbacks; so let us call it as it is.  I note the Minister is shaking his head again.  His Government announced cutbacks today and yesterday and the Minister will not even be honest with the people.  I believe, taking from the sermon from Archbishop Ryan, that we need a new honesty in this debate.  We need to be straight with each other so let us call it as it is and stop the baloney in which the Minister and his Administration are involved.

I note the Minister is leaving — we should all be on bended knee.  Yesterday payroll cutbacks in the VEC and higher education sectors were announced.  We did not hear this on Tuesday, as the spinning machine went out of control and we were led to believe that no axe would fall in the Department of Education and Science.  If this is a new era, it was a bad start from a Minister for Education and Science who has been, quite frankly, all over the place on the issue in the last few days.  He comes to the House today and announces there will be clear restrictions on recruitment.  In response to his suggestion that there will be no loss of front-line staff, I have a straight question — does that also apply to part-time staff?  Does his commitment to the House today that there will be no loss of teachers in front-line positions also apply to part-time staff?  He and I both know part-time staff make up a very substantial cohort of teachers within the profession.What is far more concerning is that the Minister went on to say he has still to involve himself in serious discussions with the Minister for Finance about next year.

If this is a new era of honesty, as the Archbishop claimed earlier, why will the Minister not tell us which of the 56 priorities will be shelved?  At the moment, the programme is a wish list and does not have any semblance of reality.  The Minister is trying to fool teachers, school managers and those interested in education into thinking that he can now achieve all of those promises.  What we want from this Government is an honest appraisal of what can be done at this stage.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	277	When the Minister said he was introducing the payroll cost reduction across the VEC and higher education sectors, why did he not say in the same breath that he was prepared to amalgamate or abolish some of the agencies under the aegis of his Department?  I have already outlined three agencies in the area of special needs which could be amalgamated into one, thus reducing costs and providing more money for front-line staff.  If the Minister takes up my challenge and joins me in that task, I will support him.  What I will not support, however, is——
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	278	I invite Deputy Hayes to join me.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	279	——a reduction in front-line staff, in services to our children and in the opportunities this State owes to them.  After almost 11 years in office, the Government has wasted the opportunity that the Celtic tiger economy presented for education.  Approximately one in four primary school classes now have 30 children or more, which means that 104,000 children are in oversized classes.  No progress will be made on this in the coming years.  Promises made in 2002 and 2007 about reducing class size have been set aside in a most cynical fashion.As the Minister has admitted, over 900 schools depend upon prefabricated and temporary accommodation and approximately €35 million is wasted every year on the rental of such accommodation.  That is another black mark against this Government and the Minister in failing to provide decent accommodation for our children.  A total of 25% of all schools in the country have building projects before the Department.  However, as the Minister informed the Dáil yesterday and today, there is not a chance in hell of those projects being advanced because we will see a major drying up of capital resources next year and beyond.  This means that some of the worst examples in terms of accommodation will be left hanging on a list with nowhere to go.I am most disappointed that Archbishop Ryan did not stay in the Chamber to hear about the commitment that was given under the national development plan that €252 million would be spent on improving technology in our schools.  Not one brass farthing has been spent in the past four years and we are at rock bottom of the EU league table when it comes to spending on technology.  When will we get this money?  When will the Minister for Education and Science produce his report on information and communications technology, about which he gave me a commitment two weeks ago?  When will the report be produced and when will the money follow from it?

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	285	Schools are now facing spiralling costs for fuel, water and waste collection and the Minister has said he will do something about that in the near future, which I welcome.  However, now is the time that schools are finding it very difficult to survive.  An average debt of €23,000 applies in many schools.  The real scandal is that ten years after this Government assumed office, it takes on average 26 months for a child to get speech and language services in west Dublin where I live.  I suspect it is no different in other parts of the country.  Is this not a disgraceful statement of where this country is in terms of our commitment to its most vulnerable children?  We cannot even provide the most basic occupational services to those children today.The Minister has had a bad week.  His spin machine went out of control and his 3% cuts will make a big difference in the post-primary and higher education sectors.  I know that next year will be more difficult.  The Minister has a job to do to defend his Department and ensure he gets the maximum return from his discussions with the Department of Finance.  The Minister has shown he is not up to the task in terms of the outrageous cutback he announced yesterday.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	286	I will make a few points in the short time available to me.  The Minister of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources was right in saying we are facing into a storm.  In a way, we are facing into what could be described as the perfect storm.  Inflation is at 5%, the highest it has been for quite some time.  Unemployment is rising rapidly.  According to a report today, electricity costs are due to rise by 20% in October.  We are in a housing crash, interest rates are rising and the Dáil is going on holidays.  The Government is out the gap.  The Minister of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources spoke about consensus.  Each Minister should come before the relevant Dáil committee to report in detail what they intend to do regarding their spending cuts.The Government presented Members of this House with a three-page document.  This is what we have received as Members and the Minister talks about consensus.  The document talks about how measures relating to the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism will be spread across various bodies.  This is the information the Minister has given, or is perhaps only able to give.  That is all we have.  It is stated that the Department of Finance will deliver the REACH programme at lower cost and that there will be additional control measures in respect of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There is no detail.  As a Member of this House, I expected a full report from every Minister at this stage detailing exactly what they are going to do.  This House and the people deserve no less but it is not there which makes me very worried.Ministers should go before every Dáil committee between now and the end of July and report in detail on their plans.  Otherwise, we have something to be really worried about.  I noticed that one of the first things axed by the Department of Social and Family Affairs is the personal advocacy service.  Again, it is very worrying that people with disabilities will suffer.  We have already noticed a major slowdown in the release of funding this year to service providers.  These are people and organisations which raise almost 50% of their funding themselves and are not getting the money from Government or are getting it at a very slow pace.Part of the reason we face this problem is because of the Government's refusal to engage in significant reform of how we carry out our business in this House.  This encompasses reform of both the Dáil and committees so that all of these issues can be debated and thrashed out.  The Government has refused to do that and treats the Opposition and all the Members here with disdain and arrogance all of the time.  The Government must clean up its own mess.  I do not know how will it do this without all of its consultants and PR machinery behind it but we will watch and see.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	291	I entered this House in 1987.  At that stage, the economy was in tatters.  Tens of thousands of young people were emigrating, unemployment was 17% or 18%, inflation was through the roof and there appeared to be a very bleak future.  The Acting Chairman will remember how the phrase "Will the last person leaving the island switch off the light?" was coined.  A Fianna Fáil Government assumed power in 1987 and took very decisive action to reverse those trends and to lay the foundations for future prosperity.As a young backbencher, I learned a few good lessons from that.  The change and turnaround in the next 20 years was done on the basis of social partnership with unions, farmers, employers and Government.  I must acknowledge that at that time, it was done with the assistance and support of the then Leader of the Opposition, Alan Dukes, as part of his famous Tallaght strategy which cost him his place as leader of Fine Gael some time after that.The other lessons I learned from that experience was that decisive action in the national interest should always take precedence over short-term political popularity and that people will support action, no matter how difficult it is, if they perceive it to be necessary and proportionate.  While the economic challenge about which we are talking today is not as serious for our economy as the one we faced in the late 1980s because of the progress we have made, we have difficulties which we must and will tackle.On Tuesday, this Government made the necessary tough choices.  We took these tough decisions now to avoid even tougher times later.  The budget shortfall, which is driven largely by the change in the economy, the rise in unemployment because of difficulties in the construction sector, oil prices and the international banking crisis, dictates that we must focus even more of our resources on the productive areas of the economy and ensure we protect the most vulnerable in society.With the decisions we have taken, I believe we have done that.  I have no doubt some of the decisions we must take will be unpopular.  We knew that when we made them.  Governments do not have the luxury of just making popular decisions.  They must make hard decisions that affect people at times.  Despite what the media and commentators might say, politics is hugely relevant to the people and decisions we make here on all sides of the House have an affect on the public.  However, we believe that these decisions will yield the greatest benefit while we navigate the current economic turbulence we are experiencing.I will outline the changes to my Estimates as part of the Government effort to consolidate the budget for 2008.  Savings of €20 million in capital funding will be made in the Department of Transport this year.  Savings of €133,000 in the administrative budget of the Department will be made this year.  Further savings of €156,000 will be made through efficiencies in the agencies funded by the Department.  Savings of €1.9 million will be made in the Department in the area of consultancy-payroll costs, advertising and PR.  A saving of 2% will be made in 2009 in the area of procurement.  In common with other Departments, a saving of 3% will be made in 2009 in the area of payroll costs.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	300	If the Deputy wants to do his sums, he has plenty of time to work it out during what they call the holidays.  The NDP is the basis for continued investment in our economic infrastructure in the years ahead.  Investment in key transport infrastructure remains a priority.  Now more than ever, we must ensure we achieve value for money across all areas on public activity, including expenditure in transport projects.Out of a gross spending budget of over €3.8 billion for my Department in 2008, I can manage the €20 million saving in capital funding this year without impacting on the delivery of our infrastructure projects.  The bulk of the saving of €20 million is in the non-core capital budget.  As much as €13 million will arise in the capital expenditure grant scheme for regional airports.  There has been a slow drawdown of these grants by the airports due, I understand, to factors such as planning delays and the necessity for the airports to come up with their share of the capital project costs.  So far this year, the drawdown is €2.5 million of the €24 million allocation, a spend which is considerably less than anticipated.  Spending on property acquisition for metro north has also been slower than anticipated and I envisage the bulk of the balance of savings on capital, €7 million, will come from there, in addition to lower costs.

It is not political and I will write to him if he wants me to.  We are in the middle of a procurement process for metro north.  Bidders have submitted bids and must finalise bids before the end of the year.  Casting doubts on the future of metro north in this House could give rise to difficulties with the tender process.  I ask the Deputy to accept my assurance that the tender process will go ahead, as will the project if it is in the budgetary limits we set.  I know Deputy Broughan is trying to ensure it goes ahead but raising doubts about it in the House does not help the tender process.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	303	Then the Minister should not have touched it.  Why did he touch it?

This is money we brought forward but which we cannot spend because we have not acquired the properties.  In addition, some property we intend to purchase now costs less than it did because of the downturn in property prices.In respect of 2009 the Government has decided that payroll costs must be cut by 3% by the end of the year.  The payroll savings will be achieved through a range of measures, including control of numbers recruited, tight management of overtime and other costs.  This will pose challenges for the Department but I am confident we can meet them.  Savings of 2% in the procurement of goods, services and capital works must also be achieved together with a saving of at least 50% in public relations, advertising and consultancy expenditure.  Savings arising from the efficiency review carried out by my Department on foot of the Minister for Finance's budget day announcement will also be taken into account.This year, my Department will make savings of €1.844 million on publicity campaigns and consultancies.  Spending proposals for 2009 will need to be examined critically to comply with the Government's decision.  This will be undertaken between now and budget day and my Department is already doing preparatory work so that it can make an effective input to the decision-making process.A key objective for me is to ensure that the momentum, which has built up in the Transport 21 investment programme over the past two years, is maintained.  This investment is of critical importance to sustaining our economic competitiveness.  A number of projects have been completed and many more are either under construction or well advanced in planning.  Excellent progress is being made on the national roads programme and I am confident that the five major inter-urban routes will be completed by the end of 2010.New rolling stock and improved services are being introduced across the intercity rail network and the capacity of trams on the Tallaght Luas line has been increased by 40%.  In addition, construction is under way on the Luas extensions to Cherrywood and the docklands and on the Cork-Midleton line, the western rail corridor and Kildare route rail projects.  Important planning work on public transport projects, including two key strategic projects in Dublin, metro north and the DART interconnector, is progressing well.A total of €2.6 billion in Exchequer capital has been allocated to Transport 21 projects and programmes in 2008.  Due to the policies of successive Fianna Fáil Governments we face the current global economic downturn in a much better position than in previous unfavourable economic conditions.  Stripping away the construction sector, the rest of the economy is growing at 4%.  We have a young, well educated population capable of adapting to adverse conditions.  Previously, our isolated economy meant we only had recourse to tax and spend in difficult times.  We are now in a position where, despite the negative global economic megatrends we are exposed to, we can still make choices.  The Government has consistently shown it makes the right choices.  We are creating efficiencies by reducing the growth in expenditure across a series of areas to redress our budget.  We are focusing on those productive areas that will yield the greatest returns to the Exchequer which in time will strengthen the Irish economy.The Irish public consistently selects Fianna Fáil in government because the public recognises the ability of Fianna Fáil to maximise the benefits to our open and globalised economy.  We had the courage and vision to chart a course that made us a leading light in the global economy in the past 20 years.

Deputy Broughan would like to hear what else I have to say on this but I will give way to my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, and send Deputy Broughan a copy of the speech.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	307	I thank the Minister for the opportunity to speak.  This is a good exercise on behalf of the Government.  The Opposition has been vocal in asking where the cuts will be and how many dispossessed and disadvantaged people the Government will discommode.  Each Minister and Minister of State has laid out exactly where the savings will be made within each Department.  That is a good exercise.  When we open our newspapers, we can see where the savings are being made under each heading.  This informs the House and the electorate at large on the strategy.  I thank the Whips for arranging these statements in which we have set out our stall.  No one can say he or she did not know.  Each Minister and Minister of State has been told to come in and tell it as it is and that is the way it should be done.Listening to Opposition Deputies today and yesterday, one would think that this downturn occurred only in Ireland, as if a big, bold witch came along and decided to single out Ireland as the place where there would be an economic downturn.  Of course, it is not so.  This is a global downturn, not one visited exactly on this country.  I am sure many of us look at BBC or Sky News at night and see the travails of what is taking place in Britain.  Seeing Gordon Brown and what is going on there, we know well that if it just afflicted us, it went quickly across the water and to many other countries of which we read.I am amazed at the strident contributions suggesting that Fianna Fáil threw it all away for the past ten years as if we put all the taxes in big black bags and dumped them in incinerators, if one is allowed to do so.  That is not so.  I look at schools with extra teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs.  Up to eight years ago, there was no such thing as SNAs, as the Acting Chairman will know from his education times.  An SNA might as well have been a foreign body.  Certainly up to eight years ago, and perhaps up to a decade ago, there was not such a person in the classrooms of Ireland.  There is now and they have made a marvellous difference.  Everyone wants the best for people with disabilities.  There are halos not just on the Opposition side, everyone wants good for people with disabilities.I see children who are happy with the SNA, happy going to school, knowing that their special, private, personal needs are being looked after by a well motivated person.  There are training outlets open to these people, where they can be trained so that they are better professionals.  That is a wonderful initiative so money spent there has not been wasted.  It is money that will have a major input into the person's upbringing.With regard to roads, next Wednesday, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, will come to the Moate intersection and he will open the last leg of the Dublin to Athlone motorway.  I will go out of my house, get into the car and 50 yards from where I live I will come to the motorway.  Of course, one comes to a dead end at the M50 and this is where the difficulty lies.  Massive work is being done there too.This road is ahead of target.  It is within its budget and is ahead of time.  Was this wasted money?  Ask anyone who travels between Athlone and Dublin.  Did people think it was not a good job?  Of course it is a good job, it is well merited and it is great that we have it.  I hope the Athlone to Galway leg of that motorway will be completed as swiftly.We see all the benefits which accrued in education.  With regard to health, I frequently stand up and rightly give out about the vagaries of the HSE because it does not know whether it is coming or going, to whom it should report and what it should report on.  That is its largest difficulty.  However, my elderly neighbour tells me he visits Portiuncula Hospital on a monthly basis and Galway Regional Hospital on a three-monthly basis for various tests which he must undergo and he is treated with the utmost courtesy.  He is rarely left waiting.  He has a medical card and finds he gets great service.I try to catch myself picking out the bad and tell myself to ease on because it is not all that way.  Major advantages have accrued through the health service for people up and down this land.  However, people do not usually talk about them because they are so happy to have gone in and out of hospital, escaped it all and be back in good health.  I can also see the roads and what has been done for children with disabilities.I wish to make a plea for funding for schools and the construction of physical buildings for schools.  Yesterday, we had three deputations, one from Longford and two from Westmeath, one from a primary and two from post-primary schools.  They sorely need new schools.  They had reached the point of going to tender and they were told to stop.  Money borrowed for infrastructural work such as schools would be money well borrowed and spent.  If the school is sound, the children will be happier to attend and a better type of education will be provided.If I were to have a plea it would be that the spending on school construction should continue in the Estimates round-up which will gather pace during the summer and the early autumn.  Let this spending continue because it will be money well spent and it will lift the industry.  Let no one be under any illusion that this is a soft way to go into a downturn.  The Taoiseach has been emphatic in stating that if further cutbacks are needed they will be made and if there is a need for scrutiny and rescrutinising of all Government heads and subheads in the Estimates, that will be done.  However, I would exempt capital spending of a beneficial nature to those living in the country.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	308	I will start with a quote from the late, great American economist, John Kenneth Galbraith, who stated that "Politics is not the art of the possible.  It consists in choosing between the disastrous and the unpalatable."  I have a feeling this is where Fianna Fáil is at present.As always, Shakespeare got it right, "When sorrows come, they come not single spies but in battalions".  Today, as though to pile the misery on this incompetent and scared Government, the consumer price index shows that inflation is back at 5%.  This follows the disastrous Exchequer returns of last week, confirming that by year end the tax returns are likely to be €3 billion short of even the revised forecast.The Exchequer returns were preceded by the gloomy ESRI report which acknowledged what this Government has refused to admit that the economy is in severe difficulties, most of them home-grown by this Government.  Governments love to blame external factors for every crisis.  If things go well and oil is cheap Ministers smile and take the credit.  When things go wrong and the price of commodities goes through the roof they wring their hands and state, "its not our fault".So who killed Cock Robin and where has all the money gone?

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	310	Miss Marple or Hercule Poirot with his little grey cells would have little difficulty in identifying three prime suspects, the Government, the banks and the construction industry.  What was the motive?  Greed for money on the part of the banks and construction industry and greed for votes on the part of Fianna Fáil.The Government, and more particularly the former Minister for Finance, now Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, boosted pre-election spending in 2006 and 2007 to the point of reckless endangerment.  He was the darling of the banks and the building industry who cheered him on to blow the bubble even bigger.  Cheap credit and globalisation eased the path for the banks while Deputy Brian Cowen stuffed the building industry full of juicy tax-breaks that drove land prices and construction inflation higher and higher.When I pointed out to him that the State was losing hundreds of millions of euro every year in stamp duty evasion by the big builders while young couples paid large amounts of stamp duty on modest houses in Drumcondra and Glasnevin he refused to close the loophole, even though he acknowledged that the loophole in 2006 alone allowed the construction industry to evade €260 million in stamp duty.  Now the bubble has burst and it is the ordinary Joe and Josephine who is paying for the fall-out and the bail out.Some budgets ago, as Deputy Brian Cowen was Minister for Finance and blowing the boom, in response to his recklessly pro-cyclical budget I reminded him of John Lennon's song "Dear Prudence, won't you come out to play".  Brian's flirtation with prudence, if he ever had one, was short lived.  Blowing the budget won him the election.  This week, however, his Government had to pay the price for its incompetence, not to mention the 54,000 people who have lost their jobs.  Since 2 May, when Deputy Brian Cowen became Taoiseach, more than 25,000 people have lost their jobs and we are losing jobs at a rate of 2,000 per week.This morning, there was an important article in The Irish Times by Dan O’Brien, a senior economist and editor at the Economist Intelligence Unit in London.  People who can remember that far back will recall the Celtic tiger was confirmed when The Economist ran articles describing it as a parallel to the Asian tigers, even though people such as David McWilliams had coined and used the term previously.  Therefore, this article is significant and I want to know whether what it states is true.To quote Mr. O'Brien:the Department of Finance now expects a general Government deficit of nearly 3 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) this year, having enjoyed a surplus of a similar magnitude as recently as 2006.  This six percentage point deterioration amounts to the most rapid two-year decline of any euro area country at any time since the single currency was launched.This bears out the statistics quoted by Deputy Kenny yesterday from EUROSTAT.  Mr. O'Brien continues to state, "Bad and all as the official figures are, they understate the gravity of the position.  To achieve the new target, general Government revenues in 2008 would have to remain at last year's levels."  Given a rapid and accelerating decline in tax revenues in the first half of 2008, this would require a miracle in the next six months, according to Mr. O'Brien.  Without such a miracle, the deficit will be closer to 4% of GDP.He states: "In 2009, even assuming no further reductions in revenues and a curbing of the rate of expenditure growth, the deficit is set to increase towards 6% of GDP or above?" Is this true?  Does the Minister for Finance acknowledge what most of us know that the two most important pillars of the modern economy are consumer and investment spending, which accounted for three quarters of Ireland's GDP last year?  According to Mr. O'Brien:Further double-headed risk to the public finances comes from the rising cost of servicing a low-but-rising Government debt.  The recent upward movement in interest rates on most Government bonds reflects rising inflation expectations.If fears of higher global inflation come to pass, this trend will accelerate.  Is this true?  He further stated:Making matters worse for Ireland has been a re-pricing of risk by those who invest in Government bonds?  As recently as last year, investors considered Government debt to be as risk-free as any in the euro area.  In 2008 investors have been demanding a premium to take on and hold Irish public debt [that is rated closer to that of Italy rather than Germany, as it should be].Is this true?Irish banks claim to be socially prudent, responsible corporate citizens, yet history tells us the opposite.  Deputies from an agricultural background will recall their role in the land bubble of the late 1970s where the same bank would fund different bidders desperately in pursuit of the same land.  Has pretty much the same not happened more recently in the housing market?  Lending policies of banks played a large part in pushing up prices by providing additional cash by, first, extending the average length of a mortgage from 20 to 35 years, which was called product innovation, second, when even that had gone too far, moving to provide interest only loans and 100% mortgages — less scrupulous financial institutions went beyond that — and, third, bidding up land prices for developers to absurd amounts.It is rumoured that the banks want the Central Bank, the National Treasury Management Agency and the National Pensions Reserve Fund to bail them out by buying out many of these doubtful mortgages and loans.  This was referred to by Mr. Boucher of the Bank of Ireland when he appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service last week.  He said discussions were taking place.  Unable to find any more suckers willing to part with their money, the banks want the State to play the role of patsy.  Will the Minister for Finance state categorically whether the Government is thinking about using the taxpayer to bail out the banks?The Government hung tough on Waterford Glass recently, when there was a question over jobs in the Waterford area.  The Taoiseach should not be coy and he should tell the House what he is thinking.  Shareholders of Irish banks have received significant dividends over the years and it is time for them to put their hands in the pockets and subscribe to rights issues, as is being done in the US and the UK.  Stock markets and professional investors know this must happen and they are avoiding the shares until that happens.  Even the managers of the banks' own pension funds know it and they have been net sellers of bank shares for some time.  This is the appropriate way for the banks to deal with their own home made crisis.  Should the taxpayer be expected to bail out the speculators or people who have acted recklessly?  We are all familiar with Mr. Sutherland's lectures on moral hazard.  If a young couple having difficulties repaying their mortgage is bailed out, that is moral hazard but if the banking system is bailed out, that does not seem to be moral hazard.  The Jesuits developed the concept of moral hazard in the Middle Ages but I do not know what is their position in this regard.Another example of the banks continued ruthlessness in pursuit of a profit is their activities in the credit card market.  In nine of the past 12 months, customers have repaid less than they spent in the previous month.  Despite new spending in May 2008 being less than May 2007, repayments were only 89% of April's spending.  The majority of better off people who hold credit cards have no difficulty clearing their bills but banks have focussed on those on lower incomes or students who have no income.I refer to the discussions between the Government and the regulatory bodies.  Where were the guardians of our financial system while all of this was going on?  The Governor of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator have repeated their mantras to whoever will listen that "Irish banks are fundamentally sound" — we all hope so — "there is no crisis", "Irish houses are not overpriced" and "Irish developers are not going broke", when it has become increasingly clear to the rest of us that the banks, unfortunately, have problems.  There is a housing crisis because houses are massively overpriced, although they are reducing.  Young people can no longer obtain mortgages even if they could afford them and the higher interest rates.A number of Fianna Fáil's paymasters in the construction industry are in mortal financial danger.  As that redoubtable Cork developer, Owen O'Callaghan, said in a recent interview about his fellow developers and the current difficulties in the construction industry, "There will be blood".  Unfortunately, we are witnessing the blood of construction workers who have to take their holidays now and returning to find they have no job.

We have to look beyond an economy over-reliant on low value-added construction and we need to move beyond the bricks and mortar economy.  It is an important component but the driving forces are indigenous investment, inward investment and high-tech, high jobs and the knowledge economy.  Competitiveness must be restored while striving for social and environmental sustainability and support must be ramped up for indigenous industry.  It must be ensured the fiscal and infrastructural framework is in place to support a high-tech, high valued-added economy.  The foundations must be laid for a 21st century knowledge economy.  I do not disagree with Deputy O'Rourke's comment that many good things happened during the Celtic tiger years but they cost too much money and they did not help the least able people in our society nor are they helping those losing their jobs now.As I noted on the Minister for Finance's appointment, his reputation for cleverness is based on the fact that he is a Cambridge man.  Cambridge men go punting in the pleasant River Cam but sometimes, instead of making progress and going forward, inexperienced punters spend their time going around in circles.  The really unfortunate punters end up going backwards.  The Minister is steering the economy and the ship is very unsteady.  Those in charge, like the Minister, need to steer the boat to safer waters.  The uncertainty, confusion and panic that we have seen in the ranks of the Government and Fianna Fáil this week will only put us all in mortal peril.  People are already overboard — those who have lost their jobs, the businesses that have closed, the people sitting on negative equity in overpriced homes and whose houses risk being repossessed and the school leavers who cannot get a job.  If the Government cannot face the situation, it should leave the field to those of us who will rescue the economy, restore confidence and rebuild employment.  I was proud to have been in government with most of the parties in the House at different times.  Those Governments created fortunate economic circumstances.The list of cuts, half-cuts, deferrals and postponements breaches several principles despite the Taoiseach's promise and rows back on capital investment and investment in public transport and scientific knowledge.  Even the FÁS apprenticeship scheme is to take a hit of €10 million.  Those apprentices are at risk of losing their jobs.  One month ago, FÁS was going to send them abroad to complete their training.  The House has been told of a 3% reduction in salary levels across Departments, including within higher education and the knowledge economy.  As someone who has served in government, I know how difficult such a cut will be.In yesterday's discussion, the Taoiseach admitted that the famous €1.44 billion was for the rest of year and the carryover into next year.  To meet the expected €3 billion slide in tax revenue, there must be further cuts, which will be set out in December's budget.  Is it in the Government's principles that those who can least bear the burden should be the people least hit by the cuts?  Does the Government view capital investment, investment in scientific research and education and increasing competitiveness, public transport and the knowledge economy as the way forward?  Will Fianna Fáil resort to panic measures?  When the two Brians first entered the House as the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance some weeks ago, they seemed to have everything going for them.  In recent days, however, they have begun to sound like the Two Ronnies — incompetent, unsure, nervous and frightened about what may occur in the economy and what the voters may do to them.Many responsible and prudent people can be found in the construction and banking sectors.  The Government must respond and reskill the construction workers who worked long and hard to make a fair amount of money in the past decade so that they can become the engineers, scientists and building and construction firm owners of the future.  The bubble has burst.  When people enter therapy, the first step in recovering is to accept responsibility, but I am unsure as to whether the Government has accepted responsibility.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	316	The debate is on the economy and it is important to emphasise that the fundamentals of our economy are sound.  For many years, it has been one of the most successful economies in the world.  Irish people everywhere are proud of the significant success experienced in Ireland, particularly during the past decade.  Some 14 years ago, 1.1 million people were working.  Today, that figure is 2.1 million.  Under the rainbow Government in 1997, a single person earning £78 began to pay income tax and income tax rates were 27% and48%.  There was no tax individualisation.  If a woman returned to work after her children had been reared, she began to pay tax at 48%.  Today, a single person can earn at least €340 tax free and the tax rates are 20% and 41%.  In recent years, living standards in Ireland have improved more quickly than anywhere else in the OECD.We are suffering due to the global setback.  Ours is an open trading economy and our companies must compete in global markets, particularly those of the UK and the US.  The 15%-20% difference in the values of the euro vis-à-vis the dollar and the pound sterling affects our companies in the UK, for example.  They must also compete with UK companies in third markets.  The difference also affects our companies exporting to the US.  The cost of a barrel of oil is $145, which is likely to increase to $200.  Due to the credit crunch, it has been difficult for financial institutions to get money.  While money is being loaned, interest rates are considerably higher and lending periods are short.All of these matters are international factors.  The domestic factor is the construction sector, but the economy is still growing at 4% if we exclude that sector from the statistics.  However, it must be included.  For every 10,000 houses not built, our economic growth falls by 1%.  To be fair, no one on either side of the House anticipated that the slowdown in the sector would be so rapid.  During last year's election, parties opposite budgeted on the basis of a 5% growth rate, the scenario generally agreed by independent commentators and everyone responsible for economic planning on both sides of the House.As situations change, the Government must change.  It must be capable and determined to see out its responsibilities, one of which is public spending.  We cannot return to an era in which we spent, borrowed and taxed to find our way out of economic deprivation.  That was the story of the 1970s and the 1980s.  The only Government that ever bailed out a bank was a Labour-Fine Gael Government, which bailed out AIB in the 1980s.  Unfortunately, while it did so for good reasons, it did not take shares in the bank.  When the bank recovered, taxpayers did not receive the benefit.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	318	No, but Deputy Burton discussed the banks for a long time.  The only bank rescued was rescued by the parties opposite.  Unfortunately, no shareholding was taken to benefit taxpayers after the bank's quick recovery.As we were required to do, the Government examined public spending a few days ago.  Regarding the €440 million, we set out to spend €61 billion this year governing the country and will still spend an amount of that order.  In terms of national income, the country has grown from €130 billion in 2002 to €160 billion today.  Many references to waste have been made.  In 2002, spending on pensions amounted to €3.5 billion per year whereas the current figure is €6 billion.  Is this waste?  Pensioners are in receipt of an additional €2.5 billion and €800 million extra has been allocated in respect of child benefit payments to support families.I want to deal with health issues specifically.  By any standards, the health budget is enormous and spending in Ireland has grown at 4% or 5% ahead of inflation more than in any other OECD country.  We spend 9% of our national income, which is more relevant than GDP in Ireland's case, on health.  This is the average figure throughout the EU and the OECD.  We are involved in a major programme of health service transformation.The decisions made recently will not affect, for example, the 8,700 people with intellectual disabilities in residential care, the 4,600 people in receipt of respite services or the 24,000 people in receipt of day services.  None of those things is affected by the decisions that were made the other day.In regard to the decisions on health I want to spend some time talking about the fair deal scheme.  Every working day for the past 18 months, officials in my Department and in the Office of the Attorney General have been working on this legislation.  We have also availed of expertise from outside the Office of the Attorney General in regard to the legislation.  The issues that arise are not constitutional but they are complex.  We are dealing with people at a very sensitive time in their lives.  We are dealing with money, assets and income.  We often deal with people who have diminished mental capacity.  We must, therefore, make sure that the legislation protects those vulnerable people legally and that the legislation we promote through this House stands up legally and protects those people.  I am confident that when the Dáil resumes after the summer recess we will be able to have that legislation passed with a view to having the fair deal scheme in place from the start of next year.  Of the €110 million that was assigned for the fair deal scheme, we have taken €25 million, €13 million of which is for contract beds and €12 million of which is for more subventions.  It would not be responsible of me to put all that €85 million into services that we would not be able to sustain next year because we need the money for the fair deal scheme.

Not one euro is being taken off the health capital budget.  The national children's hospital is a priority and it will be progressed as rapidly as possible.  The national rehabilitation hospital is a priority and that, too, is being progressed.  Let me say in passing——

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	322	It is good to listen occasionally.  In regard to co-location, the only ideologue that opposed it was the former Deputy Joe Higgins.  There was not a single other opponent.  He has appealed the matter to An Bord Pleanála.  We know what the former Deputy Higgins's ideology is.  As Deputy Reilly knows well as a medic, half of the patients being seen in some of our Dublin hospitals for elective procedures are private patients going into public beds on a preferential basis.  That is why there will be a new contract of employment for consultants which is a fundamental overhaul of the current situation where they effectively work as lone rangers in hospitals but not for hospitals.  Under the new contract they will work as part of teams with a clinical director and the team will be responsible for providing cover.In regard to some of the other moneys we are taking from the health and children Vote — reference was made to the fact that one third of the money comes from health and children, and that is the case — all the new developments are starting.  There are timing issues.  Professor Keane got €15 million to recruit new consultants and for other developments in the cancer control area.  He is recruiting new consultants, but he does not need €15 million this year, he needs €12 million.  That is proceeding.  The same applies to the pneumoccoccal immunisation vaccine for a form of meningitis.  Every one of the developments, including palliative care, is proceeding.  None is cut back as a result of the decisions made.On the broader reforms within the HSE, like every other organisation the HSE must operate within the budget allocated to it by the Oireachtas.  The budget is not inconsiderable at more than €15 billion.  The HSE must make sure it commits to the service development on which I signed off at the start of this year in relation to 2008.  It has assured me it will do that.  Clearly it must organise services in the most cost effective way, bearing in mind its first obligation is to patients.  Earlier this week there was a controversy at Louth hospital which I will mention in passing.  We paid two doctors overtime for out-of-hours services and there were 14 patients who attended out of hours.  When the patients arrive the senior registrar who is also on call must attend.  From here on when the patients attend the senior registrar who is on call will deal with them.  I give that as an example because we spend €135 million on overtime for junior doctors.  Last year 20 of them got more than €100,000 in overtime.  Those kinds of decisions are sensible.

The effects of the sub-prime crisis in the US are being felt worldwide while increasing worldwide oil and food prices are putting the brake on global growth.  A small open economy, like ours, is not immune to what is happening in the rest of the world.  The reality, however, is that the fundamentals of the Irish economy are strong.  It is a reality that the more pessimistic economic forecasters and most Members opposite seem, amazingly, to have missed.  We have more than 2 million people in work.  We have a highly educated and very flexible workforce.  We have a vibrant export sector.  We have had a decade of unprecedented investment in infrastructure and in our productive capacity.  We have a strong welfare system to support those in need and at risk.  Welfare payment rates in Ireland far outmatch those in the UK.  Contributory State pensions here are 94% higher than in the UK, job seeker's benefit here is 160% higher and child benefit rates are 60% higher.  That is real progress.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	338	Prices are higher also.

As well as the huge investment in infrastructure, health and education, we have used the surpluses to build up our pension reserve fund to almost €20 billion and to dramatically reduce our national debt from 65% of GNP to about 25%.  The reduction in our national debt leaves the economy in a much better position than if we had a higher level of indebtedness.  It certainly leaves us in a better position than the Government under former Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald, left us in 1987 when the national debt was 120% of GDP.

Unlike any time in the past, Ireland is well positioned to deal with the consequences of an international slowdown.  This means the Government is well positioned to get us through the tough times.  The responsible course is to take the actions needed now.  That is what we are doing.  We are taking the necessary corrective actions needed to put our economy on a sustainable path for the future.  When international conditions improve we will be in a position to take advantage of that improvement.  At the heart of the Government's strategy are two basic principles.  First, we will continue to fund current services out of the taxes received.  Unlike others, we will not turn the clock back to the 1980s and fund day-to-day expenditure out of borrowing.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	343	Or the 1970s.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	344	The operating cost of this State must be sustainable.  This means moderating our spending and driving the value-for-money agenda harder.  Second, we will continue to invest in the productive capacity of the economy.  We will improve our national infrastructures even further by continuing to invest in roads, communications, education and public services.My over-riding priority as Minister is the modernisation of the Defence Forces.  We have maintained and must maintain modern Defence Forces capable of meeting the needs of Government and the public and delivering value for money.  I have witnessed the tremendous work being done by members of the Permanent Defence Force at home and in various overseas missions, most recently during my visit to Chad.  I know that everyone in this House will join me in thanking the members of Óglaigh na hÉireann and their families for the great sacrifices they make in the service of the State.  The development and modernisation of the Defence Forces over the past decade has been a major public sector success.  The Defence Forces and the Department of Defence have led the way and will continue to do so.  Seeking the delivery of more productivity, value for money and excellence is now hard-wired into the ethos of the Defences Forces organisation.The Government is fully committed to Defence and to ensuring our ability to meet our commitments at home and on the international stage.  In recent years we have made considerable progress in regard to a number of matters, a few of which I want to mention.  As part of our policy of securing value for money I concluded an agreement with the Irish Banking Federation in May 2005 to ensure banks pay the costs incurred by the Defence Forces in the provision of cash escorts.  This agreement runs up to 2010.  From 1995 to 2004 the banks paid an annual fixed contribution of €2.86 million.  That was increased to €6.03 million in 2005; €6.47 million in 2006 and €7.34 million in 2007.  My Department continues to examine and review its property portfolio with a view to disposing of those lands deemed surplus to military requirements.An important policy area has been the provision of greater opportunities for enlisted personnel to advance into the officer corps.  I point to recent progress in this area with the commissioning on 10 June last of 24 personnel from the enlisted ranks.  I am pleased to say that a career in the Defence Forces is seen as an extremely attractive and popular option.  The number of applications received far exceeds the number of positions available.  In 2007, for example, there were 25 applicants for every cadet vacancy and seven applicants for every general service recruit vacancy.Significant investment in equipment and personnel has taken place in recent years across all facets and elements of the Defence Forces.  We have acquired 80 Mowag APCs since 2001 at a combined cost of some €120 million.  More than €13.5 million has been invested in the provision of an integrated protection and load carrying system for individual soldiers.  In addition, six utility AW 139 helicopters are being acquired from Agusta Westland at a cost of €75 million, inclusive of VAT.We have also introduced several other important reforms.  Action on equality, dignity and bullying has been implemented in a manner that will prove a useful model to other State and commercial operations.  The creation of an independent Ombudsman for the Defence Forces and the comprehensive reform of military law have further advanced the equality and fairness agenda.  All these important reforms and improvements leave the entire Defence Forces organisation well placed to address the adjustments and savings needed to ensure sustainable defence expenditure in the years to come.To set the 2008 defence expenditure savings in some context, the €4.6 million saving we are making this year is just slightly more than the additional €4.48 million paid by the banks for cash escorts in 2007.  We will secure the €4.6 million in savings under several headings.  Approximately €2 million will come from payroll savings, a further €500,000 will come from the deferral until 2010 of the proposed Reserve Defence Force information and recruitment campaign, while the balance of approximately €2.1 million will be secured in savings in the building, refurbishment, equipment and administrative budgets.  I assure the House that the savings will not impact on the ongoing operations of the Defence Forces at home or overseas.What I certainly do not propose is to take lessons on economic responsibility from the economically illiterate.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	348	In fairness to Deputy Deenihan, his pronouncements, while in favour of increased public expenditure, have been a model of consistency when compared with those of his Front Bench colleagues.  Last April, Deputies Varadkar and Kenny launched a document committing Fine Gael to reduce massively the number of State agencies.  Unfortunately, news of this important initiative seems not to have reached Deputy Shatter who almost immediately introduced a Victims' Right Bill which provides, among other things, for the establishment of yet another statutory agency.

I have figured out at last why Fine Gael and the Labour Party spend so much time in opposition.  It is because they are congenitally predisposed to negativity.  I came across a quotation which illustrates this point and which is almost 50 years old.  In 1962, in reference to Fine Gael and the Labour Party, Seán Lemass said:There seems to be an attitude of mind in those parties . . . that they have a right to attack the Government and to paddle their party canoes up any creek that appears inviting to them, but that it is ungentlemanly for us to defend ourselves against their attacks and outrageous for us to criticise them in turn.  Political life and public office impose many burdens but they also confer a few pleasures.  One of the pleasures is that of criticising one's critics, exposing their foolishness and demonstrating their errors.  That is a pleasure of which I do not propose to deprive myself.Nor do I propose to deprive myself of it.  I do not see anyone on this side of the House depriving himself or herself of that pleasure for many years to come.I support the motion and commit myself to managing defence expenditure in such a way as to sustain our social and economic progress into the future.

When the national development plan was introduced, the Government offered the following assurance:A prudent budgetary policy will be implemented over the period of the plan which does not add to inflationary pressures in the economy and which leaves flexibility for budgetary manoeuvre should an economic slowdown occur.  This policy will require that growth in day-to-day expenditure must be kept broadly in line with the increase in economic growth.  In such circumstances, a key expenditure objective will be to achieve more with the resources already being used to realise maximum value for money.This was the precondition for the national development plan, the bedrock upon which Fianna Fáil economic strategy was to be built.

That wildly optimistic tax forecast has proved entirely illusory.  The Taoiseach budgeted that 70% of borrowing this year would be used to fill the gap between the huge current spending and the tax he hoped would come in.  The tax take was not realised but spending has pushed ahead regardless.We are now seeing what was never before seen in the history of the State — a surplus of €2 billion in 2006 being turned into a deficit which the ESRI predicts will be €11 billion in 2009.  The Taoiseach sleepwalked into this entirely predictable crisis.  At a time when every commentator was telling him that his spending programmes were unaffordable, he pushed on relentlessly.  We are paying for that recklessness now.  The Taoiseach has destroyed the flexibility and capacity of our economy to withstand the economic downturn which was so clearly predicted.

Instead, we are left facing into the abyss on the economic front.  Contrary to all advice, the Taoiseach introduced four inflationary budgets which pumped up the housing bubble and drove price inflation far higher than elsewhere in the eurozone, thus destroying the competitiveness of our businesses.

I pointed this out at each budget but he pushed ahead relentlessly.The Taoiseach indulged the lazy habit of his ministerial colleagues of setting up unaccountable agencies to tackle every problem that came their way.  Those agencies are now a millstone around the necks of taxpayers.  He corroded the traditional disciplines which emphasised a frugal approach to public spending and the importance of evaluation before large projects are launched.

Individual Ministers introduced failed strategies in areas such as climate change, decentralisation, e-Government and health.  What happened?  Nothing because Ministers sat smugly in their seats and blamed someone else.  That is the culture of Government that we have learned to expect from Fianna Fáil under the leadership of the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, and the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.

It is causing unemployment, which is rising to levels that have not been seen in a generation.  It is causing inflation that is hurting people.  Irish shoppers now pay 30% more for basics here than in the North of Ireland.  Much of that has occurred because of the way the Government mismanaged its public sector responsibilities.  It failed to reform, change, deliver efficiently or keep down prices in public sector bodies.  We are paying the price in lost jobs and public service cutbacks.  The two Brians woke up like two dazed men from a deep sleep to discover that the public finances were sinking below the Plimsoll line.  They did what comes easily to them, cobbling together a few mindless measures that do nothing about the underlying economic problems.

They kept it to themselves.  This is the new approach by the Department of Finance, a three-page document with no details of any of the so-called cuts.

If one looks at what purports to be a corrective economic measure, there is nothing in it that will deliver any serious change.  This is not a medium-term strategy for the recovery of the economy.  Three quarters of the money this year is either for capital or deferred programmes.  Next year, one third of the money will again be in capital.  The sum total of the Government's efficiency savings, €71 million, represents one eighth of 1% of Exchequer spending.  After all the huffing and puffing, the great body of Government produced savings of one eighth of 1% from the massive spending that has been ramped up in recent years.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	391	Untrue.

The Ceann Comhairle knows as well as I do what that means; it means that even the most successful agencies that have been repeatedly delivering results will have to cut their payrolls.  Equally, the duds — agencies that should have been closed down long ago — will be treated the same way.  Where is that forensic search for value for money, rewarding success in the public service and encouraging innovation?  They are seeking savings in programmes that should be closed down.

There is no coherence in the approach being adopted.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20206	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	428	What is most disturbing about this week's announcement is that the triumvirate, the three Ministers in charge of the economy, do not realise what is going on in the real world.  They have now woken up to the need for Ireland to articulate a new strategy, taking it in a different direction, that will reinvent the economy.  In addition, it would reform public services, tackle inflationary problems and address the decline in competitiveness with which we have struggled and which is causing business to shed labour.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20206	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	430	There is no realisation of those needs.  There has been no mention this week of what the Government might do to resolve the credit crunch that has people up to their necks in debt.  Banks are pulling back on every front, while ordinary businesses struggle to get capital to remain in place.  People who want to buy houses are unable to obtain mortgages.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20206	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	435	The Government is silent on those issues, including a competitiveness action plan and an anti-inflation strategy.  They have no commitment to change, including competition and deregulation, anywhere in the public sector.  That is the core problem: they continue to peddle the snake oil of a programme for Government issued last year, from which €40 billion in cumulative tax expectations have been wiped out.  The dreams of the programme for Government were built on that €40 billion but it has now been wiped out and there has not been a whimper from the Government.  Ministers will not own up to the reality that the promises made to pupils, the sick and people struggling with crime are now baseless.  We need a bit of reality. Ministers should realise that we are in a new situation.  Resources will be scarce in the coming years so we must cut our cloth to what is available.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20206	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	448	This was going to deliver the economic nirvana towards which we were heading.  I am sure the Minister has the progress report for 2007 for his bed time reading, as it contains some very worthwhile things.  The programme was to be delivered in full, on budget and on time.  This was the great mantra that was repeated time and again on posters, on the back of buses and everywhere else.  None of the five Transport 21 projects has been delivered yet.  Spending is 97% off on strategic energy infrastructure.  It is 50% off on broadband expansion, 50% off on waste infrastructure, 65% off on ICT in schools, 100% off on the delivery of primary health care centres, and 30% off on affordable housing.  We were led to believe this was a Government that was focused on the need to modernise our schools, to have a broadband structure that would span the country and that would have the highest quality energy infrastructure.  Instead, we find the Government is 60% off on all of these priorities.  All this has happened before money got scarce.The truth is sad and it is hard for the Minister to face up to it.  Ministers have come into this House and have articulated strategies that have been without foundation.  We had a climate strategy for eight years, but we delivered no impact on our carbon emissions.  The health strategy has delivered 20% of its ambitions.  We had a decentralisation strategy, which thankfully is being buried, but the Government has to wait for some outside agency to tell it that the programme has collapsed.  It delivered 20% of what was promised.At least Charlie McCreevy had the good grace to say that if Ministers promise a strategy but do not it on time, then they should be sacked.  Of course, Charlie McCreevy was the one who got sacked.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	449	There will be no one left.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20206	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	450	Perhaps the consequence is the empty Chamber today, as the rest have been banished.  Are we meeting our targets at the Department of Defence?  The sad truth is that if the NDP was to be the centre piece of the Government's strategy, then it had to do what it said at the outset of the strategy, namely, to manage current spending within the capacity of the economy to deliver.  Instead, the Government introduced huge spending programmes on the back of unsustainable property revenues.  Now we are right up against EU borrowing limits at a time when Ministers should be bringing forward good projects to take up the slack in our building industry and the slack created by other industries falling by the wayside.  We are not in that position.  The Taoiseach and his Ministers have sabotaged the capacity of this economy to deal with the economic downturn.The consequence of all this is clear.  More people will lose their jobs than normally should be the case.  More old, sick and disabled people will suffer cuts in their public services than should.  The reason for that goes back to the shoddy way in which the Government has been managed for years.  Ordinary people are paying the price, and not the Ministers comfortably strapped into their Mercedes.  When we hit the wall, it will be those vulnerable people who once again will feel the pinch.  We have already seen it this year, as older people and people with disabilities have been turned away from services.  That is just the start.  We will see a continuation of that trend, because this Government does not have a credible medium-term strategy that can get us out of this hole.  They keep doing what they have always done, and that is just not good enough.

It is important to put in context where Ireland is now, when compared with ten years ago.

There are over 2 million people at work now, which is double the amount at work 20 years ago.

I believe the public recognise that and will support our approach.  The savings outlined by Ministers this week will be delivered.A set of systematic measures have been announced that will yield dividends now and in the medium term in the current account.  By focusing on greater effectiveness, targeting better payroll management, seeking savings in the services we buy in and prioritising productive capital, we are putting in place a regime that will enhance the delivery of public services and the return from the investment decisions we make.

When the Government launched this plan, it highlighted the need to tackle the infrastructure deficits that had constrained our potential economic development.  That work is well in hand.  Over the remaining period of the national development plan we will continue to roll out a very substantial programme of investment in economic infrastructure.  We will focus on those priorities which offer the best value for money and promise the greatest economic return.  By investing in crucial infrastructure projects, we can augment our productivity, enhance our competitiveness and improve the quality of life.Future economic infrastructure priorities in the plan include completion by 2010 of the major inter-urban routes linking Dublin with Belfast, Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford; significant enhancement of the Atlantic road corridor.

National development plan investment priorities up to 2013 in the area of enterprise innovation will include strong support for continued investment in science, technology and innovation, with a particular emphasis on ensuring research can be translated into commercial products with resultant economic benefits.  It will include ongoing support for high potential start-up companies, support for productivity enhancements for indigenous companies and support for overseas firms that wish to invest and locate in Ireland — many such companies continue to make such decisions.  There will also be further support for tourism development, including tourism infrastructure, such as the convention centre in Dublin, due to open in 2010——

The national development plan provides a robust, multiannual financial investment framework to underpin this endeavour.  The Government is determined to prioritise and deliver those investments under the national development plan which promises the best long-term economic return for Ireland.The public can be reassured of the Governments determination to see us through and to take the sensible and balanced action needed to keep the fiscal position in good order.  That is a very important part of the strategy for Ireland in the years ahead.Irrespective of this or that EU rule, we cannot, for sound budgetary reasons, allow current spending to out-distance current revenue.  We must deal with current spending and not borrow on the never-never.  That path leads to unsustainable borrowing, less room for manoeuvre, lower growth and a heavier tax burden.  Those opposite know this only too well as all those things happened during their extensive period in power in the 1980s.

Ireland is not immune to international developments. Since the late 1950s it has been clear that Irish prosperity is strongly associated with deep international links.

They have forgotten, in particular, the significant uncertainty and volatility in world financial markets which began in August 2007 and has continued into 2008.  The euro has continued to strengthen against the dollar and sterling, our two important export markets.  Oil prices have continued to rise, which is obviously unhelpful to competitiveness of an island economy like Ireland's.While these risks present significant challenges for the economy, it is, as has been widely acknowledged by economic commentators, is now in a position, as it never was before, to meet these challenges head-on.  The people are confident in their own abilities.  The economy and the labour force is flexible, highly skilled and innovative.  There have been significant improvements in productivity and infrastructure.  It is this confidence and flexibility, in conjunction with the improvements in productivity and investment, that have lessened the effects of the international problems and put the economy in an excellent position to benefit fully from the inevitable upturn in the global economy.

I assure the House that we were careful in developing the measures to protect the vulnerable and the economy as far as possible.We have been preparing the ground for some time.  In his budget speech last year, the Taoiseach, then Minister for Finance, announced a wide-ranging efficiency review.  That review asked Departments to examine all their administrative spending as well as the administrative spending of all bodies and agencies under their aegis with a view to identifying possible savings.  Many of the proposals with regard to savings have emanated from that review.  All Departments have identified a range of administrative savings that are now to be acted upon.Throughout the year officials in my Department have been carefully and assiduously monitoring developments in the Irish economy.  As evidence began to emerge of revenues being behind profile, they began work on plans to address fiscal problems.  While the economic situation is changing fast, the deterioration if not its extent has been clear to my Department for some time and we have been planning accordingly.  Furthermore, that work will continue over the summer.  While the issues involved are complex, the targets that the Government has set are stringent and it is committed to achieving these efficiencies and the resultant savings.  I believe that the savings on administrative costs can be realised across all Departments and agencies.  The Government is determined to secure maximum value for money in our public services and concentrate resources on frontline service delivery.A number of Deputies have joined the chorus of outside commentators in calling on the Government to breach the conditions of the Stability and Growth Pact.  Our aim for good reasons is to adopt policies consistent with the Stability and Growth Pact.  There are few Deputies in this House who do not remember the 1980s and the state of the public finances.  During that period the public finances went out of control as a result of an accumulation of bad policy decisions.

Likewise, the savings in overseas development assistance arise from moneys that would not have been spent on time this year.  Even so, we will still exceed the 0.54% target set for 2008 in terms of GNP and we will be far ahead of what most other developed nations spend as a percentage of their national income.In winding up this debate, I want to make clear the Government has an absolute resolve to meet the present challenges.  We need a sensible stewardship of the public finances.  We have taken firm decisions, some of them not without controversy.  All expenditure must be subject to scrutiny for 2009.

We have dramatically increased the State pension, child benefit and the number of gardaí, teachers, doctors and nurses serving our people.  These are the choices we made with the surplus that our taxpayers earned for us and we made wise choices in increasing this social expenditure.

This will ensure we create the right environment to return to trend rate of economic growth, which is generally agreed by leading economic commentators to be 4%.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	570	I launched the consultation paper on next-generation broadband on Thursday, 3 July 2008.  The consultation paper sets out a policy background and framework for the implementation of next-generation broadband.  It also includes ten specific Government commitments of which one is the aim that on a phased basis, second level schools in Ireland will be equipped with100 Mbps of broadband connectivity.It is crucial that our second level students are equipped with the resources necessary to allow them to develop the skills, knowledge and talents that are required by our knowledge society.  Students must have the bandwidth that will allow them to learn and collaborate on-line simultaneously.  The existing levels of bandwidth must be increased and accordingly it is my aim that, on a phased basis, second level schools in Ireland will be equipped with 100 Mbps of broadband connectivity.  Local area networks will also be installed.The cost of this measure will depend on the outcome of the procurement approach to be adopted.  This and other issues relating to the roll-out of the commitment will be considered by my Department in conjunction with the Departments of Education and Science and Finance.  I am satisfied that this commitment and other commitments in the paper can be accommodated within the €435 million national development plan envelope for investment in broadband.  As I indicated, the programme will be rolled out on a phased basis but I am determined to see the project advanced in 2009.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	571	Last week when the Minister launched his next-generation broadband consultation document, 12 months into office, he announced that the Government planned to invest, in capital terms, €435 million to address the digital divide.  Is it the case that the Government has already spent approximately €135 million of that €435 million?  I ask the Minister to clarify what is still available to spend.  He said quite clearly that the Government will target capital investment of €435 million.  What has been spent and what is left?With regard to the information and communications technology in schools project, the Minister for Education and Science said that a report is to be published today on the issue.  Has the Minister seen that report?  Will he tell us the amount of money the Government is committing to bringing broadband and ICT capacity to schools?  We all know the merits of it so he no longer needs to tell us about them.  We want to see it happen and a timescale for when it will happen.

There is significant spending this year on metropolitan area networks and the group broadband schemes.  In 2007, some money was spent on group broadband schemes   This still leaves the bulk of the funding finance available.We deliberately will not give a figure because it is a competitive tendering process.  As with any other project, one cannot get best value for the State — there are times when we must get best value — by going out with an estimate as to what the contract bid might cost.  I will outline the benefits and the reasoning behind this because it is important that we——

All I am asking is when will this happen.  He is talking about a competitive tendering process.  When will it start and finish and when can second level and primary schools expect to get broadband connection?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	588	Each school has broadband connection.  The intention is to continue the current broadband connectivity and, on a phased basis, where schools currently have in the order of from half a megabit to two megabits they will be replaced with 100 megabits and local area connectivity networks so that within the school each classroom can be connected.As I said in the report and today, that will be done on a phased basis starting in 2009.  I do not want to be prescriptive on the timing because we must go into a detailed competitive tendering process that must be worked out.

Following the completion of that, we will have the complete outcome of the actual phases.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	594	The Government's policy objectives in respect of bio-fuels are clear.  The energy policy framework and the programme for Government commit to the sustainable use of bio-energy resources in transport and to work with our EU partners to ensure that bio-fuels used in transport comply with sustainability criteria in terms of bio-fuels production.  This is the policy context for the proposed introduction of a bio-fuels obligation scheme which will be published for consultation shortly and which will take full account of developments at EU level and globally.The sustainable deployment of bio-fuels is proposed by the European Commission in the climate change and renewable energy package as a contribution to delivering the proposed target of 10% renewable energy in transport by 2020.  The contribution of renewable electricity to transport is part of the solution also.  This was very clearly confirmed by Commissioner Piebalgs, Energy Ministers and Members of the European Parliament at the informal Energy Ministers' meeting last week.Five years after the European Union agreed the bio-fuels directive in 2003, there are growing concerns about the role of bio-fuels in rising food prices, accelerating deforestation and doubts about the climate change benefits from certain fuels.  The issues and challenges are very complex and it is clear that we need a fully evidence-based approach which takes into account all factors in terms of developing a credible and sustainable European Union policy in respect of bio-fuels production and use.  The rise in international food prices has been caused by a variety of complex and interrelated factors.  We must make sure that the development of bio-fuels from potential food crops does not push food markets in developing countries into crisis.The central question is not whether Europe  keeps to the proposed 10% target for renewable energy in transport but how we quantify and implement comprehensive and mandatory sustainability criteria for European bio-fuels production and imports.  It is only in that framework of strong controls that sustainable targets for the EU for 2020 can be delivered for renewable transport fuels.  It is only in that context that a genuinely sustainable bio-fuels industry can be established.  Meeting the 2020 target will require the accelerated development of advanced technologies delivering second generations bio-fuels.  It will also include the development of fuels from bio-gas, the targeting of local crops for fuels in captive bus and lorry fleets and, as mentioned, the creation of new electric vehicle fleets.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.My Department is working intensively with the Commission and other member states to develop robust coherent and workable sustainability criteria.  These criteria include a labelling system to ensure that any bio-fuel supply does not come from agricultural methods that involve the destruction of native woodland forest.  They also require that the production method can show a clear reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of at least 35% compared to standard fuel oils.  I welcome the French Presidency's priority commitment to progress the bio-fuels sustainability issue by October.  I also welcome the bio-fuels review published this week by the British Government, which is a timely and useful contribution to the European bio-fuels debate.My Department's excise relief scheme has led to progressively greater amounts of bio-fuels coming onto the Irish market, much of which is used in the road haulage industry.  I am fully aware of the difficulties faced by that sector.  It is my objective to deliver certainty for the Irish bio-fuels industry and for the transport sector.  The bio-fuels obligation mechanism is proposed as a means of providing that certainty set strictly in the context of sustainability and taking full account of EU and global developments.  Having access to a diverse fuel supply will be of strategic benefit in the event of any future oil supply shock.  It will ensure we have access to transport solutions in critical areas such as food distribution and public transport.

However, it does not add any insight into what is a central issue in energy policy worldwide.  The impression one gets is that the Minister has run for cover.  Perhaps he will elucidate in respect of his position on the Commission directive under discussion?  Is he aware that already the environmental sub-committee of the European Parliament has rejected the Commission's view because of its concerns about the impact on the poor and starving in the world?Will the Minister explain why he has delayed the publication of his bio-fuels obligation scheme, which he has promised many times but has delayed and about which he has kept us in the dark?  Has there been any change to acknowledge the fact that we have a serious problem?  Will he state what percentage of bio-fuels used in this country are imported?  I have asked this question a number of times without getting an answer.The Minister talks about sustainable principles, which is lovely talk, but how, particularly with regard to the WTO requirements, does he intend to ensure that we know the origin of the imports and whether they have been produced in a sustainable way?  How will he do that?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	596	Policy in this area must be consistent.  A year and a half ago, I said during a debate in the Dáil on a motion moved by the opposite side of the House that we had to be very cautious and apply scientific evidence because there were environmental and other social concerns.  I wanted to hear from my ministerial colleagues and the rapporteur from the European Parliament in advance of setting out our consultation document.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	597	I am sure they wanted to hear from the Minister.  That is the point.  What did he tell them?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	598	It is right to do it that way, to take in the evidence and listen to what people are saying.  My understanding of the European Parliament's position, which is one I support, is that it is still supportive of the proposed target of 10% renewable energy in transport by 2020.  It is very important to highlight that this involves not just bio-fuels but includes electricity.  It is right to hold to that target because in its absence, the overall renewable energy target would not be met and the overall climate change package would run into difficulties.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	601	The Minister should answer the percentage question, which is what concerns me most.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	602	On what?  Will Deputy McManus repeat the question?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	603	It relates to the percentage of imports into Ireland.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	604	We do not have a figure for imported fuels because we often import oil from the UK which is already mixed with a bio-fuel component.  The industry does it.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	606	In respect of Deputy McManus's earlier question about when we intend to have the sustainability criteria, the advantage of us supporting and working with the European Commission on this is that it alone will be able to put in the labelling and tagging system so that we clearly know where bio-fuels have come from and that there are real emissions reductions which do not lead to food poverty or destruction of native habitats.  I understand that those details should be agreed by October as the French Presidency seeks to have the renewables package in its overall climate change package agreed.  We can fit in with that European sustainability criteria programme to ensure that the bio-fuels we develop are sustainable.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	607	I will try to get in the last question in the five minutes remaining.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	608	While the provision of broadband services is, in the first instance, a matter for the private sector and broadband is now widely available in Ireland, there are still some parts of the country where the private sector is unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  These areas are being addressed by the national broadband scheme, NBS, which will provide broadband services to areas that are currently not served and will ensure that all requests for broadband from those areas not served are met.Initially, the mapping exercise undertaken as part of the NBS distinguished between areas where a service is currently provided, marked as red areas on the map; areas where no service is currently provided and is unlikely to be provided in the future, white areas; and areas that are not currently served but service providers had indicated that they planned to provide broadband services in those areas in the future, blue areas.Service providers were given until 30 June 2008 to act on their stated intentions to roll out broadband in the blue areas of the map.  As the end of June 2008 has now passed, any blue area where a service provider has failed to roll out services has been changed to white to reflect the fact that no service is available in the area.  Any blue area where a service provider now provides a service has been changed to red to reflect the fact that the service is available in the area.Consequently, the NBS map is now being updated and the next iteration of the map will show areas that are served, red areas and areas where no service is available, white areas.  The map will reflect the red and white areas as they stood on 30 June 2008.  There will be no blue areas in the next iteration of the map, which will be the final map that will issue with the invitation to tender.The first phase of the NBS procurement process is now complete.  The remaining candidates have been engaged in competitive dialogue with my Department and are developing their proposed solutions to meet my Department's requirements.  The dialogue between the remaining candidates and my officials has proven to be very effective with all parties addressing and resolving potential ambiguities in the first invitation to tender documentation.  This effort, which has given rise to unanticipated work in advance of the issuing of the final invitation to tender, will minimise the need for negotiations at the contract award stage of the project.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	609	We have received some new information, which is of benefit.  The Minister is now saying that we no longer have blue areas on the map.  Until recently, the Minister promised that if people could not get broadband by 1 July, it would be provided to them through the national broadband scheme.  The Department drew up a map of the country in which all areas in red had acceptable broadband coverage; blue areas were those where broadband was promised and white areas were those where broadband could not be provided commercially.  The Minister is now saying that broadband has either been provided in blue areas by now or not and that all white areas will be provided with broadband in the national broadband scheme.  That directly contradicts information I received through a freedom of information request which states that a reasonable timeframe has been promised to broadband service providers who were proposing broadband in the blue areas.  Is the Minister saying that the response to my freedom of information request is incorrect?When can we expect the national broadband scheme to be in place?  The Minister has repeatedly stated that it would be in place by 1 July.  We are now halfway through that month.  There is an ongoing court battle.  When is that likely to finish and when will we see the benefits of the scheme?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	610	We intended to have contracts signed by July but that has been delayed for two reasons, one of which is the court challenge, which involves the Department and various parties.  As stated in my earlier answer, we wanted to get the contract documents as sharp as possible in advance of signing off on the tender so that it would be easier for the company to roll it out as soon as the contract is signed.  The contract will be very clear, determining what are the obligations.  Part of that is working out a clear map that identifies the areas that have coverage and those that do not.  Those that do not will be in the contract area where the provider must provide a service.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	611	The Minister is saying that the decision has been made.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	612	That decision was always an evolving process because it is an evolving provision.  We set the end of June as the deadline to determine the level of service.  We did not accept the situation on the basis of the map but went out to validate that the map was accurate.  The end of June is the cut-off point decided for the purposes of the tender documents.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	613	One of the main themes of the draft consultation paper on Next Generation Broadband is to facilitate private sector investment in Next Generation Broadband networks. As the paper shows, major investment is already under way by the private sector, amounting to around €700m per annum, facilitated by a pro–competition, pro-investment regulatory regime.This favourable regulatory regime will continue to be promoted.  In addition the paper sets out actions that have the potential to lower the costs for telecoms operators of building NGB networks.  A key measure in this regard is to utilise state infrastructure assets to facilitate broadband connectivity.  Accordingly, the actions in the paper to support infrastructure deployment include:Major public infrastructure projects will, in future, install ducting at construction stage to facilitate network roll-out andA one stop shop will be established to make it easier for service providers to access current and future ducting.In addition, new premises will be required to install open-access fibre connections, where practicable, with regulations in place by the end of this year.I have already engaged with key Departments and agencies in regard to the implementation of these actions including the Department of Transport and the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  I will be intensifying this engagement in the period ahead to ensure the early implementation of the actions proposed.  I consider that these measures have a key role to play in the regional rollout of Next Generation Broadband.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	614	I have no function in the direct provision of broadband services to customers.  This is a contractual matter between the service provider and their customer.The provision of electronic communications services including broadband, is primarily a matter for private sector operators.  Statutory responsibility for the regulation of telecommunications operators including regulatory issues surrounding the quality of services, rests with the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), which acts independently in the exercise of its functions.In cases where people have complaints against their service providers, it would be normal that they would take the matter up with their service provider in the first instance.ComReg will normally only deal with a complaint from individuals once they have exhausted the complaints procedure with their service providers.  In this event ComReg could examine whether the service provider acted appropriately in accordance with regulatory requirements.ComReg have stated that they have not received any significant number of complaints from the North Tipperary area over the last six months.In relation to ComReg's enforcement powers, the Deputy may be aware that these were substantially enhanced by the Communications Regulation (Amendment) Act 2007 including:The creation of new summary, indictable and continuing offences for breaches by operators of obligations imposed by ComReg;Conferring on ComReg, competition law powers, to allow it to investigate and prosecute anti-competitive behaviour or abuse of dominance in the electronic communications sector; andProviding ComReg with increased information gathering powers and power to investigate overcharging.I have no plans at this juncture to further amend ComReg's enforcement powers.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	615	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 23 together.The rollout of a national smart meter programme is progressing in line with the commitment in the Government's Energy Policy Framework and in the Programme for Government.  The Smart Meter programme is a central component of our strategy to significantly enhance management of energy demand and to achieve greater energy efficiency through the use of cutting-edge technology.The delivery of smart metering requires a collective response.  This is a technically complex and ambitious initiative. The Steering Group overseeing programme implementation is chaired by the Commission for Energy Regulation and includes representation from Sustainable Energy Ireland, ESB Networks, ESB Customer Supply and independent suppliers as well as my Department.There are four distinct work streams under way.  These cover tariffs, Billing/Data, Networks and Customer Behaviour, and the teams concerned are mandated by the Steering Group to progress the complex technical aspects of the smart metering project.  Work is under way to develop the details of the two key strands to the pilot phase; the technology trial and the customer behaviour trial.  The pilot phase is due to begin at the end of the year and is anticipated that it will last for eighteen months.The technology trial will look at meter functionality and supporting information and communications systems. ESB Networks is currently at the final stages of a tender process to select smart meters for the technology trial. The results of this tender process will also quantify the number of installations required to ensure the successful testing of the technology in the pilot phase.In parallel, work is well advanced on the design of the customer behaviour and tariff aspects of the pilot phase. The trial will determine the potential of smart meters to effect measurable change in consumer behaviour and the potential of this to effect reductions in energy use.  Work is also under way to design a statistically robust approach to customer selection for the behavioural trial.The overall objective remains to complete the national smart meter programme in five years.  This will equip us with an advanced cost effective, national electricity metering system which will deliver tangible benefits to all energy consumers.Given the very positive public response to the smart metering, and to other energy efficiency measures, I am confident that there will be ample demand from consumers to take part in the pilot project.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	616	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 54 together.The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter, in the first instance, for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  The primary role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services by competing private sector service providers.Previously, where the market has failed to meet the demand for telecommunications and broadband services, the Government has intervened to address the market failure.  Intervention initiatives have been undertaken through investment in international connectivity and regional backhaul, the construction of the open-access Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs), and part-funding rural broadband access networks under the Group Broadband Scheme (GBS).  The market's failure to provide broadband services in unserved rural areas will be addressed by the forthcoming National Broadband Scheme.The MANs Programme involves the construction of high-speed, open-access Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) in towns and cities nationwide in partnership with local and regional authorities.Phase 1 of the Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) programme provided open access, high-speed broadband networks to 27 towns and cities throughout the country.  The MANs were co-financed from the European Regional Development Fund.  All 27 MANs from Phase 1 have been successfully handed over to eNet, whose role is to manage, maintain, market and operate the MANs on behalf of the State.  The networks are offered to telecommunication service providers on a wholesale basis to allow them to provide services without the need to build their own networks in the various cities and towns.  The cost of the Phase 1 MANs Programme was just over €84 million.Phase 2 of the MANs programme is almost complete. The estimated cost of the Phase 2 MANs Programme, which will provide an additional 60 MANs covering 66 towns, is €90 million.MANs Projects in 28 towns under Phase 2 were suspended, pending consideration of the findings of a Value for Money and Policy Review of the Phase 1 Programme and a Next Generation Broadband Policy Paper both of which were published last week.Future investment decisions including any investment in MANs will be guided by the outcome of the consultation on Next Generation Broadband; the recommendations of the Value for Money and Policy Review and other analyses as appropriate.

Where these actions require Exchequer expenditure they will be funded from the National Development Plan (NDP) envelope of €435m for telecommunications, for the period 2007–2013.  The actions potentially leading to expenditure on the Vote of my Department include; universal access to broadband, which will mainly be delivered through the National Broadband Scheme; broadband connectivity to second level schools and the cost of a Communications Research Programme in conjunction with ComReg and the ESRI.I am not in a position to state precisely how much funding will be available for these actions in 2009.  This will be decided in the context of the 2009 Estimates and Budget but I anticipate progress in the rollout of these and the other actions in 2009.  In addition, I am satisfied that targeted investment in broadband is a priority area for Government and that the allocated funding over the period of the NDP will be forthcoming.

The benefit of lower roaming charges for data traffic is that it would encourage the development of new digital applications on mobile networks.  The US Communications Regulator has introduced new rules in the allocation of spectrum for mobile technologies to encourage similar flexibility in technologies that can access mobile networks.  The Japanese Government has gone further in mandating access for independent operators to send data traffic across a mobile phone network.My objective is to ensure that consumers obtain the best deal possible for data and SMS services.  I look forward to the outcome of the consultation and to working closely with my colleagues in Europe to achieve this objective.

My officials will also assess the likely need for additional international connectivity that might arise as a result of the predicted increase in demand for media rich applications and services, including streaming video, high definition television over internet protocol, online gaming, and so called "web 2.0" services like social networking and trading sites.  All of these services use much more bandwidth than standard email and search facilities.  Additionally, the security of supply of international telecommunications connectivity will be examined by my officials. While I understand that the supply of international connectivity is currently adequate to meet existing demand, I wish to ensure that we are well placed to intervene to guard against the development of any bottlenecks on our international connections.In recent months my Department has been working with the Northern Ireland Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) on the preparation of a tender to procure direct international connectivity to the North West of the island of Ireland.  The tender for the project, called project Kelvin, was issued by DETI last week.The tender is seeking:A direct international telecommunications connection between North America and the North West of the island of Ireland.Improved international connectivity between mainland Europe and the North West of the island.The provision of a telehouse facility in Derry, which will provide telecommunications operators and end users with open access to the above international links.Onward connectivity from the Derry telehouse to the Metropolitan Area Networks in Letterkenny and Monaghan.The expected outcome is that the three locations, Derry, Letterkenny and Monaghan and their surrounding towns and villages, will be more attractive for direct investment, especially for businesses in the internationally traded services sector that require high capacity international broadband links.

It arises as a result of the way the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme was constructed.  As such, it is an issue which faces not only Ireland, but all EU Member States.  It should be noted that to date only one EU Member State, Spain, has introduced measures to deal with windfall gains, and these are now subject to appeal and legal challenge.Furthermore, as the Deputy will be aware, the EU Commission has proposed that, from 2013, all allowances will be auctioned thus removing the windfall profit dimension.  From now until 2013, the free allowances remain in place and their treatment, as confirmed by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, in the House recently, is subject to an ongoing examination by his Department, which has lead responsibility for all matters relating to taxation.In terms of the possible deployment of the proceeds of any carbon windfall gains levy or tax, there would be many considerations to take into account.  There are a variety of potential implications inherent in any particular approach.  Certainty about the effectiveness of a particular approach would be a key requirement.Among the issues for consideration is the manner in which any tax or levy might be applied, the extent of its application and the legal basis for any particular approach proposed.  The impact on the operation of the all-island Single Electricity Market, which straddles the two jurisdictions, is also a major factor that needs to be taken into account.As increases in international fossil fuel prices impact on electricity and gas prices, the issue of windfall gains by power generators becomes more pertinent.  In that context, I welcome today's announcement by the ESB that it has agreed with the CER to make a €300m contribution to help offset, for all customers, forthcoming electricity price increases due to rising global fuel costs.

These new categories include offshore wind developments.The renewable energy feed-in tariff scheme or REFIT, has, to date, included biomass, landfill gas, hydropower and onshore wind-power.  The REFIT scheme provides market incentives for individuals and businesses investing in or developing electricity from renewable energy.  It does this by providing a guaranteed price for electricity produced for 15 years.  Projects included in these existing categories will deliver the target to increase consumption of electricity from renewable energy sources to 15% by 2010.The extension of the REFIT scheme to additional categories includes support for the development of offshore wind-power projects at a price of €140 per megawatt hour of power produced.  The support price is in line with what other Governments are offering and will ensure international investor confidence in the sector.By including offshore-wind in the feed in tariff scheme we are sending a strong market signal and creating the conditions for offshore wind to contribute to the target of 33% of electricity consumed from renewable energy sources by 2020.  The announcement now of the proposed support for offshore wind was in part, a recognition of the long lead in times for such projects and is also to ensure that State-Aid clearance and other requirements are cleared well in advance of developments.The current REFIT support programme was approved by the EU Commission under EU State Aid guidelines. In January 2008 the EU Commission adopted revised EU State Aid guidelines.  These were formally published in April.  My officials have been in regular contact with relevant officials of the EU Commission on the implementation and application of the revised guidelines.In light of these discussions, my Department is now working with interested players in the domestic wind sector to quantify the various offshore capital costs elements and related requirements under the EU Commission's revised State-Aid guidelines.The Offshore-wind category of REFIT may not legally be commenced until state aid clearance is secured. I am satisfied that clearance will be forthcoming in good time to ensure that offshore wind projects can be planned and developed.  In that regard I welcome Commissioner Piebalgs assurance to the meeting of EU Energy Ministers last week that the Commission was working to assist all Member States in relation to State-Aid clearances in the renewable energy area.

I am pleased to advise the Deputy that wood log gasification boilers have been added to the scheme as an eligible biomass technology. There will be a small reduction in the levels of support for the existing biomass technologies reflecting the maturing of the market.It is recognised that the installation of renewable heating systems in second hand homes is more complex and more expensive.  As a result it is appropriate to continue to provide support in this housing sector for the present. The newly introduced Building Regulations 2008 make a component of renewable energy in all new homes compulsory. Therefore an additional change under Phase III of the scheme is that from now on only existing (at least one year old) houses will be eligible for support.  Funding in forward years for the Greener Homes Scheme will be subject to overall budgetary considerations.

To date some 53 staff on the Corporate Services side of the Department have already transferred successfully to Cavan. The next phase of our planned relocation involves placing Cavan-bound staff into divisions within the Natural Resources area of my Department, namely Inland Fisheries, Petroleum Affairs Division and Exploration and Mining Division.There are strategies in place to ensure that any risks that might arise from decentralisation-related staff turnover are managed and mitigated.  These include adequate overlap periods for staff training and the development of knowledge management strategies throughout the Department, which aim to minimise the loss of corporate knowledge associated with high levels of staff turnover.  Our experience of the staff transfers that have already taken place is that these were concluded without any adverse impact on my Department's business delivery.My Department, in common with other Government Departments, operates under an authorised staff number cap set by the Department of Finance.  Staff resources, within our authorised staff number, are allocated across the divisions on the basis of availability, business needs and priorities. The Department's Management Committee continuously reviews the internal allocation and deployment of staff so as to ensure that we can quickly and flexibly respond to changing business priorities.In this context I am satisfied that the Communications Division in the Department, including the section dealing with the National Broadband Scheme, has been, and is, adequately resourced.

I have no function in regard to oil prices.My Department has been advised that the average price of petrol in Ireland in June 2004 was 93.8 cent per litre and in June 2008 was 129.8 cent per litre.  This represents an increase of just under 39%.  The average price of diesel in Ireland in June 2004 was 85.3 cent per litre and was 139.9 cent per litre in June 2008.  This represents an increase of 64%.The regulation of ESB electricity tariffs and Bord Gáis Éireann (BGÉ) gas tariffs is the statutory responsibility of the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) under the Electricity Regulation Act. I have no function in setting these tariffs.  The CER has publicly indicated that the increases in international fuel prices are expected to have a consequential impact on electricity and gas tariffs in the autumn.The Government is committed to protecting the most vulnerable from the impact of energy costs through a combination of institutional supports and investment in improving the energy efficiency of the housing stock.My Department is setting up a new working group with the Departments of Finance, Social and Family Affairs and Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the CER, Sustainable Energy Ireland and key energy suppliers, to ensure a fully cohesive approach to addressing the energy efficiency and affordability challenges for vulnerable people.The Minister for Social and Family Affairs provides a range of supplements and allowances, including the Electricity/Gas Allowance and the National Fuel Allowance, to assist those most in need with their heating costs. The Department of Social and Family Affairs estimate that expenditure on these packages will be in the region of €330 million in 2008.The CER also has a role in protecting vulnerable customers in the energy markets.  Under the European Communities (Internal Market in Electricity) Regulations 2005 the CER was tasked with ensuring that there are adequate safeguards to protect vulnerable customers, including measures to help customers avoid disconnection.  The CER has set out guidelines for the protection of household electricity and natural gas customers, particularly the elderly, customers relying on life support equipment and those with disabilities.One of the root causes of fuel poverty is the legacy of older housing with poor energy efficiency standards.  I have increased the allocation for this year to the Low Income Housing Programme administered by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) to €5 million.  The Programme's primary focus is the Warmer Homes Scheme which provides energy efficiency equipment including insulation and energy efficiency advice at little or no cost to eligible households.  The increased allocation will enable SEI to fund insulation upgrades for an additional 2,000 vulnerable homes in 2008 bringing the total to 5,000 homes this year.I also launched the pilot Home Energy Saving Scheme last April.  This pilot scheme is incentivising improvements in energy efficiency by householders with a particular focus on older housing.  This Scheme has the potential to significantly improve the energy efficiency of our housing stock.  SEI has estimated that households upgrading their energy efficiency with the support of this scheme can expect to save in the region of €500 every year on their heating bills.The Housing Aid for Older People Scheme was introduced last November by my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The Scheme provides targeted support of up to 100% of cost to improve conditions in the houses of older people. The Scheme provides grants for a wide range of structural repair and improvements including rewiring, water, sanitary services, heating, windows, as well as central heating and insulation.The Central Heating Scheme has been allocated some €26 million in 2008 by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.The scheme provides funding to housing authorities to upgrade their rented homes including attic insulation to Building Regulations standards and draught proofing to windows and doors.  It is estimated that an additional 5,000 Local Authority households will benefit from improved conditions and lower energy bills this year as a result of this year's investment.

Some of the public sector benefits identified by the consultants included better targeted service provision, improved policy formulation, implementation and evaluation, and better profiling of public expenditure.I expect that this work will be completed shortly and upon receipt of the analysis I will consider how best to proceed on the proposal.To date, my Department has incurred €27,225 in consultancy fees for the project and I expect that a further €27,225 will be incurred to finalise the analysis currently under way.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	626	At the Council of Energy Ministers in February, and again at the Informal Meeting of Energy Ministers in Paris last week, I confirmed Ireland's general support for the proposed Renewable Energy Directive.The overall target for the European Union of 20% renewable energy contributions to electricity by 2020 is ambitious but essential. All Member States will have to play their part by delivering their individual share of the overall target. It was clear in last weeks discussions with my European colleagues and Commissioner Piebalgs, that Member States are prepared to rise to the challenge.For our part, the renewable energy target proposed for Ireland of 16% for the electricity, heat and transport sectors is challenging but achievable. It is also consistent with the Governments own targets set in the Energy Policy Framework and the Programme for Government.  In the negotiations to date on the Directive, Ireland has worked with other Member States to ensure that the proposed trading system of Guarantees of Origin of renewable energies is sufficiently flexible and has the necessary safeguards for renewable energy support systems at national level. Together with other colleagues at the Informal Energy Ministers Meeting, I underlined the importance of agreeing flexibility and cooperation mechanisms which will reinforce and support delivery by individual Member States of their national targets. I welcome the French Presidency's proposal to reach an agreement around flexibility by the next Energy Council in October.We will continue to work with the Presidency, the Commission and other Member States to achieve satisfactory outcomes in relation to the Renewable Energy Directive and which will provide the best possible framework for delivery on Ireland's renewable energy targets.

I welcome the call by EirGrid's Chief Executive for collective engagement by all stakeholders in meeting the challenges inherent in delivering vitally needed new transmission infrastructure, which is safe, reliable, affordable and sustainable.I share his view that all stakeholders working together have to find a way to balance overall public good and economic and social policy objective with the concerns of individuals and local communities.The development of our high capacity grid network is needed to meet overall demand for electricity by business and consumers, to provide the critical infrastructure needed for balanced regional development and security of supply and to deliver on Ireland's renewable energy targets.  If we are to achieve the levels of penetration of renewable energy onto the network, major development of the transmission grid is required.EirGrid is finalising its Grid Development Strategy, which will take a strategic look forward to 2025.  The strategy's assumptions around renewable energy generation will be consistent with the All-island Grid Study which showed we could attain 42% of our electricity from renewables by 2020.I welcome the fact that the necessary legislation to enable EirGrid to construct, own and maintain an interconnector has recently passed all stages in the Dáil and the Seanad.  This will enable EirGrid to progress the East-West interconnector project, which is on track to be completed in 2012.  The East-West interconnector will support the increased penetration of renewable generation, particularly wind generation, in the Irish market.  It will also allow surplus power to be exported to Britain in times of high wind generation.There are very many challenges ahead.  I have every confidence that EirGrid, as the State-owned transmission company, will continue to work in the national interest and in conjunction with all stakeholders, to deliver a sustainable transmission system in support of economic and social needs.

The development, expansion, upgrading, renewal and maintenance of the gas network, including projects developed for the purposes of securing the supply of natural gas are funded through BGÉ's own resources, either through reinvestment of profits or through borrowings.BGE's natural gas transportation business is regulated by the Commission for Energy Regulation, which allows BGÉ a regulated rate of return on its pipeline investments.  This rate is currently 5.2%.  Any capital expenditure proposed by BGÉ is subject to my approval, given with the consent of the Minister for Finance.BGÉ spent €179 million in capital expenditure from its own resources in 2007. Of this expenditure €101 million relates to the development, expansion, upgrading, renewal and maintenance of Ireland's natural gas network and €78 million relates to the construction of BGE's power generation plant at Whitegate. Capital expenditure for the year to date on gas and electricity facilities are €74 million and €65 million respectively, based on actual spend to May 2008 and budget for June 2008. The final figures for June 2008 are not yet available.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	630	The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated.  There is free entry into the market, and prices at the pump for both petrol and diesel reflect market factors notably global market price, transportation costs, Euro/Dollar fluctuations and other operating costs. The significant price rises of recent months reflect the exponential increase in global oil prices.In so far as the relativity between the price of diesel and petrol is concerned, traditionally, diesel has been less expensive than petrol at the forecourts in Ireland.  This was due to the fact that the international prices for both products were previously at a similar level, and excise duty was and is lower on diesel.  European production was also closely matched to demand for both products. The international price of diesel has, however, increased relative to petrol for a number of reasons including rising demand in both Europe and in China and other rapidly-developing economies world-wide.  European refineries are unable to keep pace with the demand for diesel. Each barrel of oil can only produce a certain percentage of diesel, and European diesel demand now exceeds production.  This means that diesel has to be sourced from further afield, particularly from Russia, thus affecting price.The increase in the price of diesel is affecting all of Europe. Ireland, according to recent EU data, has the 9th lowest petrol prices and the 12th lowest auto-diesel prices out of the 27 EU Member States. It is mainly the newer Member States that have lower fuel prices than in Ireland. These comparisons demonstrate that Ireland is by no means the worst affected country in Europe in relation to the retail price of diesel and petrol.The upward global trend in oil prices reinforces the imperative for Ireland to reduce its oil dependency and to use energy wisely and efficiently. The Government is committed to accelerated delivery of our targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency which are essential to ensure a sustainable energy future for the economy and consumers. My Department is working with other key Government Departments on initiatives to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy in electricity, transport and heating, and to implement major energy efficiency and demand management programmes.

This reflects the considerable investment of approximately €3 billion in both our transmission and distribution networks that has taken place in the period 2001 to 2005, with another €3 billion planned for investment up to 2010.  In allowing for capital expenditure in its revenue determination, the CER sets challenging performance standards and monitors performance to ensure that these are achieved.As distribution system operator, ESB Networks is required by the CER to maintain certain levels of quality of supply and to report annually on the criteria set out by the CER.  These service level requirements are reinforced with financial incentives, rewards for achieving better service and penalties for failure.  I have been advised by the CER that available data for 2006 shows positive downward trends continuing in the two key metrics for quality of supply, which are Customer Minutes Lost and Verified Voltage complaints.  In addition, specific guarantees of quality of service delivery are set out in the Distribution Services Guarantees section of the ESB customer charter.

The causes of high oil prices are highly complex.  The European Council, at its meeting in June, expressed grave concern about the continued surge in oil and gas prices and their social and economic consequences.  The Council invited the French Presidency, in cooperation with the Commission, to examine the feasibility and impact of measures to smooth the effects of sudden oil and gas price increases and to report back to the European Council in October.I understand that the Presidency, which will liaise directly with the Commission, will examine issues such as the operation of the markets, the financial instruments available for the improvement of energy efficiency, the use of renewable sources of energy and the use of fossil fuels that are less harmful to the environment, and an examination of possible measures likely to reduce the effects of increased oil prices.  I understand that this report will be brought to the European Council meetings in October and December.

Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These included providing grant-aid under the Group Broadband Scheme (GBS) and ongoing investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).Although broadband is now widely available in Ireland there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  These areas are being addressed by the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), which will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved and will ensure that all requests for broadband are met.The first phase of the NBS procurement process (Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ)) is now complete.  The remaining candidates have been engaged in "Competitive Dialogue" with my Department and are developing their proposed solutions to meet my Department's requirements.The dialogue between the remaining candidates and my officials has proven to be very effective with all parties addressing and resolving potential ambiguities in the final Invitation to Tender (ITT) documentation.  This effort, which has given rise to unanticipated work in advance of the issuing of the final ITT, will minimise the need for negotiations at the contract award stage of project.Additionally, the NBS mapping process has given rise to a number of queries regarding the accuracy of the map being used to identify the extent of existing broadband coverage within the State.  While I am, thus far, satisfied with the accuracy of the map, my officials are carrying out a series of spot checks and validations to ensure the accuracy of the maps.Finally, Judicial Review proceedings regarding certain elements of the NBS mapping process took place on 10 and 11 June 2008 in the High Court and a judgement is awaited.  While the outcome of the Judicial Review cannot be anticipated, it is currently expected that a preferred bidder for the NBS will be selected in September 2008, with rollout to commence as soon as possible thereafter.

In an era of high global fuel prices, fuel poverty is a major concern for Ireland and for all Member States of the European Union.The Government is committed to increasing the energy generated from renewable resources and so reduce the impact of rising fossil fuel prices.  We have set ourselves ambitious targets of generating 15% of our electricity needs from renewable sources by 2010 and 33% by 2020.  I am confident that we will achieve those targets.Householders can individually reduce their dependence on oil or gas for their heating needs by investing in renewable heating technology such as solar panels, wood pellet boilers and heat pumps.  The Greener Homes Scheme provides grants to householders to assist with this investment.It is clear that significant savings are achievable in both the residential and business sectors through greater energy efficiency.  Energy efficiency savings can be achieved at no cost through behavioural change, while investments in energy efficiency improvements such as insulation can be quickly recovered through reduced energy use and lower bills.My Department's Power of One Street initiative has clearly demonstrated that householders can achieve major savings on their energy bills by simply changing how they use energy.  Some of the households participating in the Power of One Street initiative both this year and last year saved in excess of 30% of their heating costs by becoming more energy efficient.One of the root causes of fuel poverty is the legacy of older housing with poor energy efficiency standards.  Sustainable Energy Ireland's (SEI) Low Income Housing Programme has as its main focus, the Warmer Homes Scheme, which provides attic insulation, draught proofing, lagging jackets, energy efficient lighting, cavity wall insulation and energy advice at little or no cost to eligible households.  These measures can significantly reduce the amount of energy required to heat and light the home.  I have doubled the allocations for the Low Income Housing Programme to €5 million in 2008 and this will enable SEI to fund such energy upgrades for 5,000 vulnerable households this year.I launched the pilot Home Energy Saving Scheme in April which is incentivising investment in energy efficiency by householders.  SEI has estimated that those upgrading the energy efficiency of their homes with the support of this scheme could expect to save up to €500 per year on their energy bills.I have asked my Department to examine the feasibility of placing an energy efficiency obligation on electricity and gas supply companies in consultation with all stakeholders.  Such mechanisms can be a very cost effective way to improve energy efficiency in both the residential and commercial sectors and are already in place in other jurisdictions, including Northern Ireland.My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government provides supports for those in Local Authority rented dwellings through the Central Heating Scheme.  This scheme provides funding to Local Authorities for works including installation of central heating, attic insulation to Building Regulations standards, draught-proofing to existing windows and external doors, and the lagging of exposed pipework and hot water storage cylinders.  Some €26 million has been allocated to the scheme in 2008 and it is estimated that about 5,000 Local Authority households will benefit.The Housing Aid for Older People Scheme provides targeted support of up to 100% of cost to improve conditions in the existing housing of older people. The works which are grant aided under the Scheme include structural repairs or improvements, re-wiring, the provision of water, sanitary services, heating, repairs to or replacement of windows, provision of central heating and associated insulation works.In addition to these grant supports for structural improvements, the Government is also conscious of the need to directly protect vulnerable households.  The Minister for Social and Family Affairs provides a range of supplements and allowances, including the Electricity/Gas Allowance and the National Fuel Allowance, to assist those most in need with their heating costs. Department of Social and Family Affairs estimate that expenditure on these packages will be in the region of €170 million in 2008.CER has also been given a role in protecting vulnerable customers in the energy markets. Under the European Communities (Internal Market in Electricity) Regulations 2005, CER was tasked with ensuring that there are adequate safeguards to protect vulnerable customers, including measures to help customers avoid disconnection.  CER has set out guidelines for the protection of household electricity and natural gas customers, particularly the elderly, customers relying on life support equipment, and those with disabilities.

In that statement I affirmed the Government's decision in the Energy Policy White Paper and the Programme for Government, to transfer the ownership of the electricity transmission assets from ESB to EirGrid.  It is also fundamental Government policy that we retain the electricity and gas networks as strategic national assets in State ownership which will never be privatised.The unbundling of the transmission assets involves the resolution of complex technical, financial and operational issues as well as legislation.In the context, not least, of wide-ranging challenging priorities for ESB and EirGrid, I have proposed that we commission an independent analysis of the transmission transfer, including costs, benefits and regulatory impact assessment, set in the context also of EU developments and the all island single electricity market.Statements by my predecessor and I, have consistently underlined the need for transparent and inclusive engagement with all relevant stakeholders in the process of implementing Government policy in relation to the electricity transmission assets.Input to the process of independent analysis will accordingly be invited from the direct key stakeholders.  These are the management and unions of ESB and EirGrid, the ESB Employee Share Ownership Trust, as well as the Commission for Energy Regulation and the Department of Finance.As I also announced in my statement, I intend to appoint a senior independent figure to chair this process including the commissioning of independent consultants to carry out the technical and economic analysis.  I am considering potential candidates for this role at present.All the direct stakeholders have pivotal roles to play in the process of engagement and analysis and in achieving outcomes that are good for EirGrid and ESB, which are satisfactory for all parties concerned, and which are in the best interests of the economy and consumers.  I look forward to getting this collective process under way following my appointment of the senior independent chair.Government policy is clear in relation to ensuring the strategic future of both EirGrid and ESB as strong viable Semi State bodies with vital roles to play in delivering our national targets for emissions reduction, renewable energy and energy efficiency as well as security of supply and energy competitiveness.I recently welcomed ESB's announcement of its new Strategic Framework to 2020, which will see an unprecedented capital investment programme by the company at home and abroad in support of our goals for renewable energy, energy efficiency, emissions reduction and energy security.I look forward equally to EirGrid's forthcoming Transmission Development Strategy 2025.  This will set out an ambitious national plan for critical investment in the transmission system over the next two decades in support of economic, social and regional development and the integration of renewable energy generation.

The draft plan sets out the measures proposed to meet the 20% target.  We also propose to establish a Public Sector Energy Efficiency Working Group to drive collective delivery of the 33% public sector target.  My Department is currently finalising the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan in light of the consultative process and ongoing developments at EU level.  I intend to publish the plan in the autumn.A key part of the initial work of the Public Sector Energy Efficiency Group will be to quantify the extent of existing energy efficiency initiatives within public sector bodies, share experience of best practice, coordinate action and most importantly develop and implement the detailed measures for achievement of the 33% public sector target, including performance indicators.The energy savings potential will vary from one public sector body to another but every public sector body will be expected to contribute significantly to meeting the Government's ambitious global target of 33%.  This will require a galvanising of all players across the public sector.In relation to schools, the Minister for Education and Science has already taken a number of initiatives.  Ireland's performance in the area of low energy school building design has been recognised at both national and international level.  The Department of Education and Science is also developing an information technology project, in conjunction with Sustainable Energy Ireland, aimed at helping existing schools to improve their energy efficiency.  Schools will be able to conduct an online energy audit of their buildings and energy usage.  They will then receive information and advice on reducing their energy use, tailored to their specific circumstances.  The system is expected to be completed later this year.

A copy of the consultation paper is on my Department's website.  The consultation period will run until the 30th September 2008.  As part of the consultation process a public forum will be held this September.  The precise date has yet to be finalised.The consultation process will facilitate the views of stakeholders on the policy framework and specific actions set out in the paper.  It will also inform the drafting of the new Action Plan on the Information Society which is now the responsibility of my Department.  I intend that the necessary work on the implementation of the actions should commence as quickly as possible in order to meet the targets.  A number of the recommendations require close co-operation with other Departments and State agencies and this work will be advanced prior to the completion of the consultation process.In regard to Government purchasing power, I would point out that there are opportunities to adopt a more joined up approach to communications procurement by the Government sector within geographical areas in order to provide economies of scale for telecoms operators considering making infrastructure investments, including in broadband.  This action will be pursued in conjunction with the Department of Finance.In relation to research, the consultation paper sets out that my Department will work with ComReg and the ERSI to establish a specialised research programme to monitor developments in this fast changing area and provide evidence-based policy advice.  This programme will support ongoing policy development in the communications sector by providing a robust information framework for the sector.  It is intended that the costs of the research programme will be shared equally by ComReg and my Department.  Preliminary estimates indicate that my Department's share of the costs will be around 382,000 over a three year period.

A tender notice was advertised in the EU Journal on 21st January 2008, following which seven companies were short-listed and invited to submit a tender for the first phase of the rehabilitation works.  Tenders were received from all seven companies on 21st April 2008 and subsequently assessed by the consultants employed by NTCC to design and supervise the project.  On 21st May 2008, the Department authorised NTCC to issue a letter of intention to accept the tender of a construction firm for the first phase of the remediation works at the Gortmore site, at Silvermines, subject to the contractor producing insurances, bond and tax clearance.  It is expected that works will commence on site in the next week. This complex project is being carried out on a phased basis and these initial works are planned to be completed in October 2008.  The works planned for 2009 and 2010 at the Gortmore site include further capping and associated works as well as vegetation and upgrading of wetland areas.

Analogue TV services in Wales, for instance, are expected to switch off in 2009 and this will impact on viewers in Wexford, Waterford, Wicklow and Dublin who receive UK TV channels via overspill from the UK.Viewers on cable and satellite will not be affected by these changes and will continue to receive the UK terrestrial channels. In Ireland, the development of DTT is well under way.  The Broadcasting (Amendment) Act 2007 provides for RTÉ to develop a public broadcasting DTT service with space to carry RTÉ, TG4 and TV3.  In addition, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland is currently running a competition to provide commercial DTT services.  In these circumstances it is expected that Irish digital terrestrial services, providing a significant range of television services, will be available in the south east of the country in 2009, including to those persons who will be impacted by the switch off of analogue services in the UK.Digital terrestrial services will offer more to viewers in terms of digital quality pictures and sound, more services such as programme guide information and more channel content.

It does not contain an individual target for Departments emissions reductions as the levels of reductions will vary from each sector.The energy sector will have to make a leading contribution towards reducing green house gas emissions through a range of measures designed to improve energy efficiency and increase the penetration of renewable energy across the electricity, heat and transport sectors.Among the significant energy efficiency initiatives introduced already this year are the energy efficiency tax incentive aimed at supporting investment in new energy-saving equipment by companies and the Pilot Home Energy Savings Scheme.  These complement existing successful energy efficiency initiatives such as IS 393 (the Irish Standard for Energy Management), the Energy Agreements Programme, the House of Tomorrow Programme and the Power of One Energy Efficiency Awareness Campaign.The forthcoming National Energy Efficiency Action Plan will set out the Government's comprehensive programme of action to be implemented across all sectors to deliver on our national and EU targets for energy efficiency with resulting reductions in green house gas emissions.On the renewable energy side, I am confident that we will meet our renewable electricity targets underpinned by the Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff mechanisms and the GATE 3 connections and authorisations process. I also announced a major ocean energy research and development programme earlier this year.

Section 25 sets the new single content regulator, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, the objective of stimulating the provision of high quality, diverse and innovative programming by independent producers.Section 112 requires RTÉ to prepare a Code of Fair Trading Practice outlining how it will go about commissioning programmes from the independent production sector.These initiatives along with the continuance of the Sound and Vision Scheme under Part 10 of the Bill will serve to add to the diversity of voices and creative ideas that populate the Irish airwaves.

It also includes a review of over 500 stakeholder submissions received by the Department as part of the submissions process, analysis of current international practice and two hypothetical case studies with route lengths of 100km and 50km.  The study was completed on a national basis and is not project specific.The study represents an impartial, independent, technical assessment on the relative merits of overhead electricity lines versus underground cables and provides important further information that can used to facilitate decision making for current and future individual projects.In its conclusions, the study notes the increasing pressure internationally to place electricity transmission infrastructure underground and the continued technology development in the field of underground cables at high and extra high voltages.  The study states however, that the size and number of existing underground cables internationally is limited and that the majority of existing projects do not represent transmission connections in conventional networks.  It also notes that underground transmission cables can be expected to have forced outage rates (likelihood of unplanned system breakdowns) which are at least 10 times more frequent than those expected of overhead lines.  The consultants describe this as a "severe limitation" for underground cables and that consequently, underground cables do not therefore compare to overhead lines in terms of adequacy of the electricity transmission system and reliability of electricity supply.  The consultants describe this finding as "the dominating criterion" when comparing overhead and underground technologies and note that the associated negative impacts cannot compensate for any of the advantages of underground cables.The study also notes that the cost implications underground cable proposals are difficult to quantify, but would be significant.  Based on case studies conducted by the consultants, they state that the cost of underground cables would be approximately five times greater than the capital cost of overhead lines and three times the lifecycle cost.  In relation to perceived health impacts, the study notes that EirGrid operates within WHO guidelines and that in practice, the transmission system generally operates at levels that are 80-90% lower than the levels recommended in these guidelines.I am fully supportive of the Joint Committee's commitment to full and objective debate of all the complex issues and to hear the views of all sides.  Ecofys have confirmed their availability to present their report to the Joint Oireachtas Committee when required.I have no statutory function regarding specific power lines, including the north south interconnector.  The planning, development and routing of transmission line infrastructure is a matter for EirGrid, which is the State body responsible for operating the electricity transmission system in Ireland, including the wholesale electricity trading system.  I forwarded the Ecofys study on its publication, to EirGrid and to ESB Networks.Approval of the Transmission System Development Plan, which includes power lines, is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation, which is statutorily independent in carrying out its functions.  Individual power lines also require permission under the relevant planning process including the Strategic Infrastructure Board where appropriate.

Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These included providing grant-aid under the Group Broadband Scheme (GBS) and ongoing investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).Although broadband is now widely available in Ireland there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  These areas are being addressed by the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), which will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved and will ensure that all requests for broadband are met.The first phase of the NBS procurement process (Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ)) is now complete.  The remaining candidates have been engaged in "Competitive Dialogue" with my Department and are developing their proposed solutions to meet my Department's requirements.Judicial Review proceedings regarding certain elements of the NBS mapping process took place on 10 and 11 June 2008 in the High Court and a judgement is awaited.

The WHO's subsequent report, published in June 2007, concluded that the research does not suggest electromagnetic fields cause any adverse health effects at levels generally encountered by members of the public.The conclusions of the Expert Group on Health Effects of Electro Magnetic Fields are consistent with the WHO Report.I have this week recently published the Independent Study on the Comparative Merits of Overhead Electricity Transmission Lines versus Underground Cables.  The Study notes that EirGrid designs and operates overhead lines in compliance with WHO guidelines on magnetic field exposure and that in practice, under normal operation conditions in Ireland, magnetic field strengths directly under transmission lines are as low as 10–20% of the maximum levels recommended in the WHO guidelines.

In this regard the Government has been to the fore in using the tax system to promote environmental policies; examples include:Budget 2008 provided for VRT on passenger cars being based on CO2 emissions, rather than engine size, with effect from 1 July 2008, to encourage the purchase of lower emission cars.Motor Tax for new cars is also being based on CO2 emissions with effect from 1 July 2008.Up to €2,500 VRT relief is available on the registration of series production hybrid electric and flexible fuel vehicles from 1 July 2008 (this replaces the previous 50% VRT relief for such vehicles).Series production electric passenger cars and motorcycles have been exempted from VRT since 1 January 2008 for a three year period.Capital allowances and leasing expenses for business cars are based on CO2 emissions from 1 July 2008.An accelerated capital allowance initiative scheme for energy efficient equipment has been introduced which will allow companies to claim the full cost, in the year of purchase, of specified energy efficient equipment against their taxable income.The Finance Act 2008 also provided for the VAT rate applicable on the supply of miscanthus rhizomes, seeds, bulbs, roots and similar goods used for the agricultural production of bio-fuels being reduced from 21% to 13.5%.An excise relief scheme for biofuels over 5 years from 2006 has been introduced.Recycling companies that meet certain conditions are included in the BES and Seed Capital Schemes from 2007 onwards; windfarms are already covered by the schemes under the manufacturing category.The introduction of other tax measures aimed at encouraging environmentally friendly behaviour will continue to be considered in the context of the Budgetary process.In relation to the introduction of a carbon tax/levy, the Programme for Government includes a commitment to introduce a carbon tax/levy over the lifetime of the Government.  This will, of course, form an important part of the normal deliberative process of the Government in setting fiscal and environmental policy.  The Programme for Government indicates that the phasing-in of a carbon levy will be on a revenue neutral basis.As the Deputy will be aware, the carbon tax issue is being examined by the Commission on Taxation.  The Commission is due to report by September 2009, at the latest.

Each partner is a separate entity for tax purposes and credits and bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other.The Working Group Examining the Treatment of Married, Cohabiting and One-Parent Families under the Tax and Social Welfare Codes, which reported in August 1999, was sympathetic, in principle, to changes in the tax legislation to address the issues raised relating to cohabiting couples and reported that the options that it set out should be considered further.  However, it acknowledged in relation to the tax treatment of cohabiting couples that a key issue is whether tax law should proceed ahead of changes in the general law.There are a number of recent reports which will help to inform the Government's deliberations in this general area including:the Tenth Progress Report of the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution entitled ‘The Family' which was published in early 2006;the Options Paper presented to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in November 2006 by the Working Group on Domestic Partnership (the Colley Group); andthe Report of the Law Reform Commission on the rights and duties of cohabitants which was published in December 2006.I would also point out that An Agreed Programme for Government contains the following provision in relation to civil partnerships:"This Government is committed to full equality for all in our society.  Taking account of the options paper prepared by the Colley Group and the pending Supreme Court case, we will legislate for Civil Partnerships at the earliest possible date in the lifetime of the Government."In addition, on 24 June 2008 the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform published the Heads of a Civil Partnership Bill which had been approved by the Government.I would view as problematic and unwise a situation where changes in the tax code relating to the treatment of cohabiting couples would set a headline in advance of developments in other relevant areas of public policy such as in the area of legal recognition of relationships other than married relationships.

The maximum amount of qualifying fees on which tax relief is allowed is €5,000 for the academic years 2006/2007 and 2007/2008.The tax relief is confined to tuition fees only and does not extend to items such as registration fees, administration fees, accommodation, etc.  Tuition fees that are, or will be, met directly or indirectly by grants, scholarships, employer contribution or other means are to be deducted in arriving at the net fees qualifying for tax relief.An approved course means either:(a) a full-time or part-time undergraduate course of study of at least 2 academic years duration at an approved college; or(b) a postgraduate course of study leading to a postgraduate award, based on a thesis or on the results of an examination or both, at an approved college of not less than one academic year, but not more than 4 academic years in duration that requires an individual, undertaking the course, to have been conferred with a degree or an equivalent qualification.Under the relevant legislation, the approval of colleges for the purposes of obtaining tax relief on third level education fees is granted by the Minister for Education and Science, with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The Open University is already such an approved college and tax relief is already available for approved courses at that college.

The latter period may be transferred to Aer Lingus.  However, Aer Lingus has not accepted the former service for transfer purposes under the Public Service Transfer Network.  As the service involved predated Aer Lingus joining the network in 1973, it is at the company's discretion whether the previous service will be accepted by them for transfer.  I have no proposals to amend the Public Service Transfer Network to provide for the automatic transfer of service in such cases.

The reason for selecting the mid-Shannon region is that from a tourism perspective, the inner core of the country remains relatively underdeveloped.  Its tourism intensity is low and it has lagged behind recent growth in tourism in Ireland which has been predominately in Dublin and certain coastal counties.  This scheme aims to help redress this regional imbalance and for this reason it is important that the geographical scope of the scheme should be confined to this limited area.

As the Deputy may be aware we already have a robust and effective legislative framework in place in Ireland for ACS since 2001.  This legislation which is considered an example of international best practice in this area was updated last year.  It is one of the several mechanisms currently used by Irish banks to meet their funding needs.  Those amendments were made early in 2007, and hence obviously were unconnected to the financial turmoil later that year.  They were technical changes aimed at ensuring that the Irish legislative and regulatory basis for the issuance of covered bonds kept its place at the leading edge of international financial services.  No further adaptation of our Asset Covered Securities(ACS) legislation is immediately required or planned.As explained at the Joint Committee on Finance and Public Service, this kind of legislation draws its inspiration from the German Pfandbriefe model, originated about 150 years ago.  The ACS mechanism serves as an additional source of diversified funding for participating banks.  Put simply, it enables banks to offer highly regulated low risk bonds that are attractive to investors because they are backed by high quality assets.  The fact that we put this legislation in place has provided a useful addition to the funding mix of our institutions.As far as bank lending is concerned, the Deputy will note from the proceedings of the Joint Oireachtas Committee meeting that the bank representatives stressed that the Irish banks remain open for business and substantial mortgage lending is continuing to take place.  As far as the overall position of the banking sector is concerned, the recent report by the credit rating agency Standard and Poor's concluded that the Irish banking system remains solid and is underpinned by good profit margins, sound liquidity and capitalisation.More generally, as the Deputy would expect,members of staff of my Department and I would often have opportunities for discussions with business and their representative bodies.  However, as I stated earlier this week, no scheme of the type mentioned has been submitted for my consideration.  If there are specific proposals made, I will of course have them examined.

There are no proposals to alter these arrangements.With certain exceptions, earmarking revenues for a specific expenditure programme would, in general, constrain the government in the implementation of its overall expenditure policy.  Furthermore, if certain revenues were earmarked for particular projects within the overall fight against drug abuse, any projects thus funded would be dependent on actual revenue collected from that source.  Therefore, a fall in revenue generated by that source could imply a fall in expenditure on such projects.However, the Deputy should note that the Government is allocating considerable resources to the fight against drug abuse by a range of Government Departments and State Agencies as well as the Community and Voluntary Sector.  Under the National Development Plan 2007-2013, an indicative allocation of some €319 million was allocated to the National Drugs Strategy Sub-Programme over the Plan period to support the fight against the causes and consequences of the abuse of illegal drugs.

The basis for the zero rating of these products is that they come within paragraph (xiii) of the Second Schedule to the VAT Act 1972 as "medicine of a kind used for human oral consumption".  Nicorette chewing gum was zero-rated as the product requires authorisation from the Department of Health and Children, being classed as a medicinal product subject to the same controls which apply to medicines generally.Nicotine patches are, however, subject to the standard VAT rate of 21% and can not be zero-rated as they are not a medication used for human oral consumption.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	676	I should explain that the VAT regime for goods and services is governed by EU law with which Irish Law must comply. Under the EU VAT Directive, Member States may retain the zero rates on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services. As exercise bikes, exercise equipment and bicycles were not subject to the zero rate on 1 January 1991 it is not possible to apply the zero rate to the supply of such products. In addition, Member States may only apply the reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex III of the EU VAT Directive.  While Annex III does include the supply of certain pharmaceutical products used for health care and also medical equipment for the exclusive personal use of a disabled person, it does not include goods such as exercise bikes, exercise equipment and bicycles. Therefore it is not possible to apply the reduced rate of VAT to these items.  The only rate of VAT that can apply to exercise bikes, exercise equipment and bicycles is the standard VAT rate which in Ireland is 21%. I would add, however, that Annex III of the VAT Directive does include the use of sporting facilities and, accordingly, Ireland applies the reduced rate to the use of gyms and health studio businesses.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	678	I am aware that the Revenue Commissioners have tightened their fiscal control of the construction industry in recent years. Starting in late 2005, Revenue conducted a national campaign of audit and site visits in the industry to establish the levels of tax compliance and to tackle abuse.One of the key problems identified was the fairly common failure to operate the construction industry withholding tax, known as RCT (Relevant Contract Tax).RCT is a withholding tax operated by a principal contractor on payments to subcontractors. A subcontractor can avoid the withholding tax by applying to Revenue for a so-called C2 certificate. This allows the sub-contractor to be paid without tax deduction provided that the principal contractor applies to Revenue for a payments card for the sub-contractor. This card is issued where Revenue is satisfied that there is a contract between the principal and sub-contractor and the subcontractor has a satisfactory tax record. The card provides an auditable link between the two parties and is an essential part of Revenue control.It became clear in 2006 that in many cases, payments were being made without tax deduction where these terms of the RCT scheme were not met. There was worrying evidence of organised fraud involving criminal gangs who used the system to extract fraudulent refunds.Revenue undertook widespread publicity campaigns to explain the proper operation of the tax. They issued briefing papers to accountants, and to contractors through trade magazines. Revenue spoke at forums held by the Irish Taxation Institute to over 1,000 tax accountants.Finally, for cases where the tax had not been properly operated, Revenue created a mechanism for end year collection to help principal contractors regularise their RCT and avoid being hit with a charge to tax, interest and penalties for failures to operate RCT properly.Despite this, many cases have turned up in audit where RCT has not been properly operated; in particular, there has been a failure to use the key control document, the relevant payments card. Legally, this failure places the tax liability on the principal contractor. Some principal contractors faced with Revenue audits have argued that failure to withhold the RCT has not resulted in tax loss as the sub-contractors in the case were fully compliant with tax law. However, Revenue cannot establish this in any cost-effective way. I am advised by Revenue that in these circumstances they have proposed a mechanism that would allow the principal and sub-contractor to retrospectively adjust the tax liability between them so as to eliminate any double taxation. Unfortunately, some contractors have been unable or unwilling to make these adjustments.  The majority of taxpayers in the construction industry are not affected by the problem as they operate RCT correctly.

The HSE is also involved in developing community based stand-alone stimulant intervention services which includes additional training for its staff on issues such as cocaine and it is re-engineering existing addiction services to meet emerging needs.  Evidence also indicates that many approaches already in use in general addiction services work well with cocaine users.  The commitment in the Programme for Government is being considered against this background.

The Sectoral Plan establishes a system for the assessment of individual needs for people with a disability.The Sectoral Plan also identifies key objectives in relation to income support and associated benefits for people with disabilities including an agreed protocol with the Department of Social and Family Affairs to develop income and related supports for people with disabilities in order to ensure that they have adequate, secure and sustainable income.The Government is working towards ensuring that income supports and associated benefits do not create financial barriers to people with disabilities.The Office for Disability and Mental Health is committed to considering the issues around the cost of disability following the development of the needs assessment system provided for in the Disability Act.In the meantime, there is significant assistance currently available to mitigate the impact of the additional costs incurred by people with a disability. These measures include weekly/monthly allowances, additional income supports; other benefits such as medical cards, free travel, mobility allowance and tax concessions.

The legislation is complex and requires careful drafting in order to ensure that the interests of older people requiring residential care are fully protected.My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, intends to publish the Bill as soon as possible following finalisation by the Attorney General and Government approval, and to bring the legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas thereafter. As the timeframe for bringing the legislation through both Houses is contingent upon finalisation of the Bill, a more definitive answer on enactment of the legislation is not possible at this stage.Once the legislation is enacted and the necessary legal and administrative arrangements are in place, the scheme will be introduced.Finally, an Exchequer budget of €920 million has been identified for purposes of meeting the costs associated with the nursing home support scheme in its first three years.  This budget includes additional funding of €117 million provided in 2007 and a further €110 million pledged in Budget 2008.  My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, and I are conscious of the effect that the unavoidable and unforeseen delays in implementing Fair Deal are causing to some older people and their families.  To date, €13 million has been allocated from the additional monies provided in Budget 2008 for the provision of 200 contract beds.  Approval has also been given to HSE to utilise a further €12 million in meeting costs associated with nursing home subventions and existing contract beds.

However, I am pleased to be able to inform the Deputy that the HSE has assured me that it is now in a position to roll out the planned developments as outlined in its 2008 Service Plan.Planned services include additional residential, day care — including training places — and respite care places for people with intellectual disability and autism; additional residential care and home support services for people with physical and sensory disabilities; and additional multi-disciplinary therapy posts to provide assessment and ongoing intervention services to children with a disability.I understand that the HSE hopes to be able to finalise the position in relation to the commencement of such developments over the next week.My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the specific matter raised by the Deputy investigated and to have a reply issued directly to  the Deputy.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	721	The Working Group that I established to examine the nature and extent of haemochromatosis and to advise on the actions necessary to address problems caused by haemochromatosis presented its report to me in June 2006.A key issue highlighted in the report was that blood from persons with haemochromatosis was not being used by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service (IBTS).  The IBTS has re-examined its policy on this issue and has decided to establish a pilot venesection programme for haemochromatosis patients in one of its clinics.  Subject to the usual screening protocols, blood from haemochromatosis patients will be used by the IBTS.  A clinician has been appointed to one of the IBTS clinics to oversee the pilot programme.  A second clinic will open in D'Olier Street shortly.  It is hoped that the scheme can expand to 10-12 clinics which could provide up to one sixth of national blood stock needs.Arising from the publication of the report the Irish Insurance Federation has agreed to investigate any complaint about life or health insurance cover linked to diagnosis with haemochromatosis.I am pleased to inform you that I have granted €15,000 from my Department's 2008 allocation towards the development and dissemination of an impact document on diagnosis and management of Haemochromatosis in Irish General Practice.I recently met with officials from the HSE to discuss the implementation of the recommendations of the report.  Various issues in relation to the management of haemochromatosis were raised at the meeting and these issues are currently being investigated.My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange for an update on the implementation of the recommendations of the report on haemachromotosis and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	727	Almost 130,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services. In recent years, the Government's ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals employed in the public health services. The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the healthcare needs of the population into the future.Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement. In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public. The Executive is the appropriate body to consider the matter raised by the Deputy. My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

This year, overall capital funding of approximately €594m has been provided to the Health Service Executive.The Health Service Executive's draft Capital Plan sets out the Executive's capital investment proposals over the period 2008-2013. Project proposals have, following a detailed process of consideration, been prioritised by the Executive so as to fit within indicative funding levels under the National Development Plan. The draft plan has been submitted by my Department for the agreement of the Department of Finance. Consideration of the draft plan is at an advanced stage and I expect the specific developments for this year to be approved shortly, following which details will be announced by the Executive.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	730	BreastCheck commenced roll-out in the Western Region last May and in the Southern region last October.  I officially opened the BreastCheck clinical static units in Cork and Galway last December.  The programme is designed to offer repeat screening within an interval of 21-27 months.The expert advice from BreastCheck and from the National Cancer Forum, as contained in the National Strategy for Cancer Control, is that following the national extension of the programme, the upper age limit should be extended to women aged 69 years.  The priority of BreastCheck is to screen women who have not yet been screened and accordingly it is fully focussed at present on the completion of the first round of screening in the West and South.  I will consider extending the age limit as recommended when the national roll-out of the programme is sufficiently developed and it is assured that a quality service is being delivered.  Any woman irrespective of her age who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.

To date, €13 million has been allocated from the additional monies provided in Budget 2008 for the provision of 200 contract beds.  Approval has also been given to HSE to utilise a further €12 million in meeting costs associated with nursing home subventions and existing contract beds.This brings to €25 million the total funding redirected from Fair Deal and committed to nursing home supports in 2008.  Any further decisions regarding the redeployment of Fair Deal funding will have to be taken within the overall context of the financial situation of the HSE.Finally, it should be borne in mind that the Government already allocated additional funding of €105 million for Nursing Home Subvention in 2006 and 2007.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	738	The revised management structures being introduced by the HSE are designed to facilitate:more local responsibility and authority within defined national parameters;greater clinical involvement in the design and management of patient services; andimproved integration of primary, community and acute care for the benefit of patients and to optimise efficient use of resources.As national level, the new structures will involve:a Director of Service Delivery who will be responsible for all service delivery and head up a single integrated NHO/PCCC pillar with a team of Area Service Delivery personnel;a Director of Planning with a team of national care group/programme managers covering children, older people, disability/mental health, acute hospitals and primary/community care who will be responsible for setting corporate policy/standards in all these areas and driving performance against these standards;a Director of Clinical Affairs who will drive engagement with clinicians and be responsible for quality/risk, and defining national clinical standards/protocols;a Director of Communications who will be responsible for all communications including parliamentary affairs; andthe retention of the existing Directors of Finance, HR, ICT, Estates and Procurement.The next steps in the process are to finalise the number of service delivery areas and define their boundaries; secure buy-in from all stakeholders, including relevant unions, and to implement the new structures as soon as possible.It will also be necessary to review and modify the clinical and support structures at area level to reflect the adjustments at corporate level.  The aim, however, will be to ensure that the Area Directors will have operational responsibility and authority to deliver all hospital and community care services, and personal and social services, in their specific geographical areas within their budgets and employment allocations.This approach will strengthen and simplify area governance.  It will also ensure more efficient and responsive delivery of local services and facilitate more local responsibility, authority and decision making within defined national parameters.The implementation of these new management structures will involve a clarification of associated staffing implications.  This will include developing a voluntary redundancy scheme to streamline the number of management layers and positions.  This scheme will be subject to consultation, will require the prior approval of the Minister for Finance and will operate on a voluntary basis.  It is to meet the test of delivering value for money.  It would not be appropriate at this stage to speculate on the extent of the streamlining but the aim is to create a lean organisation with clarity of roles and accountability.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	739	As the Taoiseach announced yesterday the Government believes that a properly planned and managed voluntary redundancy scheme could have an important role to play in helping to streamline management within the HSE and, as a result, in improving the delivery of health services to patients.  Such a scheme would need to be built upon a clearly delineated organisation structure and the associated human resource requirements.  It would also need to demonstrate that it will deliver value for money, having regard to other options such as natural wastage and the scope for re-deployment.  However, it is agreed that a targeted scheme could deliver significant benefits in terms of a much streamlined and integrated management structure within the HSE.My Department will commence work immediately with the Department of Finance to develop proposals for a targeted voluntary early retirement scheme, the terms of which will be agreed between myself and the Minister for Finance and applied in the HSE as soon as practical.  At this very early stage concrete figures on numbers and costs are not available.  In accordance with established practice in the public service, any such scheme would operate on a voluntary basis and would require the approval of the Minister for Finance. HSE will hold discussions with the relevant staff associations when the proposal is finalised.

Both of these documents have been laid before the House and published.The Service Plan includes strategic objectives, cost containment initiatives, value for money and productivity reviews to progress the development and delivery of greater efficiencies in 2008 and beyond.The HSE projects a potential overspend for the year in the order of €300m in the absence of their taking corrective action.  The Board and management of the HSE are actively engaged in the development and implementation of an appropriate package of measures so as to manage within the resources available and deliver the services to which the HSE is committed in the Service Plan.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	756	The Health Service Executive has responsibility for administering the health repayment scheme in conjunction with the appointed scheme administrator, KPMG/McCann Fitzgerald.  The Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 provides a clear legal framework to repay recoverable health charges for publicly funded long-term residential care.  Recoverable health charges are charges which were imposed on persons with full eligibility under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 1976 as amended in 1987, or charges for in-patient services only, raised under the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1954, as amended in 1965.  Applications received under the scheme are processed within this legal framework.  Specific details on certain cohorts of applicants, such as those outlined by the Deputy, are not available.  However, in terms of the overall scheme almost 39,000 applications have been received, 7,500 of which were submitted by the HSE on behalf of patients.The HSE has informed my Department that up to 27 June last, 11,483 payments totalling over €229 million have issued while 15,299 offers of repayment totalling over €271 million have been made.  Approximately 6,000 claims are outstanding and they are being concluded on a daily basis.  The Health Repayment Scheme Appeals Office has advised my Department that as of 27 June 2008, 810 applicants (approximately 5% of all offers made) have indicated they wish to appeal the amount offered by the scheme administrator.  The Appeals Office has received a total of 2,694 appeal forms under the scheme from applicants who wished to appeal a rejection under the scheme.  Of these appeals 1,418 decisions have issued and 1,285 decisions agree with the decision of the scheme administrator to reject a claim.  In 133 cases the Appeals Officer has disagreed with the decision of the scheme administrator to reject a claim.  Of the 293 appeals officer decisions which have issued in relation to amount appeals, 112 have agreed with the amount offered by the scheme administrator and 181 have disagreed with the amounts offered by the scheme administrator.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	757	I propose to take Questions Nos. 175 and 176 together.Almost 130,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services. In recent years, the Government's high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other health care professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the health care needs of the population in the future.  Subject to overall parameters set by the Government, the HSE is responsible for determining the composition of its staffing complement.  In that regard, it is a matter for the HSE to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.  The HSE is the appropriate body to provide information about the number of posts employed in each sector of the allied health and social care professional grades.  The overall employment ceiling for the public health services in 2008 provides for 1,050 additional new posts arising from development funding provided by the Government in the Budget Day package for 2008.  The filling of these development posts, which cover a range of services including Older People, Palliative Care, Disability, Cancer and Population Health, is to be managed by the HSE within the employment control framework for the health services.  My Department has asked the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the HSE to arrange to have the matters raised by the Deputy investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

The review covers the period from August 2006 to August 2007.  All patients and their families will be contacted by letter when their chest x-ray or CT scan has been reviewed.  When all the x-rays and CT scans have been reviewed, a report will be produced which will detail the background to the review, the methodology, the outcome and the learning from the review.  It is expected that the final report will issue within four weeks of the completion of the review.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	759	Based on the National Quality Assurance Standards for Symptomatic Breast Disease Services, and the fact that the BreastCheck screening programme will significantly reduce the number of symptomatic breast cancer presentations, the Health Service Executive has determined that we require eight specialist breast cancer centres nationally.  To comply with the assurance standards, the HSE has directed 17 hospitals to cease breast cancer services.  Further staged reductions in the number of hospitals providing breast cancer services will occur over the next year in line with the development of quality assured capacity in the eight centres.  The director of the national cancer control programme has confirmed that services from Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda will transfer to Beaumont Hospital in September.  The Programme will ensure that adequate capacity is in place prior to the transfer of services from Drogheda.  The designation of cancer centres aims to ensure that patients receive the highest quality care while at the same time allowing local access to services, where appropriate.  Where diagnosis and treatment planning is directed and managed by multidisciplinary teams based at the centres, much of the treatment other than surgery can be delivered in local hospitals, such as Drogheda.  Chemotherapy and support services will continue to be delivered locally.  The specific questions raised by the Deputy in relation to consultations regarding the transfer of breast cancer services are the responsibility of the HSE under the Health Act 2004.  Accordingly, my Department  has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this regard.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	762	As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the National Child Care Investment Programme 2006-10 (NCIP) under which the Community Child care Subvention Scheme was introduced in January of this year.  The scheme replaced the previous staffing support grant scheme which was implemented under the EU co-funded Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme 2000-06 and which ended in December 2007.  In providing for the scheme and the previous EOCP support scheme, Government child care policy has recognised the need to target additional supports towards disadvantaged families in addition to the main supports which are made available to parents to assist them with their child care costs, that is child benefit and the early child care supplement.  The latter payment is the responsibility of my office, and it alone is expected to amount to expenditure of over €500 million in 2008.  These payments are universal and benefit all parents, regardless of their income, labour market status or the type of child care they choose.The Community Child Care Subvention Scheme has an allocation of €154.2 million over 2008-10 and will continue to support and ensure the sustainability of community-based child care services which provide reduced child care fees for disadvantaged parents.  The purpose of the scheme is not the creation of places per se, which is primarily affected by the capital grants scheme, rather it is to make places accessible to those in the community who would otherwise be unable to afford quality child care.  Community-based child care services will qualify for grant aid on the basis of the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  The parent profile of each service, and the amount of subvention it will receive, are determined on the basis of completed parent declaration forms which they return as part of the application process.  The subvention received by services is, in turn, reflected in a tiered fee system under which reduced fees are charged to parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.  As the parent declaration forms are completed on an annual basis, the level of funding which is approved for each service is established on an annual basis.I am also pleased to advise the Deputy that the child care directorate of my office has notified services of their individual grant levels for July-December 2008 based on their returns last November and that the total amount of grant assistance under the new scheme will be significantly higher than was the case under the previous scheme.  It is not possible at this stage to state the number of additional places provided for under the scheme, as the 2008 annual return is scheduled for next September.  I can report that a number of facilities, which were not considered eligible for funding under the earlier scheme, have been approved funding under the CCSS, thereby allowing disadvantaged parents access to subventions on an equal footing with parents in other areas.

These programmes and services, valued at approximately €52 million, are being administered by the Department of Education and Science.  It is hoped to have the Transfer of Function Order signed and the transfer of funding in place in the coming months.  The Department of Health and Children has commenced making administrative provision for the transfer of staff from the Department of Education and Science to the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.The Young People's Facilities and Services Fund (YPFSF — Round 2) develops youth facilities (including sport and recreational facilities) and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop.  By attracting young people into these facilities and activities, it aims to divert them away from the dangers of substance misuse.  The Fund's target group is 10-21 year olds who are "at risk" due to factors such as family circumstances, educational disadvantage or involvement in crime/substance misuse.  Over €150 million has been allocated to date to support a broad range of services and projects under the Fund.  A draft order transferring the YPFSF (Round 2) to the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is being prepared by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, in consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  The draft order will then be submitted to the Department of Finance who will bring a Memorandum to Government transferring functions from the Departments of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and Education and Science to the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  The location of all these youth programmes within the one overall policy framework of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs should facilitate the development of a more strategic approach to youth affairs across the country.

Through SPHE, children can develop a framework of values, attitudes, understanding and skills that will inform their decisions and actions now and in the future to enhance their health and well-being.  Support for the programme at primary level is provided through the Primary Curriculum Support Programme.  At post-primary level the SPHE Support Service (Post-Primary) works as a partnership between my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the HSE to support teachers and schools through ongoing in-service training and support.  Similar initiatives are under way in the non-formal education setting through partnerships with the key agencies.  Following a recommendation in the National Drugs Strategy 2000-08, all schools have been offered guidance and support in developing a Substance Use policy setting out, in writing, the framework within which the whole school community manages issues relating to substance use.  It should reflect the unique ethos of the school and should aim to develop a shared understanding.  Each policy should cover the core components; education concerning substance use, management of incidents and provision for training and staff development.

The scheme replaced the previous staffing support grant scheme which was implemented under the EU co-funded Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-06 (EOCP) and which ended in December 2007.

These payments are universal and benefit all parents, regardless of their income, labour market status or the type of child care they choose.The Community Childcare Subvention Scheme has an allocation of €154.2 million over 2008-10 and will continue to support and ensure the sustainability of community-based child care services which provide reduced child care fees for disadvantaged parents.  This compares favourably with the €37 million the EOCP staffing grant scheme cost in 2007.  Community-based child care services will qualify for grant aid on the basis of the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from the service.  The parent profile of each service and the amount of subvention it receives are determined on the basis of completed parent declaration forms which they return as part of the application process.  The subvention received by services is, in turn, reflected in a tiered fee system under which reduced fees are charged to parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.While this constitutes a significant increase in total grant aid, the targeting of support towards specific parents, as opposed to general grants made to services in respect of self-reported profiles, was always expected to result in some services, which had a weaker focus on disadvantage than reported, facing a reduction in funding, particularly if they had not implemented tiered fees as required under the previous scheme.  The review of the scheme, based on the data returned by services last November, saw the introduction of guaranteed floors below which funding would not fall, provided the level of service was not reduced.  This means that, where a service has very low levels of subvention due to its parents being middle and higher income, they would receive a top-up to 90% of their existing funding in the second half of this year, to 85% in 2009, and to 75% in 2010.  The purpose of this was to allow services to introduce on an incremental basis tiered fees to make their services accessible to disadvantaged parents, as they had been required under the EOCP staffing scheme.  In reality, it is expected that in 2009, most services will not require this top up funding as they will be more affordable to lower income families and their subvention levels will have increased.  It might be remembered, however, that the effect of this is cost-neutral to the service as, whatever the eligibility of the parent, the fee charged plus the subvention (where applicable) is equal to the cost price of the child care place.I am informed that some 46% of services are in receipt of 90% funding in July-December, with a further 7% in receipt of between 90.1% and 100%.  On average, services are in receipt of 119% of their allocation in the period January to June and, overall, there is a significant increase, with some services more than doubling their grant aid.  No service is facing a significant decrease in State funding.  The review of the scheme also announced that the subvention for Band A parents has been increased to €100 weekly for each full-time equivalent place, and the Band B subvention increased to €70.  Furthermore, each service has been given a tranche of funding to allow them to subvent low income parents above the FIS threshold, by €45.  Given this funding will allow them to offer this reduction to parents who hold GP Visit cards, and given that the thresholds for these take account of mortgage, child care and commuting costs, I think most people would agree that those who fall outside those categories are not lower income and many middle-income parents will qualify for that subvention.  Similarly, all parents in services with a top up payment are in receipt of a subsidy, which in some instances is very significant.These services have the benefit of higher capital grant aid than private services.  This is reflected in their cost price, which they charge to non-subvented parents.  I am informed that, of the fees policies approved by my office to date, the average price for an full-time equivalent place under the scheme ranges from €43 to €143, depending on the band of the parent.  This varies significantly, depending on the cost structure of the service, but is clearly below the commercial rate for child care.  To further subsidise the rate for upper income parents in this sector would not be an equitable policy.  Given these facts, there is no reason the sector should face issues regarding sustainability as a result of the new scheme.  I am aware of a service whose manager took to the national airwaves to announce it was closing because of the introduction of the scheme.  However, I can state that the situation is not as presented.  The grant funding for the service has not, as was stated, been reduced by over €80,000, from €95,000 to €16,000.  The true position is that the proposed grant funding for this service in July/December 2008, based on its level of qualifying parents, was due to reduce from €18,300 to €16,470.  The manager of the service had been in contact with my officials days earlier indicating her satisfaction with the new funding arrangements and made no mention of any intention to close.  My office is working with the local community sector and the county child care committee, as a matter of urgency, to try to ensure that another community service can take over the operation of the service and its proposed grant funding.  As the level of support being given to existing services has increased and the number of services in the scheme has increased I am satisfied that the new scheme will prove an important step in the development of child care in Ireland.

The subvention received by services is, in turn, reflected in a tiered fee system under which reduced fees are charged to parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.  As the parent declaration forms are completed on an annual basis, the level of funding which is approved for each service is established on an annual basis.  Transitional arrangements have been put in place to facilitate services which were funded under the previous EOCP support scheme to adjust to the new arrangements.  As a result, these services will receive not less than 95% of their previous level of funding in 2008.  The CCSS also recognises that in some cases, particularly in rural areas or on the islands, community child care services may operate with a small or fluctuating number of children, in which case a minimum annual grant level of €20,000 can be awarded.The CCSS provides an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community-based child care services generally.  I am satisfied that it will be effective in delivering the NCIP objectives of supporting families to break the cycle of poverty and disadvantage.  It will provide a framework which can accommodate any future child care related initiatives which may be introduced.  The scheme is responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage and the ceiling for funding which existed under the previous scheme has been removed.  Account is taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  The changes which have been introduced will ensure that the most affordable child care is available to families according to their means.  Put simply, the tiered fee structure is the most effective way of ensuring that the considerable and ongoing Government support for the community child care sector, will be targeted at those who need it most.I am also pleased to advise the Deputy that the child care directorate of my office has notified services of their individual grant levels for July-December 2008 and that the total amount of grant assistance under the new scheme will be significantly higher than was the case under the previous scheme.  I am confident that the community child care subvention scheme is a fair and equitable way of supporting community child care operators in the provision of an affordable and high quality service to parents.  Given the low level of community child care provision in Ireland prior to 2000, the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-06 prioritised funding based on applications received and where it was considered that there was a clear need for child care places and the applicants could provide sustainable and affordable services.  The National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-10 (NCIP) is continuing to target the available funding for child care in this way and as a result of this prioritisation, approximately 80% of grant funding under both programmes to date has been to the community, not for profit, sector.  It is open to areas which do not have community child care services to apply under the NCIP.  Further tranches of community applicants are expected to be approved under the programme.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	777	As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the National Child Care Investment Programme 2006-10 (NCIP) under which the Community Child Care Subvention Scheme was introduced in January of this year.  The scheme replaced the previous staffing support grant scheme which was implemented under the EU co-funded Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-06 (EOCP) and which ended in December 2007.  The Community Child Care Subvention Scheme has an allocation of €154.2 million over 2008-10 and will continue to support and ensure the sustainability of community-based child care services which provide reduced childcare fees for disadvantaged parents.  Community-based childcare services will qualify for grant aid on the basis of the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  The parent profile of each service, and the amount of subvention it will receive, are determined on the basis of completed parent declaration forms which they return as part of the application process.  The subvention received by services is, in turn, reflected in a tiered fee system under which reduced fees are charged to parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.  As the parent declaration forms are completed on an annual basis, the level of funding which is approved for each service is established on an annual basis.Each service made a return last November in respect of their children.  The subventions were based on these returns, with band A parents attracting €100 per week for each full-time equivalent, and band B parents attracting €70 per week.  A further tranche of funding was provided for parents somewhat above the family income supplement threshold, and this was calculated based on the profile of parents outside bands A and B with each service getting €45 per full-time equivalent for such parents who declared that they held a medical card or GP visit card.  Where a service did not declare any parent holding a medical card or GP visit card, one such allowance i.e.a total of €1,170, was included in the grant amount.  Finally, a supplement of €30 per full-time equivalent was added for infants under one year in the case of children of qualifying parents in that age category on the date of the return.  Where the total amount would be less than 90% of a service's pre-existing funding level, or where the minimum grant level under the scheme of €20,000 applied, services were given a further top-up of funding to bring them to the relevant threshold guaranteed under the scheme i.e. either 90% of the pre-existing funding level or €20,000.

Since 2006, additional revenue funding of €6.78 million has been allocated to the HSE to develop services for patients with cystic fibrosis.  The HSE has advised that 44 additional staff dealing with cystic fibrosis have been appointed to date across a number of hospitals, including St. Vincent's, Beaumont, Temple Street, Crumlin, Tallaght, Cork University Hospital, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.  The necessary funding is available to facilitate the recruitment of a further 37 staff nationally.  Beaumont Hospital operates as a regional centre in providing services to adults with cystic fibrosis.  In the 2008 Budget, €2.5 million in capital funding was provided to enable Beaumont Hospital to provide out patient facilities for cystic fibrosis patients.  Following discussions between hospital management, consultant respiratory physicians and cystic fibrosis patient representative organisations a decision has been taken regarding the site for a purpose built out-patient facility for patients with cystic fibrosis.  A detailed proposal in relation to the development is being prepared for submission to the National Hospitals Office for approval.  My Department understands that patients with cystic fibrosis will also benefit from additional single room capacity in the new medical admissions unit at the hospital which is due to open in December.  The Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive has been asked by my Department to revert to the Deputy on the operational issue raised.

The HSE is involved in ongoing discussions with hospital management regarding its 2008 financial allocation and Service Plan.  The Hospital has an overrun of €10 million from last year, and a projected overrun of €14 million this year.  The priority of the HSE and hospital management is to ensure that services for children at the hospital are maintained at an optimum level. The initial focus of the discussions on budgetary issues between hospital management and the HSE is on ensuring that all areas of non-pay expenditure are critically examined.  In this regard, the hospital made a recent decision to close St. Michael's Ward, which treats a mix of medical patients, a proportion of which are children with cystic fibrosis, at weekends and move to an adjacent ward, St. Joseph's, which also treats a mix of patients including orthopaedic patients.  The hospital took the decision to amalgamate these two wards at weekends as the occupancy on both wards was approximately 50% at weekends.  As a result, between five and patients, a small proportion of which are cystic fibrosis patients, from St. Michael's Ward are transferred to an adjacent ward at weekends.  The infection control team in the hospital is satisfied that there is no additional risk to children as a result of this move.  The same standard of care is being delivered to these children.  There is no change in the specialised doctors and nurses and medical team caring for the patients who are transferred.  On transfer, the children with cystic fibrosis are nursed in single rooms.  The medical care delivered to the children remains the same.  All patients and families are being communicated to by the nursing staff before they are transferred and there is an opportunity for families' concerns to be addressed by the multidisciplinary team.  The only change for the children and their families is the location.  There is ongoing monitoring and assessment of the situation by the infection control team.

Although the CSO collect data on a county basis, it is not possible to provide a breakdown on the basis of a particular area in Dublin.  There were 62 deaths by suicide in Dublin City in 2005 at a rate of 11.9 per 100,000 population.  There were 481 deaths by suicide nationally at a rate of 11.6."Reach Out" —  A National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention, which was launched in September 2005, provides a policy framework for suicide prevention activities in Ireland.  The strategy calls for a multi-sectoral approach to the prevention of suicidal behaviour in order to foster cooperation between health, education, community, voluntary and private sector agencies.A key component of "Reach Out" is the implementation of measures aimed at high risk groups and vulnerable people.  These include the provision of information and training on suicide prevention to relevant professionals and organisations, research on suicide prevention and the improvement of services which would benefit those at risk of suicide and those who attempt suicide.  Implementation of the strategy is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.

Accordingly, the issues of cost benefit analysis, cost benefit ratios and internal rates of return  in relation to the new terminal and runway are matters that fall within the responsibility of the management and board of the DAA.I understand that the DAA evaluations in respect of these two projects have not been published or submitted to committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas, nor is there a requirement to do so.The DAA, of course, is required to comply with the value for money provisions of the National Development Plan to the extent that is appropriate to a commercial State Body that funds its capital expenditure programme from its own resources.  I should also add that responsibility for compliance with Department of Finance capital appraisal guidelines rests with the Board of the DAA.Finally, I would point that, in line with the Government decision of May 2005 mandating the DAA to build Terminal Two, independent experts have since reported on the specification and cost of the new terminal.  The experts appointed by my Department concluded that the methodology, approach and execution of the planning objectives and considerations for passengers adopted by the DAA accords with best practice.  They also found that the estimated cost of the new terminal is within industry norms for this type of project in a European capital city.  The verification team report has been lodged in the Oireachtas library and is available on my Department's website. (www.transport.ie)A project manager has been in place for Terminal Two for some time now, as work on the project is well underway and is due to be completed in early 2010.  A  project manager has not yet been appointed for the proposed new runway, as work on it has not yet commenced.

I understand that Iarnród Éireann have begun a network-wide programme of expanding existing or developing new car parks, with the assistance of Exchequer funding, to cater for record demand.Within the past year car parks have opened/been extended at eight train stations namely Leixlip Louisa Bridge, Mallow, Ennis, Tullamore, Arklow, Limerick, Hazelhatch and Gormanston resulting in over 1,350 extra car parking spaces.  New car parks are also due to open at Newbridge, Rush and Lusk, Portarlington, Carlow and Limerick Junction over the next eighteen months.  I understand that Iarnród Éireann is currently examining a number of other locations for their suitability for expansion.  To date Exchequer funding of €21m has been allocated for the car park expansion programme.There are currently five Park and Ride sites along the existing Luas network at Red Cow, Sandyford, Stillorgan, Balally and Tallaght.The Luas Park and Ride facility at Sandyford is currently closed to facilitate work on the extension of the Luas Green Line to Cherrywood.  When the Luas extension to Cherrywood is complete, the Sandyford Park and Ride will re-open but with a reduced capacity for around 45 cars.The RPA is in discussion with a private developer and Dún-Laoghaire Rathdown County Council on the provision of a P&R facility at Carrickmines in the context of the Luas extension to Cherrywood which is currently under construction.The planned extension of the Luas Red Line to Citywest provides for a Park and Ride facility at Cheeverstown.Metro North, which will run from St. Stephen's Green to Swords via Dublin Airport, will have 3 P&R sites.  These will be located at Lissenhall, north of Swords, Metropark, between the Airport and the M50, and Fosterstown, south of Swords.The preferred route for the further extension of the Green line from Cherrywood to the Bray area provides for a P&R facility at Fassaroe.The preferred route corridor for Metro West was announced in July 2007 and the RPA hopes to provide Park and Ride facilities at a number of key locations where this Metro meets major road corridors.  In particular RPA hope to provide Park and Ride facilities from the N2 (Ashbourne) at the Huntstown stop, N3 (Navan) at the Blanchardstown stop and N4 (Lucan) at the Liffey Valley stop. Additional facilities might also be provided at other locations.I have made funding available to local authorities in the Greater Dublin Area to provide park and ride facilities.  It is a matter for the local authorities to develop proposals and to apply for funding.  To date I have received no such applications.  However, the local authorities in question are continuing to explore the possibilities for such facilities.  In this regard, An Bord Pleanála recently refused planning permission for a proposed facility on the N4 for South Dublin County Council.I have also made funding available in the regional cities for bus priority and park and ride facilities.  It is a matter for the local authorities to develop proposals and apply for funding.Funding has bee provided to Cork City Council for a successful park and ride facility at Black Ash, and my Department has recently received a preliminary application for funding from the Council for a similar facility on the Western side of Cork City.I understand that other regional cities are also seeking to develop proposals, taking account of the constraints of obtaining suitable sites.

In the case of public transport services under my responsibility, these derogations included reduced rates to apply to fuel used for scheduled bus services.  Scheduled bus services comprise bus passenger services provided by Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann, private operators in accordance with bus route licences under the 1932 Road Transport Act and holders of Authorisations pursuant to European Council Regulation 684/92 as amended.  The position in regard to the school transport sector is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science.While these derogations expired on 31 December 2006, Ireland, along with other Member States, sought retention of its derogations beyond that date.  However the European Commission, which is the deciding authority, has to date refused all such requests.  The Finance Act 2008 provided the basis for the removal of these excise duty reliefs with effect from 1 November 2008.My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Finance and other Departments, has been exploring whether alternative support mechanisms could be appropriate and could be done in a manner compatible with EU State Aid and other legal requirements.My colleague the Minister for Finance has already stated that our overall response to the increase in fuel prices is, as was adopted at the recent Ecofin and European Council meetings, that distortionary fiscal and other policy interventions should be avoided as they prevent the necessary adjustments by economic agents.  Accordingly, I do not envisage any approval from the Department of Finance for a replacement scheme in the current economic circumstances.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	806	Details of an agreement for the mutual recognition of driving disqualifications between Ireland, Northern Ireland and Britain were announced on the 26th of June this year.The agreement will be within the framework established by the 1998 Convention on Driving Disqualifications.  I believe that this will be the first such instance of international cooperation within that framework.In 1998, the UK and Ireland along with all thirteen (at the time) other EU Member States of the European Union signed the international Convention on driving disqualification (98/C 216/01).  The Convention intends to ensure that drivers disqualified from driving in a Member State other than their normal place of residence should not, on their return home, escape the consequences of that disqualification.The Convention provides for six agreed kinds of conduct which will be internationally recognised for the purposes of driving disqualification.  The Convention automatically comes into force across all Member States only when all signatory States have ratified it.  However, the Convention allows one EU Member State to recognise another's driving disqualifications before all Member States have ratified.The agreed behaviours covered by the 1998 Convention include: reckless or dangerous driving; hit-and-run driving; driving whilst under the influence of alcohol or drugs; speeding; and driving whilst disqualified.Ireland and the UK and have already implemented the necessary primary legislation to allow for ratification (in the UK through the Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003, and in Ireland under the Road Traffic Act 2002).The agreement should see mutual recognition of disqualifications between the three administrations in place by Spring 2009. Discussions on the practical arrangements for implementation are continuing between the police, Court services and the licensing authorities in the different jurisdictions.

The remaining offences to which the penalty point system may be applied relate primarily to offences relating to vehicles and their use, lighting of vehicles and the licensing of drivers.The offences concerned are those listed in the First Schedule to the 2002 Act (as amended in the Road Traffic Acts of 2004 and 2006) at reference numbers 1 to 6, 10 and 16 as per Part 1, the offences at reference numbers 1 to 14 as per Part 2, the offences at reference numbers 1 to 6 as per Part 3, the offence at reference number 1 as per Part 5, the offence at reference number 1 as per Part 6, the offences at reference numbers 1 to 6 as per Part 7 and the offence at reference number 1 as per Part 8.The penalty point system applies to 36 offences at present.  The progressive extension of the penalty point system will continue to be pursued but I have no definitive timeframe in mind at this point in relation to the remaining offences.

Of the €16 billion provided for public transport, an indicative allocation of approximately €13.5 billion relate to rail projects including mainline and suburban rail, light rail and metro.  An indicative allocation of over €700 million relates to bus investment and over €800 million relates to traffic management which included bus priority, cycling and walking.

I have since asked that these studies should simultaneously include consideration of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT).The feasibility of LRT and/or BRT in Cork is being considered in the context of the update of the Cork Area Strategic Plan (CASP), which I understand is due to be completed in Autumn of 2008.In the case of Limerick, the local authorities are currently conducting a tender process for consultants to carry out a Planning, Land Use and Transportation Study for the region, and the terms of reference will include consideration of LRT/BRT in Limerick.I understand that Limerick City Council expect to appoint consultants by late August 2008 and the Study is expected to be completed by late 2009.  However, it is expected that interim findings, including regarding the feasibility of LRT/BRT in Limerick, will be available by mid 2009.Discussions are under way between my Department and the local authorities in Galway and Waterford on finalising the terms of reference for a feasibility study on LRT/BRT in these cities, in order to ensure that the local authorities complete these studies within the required timeframe.I expect all of these studies to be published when completed.  The costing of any individual LRT/BRT projects cannot be finalized until tenders have been received and decided upon by the relevant local authorities.

This was the case in relation to the authorisation of the Dublin Bus Route 41X service, in respect of which Dublin Bus submitted a proposal based on an alteration to the existing route.

The Programme, which was launched in February 2007, is putting the former pilot Rural Transport Initiative on a mainstreamed basis with significantly increased funding and is providing for additional services together with expanded area coverage.Pobal, which administers the RTP on behalf of my Department, is developing the Programme on a phased basis in consultation with individual RTP groups, with a goal of achieving nation-wide coverage in due course in line with Government policy.  I am satisfied that the arrangements being put in place by Pobal in that regard take account of value for money and efficiency issues.It is planned that by end-2008, RTP Groups will be operational in every county and will be working towards maximising coverage in their operational areas.  At present, County Louth is the only county without an operational scheme although preparatory work in that regard is, I understand, at an advanced stage.One of the strengths of the RTP is that it involves local groups that know their local communities' needs.  Under the Programme, rural community transport groups, working with Pobal, are responsible for deciding on the specific services to be provided and the methods of provision.

The Investigation Unit is required to submit investigation reports to me and also to make them public within 12 months of the date of the accident.  In the event of an accident, Iarnród Éireann is also required to carry out its own internal investigation and prepare a report on its findings to be submitted to the Railway Safety Commission.The investigation of road traffic accidents, including bus accidents, is a matter for An Garda Siochána under the Road Traffic Acts.

I understand from Iarnród Éireann that it intends to commence work on the Clonsilla/Dunboyne section of the Navan Rail Link and the City Centre and Maynooth line re-signalling projects within the next 12 months.The Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) was granted a Railway Order in June 2008 by An Bord Pleanála in respect of the proposed Luas extension to Citywest.  Subject to the Railway Order becoming enforceable in mid August, the RPA expect that construction on this project will commence in the Autumn.  The RPA will also commence substantial advance enabling works on the Metro North PPP project in 2009.  The above is in addition to construction already taking place on other RPA and Irish Rail projects.

That objective has not changed.Significant progress is being made on Transport 21 and a number of projects have been completed, are under construction or are well advanced in planning terms.The value of the ten-year financial framework provided by Transport 21 is that it gives us flexibility to keep the programme under ongoing review and to make adjustments to that programme in an effective manner, taking account of all relevant factors.  For example there have already been revisions to some completion dates because of changes to the scope of projects arising from public consultation, planning issues, procurement issues and archaeological difficulties.Both my predecessor and I have consistently taken the view that, in the interest of the taxpayer and in ensuring that Transport 21 is achieved within budget, the cost of individual projects should not be released until the public procurement processes have been completed.  The publication of such commercially sensitive information prior to the completion of the procurement process.

The Integrated Ticketing Project Board was established in July 2006 to deliver the smart card technology required to deliver an integrated smart card ticketing system within an agreed specification, timeline and budget.  The initial focus of the project is in the Greater Dublin Area.The Board comprises the Chief Executives of the RPA, Dublin Bus, Irish Rail, Bus Éireann, a representative of private bus operators, a senior official from the Department of Transport, and a senior official from the Department of Social and Family Affairs as required, under an independent chairperson, Mr. David O'Callaghan, former Secretary General of the Department of Defence.  The Project Board reports to me on a quarterly basis.In line with the provisions of the Dublin Transport Authority Bill, it is intended that integrated ticketing will become the responsibility of the Dublin Transport Authority.  The timeframe for the hand-over of the Integrated Ticketing Project to the Authority will be determined by me in consultation with the Authority after its establishment.  To date €13.5 million has been paid out by the Exchequer on the Integrated Ticketing Project.

Total Exchequer funding allocated to Iarnród Éireann for 2008 amounts to more than €720 million.  In addition to this investment the potential to expand rail freight will be considered as part of the development of the Sustainable Travel and Transport Action Plan.  Iarnród Éireann continues to pursue a policy of growing its rail freight business where opportunities present and of returning the rail freight business to profitability and, in that context, Iarnród Éireann has made progress in recent years in growing the rail freight business in areas where it holds a competitive advantage over road haulage, e.g. large volumes or trainloads over longer distances.Rail freight is fully liberalised since 1st January, 2007, and while no applications have been made to my Department for entry to the market to date, any expressions of interest would be welcomed.Question No. 264 answered with Question No. 255.

As the Deputy is aware, the implementation of individual national road projects, including the M50, is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Act, 1993 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. Under Section 19 of the Act, the allocation of monies in relation to the construction or maintenance of national road projects is a matter for the NRA.In addition, issues relating to tolls on national roads are in the first instance a matter for the NRA. The statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll by-laws and to enter into toll agreements with private investors in respect of national roads is vested in the NRA under Part V of the Roads Act, 1993 (as amended by the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the Roads Act 2007).In relation to the buy out of the M50 West Link concession, the cost of compensating NTR was a matter for determination between the NRA and NTR in line with the 1987 West-Link Agreement.  Under the agreement reached between NTR and the NRA, NTR is to receive annual payments of €50 million, plus Consumer Price Index, for each of the years 2008-2020, in other words, a sum in the order of €600 million. (Partial year payments will apply in both 2008 and 2020 reflecting the date the NRA takeover operations in 2008 and also in 2020 reflecting the expiry date of the existing NTR concession contract).

The study demonstrated that the projects being progressed by the ports sector have the potential to deliver adequate capacity going forward, in line with the established policy.The expansion proposals submitted by the port companies would be sufficient for a very large expansion in Ro-Ro and Lo-Lo capacity. My Department is continuing to actively monitor both the capacity situation at our ports and developments relating to the submitted expansion proposals.The slowdown in economic activity has caused a corresponding reduction in port throughput growth and this may impact on the timing of the need for new capacity. These trends will also be factors nationally for consideration as part of the upcoming Dublin Port NDP study, which while focusing on the future of Dublin Port, will also assess alternative port capacity options and potential in the medium and longer term.

This arises mainly from the fact that land acquisitions are not proceeding as quickly as originally anticipated at the start of the year.

An amendment to rectify this problem was proposed and accepted by the Dáil during its recent consideration of the Dublin Transport Authority Bill.  That Bill has now been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.Responsibility for vehicle standards and testing was transferred to the Road Safety Authority in September 2006, under the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 (Conferral of Functions) Order 2006 (S.I. No. 477 of 2006).The recommendations from the RSA for reforming the roadworthiness testing regime and for addressing a number of other related issues have been accepted by the Minister.

On its introduction, the London congestion charge reduced congestion by 30% and traffic levels by 18% with a positive net annual revenue. Similarly, the Stockholm congestion charge resulted in weekday traffic falling by 22% and a reduction of 12% in emissions. This was introduced initially on a trial basis and was later adopted following a public referendum.The success of these schemes is partly due to the availability of public transport alternatives and democratic consensus, following public awareness campaigns. Various types of charge are feasible, including cordon charges and area licences.  Technological development provides the means for more sophisticated and targeted pricing schemes.It is too early to say what, if any, fiscal measures are needed in Ireland.  The Government is committed to delivering a Sustainable Travel and Transport Action Plan this year, for which a public consultation process is recently concluded. The question of congestion reduction and measures in relation to restricting traffic volumes in the Dublin City Centre area will be explored in more detail as part of that Action Plan. Also, the Dublin Transportation Office, in their document ‘2030 Vision for Greater Dublin Transport' will address measures for Dublin. Information on the document is available from www.2030vision.ie.

Large public service vehicles are permitted to use all bus lanes.  Taxis, while being used in the course of work, and pedal cycles are permitted to use with-flow bus lanes.The prohibition on the use of bus lanes does not apply in respect of emergency service vehicles i.e. fire brigades, ambulances and vehicles being driven by members of the Garda Síochána, in the course of duty.Last year, I received a request from the Commission for Taxi Regulation to amend regulations so as to permit the use of bus lanes by hackneys and limousines.  In considering this request, I have received the views of several interested bodies.  However, a case is pending before the High Court in which a limousine operator is challenging the provisions of the existing regulations.  I intend to await the outcome of this case before making a final decision on the Taxi Regulator's request.

After that meeting, I relayed their specific concerns to my Cabinet colleagues and on the need in Ireland for a strong and professional haulage industry.In a positive response to road haulage concerns, an Inter Departmental/Agency Task Force was immediately established at a senior level. This group has met on a regularly and has made progress on a number of measures, particularly in relation to increased enforcement targeting illegal activities of both hauliers and consignors.The Revenue Commissioners have intensified operations to detect the illegal use of green diesel and laundered fuel in order to protect oil revenues and safeguard the interests of legitimate traders with over 470 detections of illegal fuel in motor vehicles already this year. These operations have been publicised widely in the media over last weekend. In addition, the number of Multi Agency Checkpoints has increased substantially.The RSA and the Garda are working closely together to ensure that the widest range of checks (on road haulage licensing requirements, as well as tax, insurance, roadworthiness and green diesel) are carried out.  In addition, the probity surrounding the issue of road haulage licences is also being examined.The Garda has significantly stepped up enforcement with activities focused on untaxed fuel, targeted operations against the illegal transportation of waste material and unlicensed haulage activities from quarries. Checks have been intensified on hauliers entering from other jurisdictions without proper documentation and there will be a significant increase in enforcement activity at ports and border crossings. These operations will be publicised by the Garda Press Office.The Road Safety Authority (RSA) launched an advertising campaign on 3 July targeting contractors and sub-contractors and has intensified enforcement activities and multi agency checkpoints.A number of other issues relating to motor taxation, vehicle standards, biofuels, proposals for increased penalties and fines and better regulation are currently being examined by the Taskforce. The Road Safety Authority also issued a consultation paper on the use of Agricultural Vehicles in road haulage last Friday and comments were invited from the IRHA.I am also aware that one of key concerns affecting the transport industry is the impact of increasing world oil prices. The price of fuel is being largely driven by external factors and the impact of these increases is being felt by all sectors of the economy, here in Ireland and indeed throughout Europe. I have relayed these concerns to my Cabinet colleagues. The Minister for Finance has already stated that the overall response of the economy to the increase in fuel prices is that as adopted at the recent Ecofin and European Council meetings, that distortionary fiscal and other policy interventions should be avoided as they prevent the necessary adjustments by economic agents.Finally, with regard to any contingency plans to deal with potential road or port blockades, these are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice and the Garda working with other relevant agencies.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	839	The National Vehicle and Driver File (NVDF) contains details, including ownership data, on all 2.5 million registered vehicles and 2.6 million licensed drivers in the country and facilitates the processing of all motor tax and driving licence business from all motor tax outlets nationwide and through internet-based services.The primary function of the NVDF is in supporting motor tax and driving licence services for some 900 users across all the main motor tax offices and other outlets (57 in total) as well as internet services supporting the extremely successful Online Motor Tax Service and the recently introduced facility whereby motor dealers may notify changes of vehicle ownership.The NVDF contains personal data relating to drivers and vehicles which are highly sensitive and confidential and consequently extreme caution is applied in relation to the release of data to other parties.There are significant legal obligations in relation to information security and the release of NVDF data — the Data Protection Acts 1998 and 2003 which cover the confidentiality of ‘personal' data on the NVDF and the Finance Acts, which provide the legal basis for the NVDF and for access to the NVDF data.Section 60 of the Finance Act, 1993, as amended provides for access to NVDF data by Government Departments, licensing (motor tax) authorities in Ireland and other Member States of the EU, the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda and such other persons as may be prescribed.The following are prescribed for the purposes of Section 60 of the Finance 1993 to receive NVDF data including personal information; Local Authorities; Road Safety Authority, National Car Testing Services, Motor Importers and Distributors (vehicle recalls), Motor Insurance Bureau, An Post, Eirtrade Services Ltd. and motor insurers. There are also agencies such as The Private Security Authority, the Pensions Ombudsman, the National Employment Rights Authority and road toll operators who may receive NVDF data through their own legislative frameworks. There are also arrangements in place to supply vehicle data without personal details to Auto Records Ltd., T/A Cartell, The Society of the Irish Motor Industry, insurers, MoneyMate and Aspen Connect.Driver File (NVDF) is supplied to NCTS to assist with the operations of that company in relation to the testing of private cars.  The data are provided on the basis of an annual electronic file extracted from the NVDF containing details of vehicles which will be subject to testing in the following year, followed by periodic updates to reflect subsequent changes including changes of vehicle ownership. All aspects relating to the day-to-day operation of the car testing service including the issuing of test reminders is a matter for NCTS. I understand however that NVDF data quality is not the reason for NCTS not issuing reminders to vehicle owners prior to test due date. Insofar as NVDF/NCT electronic interface is concerned, necessary adjustments to the NVDF computer programs to improve and streamline the data transfer arrangements generally have been made. Comprehensive user testing is currently in progress and the new software will be released into the live environment as soon as possible. I am fully satisfied that there are no underlying problems with quality of data on the NVDF.As I have previously stated enforcing penalties for road traffic offences on foreign registered drivers raises many legal, organisational and procedural issues, which make it very difficult for any one State to enforce such penalties. For that reason, my Department is pursuing this question at European, British-Irish and North-South levels where mutual recognition and cross-border enforcement possibilities are under consideration with significant progress being made recently with agreement on the mutual recognition of driver disqualifications. As foreign licence holders do not have an Irish driving licence record is it not possible to record them on the NVDF and it is clear that the best way forward is for mutual recognition frameworks whereby details of offences are ‘homed' to the country of the licence holder.

However, the MBRS is keeping abreast of developments in this area and is keeping me informed on the matter.I have not received submissions from Irish based companies on this issue; I would refer any such submissions to the MBRS for advice.

The bidders are putting their bids together with a view to submitting them towards the end of this year.Advance works have commenced, detailed planning and design work on the project is ongoing and the RPA expects to lodge an application with An Bord Pleanála for a railway order in the current year.The target date for completion of the project is 2013.  However, this date will be critically determined by the outcome of both the planning and procurement processes.  These processes will also determine when the main project will commence, when a contractor will be appointed, when the project will be completed and when operations will commence.I am not in a position to publish the estimated capital cost of the Metro North project in advance of the completion of the public procurement process.  The publication of such commercially sensitive information prior to the completion of the competitive procurement process would prejudice the State's capacity to derive maximum value for money in respect of the project.

In some circumstances, while the preliminary work may have been completed on a particular application, a final decision cannot be made until other relevant applications or notifications from State Companies received prior to it have been finalised.In some cases, the application process can be delayed where relevant information is not provided by an applicant, such as an updated Road Passenger Transport Operators Licence, current Public Service Vehicle Licences and approvals from the Garda under the Road Traffic Acts for pick-up and/or set-down points.The Dublin Transportation Authority Bill is currently in its final stages, in the Houses of the Oireachtas. The next stage in this reform process is legislation to amend the Road Transport Act, 1932 which provides the statutory basis for regulating the provision of public bus services by private bus operators.I envisage that the new licensing regime will apply in respect of all commercial bus services, including those provided by Dublin Bus.  The new Bill will also encompass provisions relating to the subvented bus market outside the Greater Dublin Area that are consistent with the new EU PSO Regulation.

These include Metro North, DART Interconnector and Luas Line BX/D.  Pending the establishment of the Dublin Transport Authority, the Dublin City Manager chairs the Dublin Transport 21 Implementation Group which co-ordinates and oversees the investment programme in Dublin.  The group comprises the chief executives of the principal implementing agencies, an Assistant Secretary from my Department, the Fingal County Manager, the Director of Traffic and representatives of the Garda Síochána and business associations.Two sub-groups have been established and the business community are represented on both.  The Contingency Planning Group is overseeing the preparation of a traffic management plan for the Transport 21 construction phase, focussed particularly on the city centre.  This plan will take account of other construction activity by local authorities, public bodies and private developers.  The Communications Group is preparing a co-ordinated communications strategy for the construction period of major Transport 21 projects, such as Metro North and the Interconnector.  The theme of this strategy will be "Dublin is open for business".In March this year I held a meeting with the Transport 21 implementing agencies, An Garda Síochána and business organisations in Dublin to identify the principal concerns of the business community and to review progress on traffic planning for the construction phase.  I intended this to be the first in a regular series of meetings over the coming years to review progress, and the second such meeting has been arranged for later this month.

It also called on the incoming Northern Ireland Executive to work to enhance and protect the development of the Irish language. The British legislation giving effect to the St. Andrews Agreement included a specific requirement on the Executive to adopt a strategy setting out how it proposed to enhance and protect the development of the Irish language.With the restoration of the devolved Institutions on 8 May 2007, the question of an Irish Language Act for Northern Ireland is now a devolved matter for consideration by the Northern Ireland Executive. In that regard, my colleague the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Mr Éamon O Cuív T.D., has had ongoing discussions on the issue with his counterpart, the Northern Ireland Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure.The Government continues to follow developments closely in relation to the proposed Act, as well as the overall enhancement and protection of the Irish Language in Northern Ireland. This issue has been raised in discussions which my predecessor, Mr. Dermot Ahern T.D., and I have had with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr Shaun Woodward MP.The Government remains fully committed to the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and St Andrews Agreement, including the provisions relating to the Irish Language.

I have set out in tabular form below details of expenditure under sub-head A7 (Consultancy) and also the amount spent on public relations, marketing or advertising consultants, for the period in question. It should be noted that the figures relating to public relations, marketing or advertising consultants reflect costs incurred from sub-head A7 and also from various programme subheads within both Votes, where the expenditure incurred was specifically linked to a particular programme. For example, in 2007, €4,039 was paid to Rachel Dalton Communications from the Department's Communicating Europe Initiative to promote and publish the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs and the Sub Committee on European Scrutiny.I am very conscious of the need to achieve value for money on expenditure incurred in this area. My Department engages consultancy services only where specialised knowledge and/or skills are not available within the Department and, particularly in the case of Irish Aid (Ireland's official development assistance programme), where ongoing independent evaluation of programmes and projects is required.

Ireland is supportive of all efforts to bring about a sustainable and effective solution to the conflict in Sri Lanka and to aid development in that country.I remain deeply concerned by the termination of the 2002 Ceasefire Agreement between the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) in January of this year and the escalating violence in Sri Lanka.With our EU partners, we have consistently sought to impress on both the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE the importance of curbing violence and human rights violations and returning to meaningful peace talks. We continue to take the firm view that there can be no military solution and urge all sides to refrain from actions that make a negotiated settlement more difficult to achieve. I welcome the ongoing commitment on the part of the Norwegian Government to facilitate talks between the two sides should they agree to return to the peace process.Since 2005, Ireland, through Irish Aid has provided more than €5.3 million for humanitarian and development activities in Sri Lanka. This includes significant emergency assistance provided in the aftermath of the tsunami.Two members of Ireland's Rapid Response Corps have been deployed as Logistics Officers with the World Food Programme (WFP) in Sri Lanka, and Irish Aid provided a grant of €250,000 this year to the WFP to strengthen its logistics and preparedness capacity, providing considerable benefits to the wider humanitarian community operating in Sri Lanka.Ireland is willing to offer advice and assistance in support of the peace process if it is sought by the relevant parties. There currently appears little scope to do so in light of the negative situation within the country. An official from my Department has met with a delegation from the Irish Forum for Peace in Sri Lanka and made clear our willingness to work with the Forum on the issue of Sri Lanka and to maintain contacts into the future.

I regret that the most recent meeting does not seem to have produced any tangible results. However, given the Dalai Lama's repeated public commitment to non-violence and to the autonomy, not independence, of Tibet, and the Chinese government's statement that all issues can be discussed except independence, I believe it should be possible for these meetings to move to more substantial talks, which should address the issue of autonomy, within the framework of the Chinese constitution.My Department maintains regular contact with the Chinese authorities to convey the Government's ongoing concerns at the situation in Tibet. Through these contacts, we continue to encourage dialogue and to stress the importance that these talks be serious and substantive, addressing real autonomy, within the framework of the Chinese constitution.

This Law, passed in 2005, provides an overall legal framework for the demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration of illegal armed groups into Colombian society. The Justice and Peace Law, which was adopted through a lengthy democratic political process, strikes a difficult balance between peace and justice.The process of peace negotiations between the Colombian Government and the right-wing paramilitary group, Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC) began in 2003, with between 30,000 and 40,000 combatants having been demobilized on completion of the process in 2007. The Government of Colombia is currently engaging in dialogue with the left-wing guerrilla group known as the Ejército de Liberación Nacional de Colombia (ELN) in pursuit of a negotiated peace agreement. Negotiations between the major left-wing guerrilla group, the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC), and the Government have not yet commenced. In light of recent developments, I would hope that the FARC will now finally agree to engage in negotiations with the Government of Colombia.The General Affairs and External Relations Council of the European Union most recently adopted Conclusions on Colombia on 19 November 2007. Ireland was actively involved in the negotiation of these Conclusions, which expressed the EU's total solidarity with the Colombian people, its full support for the Colombian Government in its search for a negotiated solution to the internal armed conflict and underlined the importance the EU attaches to the ongoing implementation of the Justice and Peace Law.The Council further expressed its hope that progress would be made in taking forward negotiations in order to reach a humanitarian agreement, to secure the release of all hostages, to end the armed conflict and to bring lasting peace to Colombia. In the same spirit, the Council welcomed all initiatives taken with the Colombian Government's support with the objective of promoting a successful peace process.My Department continues to monitor the situation in Colombia through our Embassy in Mexico City, which is accredited to Colombia, as well as in cooperation with our EU partners with resident diplomatic missions in that country.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	859	There are three Advisory Committees and one Educational Commission which operate under the aegis of my Department: the Advisory Board for Irish Aid; the Development Education Advisory Committee; the Emigrant Services Advisory Committee and the Ireland-United States Commission for Educational Exchange (the Fulbright Commission).The Development Education Advisory Committee and the Emigrant Services Advisory Committee are advisory in nature and are serviced by staff of my Department. They have no specific budgets and therefore no procurement issues arise.The Ireland-United States Commission for Educational Exchange (the Fulbright Commission) was established in 1957 and finances study, research, teaching and other educational activities between Ireland and the United States of America. Notwithstanding certain specific statutory responsibilities of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Commission enjoys ‘autonomy of management and administration', by reason of Section 2(5) of the Educational Exchange (Ireland and the United States of America), Act, 1991. This means that the Commission itself is responsible for ensuring compliance with relevant procurement obligations.The Advisory Board for Irish Aid is an advisory body which was established to provide general oversight and advice to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State for Overseas Development on the strategic direction of the Government's programme of assistance to developing countries. The €1 million annual budget of ABIA is subject to the normal EU and national procurement rules for goods and services and is audited independently once a year. Audited financial statements are published annually as part of the Board's Annual Report. The Board is served by a secretariat of four civil servants, who ensure that proper procedures are followed. I am confident that the Advisory Board has properly adhered to all financial and procurement procedures since its establishment.The Department is fully committed to the principles of fairness, transparency and accountability in public procurement as well as to securing value for money for the taxpayer. Competitive tendering is standard procedure for all purchases, and is carried out in strict compliance with all applicable national and EU procurement rules. The Department has established an internal Procurement Unit to oversee compliance with these national and EU rules and to promote best practice and the achievement of value for money.

However, even with this reduction, I am confident that we will meet the target we have set of spending 0.54% of GNP on official development assistance this year. This reduction will be spread across the programmes to minimise the impact on any particular area.  The protection of front-line services to members of the public is at all times a priority for me and will remain so.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	862	There are a number of commitments in the Programme for Government relating to regulatory reform.  I am assuming that the Deputy's question refers to the reduction in ‘administrative burdens' — or so-called ‘red tape' — on business.In so far as my Department is concerned, the Government has agreed that I should lead the effort across Government to reduce the administrative burden on business, including small and medium sized firms, arising from regulations.In July 2007, the High-level Group on Business Regulation was established to seek concrete actions to reduce administrative burdens on business in five policy areas i.e. Taxation, Statistics, Environment, Health and Safety and Employment and Company Law. The Group comprises representatives of the business sector, trade union and relevant Government Departments and Agencies. In particular, the Group will seek to respond to specific suggestions from the business sector. I expect to publish the Group's First Report in the near futureIn March 2008, the Government set a target to reduce the administrative burden of regulations on business by 25% by 2012. My Department is currently devising the approach and methodology to be used across Government and is responsible for coordinating the work across Government Departments and Agencies and for reporting on progress.Initially, all Departments will be required to list the Information Obligations which their regulations impose on business. From that listing, Departments will assess which requirements are the most burdensome and will then measure the actual cost to business of these requirements.  At that point, the most appropriate approach to achieving the overall 25% target will be re-examined.Finally, as part of the Government decision last March, it was also agreed that in relation to proposals for future regulations, all Departments should (a) assess the proportionality of the burden imposed to the risk foreseen (b) measure the administrative cost on business (c) examine the impact on small business and (d) consider what education and advice requirements are necessary to improve compliance. This decision will be addressed through the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) process.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	864	I understand that in the Q1 2008 Quarterly National Household Survey, undertaken by the CSO, some 2,100 persons declared themselves to be musicians by occupation.With regard to the economic value of the music industry in Ireland I note that Goodbody Economic Consultants prepared an "Analysis of the Economic Significance of the Irish Music Industry" on behalf of the interim Music Board of Ireland in 2003 and that the report estimated the value-added of the industry to be just under one half of one per cent of GDP at that time. My Department does not have any data on the Exchequer contribution that might be made by this sector.I understand that specific support to the music industry and particularly to new and emerging artists is provided through the Business Expansion Scheme (BES), as extended to the Music Industry, with effect from 6 April 1996, for which my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism, is the certifying authority.  The extension of the Business Expansion Scheme to the Music Industry represented recognition by the Government of the increasing value of our cultural and heritage sectors in terms of employment creation, value added and generation of wealth.  The BES for Music was specifically targeted to stimulate investment in the production, publication, marketing and promotion of new and emerging talent, and is now extended to 2013.I am advised by the Department of Education and Science that Arts education (visual arts, music and drama) is one of the seven curriculum areas that comprise the primary curriculum, which was revised in 1999.  Music is a core part of the arts curriculum in all primary schools, and comprises listening and responding, performing and composing activities.At second level there are approved syllabi for both Junior Certificate and Leaving Certificate Music. Modules in the Arts are also available as part of the Leaving Certificate Applied and in the Transition Year programme.  The curricula continues the themes of performing, composing and listening skills, the development of music literacy and aural perception, and the regular practice of vocal and/or instrumental music.The Department of Education and Science also provides for substantial levels of investment in Music Education at Further and Higher level.  Overall, very significant resources are invested on provision of music education.With regard to employment rights, I can advise the Deputy that normal employee protection legislation already applies (and redress procedures are available) to musicians who have entered into a contract of employment with their employer. In this context, there are comprehensive redress mechanisms in place, including the Rights Commissioner Service, the Labour Court and the Employment Appeals Tribunal, to enable employees, including musicians to pursue cases where they believe they have been denied their entitlements.My Department is not aware of any specific complaints of musicians having been exploited by "unscrupulous employers" but if the Deputy can supply more specific information the matters at issue can be referred to the National Employment Rights Authority for investigation.

While I may give general policy directives to the agencies, I am precluded under the Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings, or from giving preference to one area over others.At the end of 2007, the latest date for which figures are available, there were a total of 583 people employed in 4 IDA supported companies in North Tipperary.  In line with the National Spatial Strategy, IDA Ireland is committed to balanced regional development and the development of Tipperary North as part of the Mid-West region in collaboration with all the other stakeholders in the region.As Ireland competes for investments at the highest end of the value chain the concept of scale is crucial to our economic destiny.  Leading corporations require a significant population of highly qualified talent, effective physical and digital infrastructure coupled with availability of sophisticated professional support services.  If we are to continue being successful in realising a large proportion of our investments outside of the larger cities, all economic and social stakeholders will need to adhere to the framework on which the NSS is constructed.  Future thinking and action must have a regional rather than a local bias and this requires a significant change in mindset.

I am informed by the IDA that there are 6 units in the Waterford Industrial Estate on which the Agency has long term lease agreements, and which are currently available for use.  A list of these units indicating their floor area is set out in the following tabular statement.The amount due on the balance of the leases of these 6 properties is €1,459,642.  However, it is anticipated that a number of these properties will be occupied or redeveloped during that period, which has the potential to reduce this liability.

The sub-Group includes elected representatives and representatives of business and the Development agencies.  In addition, Waterford County Council continues to employ a dedicated Economic Development Officer.I am aware that a fund of €700,000 has been put together for an Enterprise Centre in Dungarvan.  This sum includes €300,000 from Enterprise Ireland.  A site for the Centre has been offered by Waterford County Council and the design and planning of the Centre are progressing.In relation to the development of indigenous industry in County Waterford, Enterprise Ireland continues to offer its range of supports to its client companies in the County.  In addition, the agency works closely with the County Enterprise Board, the County Development Board and the South East Enterprise Platform Programme at Waterford Institute of Technology to promote entrepreneurship and, in particular, the formation of High Potential Start Up (HPSU) companies in County Waterford.  I understand two such companies, employing 23 people, have located in Dungarvan.  I should point out that there was also a major IDA Ireland job announcement from the United States for Dungarvan in April of this year.  A total of 100 new jobs will be created in the town by Microchem Lancaster Laboratories.At the time of the closure, the Industrial Training agency FÁS led an employment / training group to respond to the needs of the workers who were losing their jobs. In my reply of 7 November, 2007, to a similar question from the Deputy, I was able to say that of the 405 people directly affected by the closure, only a small number remained on the Live Register.I look forward to continued economic development and further job creation in Dungarvan and County Waterford generally in the coming years.

The region employs over 170,000 and exports €4.2 billion worth of products every year.  Limerick-Shannon represents the largest urban centre after Dublin and Cork and represents approximately 20% of Ireland's GDP.  There are approximately 600 indigenous companies employing over 15,000 people throughout the counties of the Mid-West.Since January 2007 Enterprise Ireland has responsibility for the support and development of all indigenous industry in this region. This new role involves the key aims of;driving the growth of Irish owned export focused innovation based start-ups.proactively developing existing client companies in all sectors andfacilitating local and rural enterprise throughout the region.In addition the agency has a particular focus on the development of leadership, exports and new product development through supported research in these companies.In terms of job creation, Enterprise Ireland activity is aggressively focused on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs in manufacturing and internationally traded services companies, the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and in enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional level.  A central goal for IDA Ireland is the achievement of balanced Regional Development.  The National Spatial Strategy (NSS) provides a framework for the development of the Limerick / Shannon gateway.  IDA Ireland markets the area across all sectors through its network of overseas office with emphasis on the gateway and hub towns.Ireland is competing with developed city regions elsewhere.  As Ireland competes for investments at the highest end of the value chain, the concept of scale is crucial to our economic destiny.  Leading corporations require a significant population of highly qualified talent, effective physical and digital infrastructure coupled with availability of sophisticated professional support services.  If we are to continue being successful in realising a large proportion of our investments outside of the larger cities, all economic and social stakeholders will need to adhere to the framework on which the NSS is constructed.Shannon Development is responsible for Foreign Direct Investment in the Shannon Free Zone (SFZ) and complements the work of the national development agencies in the region generally through the provision of tailored property solutions for FDI and indigenous industry.  The company is aggressively pursuing new investment opportunities for the Shannon Free Zone in home and overseas markets both in its own right and in collaboration with the national agencies.  A significant investment commitment is being made by Shannon Development to physically regenerate the Zone through direct and partnership investments in new buildings and existing building refurbishments under the auspices of an ambitious Master Plan approved by the Board of Shannon Development.For the period 2005 to 2007 a total of 9 new companies have signalled their intentions to establish and collectively create 500 jobs at Shannon.  Zimmer Orthopaedics will add a further 250 jobs to this total following their February 2008 announcement to establish a high-end orthopaedic implant manufacturing facility on the Shannon Free Zone.  Shannon development has a healthy pipeline with an imminent announcement due and further job creating investments from new and existing companies expected by year end.In 2007 the Shannon area County enterprise Boards (CEBs) paid over out €1.7 million in grant aid to 170 projects and assisted in the creation of 378 net jobs in the region.  In addition to providing grant-aid to projects, the Enterprise Boards also provides a range of "soft supports" to businesses within the area.  These supports include business related training courses for owner-managers and their staff, one-to-one mentoring provided by business specialists, in company training and start your own business courses.  In 2007 3,704 people availed of such training programmes run by the Shannon area County Enterprise Boards.

Responsibility for indigenous enterprise transferred from Shannon Development to Enterprise Ireland in January 2007.  There were 2,811 people in permanent full-time employment in 132 Enterprise Development Agency (Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland) assisted-firms based in Co. Clare at end 2007.The Government is committed to achieving balanced regional development and a key regional objective included in the NDP is to support the creation of conditions necessary to extend the process of employment and productivity growth in higher value added functions to all regions.  In that regard, we have made significant progress in working towards maintaining and enhancing our framework competitive conditions, and promoting new areas of competitive advantage, by developing our R&D base, investing in critical physical and communications infrastructures and, promoting tertiary education and lifelong learning.  Clearly the strategies set out in the National Development Plan, which support the continued implementation of these policies, will play a crucial role in maintaining the attractiveness of the regions as investment locations.The enterprise agencies aim to support sustainable, high value added enterprise, in all regions through the provision of mentoring and developmental supports, the enhancement of management capabilities and critical workforce skills in client companies, support for the creation and implementation of strategies for market entry, development and growth, and strong supports for innovation and for research and development.  An essential, and complementary ingredient to this strategy for the region is the agencies partnership with educational institutions such as UL, LIT, NUIG and GMIT.There are nine IDA Ireland supported companies in Co Clare, six of them based in Ennis; all of them established before 2007.  As part of an integrated Mid West region, IDA Ireland is committed to the development of Clare and is actively promoting the County for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).  The agency's strategy for the region involves a transition to the knowledge economy by winning such investment in innovation driven, high value sectors and working with its existing company base to expand their presence in Ireland by the addition of increased functions of scale and increased strategic functions.In line with the National Spatial Strategy, IDA Ireland concentrates its efforts on the gateway and hub locations, of which Ennis is one.  Towards that end, the development of Ennis Information Age Park has become an integral part of IDA's international marketing programme and will be pivotal in attracting new investors.Enterprise Ireland, which supports 123 firms in Co. Clare is focused on helping client companies adopt new and innovative business models, build service elements to their business offer, develop proprietary technologies, value-added products and services, and respond to the competitive challenges of the modern economy.  The agency continuously seeks to assist firms to innovate and internationalise in order to ensure long-term survival and growth.I am satisfied that the policies being pursued by Government, together with the work of the Enterprise Development Agencies on the ground, as well as the roll-out of the National Development Plan will continue to bear fruit in terms of investments and employment in the region.

Overall in the period in question 3,216 new full-time jobs were created while job losses amounted to 4,094.  While any factory closures and job losses are to be regretted they must be viewed in the context of an historically unprecedented period of job creation of well over half a million since 1997.  From 2002 to 2007 the County Enterprise Board has assisted in the creation of over 490 net jobs throughout the county.Key to the Enterprise Development Agencies' Strategies for the Louth area is to progress the development of a knowledge-based economy, so that the region can compete both nationally and internationally for foreign direct investment and the development of indigenous companies.  As part of the process of developing the capabilities of the region, the agencies work very closely with local interests.  They also maintain a close relationship with FÁS so that the requirements of industry particularly in the areas of training and up-skilling are being met.In line with this overall policy and their own North East Regional Strategy, Enterprise Ireland's aim of fostering closer links between local educational institutions and industry, led the agency to provide funding to the Regional Development Centre at the Dundalk Institute of Technology, for Incubation space.  In the past it has also developed a programme for entrepreneurs in association with Dundalk IT.  Given the geography, cross-border links are an important part of the agency's operations, and along with developing relationships with InterTrade Ireland, EI in association with Invest NI, are currently running a Cross Border Enterprise Incubation Programme which is known as the Transform Programme.  This is a programme for new entrepreneurs who wish to research new innovative business ideas.Competition for foreign direct investment (FDI) is relentless but Ireland continues to punch above its weight when it comes to attracting overseas investment.  Indeed, County Louth has the largest concentration of IDA supported companies — 19 in all.  IDA Ireland is actively marketing County Louth for new inward investment and, in line with the National Spatial Strategy, the gateway town of Dundalk has been designated a primary development centre.  Dundalk is being targeted by the agency for new investment in the Pharma, ICT, Financial Services and Internationally Traded services sectors.  I am advised that IDA Ireland owns over 20 hectares of land in the county overall, including Drogheda Business and Technology Park.The Government is committed to achieving balanced regional development and a key regional objective included in the National Development Plan (NDP), is to support the creation of the necessary conditions, to extend the process of employment and productivity growth in higher value added functions to all regions.  Progress has, and will continue to be achieved, by developing our R&D base, investing in critical physical and communications infrastructures and, promoting tertiary education and lifelong learning.  Underpinning the vision of establishing Ireland as a key location for leading edge research and development, and one where high quality jobs that are underpinned by knowledge and high skill levels become a reality, the NDP sets out an investment of €8.2 billion in Research, Development and Innovation to 2013.Enterprise Ireland and IDAJob gains200220032004200520062007Total 02-07All Agencies4432586156186985843,216Enterprise Ireland2642195144684093942,268IDA Ireland17939101150289190948

The proposed investment is expected to exceed $300 million, of which a portion would be attributed to R&D activities, and will include manufacturing, laboratory and pilot plant facilities to enable process development and product commercialisation.  It is anticipated that the proposed flavour manufacturing and innovation facility will create approximately 60 jobs after one year and in excess of 100 jobs after five years of the plant's operation.  IDA Ireland will be supporting both the manufacturing and R&D dimensions of the overall investment.  However, for reasons of commercial sensitivity and client confidentiality, the amount of grant aid given to the project cannot be divulged.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	880	The company in question announced the closure of its manufacturing and distribution operations in Drogheda in August 2007.  The decision was due to excess capacity in Ireland.  The company is committed to supporting its employees through a generous redundancy package, retraining, business start up assistance, a high level of outplacement and by promoting the skills and expertise of its employees.  The full range of services of FÁS were made available to those workers who wished to avail of them.While the future plans for the development or disposal of the site are exclusively a matter for the company the services of the industrial development agencies are at the disposal of the company in this regard.  Both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are actively working to market County Louth for new inward investment and to grow indigenous enterprise, particularly the Gateway Towns of Dundalk and Drogheda, which are designated as primary development centres under the National Spatial Strategy.Both agencies also work closely with Dundalk Institute of Technology in the development of programmes to facilitate investment in the region.  Dundalk Institute of Technology is proactive in the provision of both courses and facilities to encourage development.  These include facilities to promote Digital Media, and its Regional Development Centre in which there are a number of incubator units to promote start up operations.  Enterprise Ireland has provided direct funding to the Regional Development Centre.I am confident that the combined efforts of the development agencies, in collaboration with all local stakeholders will deliver sustainable investment and employment for the region and that the policies currently in place to achieve that objective are the correct ones.  The State Development agencies under the auspices of my Department will continue to promote Drogheda and Co. Louth in general for new industrial development.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	883	The Agencies and Offices, which come under the aegis of my Department, are aware of the necessity to comply with the Department of Finance Public Procurement Guidelines in relation to the acquisition of goods and services by them.  The Department of Finance Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies, which applies to non commercial and commercial State Bodies, states: competitive tendering should be normal procedure in the procurement process of State bodies.  It is the specific responsibility of the Board to ensure that this procedure is implemented and that it is fully conversant with the current value thresholds for the application of procurement rules.  The detailed procurement procedures, as set out in the Public Procurement Booklet,  in respect of competitive tendering should be applied.  It is stressed that, in addition to the national guidelines, the relevant EU Directives, which have the force of law in this and all Member States, should be complied with.  It is the responsibility of the Board and management to ensure such compliance.   The Chairperson should, in the annual report to the relevant Minister "affirm compliance with the procurement procedures outlined above."I have not expressed concern to any Agency or Office, other than FÁS, that it might be acting inappropriately in relation to procurement guidelines.  FÁS, along with a number of other State Bodies, was criticised in a recent report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG) dealing with audits of Non-Commercial Semi-State Bodies.  FÁS has since taken a number of steps in response to its internal audit report, on which the Comptroller and Auditor General's report is based, by strengthening its procedures and internal financial controls.Nonetheless, I have discussed this matter with the Director General of FÁS and have expressed my concern at the breach of procurement guidelines and the need to secure value for money in public expenditure.  In addition, I have requested my Department to follow this matter up directly with the Director General of FÁS.  The Secretary General of my Department has since written to the Director General seeking formal assurances that the practices referred to in the above reports have ceased and that adequate systems and controls are in place to prevent any recurrence.  He has also requested regular reports from the Director General on the implementation of these systems and controls.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	884	The Government decided this week that public expenditure savings totalling €440 million will need to be found this year across all Departments and agencies to manage the present budgetary pressures.  My Department will contribute a minimum of €24.551 million towards the overall savings target.  €19.15 million of my Department's 2008 savings will be in respect of FÁS's allocation, which is the largest single spending area in my Department's Vote, amounting to over €1 billion.A saving of just over €1 million will arise on my Department's Administrative Budget and the remaining savings will, as far as possible, be spread proportionately across other areas of my Department's Vote.  As required by the Government decision, savings will include a reduced spend on areas such as consultancy, advertising and public relations.The savings identified will have minimum impact on front line services and have been designed to ensure that the most vulnerable members of our society are protected.  Thus, there will be no reduction in places on Community Employment or the Jobs Initiative scheme and no savings are being sought on programmes for people with disabilities.

My policy on the arts is to promote and strengthen the arts in all its forms, increase access to and participation in the arts, and make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life.In so far as my Department is concerned, specific support to the music industry and particularly to new and emerging artists is provided through the Business Expansion Scheme (BES), as extended to the Music Industry, with effect from 6 April 1996, and for which I am the certifying authority.  The extension of the Business Expansion Scheme to the Music Industry represented recognition by the Government of the increasing value of our cultural and heritage sectors in terms of employment creation, value added and generation of wealth.  The BES for Music was specifically targeted to stimulate investment in the production, publication, marketing and promotion of new and emerging talent, and is now extended to 2013.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	890	Having regard to my ambit as Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, no funding has been provided specifically to rural development and LEADER programmes.  However, funding through the Department's Sports Capital Programme, the Local Authority Swimming Pools Programme and the Arts and Culture Capital Enhancement Scheme (ACCESS) benefits, on an ongoing basis, rural communities and rural development through the provision of local Sports and Arts infrastructure.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	891	Under the sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.  A total of 6,716 projects providing a range of essential sports facilities have now benefited from sports capital funding under the programme since 1998 bringing the total allocation in that time to €675 million.Under the guidelines, terms and conditions of the sports capital programme, a "sunset clause" provision exists whereby the Department can fully or partially withdraw grants in the absence of satisfactory progress being made by the grantee, for any reason, in drawing down the grant.   The reasons for withdrawals vary and in the period from 2001 to 2008, just over €23 million in grants were withdrawn.  The information requested in relation to the reasons for projects not proceeding and the proportion of these withdrawals that applied to projects in CLAR or RAPID areas is not readily available and its compilation would involve a disproportionate amount of time and work.In relation to withdrawals generally, the Department deals with each case on its merits, taking into account the circumstances or difficulties faced by the individual grantee concerned, for example if the project involved is in a highly disadvantaged area. The sports capital programme continues to prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of facilities.  Since 2002, those areas that have been designated by Government for special support through the schemes administered by Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, i.e. RAPID, Local Drugs Task Force (LDTF) and CLAR areas, are treated as disadvantaged under the programme.Projects identified as being located in areas designated as disadvantaged are targeted and prioritised in a number of ways during the assessment of applications. In particular, they are permitted to have a lower level of minimum own funding available towards their project and extra marks are also awarded to such projects during the assessment process by the application of socio-economic disadvantage criterion.  Indeed under the 2008 sports capital programme, the level of own funding required by applicants from RAPID and Local Drugs Task Force areas was reduced to 10% from 20%, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government.   I am confident that this measure will further assist projects in disadvantaged areas to benefit from sports capital funding under the programme.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	893	The Sports Capital Programme, which is administered by my Department, is the primary means of providing funding to sporting clubs, voluntary and community organisations towards the provision of sporting facilities at local, regional and national level throughout the country.Under the Programme funding is not provided for the development and maintenance of walks on public land. However, Fáilte Ireland provides funding to local authorities for the development of certain elements of tourism-related infrastructure, under the Tourism Infrastructure Fund.  The focus of this Fund, which was launched in 2007, is on supporting local authorities and other key infrastructure providers to develop appropriate facilities for tourists.  It targets facilities such as walking and cycling routes, jetties and moorings, angling stands, access paths to key areas of environmental and scenic interest, and signposting and orientation facilities in heritage and historic towns.Grant funding provided under the Tourism Infrastructure Fund is approved by the Fáilte Ireland Authority following an assessment of proposals received from local authorities and other development bodies throughout the country.  Such decisions are day to day matters for Failte Ireland under the terms of the National Tourism Development Authority Act, 2003.While the intention is that the Infrastructure sub-programme will continue over the lifetime of the National Development Plan, the focus of Failte Ireland is now moving to other elements of the Product Development Sub-Programme, including investment in visitor attractions and visitor activities.  The Tourism Infrastructure Fund is currently closed and it is a matter for Fáilte Ireland as to whether it will re-open for applications in 2009.

Compliance with the relevant financial procedures including procurement guidelines is a matter for the agencies themselves.Agencies' internal audit functions are required to ensure that all aspects of corporate governance and financial control are met.  The agencies are also liable to audit by the Comptroller & Auditor General on matters relating to their finances and to the procedures and practices operated by them, including those in respect of procurement.In addition, compliance with the Code of Practice, including its procurement aspects, is monitored by the Department through the normal corporate governance process.  This involves, variously, regular liaison meetings with the agencies concerned at which assurances are sought and received in respect of compliance with the procurement procedures, as well as written assurances to that effect, whether in annual reports or otherwise.In view of the foregoing there has been no requirement to express particular concerns to any agency.

The savings will be as follows; €3 million in Departmental operated capital programmes for cultural projects; €2 million savings split mainly among our agencies in grant programmes and an additional €978,000 in savings in administration costs and other efficiencies across the Department, the National Gallery and our agencies. The Agencies have been asked where possible, to apply the cuts in such a way as to have minimal impact on the levels of service to the public.  This will also be done in the Department.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	898	Farm Assist is a stand-alone statutory scheme which replaced the ‘small-holders' unemployment assistance arrangements.  The scheme represents a long-term safety net for low income farmers, as recipients retain all the advantages of the jobseeker's allowance scheme (formerly unemployment assistance), e.g. retention of secondary benefits and access to active labour market programmes, while benefiting from more generous means assessment disregards.The general increases in welfare rates in recent years, including 2008, mean that it is now easier for farmers to qualify for support under the scheme.In addition, improvements in the method of assessment of earnings from insurable employment, introduced from September 2007, provide further gains for farm assist claimants and their spouses, where they are also in insurable employment.I am satisfied at present that the scheme is serving its intended aims.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	899	According to the Department's records the person concerned is currently in receipt of family income supplement.  He was initially awarded €22 per week from 13th March 08 but, on provision of further information, a revised decision was made on 11th June awarding €34 per week from 13th March 2008.  This rate was put into payment from 19th June and arrears due were lodged to his bank account.The back to work scheme provides a monetary incentive designed to make return to work financially attractive and viable.  It is designed to support people who would not otherwise be able to return to the workforce for financial reasons.  To qualify for this allowance the application must be submitted in advance of taking up employment.The applicant must be in receipt of a qualifying payment for a specific length of time immediately prior to commencing employment.The qualifying payments are as follows:jobseeker's allowance/benefit for two years and aged over 23 years. Applicants must establish an entitlement to jobseeker's allowance.one-parent family payment, disability allowance, blind person's pension, carer's allowance, farm assist, invalidity pension, unemployability supplement, pre-retirement allowance, widows/widowers non-contributory pension, deserted wife's benefit/allowance, and prisoners wife's allowance for at least 15 months (12 months if aged 50 or over).illness benefit for at least 3 years.In May 2008, the wife of the person concerned was in contact with the Department's local facilitator in relation to the Back to Work Allowance and the conditions were explained to her.   According to the Department's record a claim for the allowance has not been received.The back to education allowance (BTEA) is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force.  It is paid at a standard weekly rate equivalent to the maximum rate of the relevant social welfare payment that qualifies the applicant for participation in the scheme.  It essentially replaces their existing social welfare income and, in addition, an annual €500 cost of education allowance is payable.To qualify for participation an applicant must, inter alia, be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment and must be at least 21 years of age prior to commencing an approved course of study.  People in receipt of disability related payments may access the scheme at 18 years of age.  Similarly, lone parents and people in receipt of unemployment payments can qualify at 18 years of age provided they are out of formal education for at least 2 years. An applicant must also be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least six months, in the case of a person wishing to complete a second level course, or twelve months in the case of a person wishing to pursue a third level qualification. The twelve month requirement is reduced to nine in the case of people who wish to attend a third level course and who are participating in the National Employment Action plan.A range of other supports are provided by locally based facilitators whose primary role is to assist long term unemployed and their families return to work, training or further education. The person concerned should contact his local Social Welfare Office to arrange to meet with a facilitator who will be able to advise him further on eligibility for participation in the back to work and back to education scheme and explore possible alternative supports through linkages with other agencies and organisations at local level.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	900	My Department currently operates the occupational injuries scheme which provides entitlement to benefit for persons suffering from certain prescribed diseases which are listed in the legislation and where that person has contracted that disease in the course of their employment.Where a person has contracted one of the diseases listed in the legislation, benefits are payable if they were employed in an occupation which is specifically prescribed in relation to that disease.  In addition, benefits may be payable if the claimant can show that the disease was contracted through an employment not specifically prescribed in relation to that disease. Employment under a contract of service as a miner is insurable for occupational injuries benefit under the Social Welfare Acts.  Miners who are unable to work due to an incapacity arising from their employment may be entitled to occupational injury benefit for the first 26 weeks of their claim.  If their incapacity extends beyond that period they may receive illness benefit or invalidity pension, subject to meeting the qualifying conditions for these payments.Miners may also be entitled to disablement benefit under the occupational injuries scheme. Disablement benefit is a compensation payment specifically for those who suffer a loss of physical or mental faculty as a result of an accident at work or a disease prescribed in legislation that they contracted at work. Medical assessments are undertaken in all such cases to determine the degree of disablement, which is calculated by comparison of the state of health of the applicant with a person of the same age and gender.

She was advised at that time that rent supplement would be paid in excess of the prescribed maximum limit, as an exceptional measure for a three month period, from March 2008. This three month period was granted in order to allow her time to secure accommodation within the prescribed rent limits.The person concerned has been awarded rent supplement in excess of the maximum rent limit, as an exceptional measure for a further period until the end of July 2008, to allow her additional time to secure accommodation within the prescribed rent limits.

The group held meetings on 3 occasions in 2007 and once in 2008. The next meeting of the group is scheduled for later in July.A number of enhancements have been applied to the National Employment Action Plan (NEAP). These include:a reduction in the period after which intervention takes place from 6 to 3 months on the Live Register for all age groups, andextension of the referral process to new claims from persons aged 55-64 who reach 3 months on the Live Register.The NDP 2007-13 provides for a Social and Economic Participation programme with the objective of promoting participation through activation measures aimed at people of working age.  This initiative involves an active case management service for social welfare customers of working age, including collaboration to ensure that customers, agencies and service providers in this area engage actively with each other.  A social partners group has been established to progress implementation and has met on two occasions. The programme will build on the existing activation service provided by some 40 facilitators based across the Department's 8 regional administrative areas.The interdepartmental group will continue to work in progressing objectives of Towards 2016 relating to activation measures and the referral process under the NEAP.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	910	The most recent analysis of the impact of long term demographic pressures on pension expenditure is given in the Green Paper on Pensions (October 2007). This analysis was based on population projections available at that time, which were from the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund (Mercer, June 2007) and the Department of Finance's long term pension expenditure model. Both projections took account of the structure of the population identified in the 2006 Census of Population and the most recent demographic trends up to 2007. A similar approach was taken in the Central Statistics Office's 2011-2041 population projections, which were published in April 2008. All of these projections showed a broadly similar pattern of increasing old age dependency over the medium to long term.The first indication of more recent migration trends will be available when the CSO's Population and Migration Estimates for April 2008 are published. These results are expected in September 2008.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	911	There are currently some 600,000 people availing of the Free Travel scheme at an annual cost of €66 million.There have been some 800 cases of suspected misuse of the free travel scheme reported to the Department by CIE in each of the past three years.   While the monetary value of a free travel pass depends on usage and varies significantly from individual to individual the loss based on the average value of a free travel pass is estimated at €85,000 for the each of the past three years.The return of a Free Travel pass following confiscation by a transport inspector is viewed as a serious matter.  The vast majority of confiscated passes are not replaced. Replacement passes are only issued where Departmental officials are fully satisfied that it is appropriate to do so.While the current free travel pass does not display a photograph, holders in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford must obtain an ancillary photo pass from CIE in order to use the CIE Group services.  This photo pass is obtained free of charge by eligible pass holders with costs being met by the Department.  The annual cost of the provision of the photo pass service in the major cities is approximately €55,000.It is planned that the initial issue of the new Public Service Card will include new Free Travel Pass customers.  The timescale and cost of this programme are currently under review, so it is not possible to predict at this stage the impact on the cost of operating the Free Travel Scheme.

There are two MABS companies in County Louth located in Dundalk and in Drogheda. Together they employ 6 money advice staff.The MABS computer system (MABSIS) was implemented in 2005/6 and 2007 was the first year for which full year statistics are available.  Statistics for 2007 in respect of the two MABS in County Louth show that they provided services to some 292 new clients and  approximately 109 people sought information about budgeting and money management. The total active case load at the end of 2007 was 592.There was some variation between the two services in relation to the breakdown of the debt owed by clients to creditors when they first approached the MABS.  Overall, 56% of the debt was owed to banks and financial institutions, 23.6% was owed in respect of utilities bills, 6.9% was owed to others and 5.4% was owed credits unions. Just under 1% of the debt was owed to moneylenders and catalogues.This year, up to the end of June, a total of 152 new clients have approached the MABS in County Louth seeking advice about debt problems. Information about waiting times in earlier years in not readily available but the present position is that clients that approach the MABS can expect to be seen promptly and will receive an appointment with a money advisor within 2 weeks.

To date an additional 31 posts have been allocated to some 15 offices and the necessary assignments are currently being made.In the past few years the Department has coped with increasing demands arising from significant changes to the social welfare code and in the number of persons accessing the system.  Operational procedures and the organisation of work continue to be reviewed and restructured to maximise the benefits of technology and new developments in processing techniques and business information.The Department is monitoring the fluctuation in the live register on an ongoing basis in order to ensure that local offices are adequately resourced. Cork Local Office currently has 92.5 staff and the overall processing times in the office are reasonable having regard to the increased claim load.  The Department has no immediate plans to assign additional resources to that office.

Only one new Family Resource Centre will be opened this year and additional staff will not be provided for the existing centres.  Funding will continue as planned to the 106 centres nationwide.Refurbishment of some offices for the Family Mediation Service will be deferred.  Reductions in spending on conferences, advertising and awareness raising activities by the Combat Poverty Agency.

The core objective of the cohesion process is to simplify and improve local delivery of programmes through the integration and alignment of local delivery structures and to ensure complete nationwide coverage.  The realignment of local delivery structures will reduce the overall number of local development bodies from 94 to 55, comprising 17 Partnerships in urban areas and 38 integrated LEADER/Partnership bodies in rural areas.I have arranged for details of the 55 operational areas agreed by Government to be forwarded to the Deputy.  My Department and I will be happy to deal with any specific questions that the Deputy may have.  In a small number of areas the redrawing of boundaries has been agreed on foot of locally agreed proposals to eliminate gaps and overlaps in areas of coverage while aligning the areas of operation of the partnerships with local authority boundaries.The revised operational areas, which will ensure full nationwide coverage, will be in place before the roll out of the new Local Development Social Inclusion Programme.  Transitional arrangements are being made for 2008 to enable the new integrated structures to extend their areas of coverage and to embed their operations.

This funding was allocated to 38 Local Action Groups contracted to deliver the Programmes following a selection process completed prior to the roll out of the Programmes.In accordance with the LEADER bottom-up approach to rural development, each Local Action Group is the decision-making authority in relation to approving and funding actions falling within its business plan.  Activities can be approved for funding by the Board of each Local Action Group on the basis of EU Regulatory requirements and within detailed operating rules governing the implementation of the Programmes.The Deputy may also be aware that I launched the LEADER elements (Axes 3 & 4) of the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 on 20th May 2008. The Programme will provide €425 million to improve the quality of life in rural areas and facilitate the diversification of the rural economy.  Consistent with the 2000-06 programming round, the Programme will be delivered by Local Action Groups through the LEADER bottom-up approach.  The process for selecting Local Action Groups commenced on 20th May.  The selection process will run over the coming months and will culminate in the selection of Groups and allocation of funding on the basis of recommendations from independent evaluators appointed to facilitate the selection process.  The final allocations will be subject to Government approval.I expect the Programme to be open to applications for grant assistance in late October 2008 when the process for selecting the Local Action Groups to deliver the Programme has been completed.

The Deputy will be aware that I launched the LEADER elements (Axes 3 & 4) of the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 on 20th May 2008.  The funding available for the delivery of LEADER-type activities under this Rural Development Programme will amount to €425.4 million — almost treble the €150 million available for the 2000-06 period.  The new Programme will complement the other funding for rural development measures by my Department.The overall aim of the Rural Development Programme is to improve the quality of life in rural areas and promote the diversification of the rural economy.  Under the Support for Business Creation and Development measure, €48.26m will be available over the life of Programme for a range of rural enterprise activity based on the exploitation of traditional rural resources.  The aim of this measure is to position rural areas so that they can provide economic activity of sufficient mass to attract people to live and work in rural areas.It is expected that approximately 10,000 new or existing micro-enterprises will be supported with the potential to create 12,600 fulltime equivalent jobs over the lifetime of the Programme.I expect the Programme to be open to applications for grant assistance in late October 2008 when the process for selecting Local Action Groups to deliver the Programme has been completed.

This added significantly to the supports available for small food producers and has provided a structured training environment for their development through to 2008.In December 2007 small food producers in the Dairy and Meat sector received a significant boost with the announcement of the appointment of two specialist advisors for a two year period covering 2008 and 2009.  Funding of over €350,000 was pledged to Teagasc to employ Technical Food Advisors with expertise in the dairy and meat sectors.  The new technologists are working on the development and delivery of technical support primarily for artisan food businesses in those sectors.  They will liaise with food businesses to identify their technical and development needs and will ensure that the best knowledge, skills and technology is made available through training, advice and technical support to these food businesses.

Axis 3 focuses on the Quality of Life in rural areas and diversification of the rural economy, while Axis 4 deals with the administration of the Local Action Groups who will deliver the measures in Axis 3.  Specific measures and projects under the Programme, including agri-tourism projects will be approved through the Local Action Groups that deliver the Programme on the ground throughout the country.Axis 3 and 4 of the new Programme include measures which should provide significant opportunities in the rural/agri-tourism sectors.  Two measures, in particular, are relevant.  Firstly, the Diversification into Non-Agricultural Activities measure, which has an overall budget of €16.66m, will support the development of tourism facilities and the development of niche tourism and educational services.  Secondly, the objective of the Encouragement of Tourism Activities measure, with a budget of €45.4m, is to maximise the tourism potential of all rural areas.  The allocations referred to are for the duration of the Programme; there is no specific allocation for any one year.  The areas to be covered are those outside the local authority boundaries of the ‘Hub' and ‘Gateway' town and cities identified in the National Spatial Strategy.My Department maintains regular contact with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in relation to the implementation of the Programme, including tourism measures.  In addition, discussions with the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism and Fáilte Ireland in relation to the specific tourism-related measures in the Programme take place as required.I have not commissioned any studies into the development of farm-based tourism; however, the Programme does provide for such studies or analysis where required.

It is anticipated that it will be rolled out to a further eight routes this year, with others coming on stream in 2009,There is agreement with Fáilte Ireland regarding the employment of 12 Rural Recreation Officers (RRO).  Their role will be to promote walking tourism in areas where there are clusters of suitable, accessible walks.  The RRO will act as a contact person for walking tourists and will provide a wide range of support and advice.  I understand that all 12 RROs have now been recruited.I have made over €1.3million in capital funding available to Fáilte Ireland to assist in the development of the national network of looped walks to a total of 50 trailheads and 75 Loops.  My Department continues to work with Fáilte Ireland on the upgrade and development of looped walks throughout the country.  I have allocated €90,000 (€30,000 per annum from 2006-2008) to Wicklow Uplands Council and Wicklow Rural Partnership to provide a network of access routes over private lands in areas of high scenic and amenity value in County Wicklow.In addition, my Department is actively pursuing the possibility of using former railway infrastructure as recreational trails — for activities such as walking and cycling — with the Department of Transport and Iarnród Éireann.  I have provided funding to Great Southern Trail to upgrade to cycling standard a section of the existing walking trail on the abandoned Limerick to Tralee railway line.  The National Trails Office of the Irish Sports Council, in association with my Department, is working on the establishment of a register of trails that are fully developed and open to the public.  My Department, Coillte Teoranta, Fáilte Ireland, the National Trails Office and others are also preparing a National Trails Day to enhance awareness and use of our trails.  Sunday, 28th September is the proposed date for the Trails Day.  Separately, discussions are continuing with Coillte Teoranta and Bord na Móna to discuss the possibility of expanding the use of their lands for recreational purposes and I will continue to progress this matter as I believe that there is considerable potential here to make significant contributions to rural recreation.

It is my understanding that the CCMA subsequently contacted all local authorities with the recommendation that the existence of permissive walkways on a landholder's land should not affect consideration of planning permission applications.

A further nine projects aimed at poly-drug/cocaine use are also being supported under that Fund.  While the projects have developed at differing rates, overall I am satisfied with the progress made.  Over €1m is provided annually through the National Drugs Strategy to support these projects.  The Deputy should also note that my Department has also provided funding for 4 pilot cocaine projects to examine different methods of treatment for cocaine use, as well as a training initiative for frontline personnel to deal with cocaine issues.Earlier this year, my predecessor, Pat Carey, T.D.  also announced funding of the order of €1.25m to address cocaine use in Drugs Task Force areas.  Of the overall amount, €750,000 is being provided to further develop initiatives aimed at tackling cocaine use in local communities, with the remaining €500,000 is being provided for locally based cocaine awareness campaigns that will dovetail with the national HSE campaign launched in February last.  The funding will be allocated to suitable projects over the coming months.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	938	The Report of the Working Group on Drugs Rehabilitation made a series of recommendations for the development of a comprehensive rehabilitation pillar under the National Drugs Strategy.As agreed by the Working Group, the HSE is taking the lead role on rehabilitation and I understand from them that the post of Senior Rehabilitation Co-ordinator is to be advertised shortly, and that they hope to have it filled by September.  In addition, I understand that the National Drugs Rehabilitation Implementation Committee (the establishment of which was recommended in the Report) will be in place by September to dovetail with the appointment of the Senior Rehabilitation Co-ordinator, who will chair it.  The recommendation in regard to extra detox beds will be pursued through this Committee.  Meanwhile, FÁS has made a commitment to increase the number of drug-specific Community Employment places from 1,000 to 1,300 and steps are being taken to arrange for this.A number of other rehabilitation initiatives are being progressed, including the following: my Department is providing funding of €750,000 for rehabilitation initiatives at Local and Regional Drugs Task Force level this year, as well as increased funding to the Family Support Network that will help to support the role of families in the rehabilitation process; the Irish Prison Service is working to improve the operation of the Local Prisons Liaison Groups and to endeavour to ensure a continuum of care for problem drug users when they leave prison; the Dept of Education & Science is developing proposals for an education fund for drugs rehabilitation; and the Dept of Environment, Heritage & Local Government is establishing a Working Group to progress the report's recommendations in regard to accommodation issues for recovering drug users.Overall progress on the implementation of the Report of the Working Group on Drugs Rehabilitation will continue to be monitored through the Inter-departmental Group on Drugs which I chair.  I can assure the Deputy that I will be pursuing its implementation over the coming period.

This is reflected in the allocation of over €64m in my Department's Vote for drugs projects this year, which represents an increase of nearly 29% on the original funding for 2007.This funding will facilitate the progress towards the fulfilment of commitments in the Programme for Government, including developing and strengthening the range of projects being undertaken through the Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces.  The additional monies will allow for further progress towards the full implementation of the plans of the ten Regional Drugs Task Forces.  Expenditure in 2007 on the plans came to over €7m and the increased provision in 2008 will allow for the full year cost of the approx. 155 community projects, already in progress and the start of roughly another 40 projects this year.In addition, a further €2m has been allocated in 2008 to develop and strengthen the work of the Local Drugs Task Forces (LDTFs) with over 440 LDTF projects currently receiving funding from my Department.  It should also be noted that €1.5m is being earmarked for developing specific cocaine and rehabilitation focussed projects through the LDTFs this year.  This funding will be allocated to suitable projects over the coming months.Finally, under the Premises Initiative Fund, which addresses the accommodation needs of community drugs projects in Drugs Task Force areas, nearly €4m has been approved in respect of 15 capital projects in 2008.

Approx.  €66m has been provided for capital developments, which include the building, upgrading, fit-out and refurbishment of approx. 220 youth and community facilities in the different target areas.In 2008, current funding of the order of €17m is being provided to support the employment of over 350 youth and outreach workers, centre managers and administration staff.  It also includes 24 Sports Development Officers, along with a further 13 "Football in the Community" Development Officers who are co-funded through the Fund, Dublin City Council and the FAI.A call for the development of further capital facilities, in the amount of €4m, was announced earlier this year.  Proposals submitted in this regard are currently under consideration.At present, the Fund operates in the 14 Local Drugs Task Force areas (Dublin (12), Bray and Cork), and in Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Carlow Town.  Following an announcement earlier this year, the Fund will be extended to Arklow, Athlone, Dundalk and Wexford over the coming months.Consistent with the Taoiseach's announcement in May last, arrangements to transfer responsibility for the Fund to the Office of the Minister for Youth Affairs and Children are currently being progressed.

Since 1997, more than €65m has been provided by my Department and its predecessor for the development of island infrastructure.  In 2008, a further €33m has been allocated for this purpose, bringing the total amount provided to date to almost €100m.This unprecedented level of investment has resulted in significant improvements to access infrastructure on and for the islands. The following examples illustrate this:the construction or development of piers at a number of locations, including Árainn Mhór and Machaire Rabhartaigh in County Donegal, Coney Island, County Sligo, the Clew Bay islands of Clynish, Inishlyre, Insegort and Islandmore, as well as Inis Bigil, Doran's Point, Clare Island, Inishturk and Roonagh in County Mayo and the Cork islands of Whiddy, Bere, Sherkin, Cléire, Long and Heir;the construction of airstrips at Clifden and Inishbofin and the resurfacing of airstrips on the Aran Islands;the provision of new helipads on Árainn Mhór and Cléire;coastal protection and pier improvement works on Inishbofin, andmajor pier and harbour developments on the three Aran Islands: construction of a new pier on Inis Meáin is nearing completion, while the largest development ever undertaken by my Department (in excess of €40 million) has recently commenced at Cill Rónáin, Árainn, and plans for the development of the pier on Inis Oírr are also at an advanced stage.As island access infrastructure has improved, so too have associated access services.  At this stage, my Department is funding eighteen island transport services, including ferry and air, compared to just seven in 1997 and, of course, many of these older services have been greatly improved since then.  The annual cost of these subsidised services is approximately €5m.The cost of transport for passengers and cargo to the islands has been a major issue for island communities.  The capping of passenger fares for islanders on contracted ferries (€8 for adults; €5 for students and children) has made a significant difference in this regard, as has the reduction by nearly two thirds of tariffs on the Aran Islands cargo service and the introduction of similar tariffs on other new cargo services.

The objective of this measure is to promote the sustainable tourism potential of all rural areas through the provision of the necessary infrastructure and the development of the countryside as a recreational resource for all.In relation to Údarás na Gaeltachta, I can confirm that strong working partnerships exist between Údarás and Fáilte Ireland, particularly through their regional offices and other tourism organisations, to optimise the opportunities provided by the tourism industry for the Gaeltacht. It may be noted that in 2007 employment figures in the Gaeltacht-based tourism sector (language, cultural & service based activities) increased by 25% over the 2006 level.

Support provided is in the form of a contribution towards the wages of five managers and twenty-four full-time equivalent workers.  An allocation is also provided for non-wage expenses. The community enterprises supported under the CSP in turn provide support for various services, including support for tourism initiatives, transportation, recycling, literacy, social care and youth support services, and also the maintenance of community halls and facilities.With regard to the RSS, Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann implements the programme on the islands on behalf of my Department and has a quota of twenty participant places. In 2007, eleven projects were undertaken under the RSS.In relation to the Community Employment Scheme and the Jobs Initiative, these do not fall within the remit of my Department and are matters for my colleague, Ms Mary Coughlan, T.D., Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.

In this regard, I would like to point out that, in order to facilitate people wishing to participate in the process but who have difficulties in operating or accessing technology, surveys can be completed in hard copy also.In terms of the next steps in the overall process, it is proposed to commence preparation of a draft discussion document outlining principal issues for the proposed Strategy, taking into account the views and recommendations expressed by the public, both at public meetings and through the completed surveys, together with the views of other stakeholders.  It is expected that this paper will be available for further public consultation in the autumn.  Thereafter, my Department will prepare a draft Strategy for my consideration and for submission for Government approval by the end of the year.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	947	I propose to take Questions Nos. 449 to 451, inclusive, together.I refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions No. 10 and 33 of 15 Bealtaine 2008 in relation to these matters, in which I indicated that Foras na Gaeilge has a statutory responsibility for providing advice and assistance to public bodies with regard to the delivery of services through Irish. In that context, my Department is continuing to work with Foras na Gaeilge and other interested parties in relation to putting in place resources to enhance the capacity of the public service to provide services through Irish.  These include:Development of a Quality Assurance System for TranslatorsForas na Gaeilge has, at my request, developed an accreditation system for Irish language translators.  To date 98 translators have achieved the required standard. I understand that the results of the accreditation examination held earlier this year will be available within the next fortnight and that this will significantly increase the number of accredited translators. The system is a significant resource for public bodies in their implementation of the Official Languages Act.  In addition, support is offered to assist translators in achieving the standard required for accreditation.  The accreditation system will be a continuous process and will involve examination of translators at regular intervals on an ongoing basis.Establishment of Dedicated Fund for 3rd level coursesIn 2006 I established a dedicated fund for advanced Irish language third level courses to help increase the number of professionals with particular skills in the context of the requirements arising from the Official Languages Act 2003 and from the status accorded to Irish as an official and working language of the EU. My Department is working in collaboration with the HEA, King's Inns and a number of other bodies and institutions in relation to the development of such courses.  At the request of my Department, the HEA invited proposals from the third level sector in this regard in 2006 and again towards the end of last year.  A number of courses were approved in 2006 and 2007, and I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I recently approved funding for a number of additional courses. Courses being funded under this initiative include courses in the area of translation and interpretation. A number of courses have already commenced and it is hoped that further courses can be rolled out during 2008. Funding has also been provided to enable a number students with fluency in the Irish language attend a dedicated course for interpreters at the University of Westminster.Development of Irish Language Translation Memory ResourceDuring 2007, my Department, in conjunction with Foras na Gaeilge, began the process of developing, on a phased basis, a Translation Memory resource for the Irish language.  Translation Memory is based on the reuse of already translated material in order to save time and money. The intention is that this resource will become available during 2008. When developed, this will be a very practical and important resource that will facilitate public bodies in complying with their obligations under the Official Languages Act in a more effective manner by reducing the costs associated with translation to the Irish language.Other Resources in PlaceA number of additional resources and supports have also been made available for public bodies to aid them in developing the range and quality of services they provide through the Irish language.  These include a testing and certification system for adult learners of Irish developed by the Language Centre, NUI Maynooth, which involves the awarding of qualifications with Europe-wide recognition, as well as a glossary of signage and other terms established by Foras na Gaeilge on its website www.gaeilge.ie which continues to be developed and expanded.  In addition, during 2007, I provided a research grant, from my Department's Ciste na Gaeilge, to Fiontar, Dublin City University, to assist in the development of a database of EU and legal terminology in the Irish language. In addition, King's Inns, with financial assistance from my Department, provided an intensive Irish language course in 2007 to assist candidates for positions as Lawyer Linguists in the EU Institutions to reach the necessary standard.  The intensive course is being provided again this year and the Society has indicated that it intends to provide the three year Barrister-at-Law through Irish as from the 2009/2010 academic year.

However, Údarás na Gaeltachta and my Department have also provided assistance for the provision of childcare facilities in the Gaeltacht in the form of capital funding and the provision of suitable sites.In addition, an tÚdarás may provide feasibility study grants to help community groups in Gaeltacht areas with design and other related preliminary costs associated with the building of such facilities.Discussions are ongoing with the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in relation to the provision of Irish Language crèche services in the Gaeltacht.

These initiatives have been rolled out over the past year with an emphasis on e-marketing as well as traditional multi-media publicity campaigns.Examples of initiatives to date include:the Ireland North West Marketing Campaign using TV, radio, internet and brochures;Ireland West's Connemara Marketing Strategy;marketing at trade shows in the United States, the UK and Europe;the updating and revision of the Gaeltacht element of all Discover Ireland web information to include specific information on all Gaeltacht regions; anda targeted campaign using European tour operators, which was launched in Paris in April 2008 with a focus on the Belgian, French, Italian and German markets and involved specific market segments focused on the Gaeltacht and the Islands.I can assure the Deputy that strong working partnerships exist between Údarás na Gaeltachta and Fáilte Ireland, in particular through their regional offices and other tourism organisations, with a view to optimising the opportunities the tourism industry provides for the Gaeltacht.

The results for the former Southern Health Board area — which corresponds with the Regional Drugs Task Force covering Cork and Kerry — show that 0.1% of the population reported lifetime and last year heroin use in 2006/7.  However, no respondents reported last month use of heroin in the survey.  Further details are available on the NACD's website — www.nacd.ie,The recently published HRB Drug Trend Series reports that, in Cork & Kerry, of the 2,096 new cases (all ages) entering drug treatment between 2001 and 2006, 14% were treated for problem opiate use, 59% were treated for problem cannabis use and 12% were treated for problem ecstasy use.Finally, I understand that the HSE has carried out studies and surveys in the Cork & Kerry region on youth homelessness and on smoking, alcohol and drug use, though not specifically focusing on under 18s.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	955	Approx. €22m in current funding is being provided by my Department in 2008 to support Local Drugs Task Force (LDTF) projects.  Of that, over €8m relates to 108 projects targeting under 18s, including some cross-Task Force projects.   The National Drugs Strategy Team oversees the work of the Task Forces.The type of projects funded range from drugs education workers, prison links workers, counsellors, youth information projects and outreach services.  Some of the projects funded are not exclusively for under 18s — rather they encompass family members under family support projects and community drugs teams' initiatives.This year, additional funding has been provided to all the Drugs Task Forces to facilitate local and regional drugs awareness campaigns to dovetail with the national campaign, focusing on cocaine. These will be particularly pertinent to young people as the Drugs Prevalence Survey 2006/07 confirmed that illegal drug usage is predominantly a younger adult phenomenon, particularly among the 15-34 year age group.Under the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund, which targets 10-21 year olds at risk of drug misuse, current funding of the order of €17m is being provided this year to support the employment of over 350 youth and outreach workers, centre managers and administration staff.   Consistent with the Taoiseach's announcement in May last, arrangements to transfer responsibility for the Fund to the Office of the Minister for Youth Affairs and Children are currently being progressed.Overall, I am satisfied that the level of funding for projects in LDTF areas, including those targeting under 18s, is building on the on-going progress being made through the National Drugs Strategy to tackle problem drug use.

Due to delays in implementing the recommendation of the Sheep Strategy Implementation Group, there was no expenditure in 2007.  Unfortunately, the system of Government financial management is such that the money unspent in 2007 could not be carried forward.An interim Sheep Breeding Board was established recently and is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting on 16th July.

It has a budget of €5.778 billion over the lifetime of the Programme of which €2.339 billion will be funded by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EARDF) and €3.438 billion by the national exchequer. The contribution from the exchequer includes the necessary funding to match the EU contribution together with considerable additional national financing of €1.4 billion. The Programme is structured around three core Axes which have the aim of (a) improving the competitiveness of agriculture, (b) improving the environment and (c) improving the quality of life in rural areas.The main measures and allocation of funds under Axes 1 and 2 are REPS/Natura (€2.98bn), Disadvantaged Areas (€1.8bn), Early Retirement (€418m), Installation Aid (€63m) and Farm Investment (€85m). There is a budget allocation of €425m. for the broader rural development measures administered under Axis 3 and these will be implemented using LEADER, which emphasises a "bottom up" approach comprising area based local development strategies implemented by local action groups. The Leader Programme is administered by my colleague the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Mr. Éamon Ó Cuív T.D.Expenditure under the Programme at the end of June 2008 was close to €798.2m, being 13.8% of the total Programme budget. This expenditure has funded the investment and environmental measures under axis 1 and 2 and expenditure under the Leader measures will commence when the local action groups are fully established later this year.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	965	Article 3 of the Birds Directive, implemented in Ireland under the Wildlife Acts, allows for the creation of Special Protection Areas (SPAs) for the protection of birds. Such areas have been designated in Ireland where they contain significant populations or species of birds that are of national or international importance.Article 4(4) of the directive indicates that Member States shall take appropriate steps to avoid the deterioration of habitats within, and indeed outside of, these areas that may affect bird species and their populations. In the vast majority of these areas there is human activity including habitation, various recreational facility and commercial activity including farming, aquaculture and fishing etc.The Directive does not aim to preclude such activity from SPAs but an assessment of the risk such activities pose to bird populations should be carried out. Guideline procedures on how to asses this risk have been published by the EU Commission particularly in relation to implementing the Habitats Directive and Birds Directives which together have lead to the formation of a network of so called Natura 2000 conservation sites in Ireland which are designed to protect sensitive ecosystems including their bird populations.My Department is fully committed to respect the terms of the Birds Directive in Ireland marine sites.  My officials with BIM and the Marine Institute are actively working with NPWS to introduce acceptable procedures for the management of fishing activity in Natura 2000 sites.

Consequently the moratorium on all clearfelling harvesting in Freshwater Pearl Mussel catchments has now been lifted.The number of hectares licensed to date for clearfelling in each of the following catchments is as follows:Munster Blackwater Catchment — 146.10 Ha's;Bandon-Caha Catchment — 67.21 Ha's;Aughavard Catchment — 11.00 Ha's;Claddy Catchment — 13.60 Ha's;Leannan Catchment — 48.90 Ha's;Owenea Catchment — 40.20 Ha's;Eske Catchment — 4.60 Ha's;Owenriff Catchment — 17.80 Ha's;Dawros Catchment — 5.80 Ha's;Caragh Catchment — 22.80 Ha's;Kerry Blackwater Catchment — 14.16 Ha's;Newport Catchment — 21.30 Ha's;Clodagh Catchment — 5.20 Ha's;Licky Catchment — 94.60 Ha's.A total of four licence applications are currently under consideration accounting for 108.24 Ha's of forestry.  A further felling licence application for the clearfelling of 13.7 Ha's has been suspended.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	969	The Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) of the Rural Development Plan 2007-2013 was a formal, systematic evaluation of the anticipated significant environmental effects of the Plan.  The Environmental Report, undertaken as part of the Strategic Environmental Assessment, is a major assessment measure and sets out the conditions that are applied at implementation level.  This report identifies threats to water quality as one of the potential adverse effects of forestry and pearl mussel habitats are highlighted in the context of introducing measures to improve water quality.At implementation level, a range of assessment measures and guidelines act to counter the potential adverse effects with specific account taken of the freshwater pearl mussel.  All applications for afforestation are subject to a detailed screening procedure to determine if an environmental impact assessment is necessary.  The procedure includes specific reference to the freshwater pearl mussel and the hen harrier protocol.  In addition, applications arising from within a designated site or within three kilometres upstream of such a site are referred to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.Finally, all forestry operations, including afforestation must be carried out in accordance with the published Code of Best Forest Practice and associated Guidelines including Forestry and Water Quality.  Specific guidelines for the further protection of the freshwater pearl mussel: "Forestry and Freshwater Pearl Mussel Requirements — Site Assessment and Mitigation Measures" have now been drafted by the Freshwater Pearl Mussel Steering Group and are available on the Department's website www.agriculture.gov.ie.  These requirements outline the methodologies relating to the protection of the fresh water pearl mussel during specific forestry operations including afforestation, clear felling and restocking.

Under the terms of the Act a person may, in accordance with the application regulations, apply to the Minister for an aquaculture licence or trial licence.   There are no provisions in the Act for the designation of areas for aquaculture purposes.Since 1 July 2003 the Department has issued 111 aquaculture licences for shellfish production.  This figure does not included licences renewed or assigned.  As required under the 1997 Act the Department maintains a public register of all licences.    I am arranging for a list of the licences in question to be forwarded directly to the Deputy.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	972	I propose to take Questions Nos. 476 and 477 together.The issue of high levels of discards in commercial sea fisheries is a global problem and is on the agenda of all major international organisations who deal with the development of sustainable sea fisheries and protection of marine ecosystems.Discarding is usually a feature of mixed fisheries where one species may be the target of fishing activity, but other species may be caught accidentally in the fishing gear.   For quota species, a by-catch quota is usually allowed for such contingencies, as long as sufficient quota remains to cover it.  However, an unwanted catch that is a quota species but for which the catcher has no quota, or has already exhausted the quota, cannot legally be landed and will usually be discarded.  Discarding can also occur for economic reasons, i.e., when smaller, less valuable fish are dumped in favour of larger, more marketable ones (a practice known as high-grading).  As such discarding is not usually recorded in logbooks, the true state of a stock cannot accurately be determined, and so it undermines prudent and sustainable management of stocks.  Discarding of non-quota species may not undermine the management of stocks per se, but it cannot be justified on conservation grounds.The discarding issue is already being addressed at a European level through measures regulating fishing gear, such as adjusting net mesh sizes or requiring acoustic devices to be attached to fishing gear.   The document COM [207] 136 FINAL of 28 March 2007 referred to was a Commission Communication on the issue of discards in fisheries.  Following further work, a Communication on "A policy to reduce unwanted by-catches and eliminate discards in European fisheries" was presented to the Council of Ministers in June 2007.  The Council adopted a range of conclusions on the Commission proposal and these will determine the agenda at European level on this issue going forward.  A new discard policy which aims to stop the practice of discarding is under preparation and a consultation process has been in progress with all the stakeholders.   An effective resolution of the discards issue will likely require a combination of new policy and technical measures.In parallel with actions at EU level, a number of projects are in progress in Ireland that are aimed at addressing the issue.  These include:The Irish Sea Data Enhancement Project, conceived in 2006 as a joint initiative by the Irish and UK fishermen's organisations and the North Western Waters Regional Advisory Council.  The project's aim is to provide improved data on catch and discards by the Irish and UK demersal trawl fleets operating in the Irish Sea, for stock assessment purposes and to investigate alternative management approaches for Irish Sea fisheries.  The project is supported by the fisheries administrations and national research laboratories of Ireland, the UK and Northern Ireland.Ireland is continuing trials with selective gears in its nephrops and whitefish fisheries and with grids in the monkfish fishery.  This work will include trials in the Celtic Sea and at Rockall in 2008, which will be aimed specifically at reducing the discarding of cod, haddock and whiting.A pilot project in the Aran nephrops fishery is due to begin later in 2008.  This project will examine the possible development of an adaptive management plan for this fishery using a target-based approach to discard reduction.Irish scientists have been working with netmaking firms and fishermen in the northwest of the country to develop species- and size-selective gears for the mackerel and horse mackerel fisheries.Ireland is planning to participate in a project coordinated by Marifish ERA-net that aims at the harmonisation and compilation of discard data.  The objective is to develop an integrated view of discard patters in the Irish and Celtic Seas.National laboratories in Ireland, the UK and Sweden have recently completed an EC funded project which critically appraised a number of pilot projects aimed at reducing discards and identified the principal obstacles that hindered both commercial participation in pilot self-sampling schemes to enhance national discard collection programmes and the adoption of more selective fishing gear despite significant finances being made available through FIFG.  A final draft of this report is being prepared by the project partners.During my recent meetings with the Federation of Irish Fishermen, strong representations were made to me in relation to the need to address the issue.  At my meeting on the 18th of June with Commissioner Borg I raised it as a priority both for me, and for the Federation of Irish Fishermen.  While the Commissioner advised that finding effective solutions is challenging, he restated his commitment to continue to prioritise the current work programme agreed by the Council in June 2007.  I will continue to press for progress on this issue at national, EU and international levels and I am confident that, with the co-operation, collaboration and commitment of all the stakeholders, significant improvements can be achieved in this most sensitive area for the long term sustainability of our industry.

I have, however, been advised by Coillte that they take the safety of forest workers very seriously and that they implement effective safety controls in all its operations.  I understand from the company that they treat some young seedlings with Cypermethrin (Forester), an insecticide for the protection of these seedlings from the Large Pine Weevil.  A plant polysaccharide (Flexcoat) with adhesive properties is added to the insecticide to bind it effectively to the seedlings.  Cypermethrin has been fully approved and authorised for use in forestry in Ireland by the Pesticide Control Service (PCS) of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Authorisation PSC No. 02533).  Flexcoat is not a pesticide and does not require authorisation.  Coillte exports treated seedlings to the United Kingdom and the company advises that it has received clearance for this from the Pesticide Safety Directorate (PSD) in the UK.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	974	I propose to take Questions Nos. 479 and 485 together.For some time, farmers have chosen to maximise their incomes through a combination of farming and off-farm employment. This Government is committed to maintaining a core of competitive, full-time farmers, while at the same time providing an economic environment which enables smaller scale producers to avail of both on and off-farm opportunities to secure their future. Full-time farmers are looking to the new flexibility offered to them under decoupling to develop and intensify their commercial farm enterprises while many small-scale producers are finding that combining farming with off-farm employment is an effective way to ensure the viability of their holdings.The State's role is to facilitate a climate that assists competitive drive and innovation, for example, through the implementation of the Agri Vision 2015 Action Plan and the commitments in the Programme for Government.  At EU level a range of market support measures are operated, while the exchequer and the EU together also provide almost €2 billion per year in direct payments to support farm income.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	975	I propose to take Questions Nos. 480 and 533 to 535, inclusive, together.The introduction of the Single Payment Scheme in 2005 has dramatically reduced the paperwork for farmers in applying for the direct payment schemes.  In addition, my Department  introduced an on-line application system for the Single Payment Scheme and the Disadvantaged Areas' Compensatory Allowance Scheme for 2007 to facilitate the application process. Over 7,500 farmers availed of this facility in 2007.   This year some 20,000 farmers have applied on-line.Following a Commission review in 2007 on the operation of cross compliance, some legislative changes have been made which set rules for the non imposition of sanctions for minor breaches of the cross compliance requirements in addition to the possibility for a de minimus provision where sanctions up to €100 may be waived. The review also introduced a one-day availability rule for land and clarified the cross compliance responsibilities in the context of the one day availability requirements.  The revised arrangements take effect from 1 January 2008.My Department has also carried out a full review of the inspection arrangements and checklists for the Single Payment Scheme with a view to simplification of the arrangements (including paperwork) where possible while, at the same time, ensuring compliance with the regulatory requirements.My Department is actively engaged with the Commission and like-minded Member States to bring about a rationalisation of the cross-compliance arrangements. This issue will be further pursued in the context of the CAP Health Check.  Specifically, Ireland is committed to pursuing indent 14 of the June 2007 Council conclusions which requested the Commission "to study ways of improving the coherence and practicability of the control provisions in the different sectors covered by the Statutory Management Requirements (SMRs) for example as regards control rates and advance notice for on-the-spot checks".  My Department is also pursuing general simplification of the Single Payment Scheme arrangements in the context of the CAP Health Check.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	976	My Department, working in conjunction with the promotion and development agencies, and with industry through the structures established under the Agri-Vision 2015 Plan of Action, and most recently the Food Industry Research Sub-Group, has promoted marketing and research strategies to develop new products and new food markets.At market level, there are emerging opportunities in Continental EU and Asian markets for food and drink exports as well as opportunities to build on established markets. In relation to beef progress continues in developing EU markets and improved access to third country markets has been secured, most recently in Saudi Arabia.Funding to the food industry for in-company research and technology transfer is administered by Enterprise Ireland. My Department works closely with Enterprise Ireland to ensure that all aspects of food research, from applied to commercial, are facilitated and has supported initiatives by Enterprise Ireland to encourage greater involvement by the food industry in food research and development. Assistance is particularly focused on developing company's management, innovation and marketing capabilities.  A number of company clusters in innovation and world class manufacturing are currently in existence, whose objective is to keep abreast with developments in these areas, facilitated by Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia, BIM and Údaras na Gaeltachta.  Research to provide a base of information and expertise in generic technologies is funded under my Department's FIRM programme to support innovation and product development in the food industry.

It is chaired by my Department and comprised of representatives from the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, An Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland and Bord Iascaigh Mhara. This group held its first meeting in June and focussed on developing a co-ordinated effort to identify potential market opportunities for the full range of Irish food and beverages, prioritisation of market initiatives and broader access issues.  The Group's initial priority is the identification of new market potential and development of a programme of network support with customised strategies, including, where appropriate, trade missions. A report on progress on meat market access was also considered by the group.  The 20% increase in funding to Bord Bia in 2006 has been carried through to 2008 and its current grant in aid is €27.5 million.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	978	It should be emphasised that there are in place a number of strategic plans operated by my Department that have the overall objective of developing and enhancing the capacity, sustainability and competitiveness of the agriculture, food, and forestry sectors. These include the Agri Vision 2015 Action Plan, the relevant commitments in Towards 2016, the National Development Plan and the Rural Development Programme for the 2007-2013 period, and the agriculture research and development programmes in the National Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation.An example of the implementation of this commitment is through the Agri Vision 2015 Action Plan which details 167 actions to be undertaken to help ensure the competitiveness and sustainability of the agri-food industry.  To date, 93% of these actions had been implemented.  To achieve these aims, extensive funding has been provided, both national and EU, through direct payments, the National Development Plan (NDP) and the Rural Development Programme (RDP).
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	979	The Farm Improvement Scheme, introduced in July 2007 following receipt of EU approval for the 2007-2013 RDP, provided grant-aid for the areas mentioned.   The Scheme was, however, closed for new applications on 31 October 2007 as applications had reached the level of funding provided for the Scheme in the 2006 Partnership Agreement, Towards 2016.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	980	The Rural Development Programme for Ireland 2007-2013 was approved by the EU Commission in July 2007. It has a budget of €5.778 billion over the lifetime of the Programme of which €2.339 billion will be funded by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EARDF) and €3.438 billion by the national exchequer.The main measures and allocation of funds under Axes 1 and 2 are REPS/Natura (€2.98bn), Disadvantaged Areas (€1.8bn), Early Retirement (€418m), Installation Aid (€63m) and Farm Investment (€85m). All of these Schemes have now been commenced.There is a budget allocation of €425m for the broader rural development measures under Axis 3 and these will be implemented using LEADER, which emphasises a "bottom up" approach comprising area based local development strategies implemented by local action groups.Expenditure under the Programme at the end of June 2008 was close to €798.2m, being 13.8% of the total Programme budget. This expenditure has funded the investment and environmental measures under axis 1 and 2 and expenditure under the Leader measures will commence when the local action groups are fully established later this year.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	981	The State's role is to facilitate a climate that assists competitive drive and innovation, for example, through the implementation of the Agri Vision 2015 Action Plan.  At EU level a range of market support measures are operated, while the exchequer and the EU together also provide almost €2 billion per year in direct payments to support farm income.A number of schemes and reliefs have been introduced in recent years to bring about improvements in farm structures and the age profile of the sector. To maintain this structure, there are a number of generous schemes and reliefs aimed at encouraging the early transfer of farms to young farmers and reducing the tax burden of such transfers on farmers. In particular, the Rural Development Plan 2007-2013 includes a range of enhanced measures to improve the structure and competitiveness of Irish farming. It contains a generous Installation Grant Aid for young farmers of €15,000 (an increase of 55% of the previous grant) and the early retirement pension is also increased to a maximum €15,000 per annum for farmers who dispose of their land by gift, sale or lease.Other incentives for early farm transfer include:100% stamp duty relief for on transfers of agricultural land and buildings to young trained farmers;100% stock relief for up to four years for young trained farmers;90% agricultural relief from capital acquisitions tax;higher grant rates for young trained farmers under the farm improvement scheme;Capital Gains Tax — Retirement relief on farm disposals up to the value of €750,000 and marginal relief on disposals above this threshold.Also the Finance Act 2007 included a number of provisions to facilitate greater levels of land mobility and farm consolidation. The measures include a third rental income exemption threshold —  €20,000 for leases of 10 years or over; stamp duty relief for farm consolidation where only one farmer is consolidating his holding; and a provision whereby farmers who are leasing out land can still, subject to certain conditions, qualify for Capital Gains Tax retirement relief.  All these measures help to improve the structure and scale of Irish farming through early farm transfer or by encouraging greater levels of leasing, land swaps or farm consolidation.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	982	A new REPS 4 scheme was launched in late 2007 as part of the Rural Development Programme 2007-13.  For the first time REPS is open to more intensive farmers and this, together with more attractive payment rates agreed in Partnership, has potential to bring numbers to the targeted level.    By the deadline of 15 May, some 11,500 farmers had applied to join REPS 4.  There are some 54,000 farmers still participating in the previous schemes, REPS 2 and REPS 3.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	983	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 490 and 531 together.My Department recently launched its Organic Farming Action Plan 2008-2012, which is central to assisting in reaching the Programme for Government target. The Plan has four main objectives:  to increase production in line with market trends, increase the knowledge base, develop the organic market at home and abroad, and encourage the development of public procurement opportunities for organic products. There are 64 actions identified in the Plan. The National Steering Group for the Organic Sector will have a crucial role in guiding and overseeing progress on the Action Plan.Teagasc published its own Organic Business Plan in March 2008, and many of the actions outlined in that document are now incorporated in my Department's Organic Action Plan.   It has increased its organic staff compliment, while its combined land area with organic status is 200 Hectares, which represents around 10% of its total land bank. Teagasc also works closely with my Department in ensuring that the 21 designated organic demonstration farms are effectively used to disseminate knowledge about organic farming.The recently launched National Organic Training Skillnet Programme is another excellent initiative that is delivering low cost training to interested producers and processors.My Department already provides significant incentives to encourage conventional producers to convert to organic farming and also to support existing organic producers and operators.  Under the new Rural Development Programme, which runs from 2007 to 2013, we have now made it possible, for the first time, for a farmer to join the new Organic Farming Scheme without having to be in the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS).  This initiative is designed to encourage small-scale horticultural producers to convert to organic production, and also conventional tillage producers to convert part or even all of their holdings.  The majority of organic producers will of course continue to participate in REPS as well, and we will be encouraging them to do so. The current anomaly whereby Reps 2 and 3 producers, not already participating in the Organic Supplementary Measure, have to transform to REPS 4 before joining the Organic Farming Scheme has had a negative impact on encouraging farmers to convert. My officials are currently liaising with the European Commission to try and resolve this issue.The capital on and off-farm grant schemes, which were re-launched in 2007, provide farmers and processors with much needed assistance in developing their businesses.  Over the seven-year period, the on-farm scheme provides grant aid of 40% of the cost up to a maximum grant of €60,000.  For off-farm investments, the maximum grant is €500,000.  So far this year, there has been a large increase in grant aid applications under these Schemes and this is indeed very encouraging.

The Bill will amend and consolidate previous legislation to reflect the changed disease status of our nation's animals and update existing legislation, to ensure that the welfare of all animals (including non-farm animals) is properly protected and that penalties for offenders are increased significantly. The Bill also contains provision for repealing and revoking a number of pieces of existing legislation as some of the principal Acts in this area date to 1911.There has been a very good response to the public consultation process initiated in May last on the draft Bill. Closing date for receipt of submissions is Friday 11th July 2008. Following completion of the consultation process it is intended that my officials will meet with a number of organisations to provide them with an opportunity to elaborate further on their respective submissions and proposals. Thereafter, arrangements will proceed with drafting of the Bill taking account of the submissions received.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	985	My Department's responsibilities extend to animal and plant health and the diseases of these sectors.  In this regard it works closely with the Department of Health & Children and the Health Services Executive in relation to the public health aspects of and the potential implications for human health posed by these diseases, as for example in relation to avian 'flu which crosses both disciplines.I am acutely conscious of the threats of various animal disease outbreaks and my Department continually reassesses such threats and the dangers posed to Ireland. On the basis of such risk assessments, I and my officials on an ongoing basis review the adequacy of our control measures aimed at mitigating the risk of the introduction of such diseases to this country.  As part of this review process, my Department has offered and continues to offer biosecurity advice to farmers in relation to diseases such as foot-and-mouth, avian 'flu and bluetongue. This advise is updated as appropriate and made available in leaflet form, through the national newspapers or on my Department's website.My Department within its own internal competency and facilities operates a wide range of surveillance, monitoring, controls, systems and processes which regulate, monitor and manage the risks posed by diseases and pests. These competencies and skills encompass professional, veterinary, scientific, bacteriological, microbiological, virological, epidemiological, administrative and legal expertise, all of which contribute, as appropriate, to the process.  My Department's state of the art veterinary and agriculture laboratories at Backweston also continue to develop as centres of excellence increasing their range of diagnostic services to underpin any challenges posed to animal, plant health or food safety.  All of these professions and disciplines are constantly upskilling and re-training.In addition to its range of internal resources, my Department can rely on extensive external expertise, and assistance from State agencies, as well as organisations such as Birdwatch Ireland and academic expertise, such as for example, that provided by the Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis in UCD (CVERA) and the Department of Zoology at NUI, Galway in dealing with diseases or threats of diseases.I am satisfied that my Department has available to it all the relevant expertise to ensure that the necessary biosecurity controls and precautions are exercised and taken both at points of import and at the farm gate. Nonetheless, I am anxious to bring a greater focus to and place a greater emphasis on the need for constant vigilance in the area of biosecurity and, for that reason, I have decided to establish, as a division within my Department, biosecurity Ireland with a remit to ensure the exclusion, eradication or effective management of risks posed by diseases and pests to the economy, the environment as well as to human and animal health.

State aid approval has been secured for Bord Bia's advertising campaign for quality assured product and for the use of the quality assured logo denoting origin.FIRM (The Food Institutional Research Measure) has funded a number of research projects in the area of safety, quality and traceability.  The results of these projects will be disseminated via RELAY to ensure that high quality and safe beef products are available for the consumer.3 traceability projects which can be used to assist marketing are being funded by FIRM:Development of a protocol for Bio Track — a biometric based animal tracking and tracing system;Enhanced traceability of poultry meat using biometrics and e-tracking technology (Avian Bio Track);Biomarkers to Authenticate Irish Grass-fed Beef.These traceability projects proceeding satisfactorily and are due to be completed in 2009.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	988	I proposed to take Questions Nos. 495 and 518 together.My Department, in conjunction with Department of Health and Children, drafted national regulations that would require the country of origin to be indicated on pigmeat, poultry and sheepmeat.The draft regulations were notified to the European Commission in December 2007 as required by EU legislation.  The Commission adopted a negative opinion in relation to the proposal on the grounds that the legislation in question was not in compliance with EU food labelling regulations.  The Commission view, which is supported by most Member States, is that only labelling rules that are harmonised at Community level are permissible except in the most exceptional circumstances and that this best facilitates the functioning of the internal market.When issuing their negative opinion the Commission afforded us the opportunity to provide further information which will be regarded as a new notification.  This information has recently been transmitted to the Commission who now have 3 months to consider it before issuing another opinion.  The Commission also offered to meet officials to discuss the matter and it is planned that such a meeting will take place next week.

However, my Department has encouraged the food industry to provide more nutritional information.Regulations on nutrition and health claims in force in July 2007 (Reg 1924/06) cover claims on foods marketed in the EU, food supplements, foods for particular nutritional uses. Under Article 13 of the Regulation, Member States were responsible for providing the European Commission with national lists of health claims based on scientific evidence of effectiveness, together with conditions of use applying to them by 31 January 2008.The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) will assess submissions from all Member States and the European Commission will adopt a final list of permitted health claims by 31st January 2010.  The claims on the Community list will be the only health claims allowed on food products from 31st January 2010 onwards.There are 316 claims on the Irish national list of health claims.  All claims submitted via the FSAI submission process will be forwarded to the Commission.  However, it is important to note that the claims on the National list have not been endorsed or approved in any way by the FSAI.  Until adoption of the Community list, businesses must ensure that they comply with current legislation.On 11 January 2008, the European Council agreed an amendment to the EU Regulation 1924/2006 on Nutrition and Health Claims made on Foods to introduce a transition period for health claims referring to children's development and health.  The key requirement is that food business operators with claims related to children's development and health which have been on the market before 19 January 2007 must submit an immediate application pursuant to the Regulation to the FSAI.The main aim is to allow consumers to make informed food choices, by ensuring that they receive accurate information and are not misled.  Claims for health benefits will have to be adequately substantiated by scientific evidence.  Food business operators are responsible for ensuring that claims they make on food labelling, presentation and advertising are authorised.The Department has reservations about a simplistic traffic lights system, as it would allocate a red traffic light to dairy products such as cheese, of high nutritional value and where there is insufficient intake by children and teenagers, but a green traffic light to diet soft drinks.The larger food companies have worked in the UK and Ireland on voluntary declaration of Guideline Daily Amounts (GDAs) for 5 categories — calories, sugar, fats, saturated fats and salt.  A recent IBEC survey based on an average shopping basket of goods (CSO) showed increased use of GDAs.

The support package, amounting to €50 million, should trigger overall investment of some €120 million.  The objective of the scheme is to make financial assistance available towards the cost of the construction and acquisition of buildings, new machinery and equipment and, consequently, assist the industry in improving efficiency and competitiveness and in so doing, not only strengthen primary processing but also underpin agricultural incomes.Enterprise Ireland, which is responsible for the management of the scheme, is currently completing its project evaluation process.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	994	The Animal Welfare, Recording and Breeding Scheme for Suckler Herds came into operation in January 2008 and runs for 5 years with a budget of €250m.  It aims to encourage and underpin the adoption of high standards of animal welfare in suckler herds and to improve the quality of breeding cattle in the beef sector.  Almost 53,000 suckler farmers have joined the scheme and over 80% of all the suckler cows in the country are now covered by the scheme.The scheme will also be used as a marketing tool when selling Irish Beef into new higher value markets where the consumer is seeking assurances about the standards of animal welfare and husbandry on Irish suckler farms.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	998	The Sheep Strategy Implementation Group reported in early April 2007.  The Group has addressed all the report recommendations and the Minister announced this Department's support with financial assistance in relevant areas.  Progress is being made in implementing the recommendations.My Department and the state agencies under my aegis are dealing with the areas relevant to them.  Under REPS 4, a new mixed grazing measure specially targeted at sheep farmers has been introduced and progress under this measure is being kept under review.Plans for the upgrading of a Sheep Breeding Programme are well advanced, with the recent establishment of the Interim Sheep Board under the auspices of ICBF, which should enable a new programme to be put in place for the 2008/2009 breeding year.Farmer confidence in the pricing system operated by plants will be improved if mechanical grading can be introduced. My Department has organised trials on this aspect and the results are being assessed.  It is also important that producers and processors agree on the structures necessary to reward quality and to bring transparency to the pricing system.Teagasc are making a very positive contribution as well and have developed a comprehensive plan to restructure their sheep support services, including a programme for Technology Evaluation and Transfer farms, which includes hill and lowland areas.  This approach will provide an opportunity for developing a dialogue with sheep farmers about the application of the latest management practices to their enterprises and identify research and development needs.Bord Bia is also playing a prominent part.  The Lamb Quality Assurance Scheme was established in 2007.  Almost 6,000 farms have been registered to date and over 4,200 farm audits have been carried out.In addition to the measures being taken at producer and processor level, promotional efforts are being undertaken by An Bord Bia which will continue to organize strategic marketing campaigns marketing in selected European markets.  The downward trend in lamb consumption in certain markets presents a real challenge.  To address this, Bord Bia is collaborating with its French and British counterparts on a 3 year generic lamb promotion on the very important French market to promote lamb to younger consumers.The overall goal is to facilitate the development of a more profitable sheep-meat sector in Ireland covering the lamb production, lamb processing and marketing sectors of the industry.  I recognise the challenges ahead but am confident about the future of the sector provided all stakeholders play their part in undertaking the various initiatives set out in the Strategy Group's report.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1001	Bord Bia Pigmeat Quality Assurance Scheme — Auditing to the new standard commenced in May 2007 and the scheme is now fully accredited under EN45011 at producer and processor level, the latter being achieved in early October 2007.To date there has been 248 applicant producers, of which 116 producers have been certified.  Farm inspections and processor audits are ongoing with certifications taking place once the standard has been achieved.  There are currently 40 processor members of the scheme.There are new and significantly increased requirements regarding reconciliation.  This requires the processor to demonstrate that there is complete traceability of all approved product marketed under the scheme to approved farms.  Auditing against this new requirement came into effect from 1 February 2008.Bord Bia Poultry Products Quality Assurance Scheme — The Poultry Products Quality Assurance Scheme incorporates the requirements that were previously included in chicken, turkey and duck standards.  The Processor standard of the new Scheme has been accredited by the Irish National Accreditation Board (INAB).  The accreditation of the Producer Scheme is expected in September.  Training of all participants (plant personnel, processor's farm inspectors, producers and Bord Bia auditors) is currently taking place.The Irish Grain Assurance Scheme (IGAS) assures customers that grain is produced, handled, stored and transported according to a defined Code of Practice.  Almost 6,000 cereals producers are now participating in the scheme, which accounts for approximately 90% of grain traded in Ireland.  My Department has supported the objectives of the Scheme in a tangible way under the National Development Plan by the provision of grant aid towards the improvement of grain handling and storage facilities both on-farm and at commercial intake points.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1003	The EU prohibit supports which are targeted at import substitution.  The fruit and vegetable sector contributed approx €213.7m to farm output in 2007, an increase of 14% over 2000.  This sector has considerable potential for development but is experiencing strong competitive pressures, particularly from the highly concentrated retail chain and from imports.  In March 2007 Bord Bia published the Strategic Review of the Horticulture Industry which identified the issues which needed to be addressed if the sector is to maximise its potential.  These recommendations were taken into account in their 2008 programme.  Under the new NDP 2007-2013 funding of the order of €49m is being provided for the horticulture sector to continue the modernisation process initiated in the NDP 2000-2006 for on-farm investments and marketing and processing facilities.The EU Producer Organisation (PO) Scheme provides an important mechanism for growers to achieve greater bargaining power in the marketplace by becoming part of a larger supply base.  The agreement reached in the Agriculture Council in June 2007 for a new fruit and vegetable regime should attract more growers to join POs (currently only 21 fruit and vegetable growers and 79 mushroom growers are members) as it provides for more flexible terms.  Since 2000, twenty POs have benefited from EU funding amounting to €26m.

Under the new FEPS an additional premium of up to €200 per hectare for five years is available to farmers in REPS who join FEPS.  The target of 30% broadleaf planting has been achieved in 2005 and 2006 and this broadleaf planting target remains in place for the 2007-2013 programming period.Under FEPS, there is a strong emphasis on diversity and nature value with a specific requirement to plant a minimum of 15% broadleaves/native trees.  A new FEPS Enhancement Scheme is planned to encourage restructuring of older conifer plantations through the introduction of open space and the improvement of species composition.  The Native Woodland Scheme provides support for the conservation and establishment of native woodlands.  In 2006, support for over 1100 hectares of native woodland was provided.  This Scheme was relaunched in December 2007.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1005	My Department, in conjunction with Teagasc and COFORD, have been actively encouraging the development of new markets for forest thinnings in the heat energy sector through a range of support measures aimed at creating an effective supply chain from producer to end user.In 2007 my Department introduced a new capital grant scheme to support emerging enterprises in the wood chip supply sector.  To date, the Wood Biomass Harvesting Machinery Grant Scheme has provided grants totalling €550,000 to support the purchase of 4 self contained/self propelled whole tree chippers and 3 mobile whole tree chippers, stimulating an associated investment of some €1.6m within the sector.  The additional wood energy harvesting capacity created by this support measure will have a significant impact in assisting developing enterprises in the wood chip supply sector.  The scheme is now closed.Since 2006 COFORD (National Council for Forest Research and Development), which is wholly-funded by my Department, has been managing the ForestEnergy Programme in association with Teagasc and Waterford Institute of Technology.  To date, the programme has operated a series of nationwide forest thinning and chipping demonstrations, trials and workshops aimed at developing the wood biomass supply chain.  The programme, which is specifically aimed at forest owners, managers and contractors wishing to become involved in the wood biomass supply chain, will continue in 2008 and details of further events will be announced shortly.COFORD, Teagasc and SEI organised the recent Bioenergy 08 event, held as part ofFarmFest 08, to raise awareness across all sectors on the many uses and benefits of growing, harvesting and using wood fuels and energy crop products to generate heat, electricity and fuel for our homes and businesses.Another initiative currently underway is a number of pilot "Forestry Producer Group" type projects, funded by my Department, such as the "Clare Wood Energy Project" in Clare, the "Forest Link" project in Donegal and the "Cork and Galway Producer Group Project".  These projects are aimed at providing a number of benefits including the better marketing of wood produced by farmer/foresters and also giving a kick-start to the creation, in a coordinated way, of a wood fuel supply network.  These measures are aimed at stimulating the supply of wood energy, thereby complementing schemes such as the Renewable Heat Deployment Programme (ReHeat) and Greener Homes Scheme operated by Sustainable Energy Ireland, which aim to stimulate the demand for wood energy.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1006	My Department continually promotes forestry through attractive grant incentives i.e. — 100% establishment grants and 20-year annual premiums.  In 2007, my department launched the Wood Biomass Harvesting Machinery Grant Scheme and has supported the purchase of a number of large and medium-scale chipping units designed to bring critical capacity to this sector (this scheme is now closed).My Department also participates in the Regional Biomass Advisory Group of the Wood Energy Development Initiative for the western region.  This initiative is currently preparing a Regional Wood Energy Strategy and Action Plan for the western region.  All forests operate as sinks to combat climate change.  The projected sequestration rate of Ireland's eligible forests (i.e. those planted since 1990) for the 1st year of the Kyoto commitment period (2008) is 1.7 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent.

The threshold of 8 hectares has been reduced to 5 hectares for small farms (less than 30ha), attracting a €150/ha rate for plantations between 5 and 8 ha, and €200/ha thereafter.  At the other end of the scale, a standard rate of €200/ha will apply for all plantations irrespective of the size of the farm on which they are established.  (Previously a sliding scale applied, whereby the FEPS payment reduced progressively in line with the relevant REPS payment).

A number of these measures relate to energy crops.  DAFF is also participating in a new Bioenergy Working Group, which has been established by DCENR to deliver the bioenergy targets in the Energy White Paper and the Bioenergy Action Plan.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1010	I propose to take Questions Nos. 528 and 530 together.The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (DAFF) supports research into projects in biofuel and biomass through the Research Stimulus Fund Programme.  The Programme facilitates research that supports sustainable and competitive agricultural production practices and policies and contributes to a scientific research capability in the agriculture sector.  Under Stimulus Calls in 2005, 2006 and 2007, 13 projects relating directly to biofuels and energy crops were awarded total grant assistance of almost € 6.4 million.In February 2007, DAFF launched a new Bioenergy Scheme to provide 50% establishment grants to farmers to grow miscanthus and willow, subject to a maximum payment of €1,450 per hectare.  In addition to establishment grants, farmers who grow willow and miscanthus qualify for the following aid.The EU Energy Crops Scheme premium (up to €45 per hectare) and the national top- up payment of  €80 per hectare.  An adjusted REPS 3 payment of €155 per hectare increasing to €189 per hectare in REPS 4, subject to a maximum of 10 hectares per applicant or 25% of the holding, whichever is greater.Disadvantaged Area Scheme (DAS) payments may be claimed on lands used for the cultivation of energy crops subject to a maximum of 10 hectares per holding.  Farmers can qualify for a DAS payment, by way of an adjusted rate of grant consisting of the appropriate DAS amount less the EU Premium available under the EU Energy Crops Scheme.  The scheme was well received.  The response from growers has been positive with 800 hectares planted in 2007.  A further 1,200 hectares were granted pre-planting approval in 2008.

The control authorities for water, nitrates and integrated pollution are the Environmental Protection Agency and/or local authorities.Under the Cross-compliance arrangements for the Single Payment System, this Department carries out checks on farms in receipt of the SPS for compliance with the requirements of the nitrates regulations. My Department has also taken steps to assist farmers meet their obligation under the Regulations, such as the revised Farm Waste Management Scheme in 2006, publication of an Explanatory Handbook, information meetings for farmers and providing statements of nitrogen and phosphorus produced on farms.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1021	I propose to take Questions Nos. 548 to 551, inclusive, together.I understand from Teagasc that training programmes are delivered at eight colleges and local centres in agriculture, horticulture, horse breeding and forestry.  In 2007 a total of 612 students enrolled in further level training programmes bringing the total overall number participating in these programmes to 3,353.  In addition Teagasc collaborates with Institutes of Technology to deliver 11 higher level training programmes to degree level and beyond. In 2007 a total of 243 students enrolled in higher level training programmes bringing the total number participating in these programmes to 770.During 2007 a total of 450 students completed both the 100 hour and the 80 hour courses online through the Teagasc eCollege.  This is additional to the students who completed these programmes at Teagasc colleges/local centres.  Three new Advanced Certificate in Agriculture programmes for part-time farmers commenced in 2007.  A range of other programmes in areas such as Food Safety, Horticulture and Information Technology are delivered online and Teagasc intend to expand on this in 2008.All mainstream training programmes include modules on course and career planning, start your own business and farm planning. In addition the Options Analysis Programme,a central component of Teagasc's Advisory Service, takes farm families through a formal planning process to identify new development pathways and/or referral to  diversification and business start-up programmes. Additional specialists have been appointed in the areas of artisan food and rural tourism, equines, renewable energy and organic production.  Two food technologists have also been appointed. This will enable a greater number of farmers to avail of specialist training and support services in all of these areas. During 2007, national conferences were held in artisan food and rural tourism, goat production, deer production, equines and organics.  An "All Island" Innovation for rural business awards programme was also established in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development Northern Ireland (DARDNI) to incentivise and support farmers to develop business ideas in areas including, environment, energy, manufacturing, technology, tourism, value added food and services.A review of college infrastructure was undertaken by an outside consultancy body and was finalised early in 2008 and agreed by the Teagasc Authority.  Four colleges, (three Teagasc colleges and one private college) were prioritised in terms of future capital expenditure.  The remaining four colleges of which three are private colleges and one Teagasc college will be required to deliver the overall Teagasc Education Programme and together with Teagasc senior management are agreeing a work programme to ensure their future viability.

This funding is allocated via my Department's Core Grant to Teagasc and via the DAFF public good competitive programmes in Food, Agriculture and Forestry.   In addition, the Interdepartmental Committee on Research and Technological Development provided a sum of €40m in 2007-08 for research collaboration in areas of shared interest.  DAFF secured €13.67m from this fund for agri-food research.  DAFF are currently in discussions with the IDC regarding the work programme for 2009.In the area of food research, significant collaborative research initiatives in the areas of Marine Functional Foods (with the Marine Institute) and Food And Health (with the Health Research Board) were launched in 2007.   The Marine Functional Foods initiative with the Marine Institute was awarded to a Teagasc led research consortium in November 2007.Awards amounting to €20m under the collaborative research initiatives with the Health Research Board in the theme areas of "Food safety Monitoring and Surveillance", "Nutrigenomics", "Food Consumption databases" and "Nutritional Health in the Elderly" were made in December 2007.A call for proposals under the Department's capital investment scheme for marketing and processing of agricultural products issued in December 2007.  The sectors involved are Horticulture, Livestock Marts, Small Slaughterhouses and Meat Establishments. Evaluation of applications is currently underway.The Capital Investment Scheme for the beef and sheep meat processing sectors was launched in April 2007.  The package involved grant aid of €50 million.  Enterprise Ireland, which is responsible for the management of the Scheme is currently completing its project evaluation process.  In the Dairy Processing sector, capital investment grant aid of €114 million was also put in place last year. The projects are under way and a number have already been completed.

The project involves the construction of a pier, breakwater and access road together with dredging of the entrance channel.My Department approved funding of €500,000 in 2007 and €750,000 in 2008 under the Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme. Due to considerable delays encountered by Kerry County Council in securing the land required for the project no funding was drawn down in 2007. It is anticipated the project will commence after completion of the Compulsory Purchase Order process by Kerry County Council.Greencastle harbour is under the control of Donegal County Council and has a very significant congestion/safety problem.  The recommended development option for Greencastle consists of four phases, which will provide a rock breakwater, fuel berth and mussel berth, new deep-water berths and additional berths to the inner harbour, estimated to cost in excess of €35 million (phase 1, the breakwater, is estimated to cost €16.8 million). The development has passed the planning stage and the Cost Benefit Analysis report was completed in 2006.  The development at Greencastle commenced in 2007 and funding of €1.158 million was provided under the Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme 2007.  My Department has also approved funding of €3.6 million under the 2008 Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme.

BIM is delivering training at its training centres to upgrade skill levels of fishermen.The National Strategic Plan sets out a number of avenues to support economic and social development of maritime communities including:Diversification into complementary activities such as tourism;Increased on shore complementary fisheries related activity;Greater participation by women in business activities in these communities;Local Leader type groups established in coastal communities to promote and deliver local plans.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1031	BIM has an ongoing programme of grant aiding new onboard technologies in place and BIM are also currently carrying out trials on an eco friendly pelagic fishing net.  The aim of such initiatives is to incentivise industry in adopting environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient fishing gear that is species and size selective, minimising the impact of fishing gear on sensitive habitats and protecting non-target species.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1032	The Seafood Development Operational Programme includes a measure aimed at providing grant aid to small and medium sized aquaculture enterprises in the private sector. The Operational Programme has been finalised and discussions are underway with the Commission with a view to receiving Commission approval of the Operational Programme.  DG Environment has opposed the inclusion of grant aid for aquaculture development in the co-funded Operational Programme and it is anticipated in this context that aquaculture development will instead be included in the nationally funded measures.In certain high-risk areas, BIM will undertake pilot or prototype projects in conjunction with industry players to assess the feasibility of innovative technology.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1033	The Marine Institute is currently implementing the Government's wide ranging marine research "Sea Change" Strategy.  This involves a very wide range of marine research activities across the total marine sphere, including research on renewable ocean energy.  For example, DAFF, in co-operation with the Marine Institute recently launched a joint public good research Initiative in marine functional foods.  The Programme of research will build a world-class consortium of internationally ranked marine and food scientists to deliver a programme of research in marine functional foods drawing on expertise from both the seafood and food industry in Ireland.  The total initial fund available is €5.2m over a period of 5-7 years.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1034	The MI is leading and co-ordinating the initiation of a complex programme in Biodiscovery, which seeks to utilise Ireland's marine biodiversity for the discovery of novel compounds for use in drug discovery, biomaterials and biomedical engineering.  This involves the coordination of existing, and the initiation of new, research across a wide range of third-level, agency and industry groups.  Initial funding of €7million for the establishment of research personnel has been committed under the Beaufort scheme and PhD research fellowships have been funded by the MI through IRCSET.  A recruitment process, for a world-class researcher to be located in NUIG, is underway for the Principal Investigator who will lead this research programme.A  €5.2 million Marine Functional Foods Research Initiative, aimed at establishing Ireland as a leader in the $74 billion worldwide market for functional foods was announced 24th April 2007 by the then Ministers for Marine Communications and Natural Resources and for Agriculture and Food in Dublin.  A research consortium led by Teagasc and including UCD, NUIG, UL, UCC and the University of Ulster, Coleraine was invited to prepare a detailed work programme that targeted the identification and extraction of functional materials form algae, fish processing waste, underutilised and abundant species and aquaculture products following an international expert review of their application.  After negotiations between the MI and the consortium, a contract was signed in December 2007.  The consortium commenced a search process to identify two international professorial level researchers, (one to be based at UCC and the other at UCD) with specific expertise in marine functional ingredients; the recruitment of post-doctoral (7) and PhD students (7) was also initiated.  The programme's management board, chaired by Dr Noel Cawley will hold its first meeting on 14th July, 2008.

Any change to the measure would require further Commission approval and could only be justified on environmental grounds.My Department has issued some €9,000 for the mixed grazing supplementary measure to farmers with REPS 4 contracts starting in 2007.  For contracts starting in 2008, in accordance with EU Regulations, 75% of an applicant's REPS 4 payment, including supplementary measure payment, will be processed in the autumn when all administrative checks for REPS and the Single Payment Scheme are completed.  The remaining 25% payment will be processed in December when the last of the year's REPS on-farm inspections has taken place.  Some 11,600 applications for REPS 4 were received in my Department by the closing date of 15 May.  These are currently being entered on my Department's computer systems and until this exercise is completed, it will not be possible to say how many applicants have opted for the mixed grazing supplementary measure and what the cost of this measure in respect of 2008 will be.

I have no plans to approach the EU Commission to alter the terms of the state aid approval.The Standard Costings used to calculate grants under my Department's on-farm investment schemes were last revised with effect from January 2007.  A review of these Costings then took place in late-2007 and the decision was taken to maintain these Costings at their current rates.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1045	The possibility of introducing administrative sanctions was comprehensively considered, including an examination of practices in other Member States, at the time of the passage of the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill through the Oireachtas.  The position taken by the Minister at the time was based on the legal advice from the Attorney General.During recent negotiations with the FIF I gave a commitment to ask the Attorney General to examine the issue further and consider if any new developments can support the introduction of a regime of administrative sanctions for fisheries offences in Ireland.I have now received that advice, which is the same as that given at the time of the passage of the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill, namely that it would be unconstitutional to introduce a regime of administrative sanctions for fishery offences.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1046	At the December 2007 Council, a preliminary 2008 Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for Celtic Sea cod was set at 4,316 tonnes under Council Regulation (EC) No. 40/2008.  A final TAC was to be established in the light of new scientific advice as soon as possible in the first half of 2008.  In March this year, a scientific submission was made by the Research Institutes of France, UK and Ireland proposing that the scientific state of the stock was sufficient to justify an increase in the stock.Ireland's provisional allocation for this area for 2008 was 753 tonnes.  The quota is managed in conjunction with the industry and at the request of the industry a relatively liberal fishery was permitted earlier in the year when markets were strong.  This quota is almost exhausted now and it has already been necessary to scale down the fishery in this area.  This will prove a very difficult problem for Irish fishermen because cod is taken in a mixed fishery and this will ultimately lead to discarding, which, from a conservation perspective, cannot be justified.In that context I welcomed the commitment given by Commissioner Borg, after strong pressure from Ireland, France and the UK, to re-examine the 2008 TAC in the light of the most recent scientific advice, published at the end of June.  I understand that, as a result of the review, the Commission will be bringing a revised proposal to Council for decision in the near future.  Any increase in the TAC will of course be shared among all Member States having a quota for cod in the Celtic Sea.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1047	The new Council Regulation establishing a Community System to prevent, deter and eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing achieved political agreement at the Council of Agriculture and Fisheries Ministers on 24th June 2008.  As an EU Council Regulation, of course, its provisions are directly binding on all Member States.  I have already welcomed this measure for the benefits it will bring for our fishermen in removing unfair competition from the market and assisting in the protection of our already depleted fish stocks, and I will be strongly supporting the formal adoption of the measure at Council.  After formal adoption, it is intended that the Regulation will come into effect from 1 January 2010.In the meantime, detailed rules and procedures for implementation must be drawn up.  This is a complex and wide ranging measure, addressing not only IUU fishing activities but the marketing, import and export of the resulting catches.  For that reason, it will require actions from a number of responsible authorities in each Member State.  My officials will be having discussions with relevant authorities here and putting the necessary arrangements in place to ensure the effective delivery of the new controls.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1049	Since the escalation of this crisis Minister Killeen and I have taken every opportunity available to stress in the strongest possible terms to Commissioner Borg and the Commission, the depth of feeling of Irish Fishermen and the critical nature of the situation facing them.We have continuously pressurised the Commissioner to bring forward a new EU-funded package of measures to alleviate the immediate difficulties facing the Irish fishing industry.At the Fisheries Council on the 23rd June, with the support of my colleagues in the Council we continued the process.  The response of the EU Fisheries Commissioner Borg was encouraging, and he has now come back with new proposals for discussion and, I hope, agreement at next week's Council meeting.I am pleased to welcome the statement issued by Commissioner Borg on Tuesday and the adoption by the Commission of a proposal for the urgent restructuring measures to tackle the fuel crises.  I acknowledge the Commissioner's pledge for up to €600 million to fund these measures and that in his statement he acknowledges the particular justification for additional funding for countries such as Ireland who have large fleets but small EFF funding allocations and the unprecedented scale of the restructuring effort required by the current crises.I can assure the House that I will be seeking a fair share of these additional funds for Irish fishermen to allow us to implement the urgently needed measures set out in the Commission's proposals.  At the Council meeting next Tuesday we will be seeking agreement on the package of measures proposed and also a solid commitment from the Commissioner that a fair share of the additional €600 million is allocated without delay to Ireland.I will also continue my efforts with the Commission for further initiatives to strengthen the price fishermen receive for their catch and to reduce the cost of fishing in addition to bringing forward initiatives on research and innovation into ways to develop more fuel-efficient engines and fishing practices.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1050	A scheme for the compensation of crew affected by the decommissioning of fishing vessels has not been put in place and the focus has been to provide training for crew who lose their jobs to support them to source alternative employment.  Even if it was decided to implement such a scheme its practical implementation would be difficult because there are no official records for crewing of fishing vessels.  The Cawley Strategy has recommended the introduction of a register of fishing crew and BIM is working with industry representatives in this regard.All fishermen are eligible to undertake BIM training programmes including those serving on vessels that are decommissioning.  In this regard, BIM and FÁS have agreed to co-operate to provide training for fishing vessel crew members that find themselves without a job when their fishing vessel is decommissioned.  Both agencies will work closely together to provide retraining, up-skilling or diversification opportunities in the seafood industry or elsewhere in the economy.Funding will also be provided within BIM's overall programmes to support the sustainable development and improvement of the quality of life in fisheries areas as part of an overall strategy that will support the implementation of the objectives of the common fisheries policy, in particular taking account of its socio-economic effects.The measures for sustainable development of fisheries areas shall seek to:maintain the economic and social prosperity of these areas and add value to fisheries and aquaculture products;maintain and develop jobs in fisheries areas through support for diversification or the economic and social restructuring of areas facing socio-economic difficulties as a result of changes in the fisheries sector;promote the quality of the coastal environment;promote national and transnational cooperation between fisheries areas.It should also be noted that while the decommissioning scheme will remove some of the older and less economically viable vessels from the fleet right around the coast, the majority of the fleet will continue fishing and will continue to need crew.  At present many skippers are experiencing great difficulty securing crew, as there is an overall shortage of crew for fishing vessels.  In this situation there remains good opportunities for crew members whose current boats are leaving the fleet.Diversification into other marine related areas such as aquaculture or seafood processing or training to become Department of Transport (DoT) certificated skippers, mates and engineers, or undertake Global Maritime Distress and Safety System radio and other skills training will be available to crew through BIM.  For those who wish to retrain to enter the marine tourism sector or handle workboats authorised to carry passengers (e.g. on fish farms), BIM can provide training to enable them gain the DoT Passenger Boat Proficiency Certificate.The training funding provided by Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) is for the delivery of further education and statutory training courses to the seafood industry.  Funds are not allocated to cover fees for courses in Higher Education or Third Level institutions.  There are several grant schemes available in this regard via the Department of Education and Science and further information is available from that Department.Notwithstanding the career options made available to individual fishermen, it is ultimately a personal decision as to what route they wish to take in their future working lives.  Every encouragement will be afforded to them from the appropriate resources of my Department andthose of BIM to facilitate where possible career changes for fishermen on decommissioned vessels.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1052	The Community Fisheries Control Agency (CFCA) has been established at Vigo since the 1st of July 2008.  I am advised that a small staff complement of personnel will be maintained at Brussels for a limited period no later than December 2008 for continuity purposes.  The Community Fisheries Control Agency will perform a number of functions.  The CFCA will administer fisheries data exchange and provide Member States and the Commission with technical expertise in the field of fisheries data administration along with conducting analysis of this data.  The Agency will prepare, adapt and implement Joint Deployment Plans and in this regard liaise with National and International authorities. The operational coordination of Joint Deployment Plans will include operations in the North Sea, Baltic Sea, North Atlantic, Mediterranean, Black Sea and NAFO as well as matters associated with the control of IUU fishing.The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority will routinely liaise with the CFCA in support of their work and to participate in a meaningful way in the operations of the CFCA.  The SFPA has already been in touch with the CFCA and provided a list of competent Fisheries Inspectors that may be deployed in the role of Community Fisheries Inspectors in the future.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1053	My Department has taken a number of important initiatives in recent years to promote the conservation and sustainable use of plant and animal genetic resources, as follows: DAFF and Teagasc maintain substantial collections of native potato varieties and cereals, and seed of these are made available to growers and interested parties on request. DAFF has operated an annual grant scheme since 1996 to finance conservation projects aimed at locating, conserving and promoting the use of Irish based genetic resources.  The Irish Seed Savers Association based in Scariff, Co. Clare have been one of the benefactors of this funding and are very active in conserving promoting and bulking up, for sale to the public, many old varieties of apples and vegetables.  This funding has also been used to conserve native species of Elm and Oak and establish collections in public arboretae and re-introduce them in multi-species plantations.The Native Woodland Scheme operated by DAFF aims to provide landowners with the resources needed to enable them to protect and enhance existing native woodlands and to develop new native woodlands.  Under the Department's REPS scheme farmers are encouraged to promote native species in the establishment of high nature-value woodlands.  General obligations under the Single Farm Payment Scheme, the Nitrates Directive and Commonage Framework Plans, operated by my Department also benefit biodiversity by protecting species and habitats found on agricultural land.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1054	I have read with interest the correspondence from the person referred to (details supplied).  Fundamentally it is a personal assessment of how he sees some of the difficulties which have impacted on the fishing sector over time culminating with the present situation which has been triggered by the global rise in fuel prices.I have been fully advised by the Federation of Irish Fishermen of the issues facing fishermen and their implications, furthermore I am sympathetic to the plight of our fishermen and I am committed to working with the FIF to address these issues.Notwithstanding the current weaknesses that exist in the fishing industry, I am satisfied that a road map to restructure and develop the sector on a sustainable and profitable basis is set down in the Cawley Strategy — Steering A New Course which was launched in January 2007.  At a time when the Industry is experiencing extreme difficulties we already have an excellent blueprint available to us to transform the industry and ensure a sustainable, profitable and self reliant industry for all its participants into the future.I firmly believe that delivery on the recommendations in that strategy, now being overseen and driven by an implementation group under the chairmanship of Dr. Noel Cawley himself, is the way to ensure a profitable, viable and sustainable fishing sector into the future.In relation to short term measures to address the immediate impact of the current crisis.  I welcome the statement issued by Commissioner Borg on Tuesday and the adoption by the Commission of a proposal for the urgent restructuring measures to tackle the fuel crisis.  I acknowledge the Commissioner's pledge for up to another €600 million to fund these measures and that in his statement he acknowledges the particular justification for additional funding for countries such as Ireland who have large fleets but small EFF funding allocations and the unprecedented scale of the restructuring effort required by the current crises.I can assure the House that I will be seeking a fair share of these additional funds for Irish fishermen to allow us to implement the urgently needed measures set out in the Commission's proposals.  At the Council meeting on Tuesday we will be seeking agreement on the package of measures proposed and also a solid commitment from the Commissioner  that a fair share of the additional €600 million is allocated without delay to Ireland.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1055	Staffing levels in my Department's offices in Laois and Offaly, as in all areas of my Department, are subject to constant review.  Where vacancies that need to be filled are identified, recruitment of clerical staff is carried out on behalf of my Department by the Public Appointments Service or posts are filled by transfers of staff.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1056	The Programme for Government includes a commitment to setting a target of a reduction of 3% per year on average in greenhouse gas emissions.  Separately, the European Council agreed at its Spring 2007 meeting to set a target of a reduction of at least 20% in greenhouse gases by 2020 — rising to 30% if there is an international agreement that fulfils certain conditions.  Under its burden-sharing proposal to implement the Council's decision, the European Commission is asking Ireland to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020, based on 2005 emissions figures.The 20% target for Ireland presents a substantial and difficult challenge.  Through the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, I am engaged in discussions on the part that the agricultural sector can play, while having due regard to considerations of food security and the continued viability of Irish agriculture.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1058	S.I. No. 320 of 2003 — European Communities (Labelling of Fishery and Aquaculture Products) Regulations requires that the product is labelled with a country of origin.  However there are a number of exclusions in the legislation and essentially, there is no overall enabling legislation requiring all fish products sold here to carry a country of origin label.  For example, raw or portioned aquaculture products should be labelled, but not if processed in any way.  Wild caught fish only has to show from which FAO fisheries area it was caught (North West Atlantic etc) and again if processed, even that can be dropped.Ireland raised this issue as recently as the June 2008 Agriculture and Fisheries Council, in support of the new Council regulation combating illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing.  This measure addresses not only illegal fishing but the products of such fishing, and proposes a catch certification system which will be mandatory for all imports of fishery products into the EU.  The ultimate objective is to remove illegally sourced fishery products from the market that are currently unfairly competing with those caught legally by Irish and other fishermen who observe the rules.Speaking in support of the measure, Ireland highlighted the potential role of consumers in relation to this issue — enhanced consumer awareness of the sources of products and consumer demand for ethically- and legally-sourced products can play a significant role and a robust labelling system will facilitate them in making an informed choice.At the Council meeting Ireland called on the EU Commission to bring forward proposals for a more robust labelling system for all fishery products and I will continue to press for such measures going forward.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1059	Data from a BIM survey shows that nationally, employment in the seafood processing sector was 4,020 in 1997, this comprised 2,111 on a full time and 2,809 on a part time basis. These figures are not available for 1998.  I will revert to the deputy directly when the details by county are validated.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1060	According to BIM, in 2006, the most recent year for which data is available, employment in seafood processing amounted to 2,867, this comprised 2,205 full time and 662 part time.I will revert to the deputy directly when the details by county are validated.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1061	I propose to take Questions Nos. 591 and 592 together.The Single Payment Scheme was introduced as a fully decoupled scheme on 1 January 2005.  Farmers were allocated Single Payment entitlements based on the average of their receipts under the various Premia schemes during the three years 2000, 2001 and 2002.  Provision was made under the Single Payment Scheme for the transfer by way of sale, or lease, of Single Payment entitlements, subject to certain criteria.  A total of 128,742 farmers were paid under the 2005 Single Payment Scheme, 125,863 under the 2006 Scheme and 124,730 under the 2007 Scheme.  There are still some outstanding cases in respect of the 2007 Scheme where my Department is awaiting the receipt of outstanding documentation, including legal documentation.However, there are many farmers who do not claim the Single Payment but submit an SPS application form each year and declare land.  The forms are submitted by farmers for the purposes of claiming the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and/or REPS or for compliance with other area based Schemes.  The number of applications forms with land declared in the three years in question is as follows:135,550;134,053;133,187.I am arranging for my Department to send county details directly to the Deputy.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1062	During its period of existence all decisions as to what land was acquired and distributed by the Land Commission was a matter reserved by law to the Land Commissioners.  As well as compulsory acquisition powers, the Commission also accepted voluntary surrender of land, which could be used as part of re arrangement proceedings.  The Land Commission was dissolved in 1999 by the commencement of the Irish Land Commission (Dissolution) Act 1992.The searches mentioned by the Deputy for surviving family members in the 1970's are not documented in the available papers, and if they were deemed necessary at the time, they would have been conducted by the local Inspector.  The powers of the Commission and the Minister are set out in Section 12 of the Land Act 1950.  It is not clear what changes to the scheme the Deputy is referring to.Of the three folios mentioned in the details supplied the Land Commission had no dealings in the 1970's with the last two.  On the first mentioned folio a small area of approximately one acre was surrendered under exchange proceedings by the then registered owner in May 1973.There appears to be some confusion about the Record No. given by the Deputy in the details.  The entire area of the townland named was dealt with under the Estate reference number 9823 and not 9923 as stated.  The Land Commission at the time appears to have inadvertently used the incorrect reference number on a map dated 1935.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1063	Under the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies set out in the Department of Finance Guidelines, it is the specific responsibility of the Board of each State Body to ensure that Public Procurement Procedures are implemented at best practice level.For State Bodies which come under the aegis of my Department, each Chairman is required by this Code to affirm compliance with these procedures in their annual report.This requirement has been complied with in each of the years 2000 to 2008, with the exception of Coillte, where the current Chairman's statement indicates that Coillte is compliant in most respects with the Code, but that in certain contract situations, unique to the Forestry sector, full compliance has not yet been achieved.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1064	Earlier this week the Government decided on a number of spending measures to maintain a prudent fiscal out-turn for 2008.  That decision included expenditure savings on my Department's Vote of €9.1 million. Further savings in expenditure will be sought in 2009.The savings in the current year will be absorbed by my Department on its administrative budget and by the State Agencies under its aegis.  The focus will be on savings in administrative spending (operating costs, including salaries), the streamlining of service delivery and improved efficiency.  Savings in expenditure on the investment programmes and schemes operated by the Department were not targeted in the Government decision.  Nevertheless, I will be examining every aspect of the schemes and services in the context of the current economic circumstances and the more limited financial resources with a view to identifying savings, ensuring that expenditure is fully justified and that it provides the best possible value for public investment at this time.

In all, there are 13 primary schools on the offshore islands with a total enrolment of 270 pupils. There are 4 post-primary schools and one unit attached to a mainland school on the offshore islands, with an enrolment of almost 170 pupils. Where it is not feasible to provide a post-primary school on an island, island families are eligible for financial assistance under the Remote Area Boarding Grant Scheme to facilitate a child's attendance at school on the mainland. Under the Scheme, grants are paid towards the cost of boarding in or near second level boarding schools in the Free Education Scheme for pupils whose homes are outside the range of public transport services to a day school providing suitable post primary education. This Scheme provides for the payment of grants up to €4,725 in each case towards the cost of boarding or lodgings. The maximum grant per pupil was increased from €4,500 to €4,725 for the school year 2007/08 in accordance with the cost of living index. I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to ensuring that all persons living on our offshore islands have access to quality education.

The purpose and function of funding support in this context is to develop both the teaching and research capability and capacity in the Higher Education System. My Department also provides annual funding to the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies to support its activities. Specifically in relation to research, the Irish Research Council for the Humanities and Social Sciences, which is funded by my Department, funds cutting-edge research in the humanities, social sciences, business and law with the objective of creating new knowledge and expertise beneficial to Ireland's economic, social and cultural development. The Research Council operates a suite of interlinked Research Schemes, including pre and post-doctoral levels and research projects grants. A number of projects in the areas of old, classical and middle Irish are supported by the Research Council.As part of its current work programme the Research Council has recently commenced a national Foresight exercise to explore the contribution that the arts, humanities and social sciences make to the Irish economy and society. The overall objective of the Foresight exercise is to provide a comprehensive review of the contribution which a thriving humanities and social sciences sector can make to social and economic development; to review the current status, strengths and weaknesses of the arts, humanities and social sciences in Ireland and to chart a course for their future so that they can make the best possible contribution to social and economic development. The exercise will make an objective assessment of the role of the arts, humanities and social sciences in interacting with current research and policy; map past and present research; identify strategic opportunities and the supports necessary for the development of the arts, humanities and social sciences research in Ireland. It is expected that this Foresight exercise will be completed next year.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1068	My Department is providing broadband connectivity to recognised primary and post-primary schools under the Schools Broadband Access Programme. This programme is being undertaken in partnership with industry in the context of a Government — IBEC/TIF (Telecommunications and Internet Federation) Agreement to provide local broadband connectivity to schools. The Programme has three elements — local connectivity to schools, a national broadband network and a broadband support service desk. Schools connectivity is being routed to the Internet through a national broadband network, which is supported by HEAnet and provides centrally managed services for schools such as security, anti-spam/anti-virus and content filtering. The broadband support service desk has been established to interface between the network, the local broadband service Access Providers and schools. It is managed by the National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE).Following a competitive technology neutral, central procurement process, contracts were finalised in 2005 with six service providers for the provision of local broadband access to 3,925 schools. The total number of schools involved in the Programme has been adjusted in the meantime to reflect a number of school openings, closures and amalgamations and stands currently at 3,936, of which 136 are in County Clare. As of 24 June, 2008, 3,901 (99%) have had their local connectivity installed and of these 3,899 have had their router capability installed and tested. A further 72 schools have had broadband access provided under the Hermes and Advanced Deployment programmes and are not included in the 3,901 figure. However, none of these schools are in County Clare.  In relation to County Clare, as of 24 June, 2008, 118 primary schools (100%) and 18 post-primary schools (100%) have had their local connectivity installed and have had their router capability installed and tested.

With regard to expenditure in the past 5 years the details are as follows; Nil was spent on temporary accommodation in 2007, €1,306.80 in 2006, €162,703.31 in 2005, €104,820.42 in 2004 and €128,731.97 in 2003.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1072	The information on expenditure of renting and purchasing temporary accommodation by secondary and primary schools in each of the past five years is provided in the following tabular statement. The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years, with the appointment of 6,000 extra teachers in the primary sector alone since 2002. In considering the need to provide extra resources and teachers to schools in recent years, the Government could have decided to make children wait until permanent accommodation could be provided. However we prioritised putting the extra teachers into schools as soon as possible. Provision has been made in the estimates for 2008 for rental of temporary accommodation of just over €60 million and €10m for prefab purchase. However, as the scheme is demand-led, and with the continued increase in teacher numbers in our schools, applications for temporary accommodation are expected from schools during the course of 2008. With over 2000 extra primary teachers appointed than the number in schools since last summer the demand for the purchase of temporary accommodation will be significant this year and expenditure under this subhead will continue to be monitored and kept under review.YearExpenditure on Rental of Temporary School Premises (including prefab classrooms) Primary LevelExpenditure on Rental of Temporary School Premises (including prefab classrooms)Post-Primary Level€m20039.400200411.300200515.700200624.510200734.501.00YearExpenditure on Purchase of Temporary School Premises (including prefab classrooms) Primary LevelExpenditure on Purchase of Temporary School Premises (including prefab classrooms)Post-Primary Level200321,669,430.934,169,023.0020048,745,049.733,966,753.0020054,434,603.632,033,396.0020062,165,186.341,235,845.0020071,939,376.542,474,651.00

Budget 2008 provided my Department with €4.6 billion or €380 million extra for teacher pay and pensions. This was a very substantial level of additional investment in terms of the economic environment on which the budget was based. That allocation provides for paying for over 2,000 extra primary teachers more than the number in schools when the Government took office last summer. It covers the additional teachers that went into schools last September for the previously announced reduction to a 27 to 1 based staffing schedule along with additional teachers this school year and in the coming school year to meet increasing enrolments, to provide for special needs and the language requirements of newcomer children.  This means that in terms of the overall commitment to provide at least 4,000 additional teachers the Government in its first two years in office will be well ahead of target.All Programme for Government commitments to improve public services including those relating to class size are contingent on the economic and budgetary environment and the need for prudent expenditure and fiscal management. Even since the presentation of Budget 2008 last December there have been significant alterations in the external and domestic environment. In that context any reasonable observer would regard the fact that the Government has already taken measures that will see the allocation of over 2,000 additional teachers to primary schools as a considerable investment all things considered.I am aware of the cost pressures on schools and it is for this reason that it is a priority for Government to improve funding for the day-to-day running costs of schools. Specific commitments in relation to improving school funding form a central part of the education provisions of the Programme for Government. These commitments are a direct follow on from the clear thrust of Government policy over recent years to improve the position of schools and primary schools in particular. Primary schools are now getting over €178 per pupil to meet their day to day running costs — an increase of nearly 70% on the 2002 rate of €105 and €15 more per child than they got last year.The school referred to by the Deputy applied for and was approved grant-aid of €300,000 for the provision of resource rooms under the Permanent accommodation scheme 2007. The Scheme allows Boards of Management to address their accommodation and building priorities with a guaranteed amount of funding and gives Boards of Management control of the building project. The intention of the scheme is to provide funding to schools to enable them to undertake wanted building projects. The scheme is not intended to leave schools with significant fund-raising needs but for the school to tailor the scope of capital works commissioned to the available funding. A central tenet of the scheme is that the schools, granted discretion and funding, must equally accept responsibility for prioritisation, adherence to statutory regulations, control of costs and ensuring value for money. The decision on whether to continue participating in the scheme or to drop out, if the scope of build is more than the funding envelope permits, is a matter for each school authority. Further progress on the project is a matter for the school authorities.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1090	I welcome the report which was published on 1 July 2008.  The arts have a key role to play in our education system, in providing for sensory, emotional, intellectual and creative enrichment and contributing to young people's holistic development and self esteem. The arts help children to respond creatively, to express feelings, attitudes and to interact with others, as well as inculcating an appreciation of beauty and art. They support the development of communication, co-ordination, numeracy, creative skills, social skills, team work and leadership skills, as well as promoting a child's self esteem and enjoyment of learning. They also provide an important vehicle for personal enrichment and cultural expression, as well as creating awareness and respect for other cultures.My Department invests extensively in arts education through the provision of visual arts, music and drama in the primary curriculum, the Music, Art Craft and Design syllabi at second level, through arts education initiatives for disadvantaged pupils, the provision of some 93 additional full time equivalent teaching posts to VECs for music education, 2 pilot Music Networks initiatives, and through an extensive range of programmes at Post Leaving Certificate and Higher Education levels. The Arts also feature prominently in other subjects such as languages and technology.The Points of Alignment report highlights the importance of supporting arts in education practice through systematic collaboration between schools and local artists and through visits by schools to arts events and performances. My Department is working closely with the Department of Arts Sport and Tourism to explore how best a synergy can be promoted between in-school activity and the work of other agencies, and how best combined investment can be used to optimum effect within available resources. In that context, the terms of reference for the Special Committee on Arts and Education made clear that the budgetary resources likely to be available over the next four years for the education sector would have to be allocated to fund existing policy commitments. The Arts in Education Development Unit proposed in the Report has the potential to play a key role in building further synergies and strategic partnerships in this important area.

I identified the two schools as Coláiste Cois Life in Lucan and Gaelcholaiste Chill Dara in Newbridge.A multi-million Euro building project was recently completed to provide Coláiste Cois Life with permanent accommodation to cater for a long term projected enrolment of 600 pupils, to include pupils from the north Kildare area.Transport arrangements to this school for those pupils will continue to be available, as necessary, subject to the usual conditions.In the recent past, my Department gave careful consideration to an application for a further all-Irish post primary school for the North Kildare area and decided that the application was premature and should not be granted. In arriving at this conclusion, account was taken of the establishment of Coláiste Cois Life under the aegis of Co. Dublin VEC to serve the needs of the west Dublin/north Kildare area.  My Department will keep this situation under review.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1102	Teacher allocations to second level are approved by my Department on an annual basis in accordance with generally applied rules relating to recognised pupil enrolment. In general a ratio of 18:1 is applied in respect of recognised pupils on established Junior Certificate, Leaving Certificate, repeat Leaving Certificate and Transition Year Programmes and a ratio of 16:1 is applied in respect of recognised pupils on the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme, Post Leaving Certificate courses and Leaving Certificate Applied. The rules for allocating teaching posts provide that where a school management authority is unable to meet essential curricular commitments, my Department will consider applications for additional short term support. An independent Appeals Committee is available to school authorities who wish to appeal the adequacy of  their teacher allocation.Significant improvements have been made in the staffing of our second level schools in recent years. In the 2001/2002 school year, there were approximately 24,477 wholetime equivalent teaching posts allocated to second level schools. For 2006/2007, the corresponding figure is 25,454 wholetime equivalent posts.This increase in staffing has improved the pupil teacher ratio at post primary level in recent years. The pupil teacher ratio has fallen from 13.85:1 in the 2001/2002 school year to 13.13:1 in the 2006/2007 school year.Each school management authority is required to organise its curriculum, teaching time-table and subject options including Irish, English and Maths having regard to pupils' needs within the limits of its approved teacher allocation.In line with Government policy, my Department will continue to provide further reductions in the pupil teacher ratio within available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector.  The commitment in relation to extra teachers and teacher training can only be looked at and considered in the context of the overall economic and budgetary position that might prevail in the coming years and the competing priorities for available resources.

The Council has begun its work in relation to this review and will produce a Strategy for initial teacher education. To this end, the Council held a series of consultation fora for stakeholders in education in February of this year, and the Council will continue to consult with education partners, including my Department, over the course of their work. I look forward to receiving the Council's Strategy in due course.Regarding the reservation of places for students from disadvantaged areas, all of the Colleges of Education have a direct entry scheme for such applicants.  The intake of students via this stream of entry to initial teacher education programmes has admittedly been low, this is due to a number of factors including low numbers of applicants and the fact that some students from disadvantaged areas apply successfully for teacher education programmes via the ‘normal' route. My Department will continue to monitor the intake of students from disadvantaged areas in the Colleges of Education and will liaise with the Colleges as necessary. These programmes are reviewed and adapted on an ongoing basis to address the evolving nature of the education system and the factors affecting teachers on the ground.My Department will continue to prioritise high quality in-career professional development for teachers and principals. There are a range of national programmes in place to support teachers' professional and personal development covering such diverse areas as curricular or syllabus change, support for teaching and learning methodologies, improving teachers' competence in the teaching of the Irish language as a communicative tool, child protection, student behavioural issues, development of leadership skills in schools, whole school planning, addressing the teaching of children with special educational needs and so on. In addition, the national network of education centres provides a range of local and summer courses for teachers, which respond to identified needs and advance the quality of teaching and learning generally.In 2007, my department spent over €40m on in-career professional development for teachers and principals at primary and post-primary level.

The commitment in relation to doubling the capitation grant to primary schools can only be looked at and considered in the context of the overall economic and budgetary position that might prevail in the coming years and the competing priorities for available resources.The need to control public expenditure will present particular challenges in the context of framing the 2009 estimates. I want to assure the Deputy that I will be mindful of the funding pressures on schools during that process.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1105	The funding arrangements made by my Department for second level schools reflect the sectoral division of our second level system. At the core of all arrangements is a reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant of funding.My Department provides funding to secondary schools by way of per capita grants, which affords schools considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils.There have been significant improvements in recent years in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools. With effect from January 2008, the standard per capita grant was increased by €15 per pupil and now amounts to €331 per pupil. In addition, voluntary secondary schools have benefited by the increase of €15 per pupil in 2008 in the support services grant bringing that grant to €204 per pupil.The cumulative increase of €30 per pupil in a voluntary secondary school brings the aggregate grant to €535 per pupil. These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to €40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. For example in the case of a secondary school with 500 pupils, this brings annual grants towards general expenses and support service to over €300,000.Budget allocations for schools in the Community and Comprehensive school sector along with those in the VEC sector are increased on a pro rata basis with increases in the per capita grant. All schools are eligible for recurrent per capita grants towards special classes and curricular support grants.My Department has provided an estimated €18.4m per annum in equalisation funding to date.These significant increases in the funding of post primary schools are a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools. My Department will be considering how best to complete the process of equalisation of funding at second level, as envisaged in theProgramme for Government 2007-2012, having regard to available resources.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1106	I am very much aware of the cost pressures on schools, including those arising from waste charges and the changes that are happening in relation to water charges.Primary schools are now getting over €178 per pupil to meet their day to day running costs — an increase of nearly 70% on the 2002 rate of €105 and €15 more per child than they got last year. Post-primary schools have also seen improvements in funding and through a similar €15 increase this year now receive €331 per pupil. These increases are significant and well ahead of the Consumer Price Index increases for the same period.With regard to waste charges, there is a commitment in the Programme for Government to examine the feasibility of introducing waste allowances for schools. The progression of this commitment is primarily a matter for my colleague — the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. My predecessor was in contact with Minister Gormley on this issue and my Department will of course input to and support as required any work being done by that Department on the commitment.The position in relation to water charges is that the Government agreed a transition period to full water charges in the case of non-fee charging recognised schools and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has advised local authorities of the detailed arrangements regarding the implementation of this decision.The transitional arrangements afford schools the opportunity to put in place water conservation arrangements and practices and to undertake works that can help reduce water usage significantly before full water charges are introduced. By virtue of good water conservation schools can be in a much stronger position to reduce the impact of water charges on their overall budgets. Guidance was also recently issued to schools on the most appropriate measures to minimise excess consumption of water and to reduce wastage where it exists. In addition, water conservation issues will continue to be addressed by my Department as a matter of routine where new schools are being built or where major renovations are being carried out to existing schools under the schools modernisation programme.My Department remains in close liaison with the Department of Environment and Local Government regarding water conservation and is supportive of any initiatives by it and local authorities that will help reduce water costs for schools.The funding needs of schools generally, and what support I can give them to help them meet day to day running costs, is of course a matter that I will be considering in the context of next years estimates.

These projects are being delivered in areas which have been identified as areas of rapid population growth.To deliver its 2008 programme, the Developing Areas Unit has been working closely with relevant Local Authorities on the acquisition of sites and on general pre-planning issues.When taken with a number of other projects in developing areas involving extensions to existing schools, approximately 7,500 additional school places will be provided for September 2008.In the meantime, the Forward Planning Section of my Department is identifying the areas where significant additional accommodation will be needed for 2009 and onwards. This is also being done in close consultation with local authorities.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1108	The Programme for Government sets out a number of measures in relation to school provision including improving arrangements for the planning for new schools.My colleague, the Minster for Environment, Heritage and Local Government Minister Gormley published draft planning guidelines on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas for public consultation in February which reinforces the need for new development to be phased in line with the availability and provision of essential social and community infrastructure such as schools, amenities and other facilities, and for timely consultation with my Department in relation to new schools needs. Moreover, the draftguidelines state that:"No substantial residential development should proceed without an assessment of existing schools capacity or the provision of new school facilities in tandem with the development."In addition, the procedures to be adopted by planning authorities in integrating schools planning issues into their development planning processes are outlined in the Planning Guidelines on Development Plans.My Department has been developing in partnership with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the City and County Managers Association a code of practice for planning authorities on the provision of schools in the planning system.

A suite of technical guidance documents is available on my Department's website to assist design teams in best practice in the design and development of projects and to encourage the design team to take a complete design team approach from project conception.My Department has developed Generic Repeat Designs to reduce the cost, speed up the delivery of new schools particularly in developing areas and ensure that the most up to date technologies are used. This year further design templates are being developed, using appropriate off site construction technologies, for repeatable buildings.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1110	My Department has a strong record in developing low energy educational buildings. For the past eight years my Department has been using a process called the DART approach to develop sustainable and energy efficiency in educational buildings. This acronym focuses on four key areas, namely; Design, Awareness, Research, and Technology.The Department takes a holistic approach and has developed technical guidance on energy efficiency in school designs as an integral part of the suite of technical guidance documents. These guidelines encourage the design team to take a complete design team approach from project conception. There is particular emphasis on elimination of over-design, improved thermal envelope design, improved passive solar design, natural ventilation and day lighting along with advanced heating and lighting controls.It has been demonstrated that all Primary Schools designed and built in line with the above policy and the technical guidance documents can have an energy performance that is 2.3 times more efficient than international best practice.The performance of the Department in the area of low energy design has been recognised at both national and international levels with sustainable energy awards for excellence in Design and Specification.One of the research projects currently underway, in conjunction with Sustainable Energy Ireland, is aimed at helping existing schools to meet the certification requirements of the Energy Performance Building Directive. This process will allow all schools to conduct an energy audit of their school and energy usage and to input specific information to the Department's energy website. The school will then not only receive information on their actual energy use and environmental emissions but will also be able to compare the school's energy performance relative to that of other school buildings in the form of an energy rating. They will also be able to receive energy saving advice from the website relevant to their school buildings and to view case studies of similar schools and how they achieve better energy savings.The data gathering, energy auditing and benchmarking and website development aspects of the project are complete and validation of the system will be completed this year.The development of energy efficiency and eco-design will continue to be kept under review to take account of improvements in technology in the market place.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1111	As the Deputy is aware, the Programme for Government commits my Department to promote and support the use of school facilities by community groups and other appropriate services and design new schools in order to facilitate multi-use.The primary responsibility of my Department in this area is the provision of school facilities for the effective delivery of the curriculum. In addition, school authorities have a considerable degree of autonomy in relation to how their premises are managed and utilised at local level.However, the Government recognises that there is a lack of recreational facilities for community use in certain areas which could be met if school premises were made available to the wider community. To encourage schools in this respect, my Department issued a circular to all school authorities in late 2005 urging trustees and Boards of Management to make their facilities available, where possible, for community education and recreation purposes.Decisions in relation to the use of school facilities remain entirely at the discretion of the school authorities, subject to the condition that the needs of the students attending the school are prioritised in the first instance.  It is also important that schools should ensure that insurance and security are covered as it is unlikely that the school's insurance policy would cover non-school activities or that a caretaker would be routinely available to open/lock up premises.My Department has also progressed a number of school building projects within the Fingal and Adamstown areas of Dublin with local Authority/Developers to produce an integrated solution to education and community facilities that matches the delivery of new housing.In respect of PPP schools, the contract arrangements provide for school facilities to be available for community use when not required by the school.My Department's position generally is that the availability of such facilities should be self-funding i.e. adequate to cover the heat/light/caretaking arrangements as well as making some contribution to the repair of wear and tear on premises caused by increased use.

In November 2006, the funding for the minor works grant was increased by 44% on the previous year.  Over €27m was paid out to schools throughout the country in 2007 to enable thousands of small scale works to be completed without the need to interact with my Department. Individual primary schools received a grant in the sum of €5,500 plus €18.50 per pupil.There are close to 3,300 primary schools including 126 special schools in the State. The Deputy will appreciate that the total number of schools will vary from year to year on account of closures, amalgamations and new school openings. In this regard, 22 new schools will open with effect from September next.It is intended that the Minor Works Grant for the 2008/2009 school year will be paid in 2009.The level of grant to be paid under the grant scheme will be considered in that context and in the light of the trend in the cost of building works generally.

The number of days release time allowed varies between 14 and 22 and is determined by the number of mainstream class teachers in the school. Paid substitution is provided by my Department for the days that Principals are on release time.In the 2005/2006 school year my Department, following consultation with the relevant education interests, introduced on a pilot basis, a system whereby a fully qualified primary school teacher may be employed to act as a nominated substitute teacher for the Principals in a cluster of schools taking release days. Twenty clusters have been established under the pilot scheme.As part of the Programme for Government there is a commitment to increase the number of release days for teaching principals and to also expand the pilot scheme for substitute cover for principal release days.  Progress on these commitments are contingent on the economic and budgetary environment and the need for prudent expenditure and fiscal management.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1116	The Leadership Development for Schools Programme (LDS) has expanded the range of supports and services that it offers to school leaders and over 8,000 teachers from principals to middle managers have successfully completed LDS module programmes such as Misneach, Spreagagh, Forbairt, Tánaiste, Cumasú and Cothú. This investment has now led us to a point where there are structured continuous professional development opportunities for all school leaders.In September 2008 a new Programme called Toraíocht will commence.  This programme will lead to a Post Graduate Diploma in Educational Leadership and is a programme of continuous professional development for teachers interested in developing their leadership skills. It aims to enhance their current work and to support preparation for future senior leadership and management positions. It will develop the knowledge, understanding, attitudes and skills required for successful modern school leadership. Such a programme is both timely and necessary in the provision of high quality leadership to meet future challenges.  There will be 160 participants on the initial Toraíocht course.

The purpose of these discussions is to ensure that maximum benefit is derived from the management structure in schools to assist school authorities in the running of schools.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1118	My Department is currently considering the results of a Feasibility Study on the development of a single point of access to share data between schools, the Department and certain Agencies such as the National Educational Welfare Board, the National Council for Special Education and the State Examinations Commission.  Consideration is also being given to the timing and resource requirements of a Learner Database to be introduced initially at Primary level and then rolled out to Second-level. It is intended to proceed, as soon as resources permit, with a live online system allowing for easy exchange of information that reflects the up-to-date situation in regard to enrolment at any one time and to cut down on administrative burden and the scale of paper-based information flows across the Department and its associated agencies.These developments will build on the existing On Line Claim System (OLCS) which already allows each primary school and Voluntary Secondary, Community and Comprehensive school through ESINET to record absences and submit claims to the Department for the payment of casual and non casual teachers and Special Needs Assistants.  The process of manual form filling at school level and manual data input at Department level has been reduced as a result of OLCS.

Other areas that are covered in training include Background Information re: the Education System, Role and Function of the Board, How a BoM Operates, Policies and Procedures.  All representative bodies form part of the Steering Committee for BoM training and these bodies also provide training in additional areas which they identify pertaining to their respective values.

Over €2.6 billion has been provided for school building infrastructure between 2000 and 2006 and a further €4.5 billion is to be invested under the current National Development Plan 2007-2013. Close to €600m of this will be provided this year alone. In a new school building or refurbishment/extension PE facilities are included as an intrinsic part of the design.New curricula for PE in primary schools and at Junior Cert level have also been put in place. The PE curriculum has been designed on the basis that facilities in schools may vary. Many primary schools have a general purpose room and practically all schools have outdoor play areas which are used for teaching different aspects of the PE programme. A similar situation with sports halls and outdoor facilities applies at second level. In addition, many schools use adjacent local facilities, including public parks, playing fields and swimming pools.Primary schools received €2,000 each in PE equipment grants in 2006, at a total cost of €6.5 million. A similar grant of €4,000 per school, at an overall cost of around €3 million, issued to post-primary schools in 2007. In addition, since 2000 my Department has provided in excess of €5.5m in grant-aid to primary schools to facilitate the provision of coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or to purchase resource materials associated with the provision of physical education.The extent and quality of local sports facilities has been improved dramatically in recent years, with more than €450 million invested by the Government since 1998 in over 5,000 projects through the Sports Capital Programme. At the same time, PE, general purpose and outdoor play facilities have been provided for schools all over the country through the School Building Programme.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1121	In accordance with the Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools, all second-level schools should provide Physical Education as part of the curriculum. The programme that each school plans and delivers should be based on my Department's approved syllabuses and the teaching hours should be registered in the school timetable. The syllabuses have been developed on the basis of a time allocation of two hours per week.A revised syllabus in Physical Education as a non examinable subject at Junior Cycle was introduced in post-primary schools in September 2003 and implemented on a phased basis over the period to 2005. No implementation dates have been set as yet for further reforms in this area.Curriculum support services provide training and school-based support for teachers. School-based support is a very rich form of support and allows the teacher explore the possibilities and limitations of the environment in which they teach. Through modelling of lessons and professional dialogue, the quality of teaching is enhanced and teachers are further enabled to develop their teaching skills. Teachers must also aim to include all students in PE lessons — irrespective of gender, or physical and/or learning deficits. The PE Association of Ireland have been active in organising conferences where teachers can avail of an opportunity to witness the latest thinking in physical education, and my Department also funds programmes on PE through the network of education centres.This Government has worked hard to improve the opportunities for young people to get physical exercise both in school and in their local communities. In a new school building or refurbishment/extension, PE facilities are included as part of the design. Between 2000 and 2006 a total of 516 large-scale projects were delivered in primary and post-primary schools by my Department as part of a record overall investment of €2.6 billion in modernising primary and post-primary school facilities throughout the country. Many more large-scale projects are under construction or due to go to construction in the near future. New PE equipment such as balancing benches and gym mats are funded as part of any major building programme.A special PE funding package of €3 million issued to post-primary schools in 2007, providing a grant of €4,000 per school towards the cost of replacing and upgrading PE equipment. This grant was issued, as a once-off measure, to enable schools to replace older equipment such as goalposts, PE mats, benches etc.So, through an increased focus on exercise in school and in the community, we are working to encourage more children and young people to get active. Indeed, the ‘State of the Nation's Children' report published by the Minister for Children recently, found that children in Ireland are doing well on physical activity, ranking second across the 32 WHO countries in being physically active for at least 4 hours per week.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1122	My Department makes a specific allocation of teaching posts in respect of guidance to schools in the post-primary system. This allocation is based on the pupil enrolment in September of the preceding school year.As a result of the decision to allocate an additional 100 posts to guidance from September 2005 an enhanced guidance allocation provision has been put in place from the commencement of the 2005/06 school year. This enhanced provision means that in the case of schools in the Free Education/Block Grant Schemes, the level of allocation ranges from 8 hours per week for schools with enrolments below 200 pupils to 47 hours per week for schools with an enrolment of 1,000 pupils or more. The additional posts included provision for a further improvement in the allocation of Guidance hours for post-primary schools participating in the DEIS programme — Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools. The allocation for these schools now ranges from 11 hours per week for schools with enrolments below 300 to 55 hours per week for schools with an enrolment of 1,000 pupils or more.In line with Government policy, my Department will continue to provide further increased guidance within available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector. The commitment in relation to Promoting Students' All-round Development can only be looked at and considered in the context of the overall economic and budgetary position that might prevail in the coming years and the competing priorities for available resources.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1123	I believe that schools have a role to play both in teaching students about road safety issues and in helping them to develop the attitudes necessary to promote safe behaviour on the roads.The Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) programme, which is mandatory in primary schools and at junior cycle level, provides a framework under which the generic values and skills which underpin responsible decision-making, and respect for the rights and safety of others, can be developed and promoted among students. SPHE has a specific personal safety strand within the programme, and this provides a mechanism through which road safety issues for all can be best dealt with in an age appropriate way.In February of 2007, the Road Safety Authority launched the RSA MACE "Safe to School" campaign at primary level. The programme is aimed at helping primary school children learn effective road safety lessons. The 2007 campaign covered walking to school safely, in 2008 the campaign is focused around the topic of Cycling to School Safely.A dedicated website, www.safetoschool.ie, has also been launched as part of the campaign.The Streetwise programme for junior cycle pupils was launched in UN Road Safety Week on 24 April 2007. It covers road safety across 9 topics — walking, cycling, seatbelts, airbags, speed, driver fatigue, motor cycle safety, hazard recognition and the engineering aspects of road safety — to be delivered over nine class periods.In addition, a Road Safety programme for Transition Year, developed by the Road Safety Authority in collaboration with my Department, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and the Second level Support Service was piloted in the 2007/08 school year and will be rolled out to schools in the next school year.Applications have issued to schools inviting them to participate in the programme from September next and over 200 schools have applied for the necessary in-service.My Department will continue to work with the Road Safety Authority to strengthen the role of schools in promoting road safety even further.

It seeks to enhance children's self protective skills by participating in lessons on safe and unsafe situations, bullying, touches, secrets, telling and strangers.Results of a survey on the uptake of Stay Safe carried out by the Child Abuse Prevention Programme (CAPP) and my Department in 2006 showed that at that time:2,514 schools (84.19%) were providing the programme472 (15.81%) were not providing the programme, and263 schools (8.8%) of respondents) were not teaching the sections on inappropriate sexual contact and secrecy.Of the 472 schools that were not teaching stay safe, 240 (8.0% of respondents) reported that child abuse prevention was covered as part of the curriculum.Following this survey my Department has been taking a targeted approach to the provision of training.Two additional primary school teachers were seconded to CAPP in September 2007 to assist with this training which is being directed at those schools that had indicated they are not implementing the programme.In the 2007/2008 school year CAPP has provided training to approximately 615 schools, over 5,000 teachers and 1,100 special needs assistants.In addition to this targeted training, CAPP continues to provide in-service training and support to all primary schools on request.It should also be noted that my Department sent a Circular on Child Protection and Procedures for Primary Schools (Primary 0061/2006) to the Chairperson and Principals of all primary schools. This draws attention to the crucial importance of schools following closely the Child Protection Guidelines and Procedures which are based on the Children First national guidelines issued by the Department of Health and Children and specifically adapted to cater for primary school settings.

It is important not only to ensure that each school has a Student Council which is representative of all students in the school but also that Councils are given a meaningful role in school decision-making.The Act provides that Boards shall have procedures for the purposes of informing students of the activities of the school and to facilitate the involvement of students in the operation of the school, having regard to the age and experience of the students, in association with their parents and teachers.An active Student Council can be a most effective way to involve students in the affairs of the school, in cooperation with the board, parents and teachers.In 2002, my Department issued guidelines on the establishment and operation of Student Councils, ‘Student Councils: A Voice for Students'. In November 2005, a curriculum development project on the setting up and development of Student Councils, entitled Giving Young People a Voice, through the Civic, Social and Political Education (CSPE) curriculum was established. This was a partnership project between the Office for the Minister for Children and the Curriculum Development Unit of City of Dublin VEC. The Project has assisted and supported schools, teachers and students in the establishment of effective Student Councils in schools through the development and piloting of a teaching and learning resource for the CSPE curriculum. It is important that schools engage with the issues which Student Councils themselves highlight as matters of concern.In post-primary schools where Student Councils have been established, my Department's Inspectorate meets with the representatives of the students during a whole-school evaluation. This meeting is intended to provide the students' representatives with opportunities to give an account of their participation in school life, their achievements during the year, how they manage meetings, who they communicate with and how and to talk about some of the issues that have been raised at meetings. Students' views are also sought on the atmosphere of the school and the extent to which students are involved in decision-making.In September 2007 my Department appointed a Student Council Coordinator to design and deliver a programme of professional development to respond to identified needs and to support Student Council Liaison teachers and schools involved in establishing and developing effective Student Councils at second-level. The Student Council Co-ordinator works within the CSPE Support Service with specific responsibility for Student Councils.The second level support service of my Department is providing training at national, regional, local and school level for both the liaison teachers and the Student Councils. The purpose of this training is to develop effective student councils. Support is also being provided to encourage the networking of Student Councils.In relation specifically to Boards of Management, the advice being delivered at in-service and in schools is that Student Councils should be proactive in engaging with the Boards of Management of their schools.They should present their reviewed Constitution to the Board of Management for ratification every year, soon after the elections.The students are being encouraged to keep the Board updated on meetings and issues by sending agendas and minutes to the Board through the Secretary which is usually the Principal of a school.Reports should be sent regularly to the Board and the Student Council should look to meet with the Board a minimum of twice a year, at the beginning and at the end.Funding applications for needs identified in the school or for the day to day running of the Student Council should also be made directly to the Board.Student Councils are being encouraged to evaluate the year's work. This would include asking the Board, school staff, students and the parents' associations, to evaluate their engagement with the Council during the year.Resources are currently being developed to support the Liaison Teachers in their work with the Student Councils one of which will specifically address the practical needs of the Student Council in e.g. how to present and draw up plans, proposals, funding applications, the constitution, reports etc. to the Boards of Management. This resource will be presented to Liaison Teachers at national in-service for consultation and review, prior to dissemination to schools.

T.D. welcomed the embedding of core skills, the inclusion of a second assessment component, and the moves to standardise transition units. She asked that change be implemented on a phased basis over a significant period of time, minimising disruption, taking account of logistical and cost factors and system capacity to change. The Minister asked the NCCA to prioritise the reconfiguration of subjects generally within the Leaving Certificate in order to embed key skills, and to provide for a second assessment component. She indicated her concern the TYP should remain as a single year programme for equity reasons. On short courses, she asked the NCCA to develop as an exemplar a short course in Enterprise Education, building on the existing Links Modules, so that the Department could better assess the implementation issues.The NCCA has established a network to undertake development work with schools. A standardised framework for Transition Unit descriptors has been developed, and organisations are using these as new programme options for TYP are being developed. Reforms are under way in Irish to strengthen oral competence and to increase the proportion of marks for the oral examinations to 40% for all new entrants beginning second level in 2007/8.Reform in Mathematics Education at junior and senior cycle is also beginning on a phased basis. This will start in 24 project schools with effect from 2008/9, and will begin in mainstream schools from September 2010. The reforms are designed to provide a bridging framework from the revised primary curriculum into second level, promote greater maths literacy across the school population, bring changed emphasis in the mathematics learnt and, in particular, a strong focus on context and applications and problem solving and a greater ICT dimension, encourage greater take up at higher level, and provide a solid foundation which prepares students for careers in science, technology, engineering, business or humanities options. For schools involved in the initial implementation from September 2008, students will experience mathematics in a new way. Teachers will be provided with classroom materials to enable them to adopt the new approaches and will be supported professionally in embracing change. These materials and supports will include lesson plans, with teacher guides and student worksheets, online exemplars and a range of assessment materials. Examination questions will also be changed for these students.Recommendations are expected shortly from the NCCA in regard to senior cycle science subjects, and a number of short courses and Transition units. Work is also at an advanced stage in regard to proposals for the subjects Social Personal and Health Education and Politics and Society in senior cycle, but proposals in this area have not as yet been submitted to my Department.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1127	The proposals of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment for reform of senior cycle envisaged a re-structuring of programmes into subjects, short courses and transition units. The Council proposed the development of Transition Units as 45 hour units of study which would provide a broad range of experiences for learners, incorporating innovative methodologies and supporting the development of key skills. The Council proposed that school based assessment would be inbuilt into each transition unit, and models for the validation of schools to develop their own Transition Units would be explored. The units would cover such areas of learning as creative applications, skills, personal achievement, sampling of subjects, enterprise, civic and social education, and work and future.In response, the then Minister Mary Hanafin TD welcomed the measures to standardise transition units, and indicated her concern that the Transition Year Programme should remain as a single year programme for equity reasons.The NCCA has established a network to undertake development work with schools. A standardised framework for Transition Unit descriptors has been developed, and organisations are using these as new programme options for TYP are being developed. The decriptors are designed to promote better planning and communication and provide for greater clarity and coherence in the implementation of the programme. They require schools to set out the aims of the unit, its learning outcomes, how key skills are being integrated, what methodologies and assessment approaches will be taken and how it will be evaluated.New Transition Units have been developed and posted to the NCCA website in a range of areas and a guide has been produced to help schools to develop their own units in keeping with the descriptor format. Schools may forward their Transition Units to the NCCA for further feedback and support.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1128	As part of the multi-annual school building programme, the Government has invested heavily in the modernisation of school facilities throughout the country including science facilities in post-primary schools. Provision of science facilities is an intrinsic part of all major projects at post-primary level. Typically this investment involves the provision of modern science facilities in new post-primary schools or the upgrading of science facilities in existing schools either as part of a school building project or as a dedicated investment to facilitate the teaching of science. Under the current NDP, €4.5 billion will be spent on school infrastructure between 2007 and 2013.Schools have also received funding under the Summer Works Schemes 2004 -2007 to refurbish science laboratories. In the 2006 application form for the Summer Works Scheme, post-primary schools were asked to identify specifically, and provide details of, any science and technology upgrade or refurbishment projects separate from any other projects being applied for, so that consideration could be given to approving these projects for 2006. Over 60 schools were approved for funding in 2006 and 2007 under my Department's Summer Works Scheme to enable them to get science laboratories refurbished on a devolved basis.Additionally, my Department has funded the provision of class materials, basic general equipment and chemicals for practical work for the Sciences. My Department also spent in excess of €13m in 2004 to facilitate the introduction of a revised Junior Science syllabus. Schools received a basic grant of €3,500 per science laboratory to enable them to provide the new curriculum. Additional funding was made available to schools where other specified equipment was required. In addition, certain schools identified as needing new or refurbished science laboratories as a result of a 1998 national survey received funding.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1129	Schools at both primary and second level use strategies such as curriculum differentiation, curriculum enrichment and acceleration to facilitate the development of pupils who are exceptionally able.Recently devised syllabi and curricula for second-level schools have been designed in such a way to enable teachers cater for the wide range of pupil ability. The revised primary curriculum, which has been supplied to every primary teacher, recognises the importance of developing the full potential of the child and caters for pupil diversity, including meeting the needs of exceptionally able pupils.Content is outlined in the curricula at both levels and process is also heavily emphasised. Enabling children to learn how to learn is stressed and facilitated. The development of language skills, investigatory and problem- solving skills, higher-order thinking skills and working individually, and as a member of a group, are all encouraged at both levels. While the use of information and communication technologies and the use of class and school libraries are of benefit in project work with all pupils, they have a special importance for pupils who are exceptionally able.In addition, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), in collaboration with its counterparts in Northern Ireland, the Council for Curriculum Examination and Assessment, has produced draft guidelines for teachers of exceptionally able students. These guidelines issued to all Primary and Post Primary schools in November 2007 along with a questionnaire for feedback. Over the last few months the NCCA has sought feedback on the draft guidelines from teachers, school management and other interested individuals and organisations.These draft guidelines are designed to raise awareness of the social, emotional and academic needs of exceptionally able students and to assist teachers in planning their teaching and learning. They feature ways in which teaching and learning can be effectively differentiated for such students, in particular how learning skills can be embedded in increasingly complex content. Case studies included in the guidelines present rich real-life contexts which consider the issues around exceptionality through the eyes of teachers, parents and students.My Department provides annual funding to the Centre for Talented Youth at Dublin City University to support its work in delivering programmes, which are designed specifically for exceptionally able children of first and second level age. Of particular significance at second level are the International Olympiads in the science subjects, in information technology and in mathematics, in which the exceptionally able and highest achieving pupils compete.The 1998 Education Act requires Boards of Management of each school to publish the policy of the school relating to participation by students with special educational needs, including students who are exceptionally able. The measures schools take in this regard are required to be stated in the school plan. It is the duty of the Board of Management to ensure that appropriate education services are made available to such students.

Participation in the programme is supported by an enhanced pupil:teacher ratio and a once-off per capita grant.138 DEIS schools are currently providing the Leaving Certificate Applied (LCA) programme, and 370 centres are offering the programme overall, including 46 out of school centres of education. All DEIS schools are being encouraged to provide the LCA by 2010. An invitation to participate in the programme is issued to all schools each year.

It is designed to offer courses of integrated general education, vocational training and work experience.Towards 2016 set out to increase the number of Youthreach places by 1,000 by the end of 2009. In 2007, 400 additional places were allocated, bringing the total number of places to just under 3,700.  Provision has been made in the Estimates for 2008 for a further 100 places.  The distribution of this allocation is under examination at the moment.

Children's command of Irish is improved through participation in a range of activities, including music, arts and crafts and games, conducted through the medium of Irish.  The programmes are developed by teachers working to guidelines produced by the Department of Education and Science.  The scheme is run by Dublin West Education Centre in conjunction with the Primary Curriculum Support Programme.  A grant of €5420 is paid to each participating school to cover the project costs.  In 2008, funding of €160,000 has been provided to cover the costs of training the teachers and project costs for participating schools.  There are 20 schools participating in the week long course and each school has capacity for up to 36 students from 3rd to 6th class.The Gaeltacht Scholarship scheme has been established.  It is designed to enable children enrolled in designated disadvantaged post-primary schools to attend approved summer colleges for teaching Irish. Funding of €100,000 has been made available for the scholarship scheme for 2008.  Applications for the 2008 scheme are still being processed and, to date, approximately 140 have been received.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1133	The curriculum in schools is devised on the basis that ICT is not a subject but rather a tool to be integrated into the teaching and learning of all subjects. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has developed an ICT framework which sets out a structured approach to ICT in curriculum and assessment. This sets out the types of learning appropriate for students during the period of compulsory education, and provides a guide to teachers for embedding ICT across the curriculum. It will be supported by a website which will provide exemplars of teaching and learning in different settings, and show the classroom application of learning outcomes and demonstrations in the ICT framework. The overall implementation of ICT in schools is supported by the National Centre for Technology in Education which provides for extensive training and guidance for schools on the integration of ICT into teaching and learning.The European Computer Driving Licence is a widely used private sector qualification providing basic competences in a range of functions such as wordprocessing, spreadsheet, database, presentation, web browsing and e-mail. There are also other qualifications attesting to similar or higher levels of skill, some of which are included in the national framework of qualifications. The 2005 census of post primary and special schools undertaken by the National Centre for Technology in Education indicates that 75.7% of schools, and 46% of special schools, offered certification opportunities in ICT. 74% of post primary schools and 32% of special schools offered external certification, primarily using ECDL. Other awards in ICT offered included FETAC, City and Guilds, Royal Society of Arts, Microsoft, etc. Many schools offer ECDL as part of the Transition Year Programme.

As a result of the identification and review processes, 873 schools have been included in the new School Support Programme (SSP) under DEIS. These comprise 670 primary schools (urban and rural) and 203 second-level schools.The plan is being rolled out on a phased basis over the period to 2010.The following progress has been made in relation to the roll out of the action plan.In respect of the 2007/08 school year, grants amounting to approximately €10 million issued to the 670 Primary schools which are participating in the DEIS Initiative. Almost €5 million was paid in the course of the year in respect of the 203 Post Primary schools participating in the initiative and 76 Post Primary Schools receiving grants under pre-existing schemes. Also approximately another 1,900 primary schools received almost €4 million of grant assistance to assist them with their respective levels of dispersed disadvantage.2006 saw the implementation of targeted class size reductions of 20:1 in junior classes and 24:1 in senior classes in 190 urban/town primary schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.In the 2006/2007 school year access to teacher/co-ordinator support for any of the rural primary schools, not already in receipt of such support under a previous measure, was implemented.The roll-out has seen the extension of literacy and numeracy programmes, including Reading Recovery and ready set go, maths for schools in the urban primary strand of DEIS and the commencement of the family literacy project under which 7 projects have been selected for support.25 schools have been selected to join the Junior Certificate School Programme (JCSP) in 2008, which is in addition to the 28 schools which joined the JCSP programme in September 2007. 138 DEIS schools are currently providing the Leaving Certificate Applied (LCA) programme. It is intended to have all DEIS schools providing LCA by 2010.Templates for three year action plans to support school planning were introduced into schools in the primary strand of DEIS during autumn 2007. Planning templates will be introduced in DEIS post primary schools in the coming school year. The Department has commenced an evaluation of measures under DEIS that will continue over the period to 2010.Under DEIS, Home/School/Community liaison and School Completion Programme services have been extended to any of the urban/town primary schools and second-level schools not already benefiting from them.An additional 80 posts were provided under DEIS for the expansion of HSCL and in the region of €30 million has been allocated to HSCL for 2008. 184,000 pupils attending 651 schools (281 post primary & 370 primary) have access to Home School Community Liaison, with approx. 50,000 of these pupil's families being specifically targeted for the services of 450 local Home School Community Liaison Coordinators.€31.160 million has been allocated to the School Completion Programme. 124 projects, targeting over 36,000 young people, are now participating in the School Completion Programme and spanning 26 counties.The 124 projects includes 81 projects originally selected to participate in SCP in 2002 and 43 new SCP clusters created in 2006/07 including the new DEIS schools. An evaluation of the SCP is scheduled to take place in 2008 in order to measure the effectiveness of interventions in place in tackling early school leaving, to identify models of good practice and to inform future policy in relation to appropriate integration of SCP, along with other programmes, within the DEIS framework.

Grants of €1.65m and €1.7m issued to schools in December 2006 and December 2007 for the cost of test materials, teachers' manuals, test scoring services or test-related software. It is intended that the implementation of standardised testing at school level will be complemented by a separate programme of national monitoring so that national trends in different categories of school can be tracked over time. Schools in the DEIS programme have already been sampled by the Educational Research Centre for this purpose, and the sample of non-DEIS English and Irish medium schools is planned for 2009.Guidelines on assessment developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment were published in October 2007 to assist schools in developing and implementing a policy on assessment practice in classrooms and on reporting to parents.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1136	I propose to take Questions Nos. 668 and 736 together.The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) as the national body with responsibility for school attendance.  The Act provides a comprehensive framework, promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving.  The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.Educational Welfare Officers (EWOs) are appointed and deployed throughout the country to discharge the Board's functions locally.  EWOs employ a welfare oriented approach in the interests of the children and young people who do not attend school regularly, working collaboratively with schools and other agencies in meeting the needs of the children and the young people concerned.Up to the end of May 2008, the total number of cases on hands with the Board for 2008 was 6624.Approval in 2007 for 15 additional staff brought the authorised  staffing complement of the Board to 109.  12 of these new posts were allocated to service delivery and 9 of these posts have been filled to date with a recruitment process ongoing to fill the remaining posts.NEPS is a service funded by the Department of Education and Science. NEPS psychologists work with both primary and post-primary schools and they are concerned with learning, behaviour, social and emotional development. Each psychologist is assigned to a group of schools. NEPS psychologists specialise in working with the school community.  They work in partnership with teachers, parents and children in identifying educational needs. They offer a range of services aimed at meeting these needs, for example, supporting individual students (through consultation and assessment), special projects and research. I can inform the Deputy that the number of educational psychologists employed by NEPS currently stands at 137.Following a national recruitment competition organised by the Public Appointments Service, a panel of suitable candidates has been formed. Currently some 33 panellists have been offered specific appointments within the NEPS regional structure, some 30 have accepted the post offered and of these 13 have passed through the requisite Garda vetting process and are finalising arrangements with my Department's Personnel Section.It should, however, be remembered that the service provided by the NEWB and NEPS are just two aspects of the comprehensive framework that this Government has put in place to improve school attendance and encourage more young people to finish school.In this regard, extra supports targeted at young people in disadvantaged areas include both educational initiatives such as intensive literacy programmes and the provision of breakfast and homework clubs.  In fact there are currently in excess of 600 staff within the education sector with a role in school attendance. Home School Community Liaison Coordinators, in working with parents, promote school attendance and its importance for success in school. School attendance is a central objective of School Completion Programme with attendance tracking a core feature and one of its preventative strategies. Access to these services is being increased with the continued roll-out of services under DEIS the Action Plan for tackling educational disadvantage.Work is ongoing to develop appropriate protocols for all agencies and services to work together and to ensure that optimum use is made of the resources deployed.  I would like to assure the Deputy that through increased investment and improved services this government is determined to optimise access, participation and educational outcomes at every level of the system. It will continue to do all that is possible to ensure that every child gets all the opportunities and support they need to enable them to achieve their potential and participate fully in education.

Based on consideration of this report and discussions held with the Education Partners, my Department has been drawing together proposals to facilitate implementation of the remaining sections, including the provisions in respect of assessment and individual education plans (IEP). The time taken to finalise proposals reflects the complexities involved, the need for consultation across the wide range of people and sectors involved, the need to align with the requirements of the Disability Act, 2005 and define how the Health Service Executive (HSE) and NCSE will work together under both acts. These proposals are being considered in the context of the 2009 estimates process.A Cross-Sectoral Team, comprising representatives from my Department, the Department of Health and Children, the NCSE and the HSE, is currently developing operational protocols to outline how the two sectors will interact.In addition, the Special Education Appeals Board (SEAB) was established in April 2007, under section 36 of the EPSEN Act 2004, to hear and determine appeals pursuant to a number of sections of the Act. The Board is continuing to identify the resources and processes it will need to put in place to ensure that it will be ready to fulfil its role once the relevant sections of the Act are commenced.In parallel with these processes, my Department has also advanced a number of areas relevant to the implementation of EPSEN:Proposals for preschool assessment services developedCollaboration with the Department of Health and Children in relation to the establishment of the Standards BodyRecruitment of additional staff for the Council and staffing review of the NCSERecruitment of educational psychologistsReview of the scheme for commissioning private assessmentsPublication of agreed standards for assessmentContributing to assessments under the Disability Act.As the EPSEN Act does not provide for phased commencement by age cohort the education sector must be in a position to provide the required services to all children before the relevant provisions are commenced. My Department's priority, therefore, is to ensure that the necessary training, guidance and supports are in place to facilitate the commencement of the remaining sections of the Act.The Programme for Government commitment  to improve post-primary provision for children with special educational needs is being progressed in the context of the proposals for the implementation of the EPSEN Act. The Deputy may wish to note that the development of the "Inclusion of Students with Special Educational Needs: Post-Primary Guidelines" published by my Department's Inspectorate in June 2007 is a key component of the preparation for the roll-out of the EPSEN Act in post-primary level schools. These guidelines, which were circulated to all second level schools, advocate a whole-school approach to effectively meet the educational needs of special needs students. Practical advice and guidance are provided on the organisation and co-ordination of resources to maximise the support to each individual student.Furthermore, in preparation for the statutory introduction of the individual education plan (IEP), the NCSE has published guidelines on the IEP process and a copy issued to all primary and post primary schools at the commencement of the 2006/2007 school year. These guidelines provide advice and assistance to schools, teachers and parents on devising and implementing individual education plans. It is intended that schools will use these guidelines to develop school practices and procedures in relation to individual education plans in advance of the mandatory requirement for them to do so.I would also point out that, during this necessary period of preparation and planning for the roll-out of the EPSEN Act, my Department continues to expand capacity and services for students with special educational needs across the schools network through the work of the National Council for Special Education.

Funds are allocated to VECs who are the main statutory providers of ESOL training. Currently, there are approximately 100 VEC colleges, 10 Prison Education providers, 100 Post-Leaving Certificate (PLC) colleges, 100 Youthreach centres and some community groups providing ESOL classes.Between 1997 and 2007, funding for adult literacy has increased from €1m to €30m and in the same period, the number of participants has increased from 5,000 to over 44,000. Of these 44,000 participants, over 13,000 are ESOL students.An independent review has been commissioned to assist in the development of a national English language training policy and framework for legally-resident adult immigrants based on extensive stakeholder consultation. This is due for completion in the Autumn.

Programmes are offered on a part-time basis: in the mornings, afternoons, evenings or at weekends.There is a commitment in the Programme for Government to expand the number of BTEI places to 10,000 by 2009. 1,000 additional BTEI places were allocated in 2007 and funding has been made available in 2008 for an another 500 places which will bring the total number of places to 9,500.Since its inception in 2002, funding for the BTEI has increased from just over €6m in 2002 to €18m in 2007. With effect from 1 September 2007, BTEI eligibility criteria were amended to allow free tuition to any adult with less than an upper second level education. Originally only people with a social welfare entitlement or medical card were entitled to free fees.The Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) provides a full-time education option for people who are over 21 years of age and in receipt of certain social welfare payments. The Government remains committed to increase the number of places on VTOS as outlined in the Programme for Government.

While this funding has allowed for some expansion in the sector, there has been a growing emphasis on consolidating current provision.The 2008 provision of €52.6m for Youth Affairs will enable the high level of provision achieved over recent years to be maintained as well as a continued focus on the further consolidation of existing provision.With regard to the National Youth Work Development plan, steady progress has been made in the implementation of a number of priority actions, as identified by the National Youth Work Advisory Committee. These include areas such as Child Protection, upgrade of one worker projects to two-worker status, the establishment of a North/South Education and Training Standards Committee for youth work and the capacity development of youth work organisations to engage with the provisions of the Youth Work Act, 2001. Ongoing support is being provided in respect of these and other initiatives.With regard to the Youth Work Act, 2001, Section 1 provides for sections to be commenced at different stages. Sections 2-7, 17, 18 and 24 have been commenced to date.A sub-committee of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee (NYWAC), representative of both statutory and voluntary sectors as well as of my Department, has been progressing the groundwork, including the development of detailed guidelines and procedures, which are vital for the further coherent implementation of the Act. The work of NYWAC continues in this regard.Significant progress has been made since 2006 in the roll out of the Act at local level. This includes the assignment of Youth Officers and related financial support to the VEC sector.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1146	Over the seven years of the National Development Plan (NDP) €13 billion will be invested under the Human Capital Priority to develop the capacity of the higher education sector to meet a number of key national objectives, including that of increasing the numbers of students participating in the sector. The focus will continue from the previous NDP on measures targeting the increased participation of under-represented student groups, such as those from disadvantaged areas and older learners.The recurrent grant to higher education institutions supports the core activities and services of all state-aided third level institutions, including the development of access programmes, the objective of which is to encourage and support the increased access and retention of young people and adults from disadvantaged schools and communities. Funding also supports measures targeting the progression of learners from the further and community education sector, people with a disability and members of the traveller community.It has been over a decade since targeted access funding was introduced to the budgets of third level institutions. While the investment is, by its nature, a long-term one it is fair to say that so far there have been some very positive outcomes. For example, since 1998 the semi and unskilled manual group, who are a long-standing priority target group have increased their participation by at least 10%. An estimated one-third of young people from these backgrounds now enter higher education.In addition to the core funding of institutions, innovative new initiatives on the part of third level institutions to increase levels of access and lifelong learning are also being supported by the Strategic Innovation Fund (SIF). Over the course of the NDP it is planned that €510 million will be allocated to third level institutions through this fund. As a first step, in 2007 an allocation of €42 million was made and in 2008 under the second cycle of funding a further €130 million was allocated.This funding is supporting some interesting new collaborations on the part of networks of higher-education institutions focusing on the needs of learners from disadvantaged communities. A number of projects aim to significantly increase part-time and flexible learning opportunities for adults who wish to develop their levels of education and skills.Having invested in infrastructure and strategies to ensure a more diverse and representative student body, it is equally important to ensure that those students are adequately supported in their participation. The Social Inclusion Priority of the NDP commits that €2 billion will be dedicated over the period 2007-13 to address inequities in participation by students from socio-economically disadvantaged groups (including members of the travelling community and refugees); students with a disability and mature students. This funding underpins the allocations that will be made through the Higher Education Grant scheme as well as the significant reforms to that scheme that are proposed by the Student Support Bill.This priority also encompasses the Third Level Access Sub-Programme, which includes the annual allocations through three funds: the Fund for Students with a Disability, the Student Assistance Fund and the Millennium Partnership Fund. This measure also supports the work of the National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education which manages these three funds on behalf of my Department and advises national policy on access to higher education for under-represented groups.A new National Access Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2008 — 2013, which will run concurrently with the National Development Plan (from 2008-2013), was published this week. The plan examines emerging issues and challenges, including progression from further to higher education. It highlights ongoing and new areas of action, including work with institutions on the development of an ‘access plan' as an integral element of the overall strategic planning process.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1147	Yesterday, I launched the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2008-2013.  The National Access Plan will seek to encourage the broadening of entry routes to higher education institutions to greater reflect the fundamental changes being brought about through implementation of the National Framework of Qualifications.In 2007, in consultation with stakeholders, the National Qualifications Authority Ireland reviewed the extent to which new and existing transfer and progression routes are operating effectively within the National Framework of Qualifications. This review concluded that the traditional web of transfer and progression arrangements prior to the Framework is gradually evolving to take account of the changes arising from the introduction of the Framework. The NQAI has since then examined in more detail the progression routes available.The NQAI's overall objective in this area, as articulated in its policies, is to ensure that there is at least one transfer or progression route onwards from every programme leading to an award in the National Framework of Qualifications; that these routes are mapped and documented; and, that information on transfer and progression routes is made available to learners.Significant improvement has been made in the acceptance of many Level 5 Certificates for progression to programmes in the Institutes of Technology leading to higher education awards. Work is underway in relation to the acceptance of the full range of Level 5 Certificates as valid for this progression route. Progression arrangements from the Level 5 Certificate to programmes in the universities are less developed and are still in the form of specific programme-to-programme links. This is a situation where significant progress has been made in recent years and positive future development is anticipated.The arrangements for transfer and progression from those Advanced Certificates formerly known as the National Craft Certificate are currently being developed. FETAC is in the process of finalising a publication setting out the routes available into programmes provided by the institutes of technology. Work is also underway within the SIF 1 strand on education in employment — in a consortium of higher education institutions led by Cork Institute of Technology a strand on apprentice progression is to be completed by December 2008. Linked work on a new programme at level 7 which will provide another progression route for holders of the Advanced Certificate is also underway in FÁS.The main route of access to third level each year continues to be the school-leaving certificate (including access programme entrants and entrants with school-leaving qualifications from other countries).A growing number of students are also gaining access through two other main routes: on the grounds of mature years (12% of entrants); on the basis of further education awards (10% of entrants).The proportion of entrants with further education awards has grown significantly from almost 3% of acceptances in 2005 to almost 10% in 2007. This is an important access route for adult learners who form at least half the participants in the further-education sector.The NQAI, HETAC, FETAC and the Higher Education Authority continue, in their policy documents, discussions with partners and funding of institutions (HEA) to promote and support increased progression and participation on the basis of awards linked to the framework of qualifications. The evidence of increased progression by further education graduates to higher education, particularly over the last two years would indicate that the concerted efforts of all of these bodies are now bearing fruit.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1148	Under the National Development Plan 2007-2013, an envelope of close to €2 billion has been provided for investment in higher education infrastructure. At the end of the first year of the programme, implementation of this measure is progressing satisfactorily with 2007 funding used to deliver additional capacity for apprentices in 4 institutes of technology as well as equipping institutes to enable the implementation of revised curricula for apprentices.Funding was also deployed to enable a series of minor improvements works be carried out within the sector. Sites purchases were grant aided, design costs of major projects in planning were funded and large scale projects at construction were similarly supported.A sample of some large scale projects at construction that were funded include a new IT Building at National University of Ireland Cork, new Tourism and Hospitality facility at Waterford Institute of Technology, refurbishment of facilities at Limerick Institute of Technology and necessary improvements works to Dublin Institute of Technology facilities.  Funding has recently been approved for the following large-scale projects: Athlone Institute of Technology — Engineering Building €36m, Mary Immaculate College of Education — Campus Development Phase 2 €23m, Institute of Technology Tralee — Library and Information Resource Centre €9.4m, Waterford Institute of Technology — Cert/Tourism Building €24m.In addition, 17 individual projects are being progressed for delivery through the public private partnership process.The Deputy will be aware that the €2 billion referred to above is separate and discrete from planned investments in building and expanding research capacity and capabilities in higher education institutions. In this regard, NDP capital funding of over €750m has been allocated. In 2007, this funding enabled the introduction of a dedicated research equipment grant as well as the launch and approval of awards under Cycle 4 of the Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions. Cycle 4 has a capital component of €108m which will be dispersed across 13 higher education institutions and involving 36 individual capital projects that are targeted to deliver over 20,000m2 of new research facilities. In the current year, the Research Facilities Enhancement Scheme has already been successfully launched where €58m of capital investment is targeted at improving and refurbishing existing research provision within higher education institutions in the course of the year.

The HEA engages extensively with student interests as an integral part of its work. The USI plays an active role in this process and continues to ably represent its constituency.The composition of the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland is set out in Section 6 of the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999, and provides for one representative of learners. The Authority is committed to working in a participative manner and engages extensively with student and other stakeholder interests as an integral part of its work, through a variety of consultative fora.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1150	Teacher Education Section has provided for a comprehensive system of continuing professional development (CPD) for teachers in the area of special educational needs. Central to this is the "Special Education Support Service" (SESS). The Teacher Education Section of my Department established the Special Education Support Service (SESS) in September 2003. The service consolidates co-ordinates, develops and delivers a range of professional development initiatives and support structures for school personnel working with students with special educational needs in a variety of educational settings. These settings include mainstream primary and post-primary schools, special schools and special classes.The CPD provided by the SESS covers a range of specialities, including inter alia:  Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASDs); Dyslexia; Challenging Behaviour; Post-primary issues in Special Educational Needs; Specialist training for Autism Units attached to schools.As part of an initiative rolled out for the 08/09 school year, teachers can have SESS training in the area of ASDs accredited by St Angela's College in Sligo.In addition, Teacher Education Section funds several third level courses in teacher training colleges and universities. These include: Combined Post-Graduate Diploma Programme of Continuing Professional Development for Teachers involved in Learning Support & Special Education (available in seven colleges across the country)(300 places available annually); Masters in Special Educational Needs (St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra) (16 places available annually); Graduate Certificate in the education of pupils with ASD (St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra) (18 places available annually); Online Certificate/Diploma in Education (Special/Inclusive Education)(150 places available annually).In terms of training for Special Needs Assistants, Teacher Education Section currently funds a certificate for Special Educational Needs Assistants delivered by: St. Angela's college, Sligo (55 places available annually); Mary Immaculate College, Limerick (45 places available annually ); Church of Ireland College of Education, Rathmines (25 places available annually).Introductory courses are also provided through Education Centres, which can be taken as a stand alone course or as part of the above-mentioned certificate.  In total it is estimated that over 20,000 places will be provided to teachers for Continuing Professional Development in Special Educational Needs in 2008. Special Needs Assistants availed of almost 530 places in 07/08.

Under VTOS, full-time courses of one or two years duration are provided to participants to enhance their employability.The Back to Education Initiative (BTEI) provides part-time Further Education programmes for adults to give them an opportunity to combine a return to learning with family, work and other responsibilities. People with disabilities are one of the target groups of the programme.Adults with disabilities may also avail of adult literacy courses provided by VECs around the country. A grant has been provided to the Irish Deaf Society to train tutors to give literacy tuition and a grant is awarded annually the Dyslexia Association of Ireland as a contribution towards assessments.An action research pilot project is continuing in a number of Further Education Colleges in the Dublin area. This project is supported by three Disability Support Officers, the National Training and Development Institute and flexible additional funds for transport, equipment, interpreters, etc. The service identifies and offers support to students and staff around the area of disability. The provision of awareness-raising sessions and participation in college open and recruitment days is also an integral element of the role of the Support Officers.My Department is also currently working with the National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education and the Association on Higher Education and Disability (AHEAD) to address special education needs of adults in further education. In 2006/2007, a total of 2,444 students with disabilities attending third level and further education accessed funding through the Fund for People with Disabilities which is administered by the Higher Education Authority. The total amount provided to students through this fund was €9.987 million. Of this €1.745 million was allocated to 279 students in the further education sector.In February of this year, AHEAD, in conjunction with the National Council for Guidance in Education (NCGE) launched a Handbook for Guidance and Information Officers on disability issues in Further Education.In June 2007, building on earlier conferences, a workshop on adults with intellectual disabilities was held at which key stakeholders shared their experiences and discussed possible ways forward for the development of services for people with intellectual disabilities. A scoping paper on the parameters of provision for adults with disabilities in adult education and lifelong learning was received in February 2008. This is forming part of the consideration and development of an overall policy to address special needs and disability in Further Education.

The allocation for school transport in 2008 is €175 million. This upward pressure on costs will undoubtedly continue due to the anticipated rise in overall transport costs in the years ahead.  This issue has been under consideration as part of the arrangements with Bus Éireann for the operation of the school transport scheme for the 2008/09 academic year. I will be making an announcement shortly.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1153	My Department is currently finalising proposals for progressing the commitment given in the Programme for Government to review the school transport system including catchment boundaries.In the meantime, the terms of the post-primary school transport scheme will continue to apply. A pupil is eligible for transport if s/he resides 4.8 kilometres or more from her/his local post primary education centre, that is, the centre serving the catchment area in which s/he lives.Pupils who are eligible for transport to the education centre in the catchment area in which they reside may avail of ‘catchment boundary' transport to an education centre in another catchment area provided spare seats are available on the school bus.Information is not readily available on the number of applications received from educational interests in each county over the past two years. However, reviews of specific catchment boundaries may be carried out where appropriate.  A number of reviews have been carried out over the years where, for example, a new post-primary school is established in an area where previously there was none or, conversely, where a "sole provider" school closes due to declining enrolment.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1154	To address special educational needs and provide the necessary supports for learners in Youthreach centres, my Department introduced the Special Education Needs Initiative (SENI) in 2007.  The SENI was introduced to 25 groups of 25 learners across 20 Youthreach centres.The SENI involves a general allocation model similar to that introduced in the primary sector in September 2005.  It is team based and caters mainly for students with high incidence needs.  The SENI provides for the allocation of increased staffing hours (from 4,200 to 5,700 hours per group per year) to deal with the special needs and disabilities of all the students.Additional training was provided to staff in the centres to enable the introduction, on a centre team basis, of a range of professional practices to support students with special educational needs/disabilities.  This training followed on from the national introductory training programme introduced into all centres in 2006.  In addition, the 20 centres have access to a password protected internet site containing guidelines, tailored training programmes and other materials.During 2007, an evaluation was carried out on the SENI to determine its suitability and effectiveness for the learners.  The findings of this evaluation were generally positive and found the new initiative to be meeting the needs of learners.  My Department is currently examining the possibility of rolling out the SENI to other Youthreach centres, subject to the availability of funding.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1155	As part of the expansion of the Small Schools Scheme 2006, a grant of €484,000 was sanctioned for the school in question to enable the Board of Management to extend and refurbish their school.The scheme is not intended to leave schools with significant fund-raising needs.  Rather the terms of the Scheme require the schools to tailor the scope of capital works commissioned to the available funding.  The decision on whether to continue participating in the scheme or to drop out, if the scope of build is more than the funding envelope permits, is a matter for each school authority.  A central tenet of the devolved scheme is that the school, granted discretion and funding, must equally accept responsibility for prioritisation, adherence to statutory regulations, as well as control of costs and ensuring value for money.The school authorities submitted an appeal for significant additional funding which was considered in my Department.  However, in line with the original intention of the Small Schools Scheme, it was considered that the school should be encouraged to complete the project within the funding envelope provided and, accordingly, the application for additional grant aid was not approved.In the current economic climate and with considerable demands on the capital budget of my Department, it is not possible to approve such significant increases in the amounts grant aided to schools.  It is the responsibility of the school authorities to manage the resources allocated to them to ensure maximum value for money and to control costs.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1156	Data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy indicates that the pupil enrolment figures on 30th September for the past three years and mainstream class teachers allocated are as follows:YearNo.2004167Staffing 2005/06 Principal + 5 Mainstream Class Teachers + 2 additional mainstream posts2005148Staffing 2006/07 Principal + 5 Mainstream Class Teachers + 1 additional mainstream post2006173Staffing 2007/08 Principal + 6 Mainstream Class TeachersAdditional mainstream posts were retained on the staffing of the school for the 2005/06 and 2006/07 as part of a proposed amalgamation process involving the school at that time.Schools have flexibility in the way in which they assign pupils and teachers to classes and the Department does not allocate teachers to specific classes or age groups.  The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30th September of the previous school year.  The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.Posts allocated on the basis of this staffing schedule are specifically for mainstream classes and should be deployed accordingly.  School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment).  In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year.  Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure.  If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.According to data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school, the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2007 was 177 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0010/2008), which is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie and a hard copy of which has been issued to all primary schools, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2008/09 school year will be a Principal and 6 mainstream class teachers.The Board of Management of the school submitted an application seeking the appointment of one additional mainstream class teacher for September 2008 under developing school criteria.Provisional sanction for the 7th mainstream class teacher was given by the Primary Payments Section of my Department in a letter to the Chairperson on 28th April 2008 based on a projected enrolment of 197 pupils.The projected enrolment for September 2008 will be reviewed in October 2008.  It will be necessary for the Board of Management to confirm in writing to Primary Payments Section the actual enrolment achieved in the school on 30th September 2008.  The letter must reach Primary Payments Section within 5 days of 30th September 2008.In the event that the projected enrolment is not reached it is open to the Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools.  Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule.  The criteria are also available in Circular 0024/2007 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) which is available on my Department's website.  The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.

This includes applications for the establishment of special classes.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.Responsibility for enrolment to these classes rests with the individual school authority.  The qualifying criteria for enrolment in speech and language classes is outlined in my Department Circular 0038/2007 — Criteria for Enrolment for Pupils with Specific Speech and Language Disorder (SSLD), Appendix 1, which may be accessed on my Department's website, www.education.ie.I can confirm that there are currently 60 special classes for children with specific speech and language disorder in primary schools nationwide.  The classes operate at a pupil teacher ratio of 7:1.  The Health Service Executive funds the provision of speech and language therapy services for the children attending these classes.In circumstances where a child who meets the criteria for Specific Speech and Language Disorder as outlined in my Department Circular 0038/2007 and who is not enrolled in a special class for SSLD may qualify for additional teaching support where he/she is enrolled in mainstream school.  Applications for such support may be made to the NCSE through the local SENO.  Pupils with mild speech and language difficulties may qualify for supplementary teaching support from within the school's general allocation of learning support/teaching support.All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.  I have arranged for the details supplied by the Deputy to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.

Sections 2-7, 17, 18 and 24 have been commenced to date.A sub-committee of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee (NYWAC), representative of both statutory and voluntary sectors as well as of my Department, has been progressing the groundwork, including the development of detailed guidelines and procedures, which are vital for the further coherent implementation of the Act.  The work of NYWAC continues in this regard.Significant progress has been made since 2006 in the roll out of the Act at local level.  A structure for the resourcing of VECs to carry out the functions set out for them under the Youth Work Act, 2001 was agreed between my Department and the Irish Vocational Education Association (on behalf of the 33 VECs) in July 2006.  This structure provided for the appointment of a number of Youth Officers (21.5 posts) to be shared by 25 VECs and outlined the salary scale and functions of the posts.  In addition, existing posts in the remaining eight VECs were re-desingated as Youth Officer posts.I will determine further sections of the Act for implementation, having regard to the advice of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee, as the necessary procedures are finalised and as resources permit.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1161	Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) forms a mandatory part of curriculum provision in primary schools and in junior cycle.  The overall aim is to help develop students' confidence and self esteem, and promote the skills for living, for responsible decision making, and for mental, physical and emotional health and well-being.  The junior cycle syllabus for SPHE includes a specific module on Substance Abuse.The implementation of these programmes in schools is supported by full-time support services at primary and second level which provide professional development for teachers and advice and support to schools.  The second level support service is operated jointly with the Health Sector.  A range of resources are available to support the programmes.  These include the Walk Tall Programme at primary level, On My Own Two Feet at post- primary level, the Teacher Guidelines for SPHE developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, a Substance Misuse Prevention Information Booklet for schools and parents, Guidelines for Developing a School Substance Use Policy, including a policy template, and links and references to relevant websites.The SPHE Support Service also provides support and assistance to schools in the development of their Substance Use policies, and offers a resource directory, which includes the materials of the Teaching Advisory Council on Alcohol and Drugs Education in England.  Copies of these materials were made available to the network of Education Centres around the country by the support service.A senior cycle programme in Social Personal and Health Education is being developed by the NCCA.  A draft curriculum framework has been published, and consultations have been completed on it.  I look forward to receiving the recommendations of the Council on the matter at an early date.  Substance Use will be one of the five areas of study planned for the programme.In addition to this, the Transition Year Programme, which is available to schools on an optional basis provides a flexible menu of options designed to further support pupils' personal and social development, to provide a bridge between junior and senior cycle and to offer a broad educational experience which can aid the maturing process.  As part of this, there is scope for schools to offer alcohol and substance misuse programmes.While education has a role to play in addressing the problem of alcohol misuse, behavioural change will not happen without the support and co-operation of parents, the drinks industry and society as a whole.  Parents have a responsibility to help children and young people to adopt sensible and responsible attitudes and behaviours in relation to alcohol.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1163	At the beginning of 1965 new rules entitled "Rules for National Schools under the Department of Education" were introduced by the Minister for Education with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  This version of the Rules for National Schools has subsequently been updated, amended and supplemented by circular letters.  The Rules for National Schools, together with Department Circulars constitute administrative measures governing the recognition operation, management and conduct of national schools.  While the Rules for National Schools and associated circulars are non statutory they are lawful measures which have been judicially considered and accorded the imprimatur of the Irish Courts on a number of occasions.The Education Act 1998 provides the Minister with the power to make regulations relating to a range of issues concerning the provision of education by schools.  Rather than engage in an exercise to revise the existing rules I favour the incremental use of those regulatory powers where appropriate to replace existing rules and circulars.I have begun this process through initiating steps to regulate the primary curriculum.  A draft Statutory Instrument and Regulatory Impact Screening document was issued in March to the partners in education for consultation.  My Department is examining the feedback on this at present and a decision on the next steps will be taken as soon as possible.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1164	As the Deputy will be aware, the general allocation model was introduced in primary schools in September 2005 to ensure that each school has learning support/resource teaching support available to meet the needs of children with high incidence special educational needs. The review is currently underway and is expected to be completed early in the next school year.The issue of allocation policies at post-primary level is being considered in the context of the proposals for the implementation of the remaining sections of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004.  The Deputy may wish to note that my Department's "Inclusion of Students with Special Educational Needs: Post-Primary Guidelines" advocate a whole-school approach to effectively meet the educational needs of special needs students.  The guidelines, which were published in June 2007 and circulated to all second level schools, provide practical advice and guidance on the organisation and co-ordination of resources to maximise the support to each individual student.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1165	The total number of administrative principal posts at primary level in the 2005/06 and 2006/07 school years were 981 and 1,043 respectively.The post of administrative deputy principal was introduced for the first time at primary level in the 2006/07 year and there were 23 appointments in that year.  Data in respect of the current school year is currently being compiled by my Department and is not yet available. The source of this data is the Annual Census of Primary Schools. Data will become available when returns for all schools have been processed.The recruitment of a teachers is managed at local level by individual Boards of Management and my Department does not have information on anticipated appointments by these management bodies.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1166	My Department does not operate a debt relief scheme for schools. However a small number of schools have sought assistance as an exceptional matter to deal with serious financial difficulties.Between 2002 and 2006, additional financial assistance for this purpose was provided to a total of 97 schools, mainly serving disadvantaged areas.  In 2002, 26 schools received approximately €341,000. In 2003, 25 schools were allocated a total of €519,000.  In 2004, €108,000 was given to 10 schools. In 2005, 32 schools shared a total of €784,000; and in 2006, just over €112,000 was paid to 4 schools.During the same period, the following numbers of schools sought assistance:2002 — 27 schools;2003 — 27 schools;2004 — 33 schools;2005 — 43 schools;2006 — 52 schools.It should be noted that the responsibility for sound financial management of  schools' affairs rests with school authorities and these were exceptional payments. Funding to schools to cover their day-to-day running costs has increased substantially in recent years.With increases in capitation and ancillary services funding, primary schools are now getting €105 more per pupil per year than they were in 2002. The capitation grant has been increased to €178.58 per child, and the ancillary services grant has risen to €151.50 per child, bringing the total value of both grants to €330 per pupil. This amounts to almost €100,000 a year for a 300-pupil school.There have also been significant improvements in recent years in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools. With effect from January 2008, the standard per capita grant was increased by €15 per pupil and now amounts to €331 per pupil. In addition, voluntary secondary schools have benefited by the increase of €15 per pupil in 2008 in the support services grant bringing that grant to €204 per pupil.The cumulative increase of €30 per pupil in a voluntary secondary school brings the aggregate grant to €535 per pupil. These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to €40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services.For example in the case of a secondary school with 500 pupils, this brings annual grants towards general expenses and support service to over €300,000.  Budget allocations for schools in the Community and Comprehensive school sector along with those in the VEC sector are increased on a pro rata basis with increases in the per capita grant. All schools are eligible for recurrent per capita grants towards special classes and curricular support grants.  Schools have, therefore, benefited from major increases in funding in recent years.The Deputy will be aware that as well as general increases in capitation funding, extra financial supports are being provided to schools under the DEIS action plan for educational inclusion. In the current school year, DEIS related grants totalling almost €19 million were paid to schools to meet the needs of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. The comparable amount paid for 2006/2007 was almost €17 million.The Government will continue to prioritise the needs of schools serving disadvantaged communities going forward. The emphasis on tackling educational disadvantage in recent years is absolutely unprecedented. In 2008, we are investing over €800 million in measures aimed at tackling disadvantage at all levels. This represents an increase of nearly €70 million on the 2007 figure and an almost 74% increase on the €460 million provided in 2003.As well as continuing to prioritise disadvantaged schools, we are also determined to ensure that both primary and post-primary schools benefit from increased funding over the lifetime of the Government. The Programme for Government contains a specific commitment to double the standard capitation grant for primary schools. Grants to schools for the employment of secretaries and caretakers will also be increased significantly.In summary, therefore, we have substantially increased funding for schools and will prioritise further improvements in the years ahead.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1167	There were seven new schools that looked for an advance of the capitation and ancillary services grants in 2007. All seven received half the capitation grant and their full ancillary services grant at that time.All new schools receive an ancillary services grant in October each year to cover the cost of employing a secretary and/or caretaker for the months from September to December, as the grant payable in March is designed to cover these costs in the calendar year.My Department is currently looking at the funding of new schools having regard to budgetary constraints. There are new arrangements in place involving funding to the recognised management body for the opening of new schools under a particular patronage as distinct from additional funding to individual school boards of management. This additional funding is available to the management bodies recognised by my Department and is related to the number of new schools established under the patronage which the particular management body serves. The funding is deliberately scaled upwards to reflect the greater level of activity and support a management body has to give when it is involved with several new schools in any year and where those schools are of significant size.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1168	In the education sector, vetting is currently done in respect of newly appointed teachers via the initial registration process with the Teaching Council. It is also done for prospective employees for posts that involve working with children such as Special Needs Assistants (SNAs), bus drivers, bus escorts to children with special needs, caretakers and other ancillary staff.As the expansion of service by the Garda Vetting Unit is rolled out my Department will be consulting the relevant stakeholders such as school managers and the unions on how best to introduce vetting of existing teachers and other education staff working with children.Ensuring the protection, health and welfare of children is a key concern for this Government, for parents, for agencies that work with children and for society generally. To this end, the Programme for Government provides for a proposed amendment to the Constitution which will further strengthen our ability to protect our children by allowing the Oireachtas to legislate for the exchange of information that is not confined to information on criminal convictions. The Programme is committed to putting in place the necessary structures and systems to increase cooperation on vetting and the exchange of all relevant information about those who work or seek to work with children and vulnerable adults.Furthermore, there is a commitment to provide extra resources to the Garda vetting service and also to develop an all-Ireland approach to child protection. It is important to recognise that though vetting is a vital and important process that at present can alert a prospective employer about a criminal record of a prospective employee who will be working with children, it has to be complemented through a general vigilant approach by the employer when recruiting particularly though checking references with previous employers and probing any gaps in an employment record. This is as important for individual schools employing personnel as it is for any other employment where the care of children is a concern.I can assure the Deputy that this Government is determined to do all that we can to keep our children and vulnerable adults safe.

The projects to be provided in rapidly developing areas in 2008 were also announced at the same time. Of those 18 large-scale projects, 12 are currently on site with the remainder due to go to construction as soon as possible. It is anticipated that 15 of these projects will be completed by September 2009, with the remainder as soon as possible thereafter.The Developing Areas Unit is advancing the delivery of 26 new school buildings and a number of smaller-scale projects which are planned to be in place for September 2008. These projects are being delivered in areas which have been identified as areas of rapid population growth.  My predecessor announced the details of the individual projects in February. To deliver its 2008 programme, the Developing Areas Unit has been working closely with relevant Local Authorities on the acquisition of sites and on general pre-planning issues.  50% of the capital budget of almost €600m for 2008 had been expended on school infrastructure at the end of June 2008. Of the total number of large-scale projects under construction at the beginning of the year, 33 have reached practical completion stage.

The sites in question range in size from c.4 acre sites for primary schools to c.10 acre campus sites for primary and post-primary schools. However, due to the commercial sensitivities attached to site acquisitions it would not be appropriate for me to provide information on the cost of these sites at the present time. Payments are made as appropriate to the Fingal County Council.For the new academic school year commencing September 2008 the Department is providing a number of new school buildings in Fingal as follows: Three new school buildings for new schools commencing in 2008 in Skerries, Swords and Phibblestown; Five new school buildings for existing schools in Balbriggan (3), Porterstown (1) and Lusk(1), four of  which are currently in temporary accommodation and one of which is on a restricted site; One new school building for an existing school in Tyrellstown on its existing  temporary site which is shared with another school.Provision of further schools under the Fingal School Model Agreement is on-going and the acquisition of further sites will be progressed commensurate with demand for school places in Fingal.

This voluntary Agreement provides for the establishment of a three year €18m joint Government-IBEC/TIF Fund, with industry contributing €5m per annum and the Government contributing €1m per annum. To date the receipts to the Fund comprise the State's contributions of €3m and €8.03m from IBEC/TIF contributing members.The Programme has three elements — local connectivity to schools, a national broadband network and a broadband support service desk. Schools connectivity is being routed to the Internet through a national broadband network, which is supported by HEAnet and provides centrally managed services for schools such as security, anti-spam/ anti-virus and content filtering. The broadband support service desk has been established to interface between the network, the local broadband service Access Providers and schools. It is managed by the National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE). The total costs of the Programme for the first three years, including the initial set-up costs, are some €30m. The funding Agreement with TIF, which provides for the €18m Fund, is to meet the local connectivity element of the Programme costs.The Agreement with TIF provides for the appointment of a Programme Evaluator to independently evaluate progress on the deployment of broadband access to schools and the impact of such deployment in schools over the period of the Schools Broadband Access Programme. The Terms of Reference for the Programme Evaluator were agreed with TIF in February 2008 and following a public procurement process, Norcontel (Ireland) Ltd has been selected to undertake the evaluation. The final evaluation report is expected to be completed by August, 2008.As the Deputy will be aware, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has launched the Next Generation Broadband Policy Paper which includes the objective of equipping second-level schools with 100Mbits per second of broadband connectivity and installing local area networks. I look forward to working with my colleague, Minister Ryan, in the pursuit of this objective. Furthermore, my Department will shortly issue a Request for Tenders for the next round of service under the existing Schools Broadband Programme and having regard to the general developments in broadband availability nationally, improved service offerings are expected to be received under the new tender process.Having written to TIF, my Department expects to meet with them shortly.  I would like to acknowledge the co-operation and contribution of TIF to the Schools Broadband Programme to date and I look forward to developing the partnership into the future.

Based on payment details the following number of assessments have been undertaken in schools to date:YearNo.2001/022,8782002/034,3602003/043,6112004/053,4882005/064,0842006/074,3932007/084,107 (to date)In common with many other psychological services, NEPS operates a staged model of service to schools, whereby an initial referral usually leads to a consultation and provision of advice to teachers and parents on appropriate teaching and management strategies. Progress is kept under review and only those children who fail to respond to these interventions will need to see a psychologist. This allows the psychologists to offer early appointments to children who are in urgent need of support and early advice to teachers in respect to those children whose needs are perhaps less pressing but who still need additional help in school.  The following relates to the number of named pupils referred to NEPS psychologists in the period, not all referrals involved full cognitive IQ assessments:YearNo.2001/022,9782002/034,6342003/044,6992004/055,0232005/064,9392006/075,6912007/083,830 (to date)The 2007/08 figures are currently being updated by NEPS psychologists and do not represent the full total for that year.  Neither do the figures include a count of the number of pupil applications processed by NEPS psychologists under the Reasonable Accommodation for Certificate Examinations (RACE) programme on behalf of the State Examinations Commission — which in 2006/07 amounted to 2,798 individuals.In addition it is estimated that NEPS psychologists give consultations, advice and assistance to teachers and school authorities in respect of an additional 5,000 unnamed pupils per annum.

As stated in April by my predecessor, it is intended to commence Section 30 of Teaching Council Act later this year. Thereafter only registered teachers will be entitled to be paid on an ongoing or open-ended basis.I also intend to provide for the use of unregistered personnel where this is a last resort for schools and work is ongoing in my Department to formulate the best manner in which this can be time limited.The move to mandatory registration of teachers will be an important factor in progressively ensuring a fully qualified and registered teaching cohort.  54,870 teachers are currently registered with the Teaching Council.  This figure does not include 3500 teachers (approximately) that have graduated from teacher education programmes in 2008 and are commencing the process of registration this month.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1182	Over 75% of pupils are in classes of less than 30 pupils. Preliminary indications from my Department's analysis of statistical returns from schools for the current school year appear to indicate that there has been a drop in the numbers of pupils in classes of over 30 pupils. The analysis of all the returns from schools has yet to be completed and the final outcome will be published later in the summer.  With over 20,000 individual classes spread across all schools throughout the country there will always be differences in individual class sizes.The Programme for Government sets out the overarching policy position in relation to the provision of additional teachers and on reductions in class size over the life of the Government.The Programme contains a commitment to increase the number of primary teachers by at least 4000 and on that basis to make further progress on reducing class sizes.Budget 2008 provided my Department with €4.6 billion or €380 million extra for teacher pay and pensions. This was a very substantial level of additional investment in the terms of the economic environment on which the budget was based. That allocation provides for paying for over 2000 extra primary teachers more than the number in schools when the Government took office last Summer. It covers the additional teachers that went into schools last September for the previously announced reduction to a 27 to 1 based staffing schedule along with additional teachers this school year and in the coming school year to meet increasing enrolments, to provide for special needs and the language requirements of newcomer children.This means that in terms of the overall commitment to provide at least 4000 additional teachers the Government in its first two years in office will be well ahead of target.All Programme for Government commitments to improve public services including those relating to class size are contingent on the economic and budgetary environment and the need for prudent expenditure and fiscal management. Even since the presentation of Budget 2008 last December there have been significant alterations in the external and domestic environment. In that context any reasonable observer would regard the fact that the Government has already taken measures that will see the allocation of over 2000 additional teachers to primary schools as a considerable investment all things considered.

The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement.The Deputy may be further aware that the current Programme for Government commits to providing, over the term of this government, a central database of suitably trained personnel seeking employment as home tutors. My Department is considering what are the most appropriate arrangements and any related resource requirements for the implementation of this commitment.The Deputy will appreciate that, as home tuition takes place outside of the normal school framework, there is need to ensure that tuition providers are appropriately qualified to give education to the children concerned. The usual requirement is a fully qualified teacher. However, other qualifications are acceptable depending on the individual needs of the child. A list of relevant qualifications may be sourced on my Department's website on www.education.ie.  The current hourly rate of payment is €43.25 for a qualified primary teacher and €48.39 for a qualified post primary teacher.  Tutors who are not qualified teachers are paid at a rate of €27.55 per hour.

While the specific information requested by the Deputy in relation to pupil numbers is not available, I can confirm that there are currently 10 special classes for pupils with hearing impairment attached to mainstream primary schools, 1 special class at post-primary level and 3 special schools. An enhanced capitation grant is provided to the special schools and special classes with hearing impaired pupils and grant-aid is available towards the special equipment needs of pupils. The 2008 rate for children with hearing impairment is €857 per pupil, while for profoundly deaf children it is €880 per pupil. The pupil teacher ratio in these special classes is 7:1.In line with my Department's policy that children with special educational needs (SEN) access appropriate education intervention in mainstream settings where possible, many deaf/hearing impaired pupils are integrated into mainstream classes at primary and post-primary level with the assistance, as necessary, of resource teaching and special needs assistant support.The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has commissioned an external, high-level review of the issues surrounding deaf education. This review will focus on models of provision with reference to evidenced-based outcomes and the implications of adopting different approaches. It is expected that the review will be completed before the end of the year.

Applications for SNAs may be considered by the NCSE where a pupil has a significant medical need for such assistance, a significant impairment of physical or sensory function or where their behaviour is such that they are a danger to themselves or to other pupils. A pupil's level of care may diminish over time as the child matures. Pupils may move to a different school or on to post-primary school. In such situations, the NCSE will review and adjust the SNA support required in the school. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.The NCSE will undertake to review a decision taken by a SENO on foot of a request from a school or parents/guardians, when accompanied by relevant additional information, which may not have been to hand at the time of the decision.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1193	Circular 044/2007, issued in July 2007, requires all schools to provide the minimum recommended tuition in English in Irish medium primary schools, beginning no later than the start of the second term in Junior Infants.The revised primary curriculum was launched in 1999 after extensive consultation with the partners in education. Page 27 in the Introduction to the Curriculum states "It is a particular feature of Irish primary education that children, from the beginning of schooling, have experience of language learning in two languages."Fundamentally, this issue is about access by all children to the full national curriculum. My Department's policy in this area, which has been set out in replies to Parliamentary Questions, is that all schools, including Irish medium schools, should provide the minimum recommended instruction time in English in the infant classes of 2.5 hours per week. There are compelling public policy reasons why an "a la carte" approach to curricular provision should not be encouraged. The current debate is about availability of English at the early stages of primary schooling but one could readily see why similar arguments could be advanced in relation to the required provision of other areas of the curriculum.  It is also quite likely that delaying the introduction of English would have the effect of deterring the enrolment of disadvantaged and special needs pupils which would run counter to the State's policy of maximum inclusion.The issue of the circular is currently subject to Judicial Review. In addition, my Department has undertaken a consultation process on proposals to prescribe the primary curriculum by regulation.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1194	I propose to take Questions Nos. 742 and 743 together.This issue relates to the impact of providing an immersion model of education in Irish medium schools under which no English is taught for a significant part of the infant cycle.There are a range of studies which highlight the effectiveness of immersion approaches to language learning. However, the precise models of immersion in use, whether this applied to the exclusion of other languages, the socio-economic profile of students, their home linguistic background, and the national context and level of societal use of the immersion language in the studies are not always clear and make comparisons difficult with the situation in Ireland.  A review of literature in this area undertaken on behalf of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment in 2006 concluded that "existing international research is not adequate to decide the reading sequencing issue clearly in the context of Irish immersion, either in a general way or in particular schools."There is an extensive body of research available on immersion education internationally, with over one thousand studies having been undertaken in Canada alone. Notwithstanding this, the NCCA concluded that the research available was not adequate to come to firm recommendations applicable in the Irish context, and accordingly recommended that research be undertaken on a range of models, with different Irish medium schools taking different start dates for the introduction of English.It has also been demonstrated that practices in Irish medium schools vary considerably. For example, both An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta ("An Chomhairle") and the NCCA highlight that there are varying practices in Gaelscoileanna with regard to the teaching of English.  Information collated from Department of Education and Science inspection reports on 74 Gaelscoileanna mirror these findings.  Of the 74 schools, it was found that 45 schools (61%) taught English to junior infants from the beginning and a further 9 schools (12%) introduced English at some stage in the junior infants.  Fourteen schools (19%) introduce English during senior infants and the remaining six schools (8%) do not introduce English until the children are in first class.  Research published by An Chomhairle, conducted by Ó Duibhir and Ní Bhaoill, found that 58% of Irish-medium schools began formal instruction in Irish reading first, 36% introduced English reading first and the remaining 6% introduced Irish and English reading simultaneously.  Other issues would have a bearing on the research relate to the socio-economic profile of pupils, levels of parental support for education, the level of community support for the first and second languages, the home language of students, and parental support for the acquisition of literacy skills in English.  Given the complex range of variables at play, allied with the fact that extensive international research was unable to provide clear direction applicable to the Irish context, the Department concluded that a single study in the Irish case would be unlikely to demonstrate conclusively that educational outcomes could be isolated and attributed solely to the impact of a particular form of immersion provision, in effect 100% immersion vis a vis a 90% model.  In any event, research will, by its nature, focus on but one subset (learning impact) of what is a significantly wider public policy matter.The fundamental public policy issue in this case concerns upholding the rights of all children to access the full curriculum from the earliest possible stage.

The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children with Special Educational Needs awaiting an educational placement and provide early education intervention for pre-school children who have been assessed as having autism. The grant provides for ten hours home tuition per week for each child with autism aged between 2.5 and 3 years of age. This increases to twenty hours per week on the child's 3rd birthday if a placement in an early intervention unit is not available.The Deputy will be aware that the NCSE is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for processing applications from primary, special and post primary schools for special needs supports on the basis of applications in respect of individual pupils. The SENOs operate within the policy outlined in my Department's circulars for allocating such support.Each SENO works in an assigned local area with parents, schools, teachers, psychologists, health professionals and other staff who are involved in the provision of services in that area for children with special educational needs. All schools have contact details of their local SENO. It is also open to parents to contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs and contact details are available on www.ncse.ie.The Visiting Teacher Service for Children and Young People with a Hearing or Visual Impairment is provided by my Department from the time of referral through to third level education.  The Visiting Teacher service provides advice and support to ensure that the needs of children and young people with hearing and visual impairment are met.  This service is available at pre-school, primary, post-primary and at third level.  Details regarding the Visiting Teacher Service, including a referral form, are available on my Department's web-site www.education.gov.ie.Officials in my Department have requested details from the Deputy's office in respect of the circumstances of the child in question and on receipt will liaise directly with him in this regard.

Courses delivered cover a range of disciplines and interests. A significant element of UCD's outreach activity is the provision of the Access to Arts and Human Sciences programme, which is at foundation certificate level. The other course which was provided by UCD in Baldoyle in 2007-8 was a short course in Literary Classics.UCD reviewed its operations on the north side of Dublin following low participation in courses in the Baldoyle outreach centre. Following this review, UCD has secured a new northside location for its outreach activities. The university hopes that the new location will encourage greater participation in education in UCD by northside communities, including from members of the community in Baldoyle.Trinity College Dublin established the Trinity Access Second Level Programme in 1993. The programme aims to increase the entry and participation rates at third level of under represented socio-economic groups through targeted and developmental outreach activities.Greendale Community School, Dublin 5, had been a link school of the Trinity Access Programme until the closure of the school in the summer of 2007. Greendale students that have moved to other designated disadvantaged (DEIS) schools following closure of the school will have the opportunity to participate in activities offered by the partner higher education institution. All DEIS schools and a number of non-DEIS schools are linked with at least one higher education institution access programme and, in some cases, more than one (for example a university and an institute of technology).My Department is managing a focused programme of investment for equity of access to higher education. Over the seven years of the National Development Plan (NDP) €13 billion will be invested under the Human Capital Priority to develop the capacity of the higher education sector to meet a number of key national objectives, including that of increasing the numbers of students participating in the sector.My Department works closely with the National Access Office of the HEA to co-ordinate and develop national policy and implement funding measures to facilitate greater educational access and opportunity for groups who are under-represented in higher education — those who are disadvantaged socially, economically and culturally, mature students and students with a disability.The recurrent grant to higher education institutions supports the core activities and services of all State-aided third level institutions, including the development of access programmes, the objective of which is to encourage and support the increased access and retention of young people and adults from disadvantaged schools and communities.New targets along with the necessary steps to achieve these targets are outlined in the recently-published National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2008-2013.

My Department does not have any involvement in this process.When an applicant for registration applies to the Teaching Council with a qualification other than those automatically recognised by the Council (previously by the Department of Education and Science), their qualifications are assessed against established criteria previously drawn up by the Department and subsequently adopted by the Teaching Council.Under Council Directive 2005/36/EC (general system for mutual recognition of professional qualifications), an EU citizen who is recognised as a post-primary teacher by another EU/EEA country may seek similar recognition in Ireland. The same rules of recognition as apply to Irish citizens apply to such applicants. However, while awaiting a final decision on his/her application for full recognition, the teacher will be granted provisional recognition in this country. This will entitle him/her to the same remuneration and conditions of employment as apply to a recognised teacher in Ireland. The suitability of his/her qualifications must still be assessed for post primary teaching in this country.Where, during the assessment, shortfalls are identified in the courses of study undertaken leading to the academic and professional qualifications held by the applicant, the applicant for recognition will then be required to demonstrate an adequate knowledge of the areas of the shortfall.  The applicant may choose to address this either by way of an aptitude test or by way of an adaptation period. The aptitude test consists of a written examination in the subjects of the shortfall. The adaptation period is 3 years in the case of degree shortfalls and 15 months in the case of a teacher-training qualification. The provisional recognition will be withdrawn if the chosen option is not completed satisfactorily within the permitted timeframe.I have made enquiries with the Teaching Council regarding this case and will forward the information I receive to the Deputy as soon as possible.

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  I have arranged for the details supplied to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.

Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters.  My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.  This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act.  In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion.  In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful.  In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000.Where a Board of Management refuses to enrol a student in a school, the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student himself or herself, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science.  A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality.  In most cases appeals must be dealt with within 30 days.  Where appropriate, the Secretary General may give whatever directions to the Board of Management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of.The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  The NEWB can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.

In the case of schools the Government agreed that the overall number of teachers and special needs assistants in schools would be agreed by my Department and the Department of Finance.In summary these measures are about facing up to and dealing with the problems we face in a considered and balanced manner.

There has been an unprecedented level of spending on the programme to date with over €250 million spent since 1999.  This year will see a further €26 million invested in the programme.  As a result of this significant increase in the building programme, consultants with appropriate expertise are engaged by the Department as necessary to provide technical services in connection with building and engineering projects. It should be noted that (as per Comptroller and Auditor General, Report on Value for Money "Consultancies in the Civil Service" 1998) such design and engineering consultancies for capital projects are better examined in association with the construction projects to which they relate. The Department spends approximately €2m annually on Construction Consultants Fees.

Participation in the Transfer Network is voluntary and Aer Lingus decided to become a member of the Network with effect from 1 June 1973.  As a result, the Company is obliged to reckon all prior pensionable service in the case of its employees who left other member organisations on or after that date and subsequently joined Aer Lingus.  As a member of the Network, it was also open to Aer Lingus to reckon prior service in the case of its employees who left other member organisations before 1 June 1973.  In the event, Aer Lingus decided to reckon such service only in respect of former members of the Permanent Defence Force who had service during the Emergency Period (1939-1946) or during the period 9 September 1968 to 31 May 1973.  The significance of the earlier date mentioned is that Aer Lingus was approved on 9 September 1968 as a designated organisation for the purposes of the Superannuation and Pensions Act 1963 — which was the forerunner of the present Transfer Network.While the part-time service in the Reserve Defence Force (RDF) of the person in question did not end until October 1970, his full-time pensionable service in the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) had ended in October 1967 on his transfer to the RDF.  Service in the PDF is full-time and pensionable whereas service in the RDF is generally non-pensionable.  Consequently, neither his pre-September 1968 period of service in the PDF nor his post-1967 service in the RDF is transferable to Aer Lingus.  The Company is, however, willing to accept for pension purposes a period of full-time service in aid of the civil power rendered by the person in August/September 1969 as a member of the RDF.The question of amending the rules governing the transfer of service for pension purposes is a matter for the Minister for Finance to whom, I understand, a separate Question has been put down.

However, the status of the mother of the person concerned is not such as would enable her to make a Family Reunification application in respect of her son. For the Deputy's information, applications for Family Reunification can only be accepted from persons who have been recognised as refugees or persons who have been granted Subsidiary Protection in the State.In light of the minor status of the person concerned, I will arrange to have a representative of my Department write to the person concerned in the coming days to advise him on possible courses of action vis-à-vis his position in the State.

Various reports have been sought and are currently awaited by this Department from bodies in this Jurisdiction.The Convention and the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995, requires extensive documentation to be exchanged between both jurisdictions in order to allow an application to be fully considered.  A three way consent is also required to enable any transfer to take place, i.e., from the authorities of both jurisdictions and from the person concerned.  On receipt of those consents (assuming they will be forthcoming), an application must then be made to the High Court for a warrant authorising the transfer of the person concerned and his continued detention here.  On receipt of the High Court Warrant arrangements are then made for the transfer of the prisoner.  Applications for transfer to Ireland can take approximately eighteen months to process.These procedures are required under the Convention and the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995, and must be adhered to in processing each application.  I should also advise the Deputy that the Convention does not confer an automatic right on any person to be transferred nor does it impose an obligation on any State to comply with a request for transfer.

The Court uses a multi-disciplinary approach and involves a range of Government Departments and agencies charged with dealing with various aspects of the problem of drug misuse.The Court operates with the assistance of a team which includes the judge, a probation and welfare officer, an addiction nurse, a Garda liaison officer and education/training representative and counsellors.  My Department is currently examining the operation of the court and officials are looking at best practice elsewhere to see how the Court's rather low throughput levels might be increased.  Subject to the Exchequer situation, there are plans to extend the concept to the rest of the Dublin Metropolitan District Court area on a phased basis and discussions with other agencies are ongoing in this regard.A number of sentencing options are already available to judges in relation to drug treatment.  Section 99(4) of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 permits a court to suspend a prison sentence on certain conditions, some of which are mandatory while others are at the court's discretion including a condition that the person undergo appropriate treatment for drug, alcohol or substance addiction.  In addition,  section 28 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 permits a court to remand persons convicted of certain drug related offences and, on foot of a court ordered medical report, to arrange for the medical treatment or care of such persons.

As indicated in the replies to Parliamentary Questions 9121/08 and 14079/08 on 4 March and 17 April 2008 respectively, any significant extension of Garda search powers beyond those already available in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 and the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996 gives rise to consideration of highly sensitive issues, including ones of Constitutional importance. In this regard I have in mind, for example, Article 40.3 (personal rights) and 40.5 (inviolability of a dwelling). My aim is to ensure in so far as possible that any new powers will be capable of withstanding Constitutional scrutiny. Accordingly I am unable to say at this stage when proposals will be available.

In addition, eleven officials from the Revenue Commissioners have been trained as asset profilers.The use of local Garda officers in this way ensures that preparatory groundwork can be carried out in advance of a full investigation by the Bureau. Asset profilers have at all times recourse to the expertise and advice of the Bureau.Essentially a key function of these profilers is to ascertain and build up information at local level and point out individuals at whom the Bureau's work can be targeted. Such information is then investigated and followed up further by the Criminal Assets Bureau.

Accordingly, any decision to replace the existing units does not arise at this time.As part of any future procurement, An Garda Síochána will examine the required specification for the new handsets taking into account all existing technologies in order to provide with the most secure and economically advantageous means of connecting the devices to the required central systems as operational needs demand.  The estimated cost and rollout schedule for these new devices will not be available until the requisite business case has been developed.

The claim was assessed by the Refugee Applications Commissioner who concluded that the person concerned did not meet the criteria for recognition as a refugee. The Commissioner's recommendation was communicated to him by letter dated 9 January 2007. This communication advised the person of his entitlement to appeal the Commissioner's recommendation to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, which he duly did.The Refugee Appeals Tribunal considered the person's appeal, following which the Tribunal affirmed the Commissioner's earlier recommendation to reject his claim. The outcome of the appeal was made known to the applicant by letter dated 24 June 2008.In accordance with normal procedures, the applicant's file has been forwarded to my Department's Ministerial Decisions Unit for final processing of the Asylum claim. A letter will issue to the person in question from my Department formally advising that his asylum claim had been rejected and affording him three options as follows:1. Return home voluntarily2. Consent to the making of a deportation order, or3. Make written representations to me within 15 working days for temporary leave to remain in the State and/or make an application for subsidiary protection under the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (SI No. 518 of 2006)

I am pleased to inform the Deputy that already five hundred and twenty-six staff have moved, representing 56% of the final target.  My Department now has a presence in all of the seven locations designated for occupation by its staff under the Programme.Out of this total, sixty-four staff have moved with their posts. One hundred and eighty-eight have moved from other public service posts in Dublin and two hundred and fifty-six from posts outside Dublin.  The balance of eighteen staff were recruited directly.As regards the technical and professional grades, ninety posts are scheduled to move under my Department's programme and, to date, fifteen of these posts have relocated.  Two hundred and thirty-nine administrative posts, at Executive Officer grade and higher, have moved with forty-six people opting to relocate with their posts.I am also pleased to report that all the business units which have decentralised under my Department's programme continue to operate in a highly efficient and effective manner in their new locations.

Of these cases, two were upheld, seven were not upheld, four were withdrawn and three are ongoing.The outcome in five cases was subject to review.  The original decision in one case was overturned, two were upheld and two are ongoing.One Assistant Secretary, who has since retired, and one Principal Officer conducted reviews in the three cases that have been completed.Where a person seeking a review is represented by their Trade Union, the agreement of the relevant Union is secured.  Where an officer is not so represented, the practice is to appoint a reviewer who has previously conducted a review(s) by agreement with a Trade Union.

The area also receives additional patrols from personnel attached to the District Detective Unit, Divisional Task Force, Divisional Traffic Unit and the Community Policing Unit.  I am further advised that the opening of a new Garda Station in the Clongriffin area would be incompatible with contemporary policing policy in the Division and would result in valuable Garda resources being diverted from outdoor, operational policing to indoor administration duties.Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.  The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available, the needs of Coolock Garda Station and the Dublin Metropolitan North Division will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda Stations throughout the country.

It is an intelligence led policing initiative, the focus of which is the targeting of active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting their criminal activity through extensive additional overt patrolling and static check points by uniform, mobile and foot patrols, supported by armed plain clothes patrols.The Operation is augmented by other Garda initiatives, both locally and nationally.The estimated cost of Operation Anvil, including the cost of overtime, travel and subsistence and other ancillary costs, from June 2005 to the end of June 2008 was in the order of €100 million.The following table provided by the Garda authorities shows the outcomes from Operation Anvil up to 29 June, 2008 in the DMR. Operation Anvil outside the DMR differs from the DMR, in that operations are focused on shorter periods of time and are designed to address, in a flexible fashion, the particular needs of specific areas. Outside the DMR up to 1 June, 2008, 765 firearms were seized, and 19,119 arrests were made.All figures are operational and subject to change.Operation Anvil in the Dublin Metropolitan Region up to 29 June, 2008

I am informed by the Garda authorities that Operation Safeguard took place from 13 June to 18 June, 2008.Offences targeted in particular through Operation Safeguard were offences relating to licences, in particular provisional driving licence and permit holders driving unaccompanied and/or failing to display an ‘L' plate; vehicle insurance; road tax; the NCT; lighting; the use of seat belts and child restraints; driving when holding a mobile phone; and driving when intoxicated.I have requested a Garda report on the Operation, and I will contact the Deputy again when this report is to hand.

Among other things that Act provided for the new verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity which replaced the special verdict of guilty but insane at common law. I have no plans to review the matter.I should say that the provisions of the Act were generally well received in both Houses of the Oireachtas, especially the provision in question. It had long been recognised that the former verdict is a contradiction in terms. In its new formulation the verdict takes better account of the fact that the defence of insanity in the criminal law marks a crucial boundary between those whom the law considers responsible, and therefore answerable for their conduct, and those who are not responsible but require medical/psychiatric care or treatment.

This may occur as part of specific road traffic law enforcement activity or general policing activity.  Members of An Garda Síochána carry out planned and unplanned checkpoints, including those carried out under Operation Anvil and mandatory alcohol testing checkpoints.I am informed by the Garda authorities that it is not possible to provide the information requested by the Deputy without a disproportionate expenditure of Garda time and resources.An Garda Síochána continually conducts enforcement initiatives to reduce road fatalities and serious injuries, increase driver awareness, promote an improved compliance culture amongst the road-users and prevent and detect breaches of road traffic and transport legislation.  As part of this, An Garda Síochána have undertaken in the recent past targeted campaigns directed at the use of alcohol and drugs by drivers, non-wearing of seatbelts and compliance by heavy goods vehicles.  Mandatory alcohol testing checkpoints operate in conjunction with general enforcement of drink driving legislation.  Specific enforcement initiatives take place during periods such as Christmas, New Year, St Patrick's Day and bank holidays, when there is an increased risk of deaths and serious injuries on our roads.As part of its ongoing enforcement activity, An Garda Síochána plans to increase, as part of a multi-agency approach, enforcement in the area of road haulage, so as to identify unlicensed haulage activity and non-compliance by road hauliers with relevant legislation.  In this regard, a series of specific three day operations will commence on 15 July.

Following a cooling off period in accordance with standard procurement  procedures, the intention is that An Garda Síochána will shortly commence contract discussions with the preferred bidder.  A roll-out of the network of cameras would commence following conclusion of a contract.  Roll-out would involve a service start-up phase, which would include drawing up policy and procedures by the service provider and their approval by An Garda Síochána; service testing, following which the Garda Commissioner would issue a service commencement certificate; and roll-out of the service until operating at full capacity.Every effort is being made to proceed with the project as speedily as possible.  However, I am not in a position to indicate a specific timescale for the project until the contract discussions are concluded.In addition to the camera network, significant resources are being provided to enforce road traffic law and thereby increase road safety.  As well as increases which have taken place in personnel for the Traffic Corps, there has also been a significant increase in the financial resources provided for road traffic equipment, including for the replacement and upgrading of current mobile speed detection equipment and the introduction of an automated number plate recognition system.

The RIA has not provided accommodation to the person referred to as this person's husband in the details supplied since March 2004.The person referred to in the details supplied had been accommodated at Eyre Powell centre along with her two children.  She has frequently been absent from this accommodation for periods of time and has received warnings from the RIA and the centre manager at Eyre Powell in relation to this.  The RIA currently accommodates almost 7,000 asylum seekers across its portfolio and there is a continued demand for bed spaces for newly arrived asylum seekers.  Where it has come to the attention of the RIA that a person is not making use of their accommodation, that accommodation will be allocated to persons who will avail of it.It is in this context that, following the issuing of warnings from the RIA and the centre manager, the accommodation was eventually deemed abandoned in this instance.  A letter issued from the RIA to this effect on 3 July 2008.  The Deputy may wish to note that the person referred to in the details supplied presented to the RIA for re-accommodation on 8 July 2008 and refused an offer of accommodation at Athlone accommodation centre.

Both of the children have initiated Judicial Review Proceedings challenging the determinations of the Refugee Applications Commissioner in their cases.  As the Judicial Review Proceedings are ongoing, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the cases at this time.

Responsibility for funding care-related costs rests with the HSE.  Each local authority has statutory responsibility for addressing homelessness in their area, including emergency accommodation.  In the Dublin area, the Homeless Persons Unit, which is administered by Community Welfare staff of the Health Service Executive, also delivers a range of welfare services to homeless persons, including placement into emergency accommodation on behalf of the local authorities.The addresses of all the hostels used to accommodate homeless persons in the four Dublin local authority areas are listed in the Homelessness Directory 2007 — 2008, published by the Homeless Agency, which co-ordinates services to homeless people in the Dublin area, and on the Agency's website www.homelessagency.ie.Presuming that the Deputy's question concerning inspections relates to homeless accommodation, I understand from Dublin City Council that properties used to provide emergency accommodation for homeless people must be inspected and passed by a local authority Environmental Health Officer and satisfy all health and safety and fire regulations.With regard to the property in question, following an inspection it was found to be no longer suitable for use as accommodation for homeless people and its use for that purpose was discontinued at the end of 2007.  Details of the numbers of homeless people accommodated in this property in 2006 and 2007 are not held in my Department.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1312	I refer to the reply to Question No. 236 of 14 May 2008.The Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines for Planning Authorities were published in April 2005, and have a statutory basis as they were issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000. The Guidelines are designed to achieve a balance between a good planning framework for rural housing and the local housing needs of those who are part of, or have links to, local rural communities.In a circular letter issued in May 2005, planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála were asked to put in place the required procedures and practices to implement the policies set out in the Guidelines as quickly and effectively as possible.  My Department also held two seminars for local authority planning officials on the implementation of the Guidelines.  While respecting the need to consider each planning application individually and on its own merits, planning officials were asked to ensure that the provisions of the Guidelines are applied consistently and uniformly.All planning authorities were also requested to take immediate steps to review their development plans so as to incorporate any changes necessary to promote consistency with the policies set out in the Guidelines.  This has been done, with some authorities varying their plans and others incorporating the Guidelines into the reviews of development plans.The Guidelines are a material consideration both in relation to development plans and in the consideration of planning applications.  Detailed application to particular planning cases is, however, a matter for the planning authority concerned or An Bord Pleanála, as appropriate.My Department will continue to monitor implementation of sustainable rural planning policies to ensure appropriate consistency in the application of guidance across all counties.

Appendix C to these Guidelines sets out, inter alia, further considerations for planning authorities in the preparation of development plans in Gaeltacht areas such as demographic, economic and cultural factors, as well as particular facilities appropriate to Gaeltacht areas and the administrative and management structures that might be required.  These guidelines were issued under section 28 of the Act, which requires planning authorities to have regard to them in the performance of their functions.  The Guidelines are available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie.  The provisions of the Act and the statutory guidelines provide a strong legal underpinning of Gaeltachta and the Irish language in planning law.I am also a member of the Cabinet Committee on Irish and the Gaeltacht which held its first meeting on 10 April 2008.  I will work with my colleagues to ensure that the Committee's programme of work is advanced, including the implementation of any necessary actions in the area of planning, to protect our linguistic and cultural heritage.

Accordingly, in common with all developments, social and affordable housing projects must meet the relevant requirements of the Building Regulations.The Building Control Acts 1990 to 2007 assign primary responsibility for compliance with the Building Regulations to the builders and owners of buildings.  Responsibility for enforcement of the Regulations is vested in Building Control Authorities who are empowered to carry out inspections of buildings and initiate enforcement action, where appropriate.  In addition, local authorities have been advised to take the necessary steps to monitor construction of social and affordable housing acquired under Part V agreements to ensure appropriate standards and the requirements of the Building Regulations are met.

In summary, they are based on the sum of the site costs at existing use value, actual construction costs as agreed between the local authority and the developer, plus reasonable profit.In the case of units provided under the 1999 Affordable Housing Scheme and the Affordable Housing Initiative, the acquisition costs are not related to market value as these are generally constructed on land owned by or given to the local authority.  Additionally, in the case of certain 1999 Scheme units purchased directly from developers or in the direct procurement exercise operated by the Affordable Homes Partnership, substantial discounts on the prevailing market rate are achievable because multiple purchases are made.I am not aware of instances where affordable housing units have been acquired at anything more than their market value at the point of purchase.

It is a matter for local authorities to decide on the specific level of funding to be directed towards each of the schemes, from within the combined allocation notified to them by my Department, and to manage the operation of the schemes in their area from within this allocation.My Department recognises the role of the Housing Adaptation Grants in facilitating the continued independent occupancy of their own homes by older people or those with a disability. The revised schemes are designed to ensure that available funding is targeted at lower income households and those whose accommodation needs are greatest. In the context of the revised schemes, my Department introduced a number of features to assist local authorities in streamlining the associated administration processes. These include the introduction of panels of contractors, in order to assist applicants in obtaining quotations in a timely manner, and lists of standard costs for different types of works commonly applied for.200020012002200320042005200620072008€€€€€€€€€Carlow County Council275,000429,167534,190306,480321,503480,767722,0321,174,2111,191,450Cavan County Council739,7751,800,2623,134,4013,009,6511,746,5421,555,9781,942,1931,130,9661,150,890Clare County Council582,7422,008,649966,090731,3621,216,0971,645,7041,457,1561,286,3401,308,060Cork County Council Nth830,435967,2932,920,4122,289,959831,7941,685,1961,960,4931,932,6061,962,090Cork County Council Sth1,255,9062,049,9012,127,4821,395,0001,159,5012,026,2312,399,4262,509,7692,545,140Cork County Council West700,531735,8801,870,2922,961,532995,000819,5181,139,106991,4091,008,930Donegal County Council2,148,6183,447,9905,967,2455,467,8512,542,5102,828,6743,463,4204,186,0474,248,660Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council691,623965,0251,193,6551,761,4291,603,6301,424,6121,594,3821,867,9401,896,180Fingal County Council504,0161,126,6251,636,315819,9381,278,5271,202,9901,328,8991,554,1101,576,770Galway County Council1,893,8132,598,4383,440,8111,870,7722,571,2171,978,4411,934,4281,795,1181,820,130Kerry County Council658,1231,250,6831,887,7551,325,438965,3721,772,9132,415,8042,551,7612,590,770Kildare County Council1,043,9961,269,1951,457,8121,569,6701,092,0531,429,5491,284,4661,619,2251,642,680Kilkenny County Council409,940794,081758,700572,408664,900613,612473,823801,467816,270Laois County Council1,193,7671,108,0742,130,688814,7072,632,0741,983,9192,323,1852,601,2551,678,000Leitrim County Council1,055,7641,614,5141,814,4451,991,0022,042,0351,297,0091,282,7821,545,1261,571,700Limerick County Council464,843861,544941,945928,0081,034,0001,140,0011,107,6681,528,9701,551,420Longford County Council873,6721,252,7301,389,7241,086,400704,982619,533724,153628,049638,820Louth County Council360,945633,159825,650576,435725,1381,478,9652,663,8931,789,8771,815,060Mayo County Council874,8441,413,6691,258,3971,883,1781,530,4231,440,9281,732,1282,446,2572,484,300Meath County Council2,361,9032,695,0443,086,1201,905,7031,046,0951,748,3192,111,2072,380,0192,418,390Monaghan County Council521,451873,6091,542,1021,646,1211,358,4511,318,9601,630,5091,880,1691,911,390North Tipperary County Council532,8461,092,3261,665,195866,020756,4471,266,6771,592,4871,547,5941,571,700Offaly County Council307,352504,000462,903788,979641,9401,383,4031,234,7921,292,9031,292,910200020012002200320042005200620072008€€€€€€€€€Roscommon County Council759,9361,070,8811,880,6161,719,3261,634,9141,764,4701,447,3391,652,9331,678,170Sligo County Council459,314458,6051,111,667620,605241,449284,566225,712484,371491,790South Dublin County Council1,373,1702,468,5972,011,7162,657,5472,396,8713,687,7642,729,7153,933,5003,990,090South Tipperary County Council770,5241,097,0442,074,825972,2551,981,5211,537,1231,690,2281,323,5931,343,550Waterford County Council363,465752,4271,004,916934,7601,368,181994,0211,616,7611,497,5841,500,000Westmeath County Council347,089755,000822,1271,274,1731,283,268994,1421,145,6901,437,4821,460,160Wexford County Council297,528788,6981,148,182991,071836,792810,5901,178,4852,010,8582,043,210Wicklow County Council953,643926,8461,746,3541,479,2891,604,0601,566,7301,612,6371,063,6491,079,910Cork City Council486,851925,3481,623,281834,0721,350,460759,8011,073,0471,827,5391,855,620Dublin City Council5,587,0667,944,5529,726,03913,030,28210,880,37713,053,83611,438,89912,464,27712,639,510Galway City Council393,452675,981704,093965,4971,183,716662,321781,3151,031,7771,049,490Limerick City Council165,437483,988640,259663,313634,880317,776859,312702,602714,870Waterford City Council376,025515,743800,729546,000401,031457,778479,648440,937451,230Sligo Borough Council193,894355,709360,403484,593115,711175,330252,166408,444415,740Wexford Borough Council02,27130,0206,63700Bray Town Council00036,47926,0740TOTAL32,809,29950,713,54468,697,55663,783,94255,399,53660,208,14765,049,38671,320,73471,405,050

This funding has been increasingly related to actual inspection performance and it is anticipated that this will continue into the future. Finalised data in respect of 2007 are expected to show more than 14,000 inspections carried out by local authorities, an increase of 40% compared to 2006. I have no doubt that the significantly increased funding being made available to local authorities for inspection activity, and the increasingly performance-linked basis for allocations, are contributing significantly to the much improved inspections regime in recent years.

The City Council has also been in discussions with the developer, the project boards, and stakeholders from these communities in moving the projects forward.With regard to the project at O'Devaney Gardens, it is understood that discussions are ongoing with the developer, and the City Council is considering all available options including mediation as a means of bringing the matter to an acceptable conclusion.  As no contract was agreed with the developer in relation to the Dominick Street project the procurement process is ongoing, and again the City Council is reviewing its options.I am of the opinion that it would be premature at this stage for my Department to consider alternative financial arrangements for these projects in advance of a clear outcome to the engagement with the developer and the completion of a full exploration of the available options.

In 2004, a proposal was made to Lisney for the scrapping of the remaining plant and machinery and the metal content of the buildings on site.  Lisney then offered for sale by open tender all remaining machinery and the metal content of the buildings.  The successful tenderer was Hammond Lane Metal Company Ltd operating in association with Clearway and Eastwoods Demolition.  The final agreement was a combined sale of metal content for scrap, netted of the cost of decontaminating the meltshop area of the plant.  The decontamination and demolition of the buildings on site is now complete.Post-demolition, large amounts of waste material remained on the site.  Significant quantities are of inert and reusable brick and concrete waste, and subject to formal classification, these were crushed and used to fill voids and tunnels.  There were also large volumes of various other wastes for disposal such as metal, timber and plastic.Procurement in compliance with public procurement guidelines of a contractor for site surface clearance to dispose of such wastes was undertaken by means of direct invitation to six appropriately qualified firms.  Three firms expressed no interest, two firms submitted a fully costed proposal and one submitted a proposal without costings.  The costed proposals were evaluated on behalf of my Department by Cork County Council who have managed the site under the direction of the Department since 2003.While the two costed proposals were broadly comparable it was considered that the one from Hammond Lane Metal Company Ltd/Eastwood Demolition represented the best value for money while also having the advantage of already being familiar with the site and being able to proceed immediately.  The Department approved the recommendation that the site surface clearance contract be awarded to Hammond Lane/Eastwood Demolition in December 2006 and contract and other necessary preparations got underway in early 2007.While the vast majority of surface wastes were predominantly inert concrete, brick and metal wastes, it was recognised owing to the site's industrial legacy that hazardous wastes might be present on the surface which would require proper handling and disposal and accordingly Hammond Lane Metal Company Ltd. proposed that CTO Greenclean Environmental act as their sub-contractor.Given the proposed participation of CTO Greenclean Environmental as a sub-contractor in the site surface clearance, Cork County Council requested various information and assurances in relation to evidence of tax clearance, evidence of public and employer's liability insurance, references for similar contracts ongoing or completed and assurance regarding accidents and prosecutions by the Health and Safety Authority or the Environmental Protection Agency.  These were considered particularly important in respect of the anticipated major input that CTO Greenclean Environmental would have into the Health and Safety Plan required under Health and Safety legislation and particularly into the methodology of waste separation, classification and disposal.  These references and assurances were supplied.It is now understood that a sub-contractor of CTO Greenclean Environmental, Louis J. O'Regan, in his capacity as Secretary of Aggregate Supplies and Transport Ltd., pleaded guilty in 2005 on behalf of the company to charges of illegal dumping of waste brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions at Cork Circuit Criminal Court and the company was convicted and fined €100,000.

Exchequer funding up to the full approved project budget has been applied to the cost of the housing project in question.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1328	I propose to take Questions Nos. 892 to 894, inclusive, together.The testing and monitoring of wastewater treatment and disposal systems in respect of which planning permission has been granted is a matter for each relevant local authority.  The interpretation and application of planning guidelines in individual cases is also a matter for each relevant planning authority and An Bord Pleanála, on appeal.Clear and comprehensive best practice guidance in regard to Groundwater Protection and the Planning System was issued to all planning authorities by my Department in July 2003.  The Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines for Planning Authorities, which issued in April 2005, emphasised the need for adherence to best practice in order to protect water quality.  These guidelines were issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 which requires planning authorities to have regard to such guidelines in the performance of their functions.Septic tanks installed on or after 1 June 1992 must comply with Part H of the Building Regulations. This requires septic tanks to be so sited and constructed that they do not pollute, so as to endanger public health, any water (including groundwater) which is used as a source of supply for human consumption.  The related Technical Guidance Document provides guidance on how to comply with the requirements of Part H.Guidance on septic tank drainage systems for single houses is contained in ‘Irish Standard Recommendations S.R. 6: 1991 for Domestic Effluent Treatment and Disposal from Single Dwellings' issued by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI).  Compliance with the Building Regulations is primarily the responsibility of the builder and the owner of the building while their enforcement is a matter for each local Building Control Authority.For septic tanks serving groups of houses, ‘British Standard B.S. 6297 : 1983, a Code of Practice for the Design and Installation of Small Sewage Treatment Works', issued by the British Standards Institute applies.The EPA is currently developing a comprehensive Code of Practice on Waste Water Treatment Systems, which I understand it intends to publish under section 76 of the Environment Protection Agency Act in 2008.  This code will then be cited in the Annex to Technical Guidance Document H of the Building Regulations.A new European Standard for small wastewater treatment plants will come into force on 1 July 2009. The need for new systems to comply with this standard, together with recommended performance levels for treatment systems, has been brought to the attention of local authorities by my Department. I understand that the EPA Code of Practice on Wastewater Treatment Systems, when finalised, will refer to the relevant European Standards.In addition to the provisions set out in both the Planning Code and the Building Code regarding waste water treatment systems for single houses, the Water Services Act 2007 places a duty of care on the occupier or owner of a premises in relation to the maintenance of septic tanks.  It also requires the occupier or owner to notify the water services authority of any leak, accident or other incident relating to discharges of sewage from a septic tank, where it is likely to cause a risk to human health or safety or the environment.  Extensive powers of inspection and enforcement by the relevant local authority are provided under the Water Services Act to facilitate the implementation of this provision.Local authorities also have powers of inspection, investigation and enforcement under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts to protect water quality, including powers to serve notice on a person to take specified measures to prevent or control water pollution.  Finally, it is open to local authorities to make and adopt bye-laws to require periodic inspections of septic tanks and other on-site proprietary treatment systems under the general powers available to them under the Local Government Act 2001.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1330	In order to address the issue of accumulated backlogs of farm plastic on farms, my predecessor announced in May 2006 that designated facilities would be provided on a temporary basis by local authorities where farmers could deposit stockpiled farm plastic.In total, some 35,000 tonnes of materials were collected at these temporary facilities over the period 2006 to 2007.  Local authorities carried out the management of the collections.  A more detailed breakdown of this figure may be obtained from the local authorities.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1331	My Department has prepared a Screening Regulatory Impact Analysis on the options for transposing the EU Environmental Liability Directive.  This document is available on my Department's website (www.environ.ie).  Preparatory work on drafting the legal instrument for transposing the Directive is underway in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.  I will publish the draft instrument for public consultation as soon as possible.I do not intend to transpose the Directive so as to require operators to underwrite their activities by way of financial security, such as insurance, at this time.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1332	I propose to take Question Nos. 898 and 899 together.Ireland signed the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters on 25 June 1998.  Progress towards ratification of the Convention is closely aligned with work at EU level and, in that context, the European Union has adopted two Directives as part of the ratification process for the Convention.  These deal with public access to environmental information (2003/4/EC) and public participation in certain environmental decision-making procedures (2003/35/EC).Regulations transposing the European Communities (Access to Information on the Environment) Directive 2003/4/EC were signed and came into effect on 1 May 2007.The process to transpose Directive 2003/35/EC is well advanced with legislation completed to amend the majority of the relevant consent systems pertaining to that Directive within the Irish legislative framework.  Work is continuing on the outstanding issues, and will be finalised by the Departments concerned at the earliest possible date.Upon completion of the full transposition of Directive 2003/35/EC, I, along with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, will ensure that the instrument of ratification of the Aarhus Convention will be submitted to Government and laid before the Dáil.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1333	I refer to the reply to Question No. 39 of 9 July 2008.  The European Court of Justice issued its judgement in the case reference C-215/06 on Thursday 3 July. The case had two aspects relating to:how the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive (85/337/EEC as amended by 97/11/EC) is affected by the availability of retention planning permission under Irish legislation; andthe implementation of the EIA Directive in respect of a wind-farm at Derrybrien, County Galway.These matters are not related to the recent amendments to the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, which were debated fully in the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Heritage and Local Government and approved by the Oireachtas, in the form of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Regulations 2008.The position remains that under Part X of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and Part 10 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, a planning application in respect of a development or class of development falling within the scope of Directive 85/337/EEC, as amended, must be accompanied by an appropriate environmental impact statement.  The carrying out of unauthorised development is an offence under the Act.

Housing authorities continuously tailor their housing supply programmes to the needs of the households on their waiting lists.Notwithstanding this, the housing needs assessment process is currently the subject of reform, with the aim of putting in place a more graduated and flexible system of housing supports to meet the housing needs of applicants over their lifetimes.  This includes developing appropriate mechanisms to cater to those households who require a change in the support being provided on foot of their changing circumstances.  This approach is in keeping with the lifecycle framework introduced in the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, which has been reflected in the Government's housing policy statement — Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities.

Following consultation between relevant Departments and the Attorney General's Office, Ireland's response issued on 27 September 2007. The Commission issued a second letter of formal notice on 3 April 2008. Ireland's response to this letter is due to issue on or before 18 July 2008.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1336	European Parliament and Council Directive 2002/96/EC  on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) as amended by European Parliament and Council Directive 2003/108/EC of 8 December 2003 was transposed into Irish Law on 5 July 2005 by the Waste Management (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) Regulations 2005 (S.I. No. 340 of 2005).The WEEE take back scheme, which can into effect on 13 August 2005, has been a remarkable success.  37,812 tonnes of household WEEE was collected during 2007, a 20% increase over the 2006 collection rate.  This represents approximately 6.7 million electrical and electronic products or 8.7kg per inhabitant. This is over double the 4 Kgs target the WEEE Directive requires Ireland to achieve by the end of 2008 and indicates widespread public support for the scheme.In April 2008, the European Commission issued a letter of formal notice concerning some aspects of Ireland's transposition of the Directive.  A detailed response has been issued to the Commission.

There has been subsequent correspondence and bilateral meetings have been held with the Commission by way of clarifying aspects  of Ireland's response.The latest letter issued on 13 June 2008 to the Commission and included updates on the various waste sites, including those specifically referred to in the question. A further meeting with the Commission is expected to take place in the Autumn to consider any then outstanding matters.

These works have facilitated visitor access and the provision of a guide service. The site is currently open on a seasonal basis to visitors.My Department has been advised by the Office of Public Works (OPW), which is responsible for the day to day management of Maynooth Castle, that the provision of additional facilities is best achieved by the acquisition of land adjoining the Castle. The OPW has, however, no specific proposals at present to purchase this additional land having regard to visitor numbers at the Castle and funding priorities generally.

The City Council has also been engaged in discussions with the developer to identify the next steps in progressing these projects.  Revised proposals have been received for some of the projects and avenues for bringing the matter to a conclusion are being explored by the City Council.On all of the projects the City Council is working closely with the relevant regeneration boards, and has indicated its commitment to the remaining tenants in these areas.  In advance of the completion of the City Council's review of the options available for advancing the projects concerned, the pursuit of alternative approaches to the delivery of the projects is premature.  My Department is, however, remaining in close contact with the Council as it considers the issues arising.Dublin City Council has also undertaken to examine all of the other Housing PPP projects currently in process to determine any negative impact from the recent announcements or the current market conditions.  There has been no indication to date of any such impact and I am hopeful that this will continue to be the case.  My Department is also examining the potential implications of these events for the PPP housing programme generally and a working group has been established in that regard.  A report on the matter is expected in the Autumn.

I am required under Section 4(b)(ii) of the Habitats Regulations, 1997 to ensure that those persons who have not been located after "reasonable enquiry" are notified by means of a local newspaper advertisement and announcement on local radio.In this instance, the cost of the newspaper advertising was €11,160 for one day. The radio ads were run over a two week period and cost €50,316.00.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1346	I propose to take Question Nos. 914 and 915 together.In accordance with Section 10 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, local authorities are required to prepare development plans setting out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area over a six-year period.  Housing and settlement strategies, which form part of a development plan, are required to be prepared on the basis of defined need and to facilitate and manage appropriate levels of growth in a sustainable manner. Such need would be established having regard to, inter alia, evolving economic and demographic circumstances. Under Section 13 of the Act, a planning authority may at any time, for stated reasons, decide to make a variation of a development plan.  Revised regional population targets on foot of the Census 2006 data analysis have already been reflected in regional and local plans.To assist planning authorities in the development plan process, my Department published Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Development Plans in 2007.  These are available from my Department's website at www.environ.ie.The 2004 Regional Planning Guidelines, which are statutorily valid for a period of six years, are due to be reviewed by 2010. The updated guidelines will have regard to the National Spatial Strategy, the National Development Plan 2007-2013 and other national policy developments as well as regional social and demographic issues, economic and employment trends, and infrastructural developments and need.In February 2008, I published for public consultation draft Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas accompanied by a best practice Urban Design Manual.  A total of sixty-nine submissions were received on foot of the consultation process and these are currently being considered in my Department with a view to finalising the Guidelines later this year.

In addition, based on figures received in my Department from Returning Officers, the total annual costs for storage of the electronic voting equipment (including the cost of insurance, service charges, rates, heating, etc.) for 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007, were some €658,000, €696,000, €706,000 and €489,000 respectively. Based on recent provisional information from Returning Officers, a total of some €139,000 has been expended to date in 2008 in respect of storage of the electronic voting equipment.  Full annual cost data are provided to my Department at the end of each year, and a more definitive figure for 2008 will be available in due course.In 2007, over 60% of the electronic voting machines (4,762 in total) were moved to a central storage facility located at Gormanston Army Camp.  Costs incurred to date in respect of the movement and storage of this equipment are some €328,000.  These are largely one-off costs related to the preparation of the facility, transportation of the machines and the acquisition of storage containers.  The available capacity at this location has now been fully utilised.  A full breakdown of all of these costs is set out in Table 1.Expenditure itemCost(€m)Voting machines43.941Ancillary equipment (Ballot Modules, Programme Reading Units, PCs, trolleys, tables, etc.)2.330Awareness and Education campaigns2.566Voting Machine development, election software development/training etc.0.828Consultancy/testing0.731Miscellaneous (staff training, freight)0.924Total€51.320mLocal Storage Costs20040.65820050.69620060.70620070.4892008 (provisional figure to date)0.139Central Storage Costs0.328Total€54.336Responsibility for the security and safe storage of manual voting electoral materials (such as ballot boxes, stamping instruments, and stationery) has been a matter for the Returning Officers, who are statutorily responsible for conducting the polls.  Accordingly, similar responsibility was assigned to them in relation to the storage of the electronic voting machines and equipment.  Information on local storage and related costs is therefore provided on the basis of constituency, rather than local authority area.  Based on the figures received in my Department from Returning Officers, the total annual costs for storage of the electronic voting equipment (including the cost of insurance, service charges, rates, heating, etc.), for each constituency, are set out in the Table 2.County/CityAnnual Storage Costs (incl.

A total of 682 Dublin based posts will be transferred to four locations in the South East: Wexford (270 posts); Waterford (225 posts); New Ross (125 posts) and Kilkenny (62 posts).Of these 682 posts, 134 are from the Department's professional/technical cadre (20% of total). A further 391 posts (57% of total) are at Executive Officer grade or higher. To date 17 internal applicants have applied to move with the Department to the South East.My Department is managing the decentralisation to four separate locations in the south east and is facilitating the transfer of staff to other decentralising Departments and also releasing significant numbers of staff who have opted to remain in Dublin to other Departments under the Dublin Arrangements.The first move will be the transfer of 270 posts to Wexford in Q1, 2009. An advance office was established in Wexford in June, 2007 and 46 staff are assigned to it.  This consists of 2 staff who moved from posts within the Department, 25 staff who moved from posts in other Departments and a further 19 who were recruited or promoted to decentralise, including 1 recruited locally.  Of the 46 staff, 3 staff have moved from posts outside Dublin.The Department's new building in Wexford is under construction and is expected to be completed by end December, 2008. The accommodation will be ready for occupation from February, 2009 and the Department will then transfer the staff complement into these offices on a phased basis from Q1, 2009; 212 staff are available for the 270 posts being decentralised (79% of the numbers required) and 144 staff are now in situ in the Department.Preparations for the Wexford move have resulted in large movements of staff into and out of the Department including a 100% turnover of staff in some Business Units.  I am satisfied that the required number of staff (270) will be in situ in the Department in advance of the phased transfer to Wexford commencing in February, 2009. Implementation of the decentralisation programme is being undertaken in a manner which minimises to the greatest extent possible any significant impacts on the delivery of my Department's business agendas.My Department is operating within its authorised staffing levels of 1,319 and reports on its staffing numbers to the Department of Finance on a monthly basis.

Under these provisions, it is open to a local authority to initiate a proposal for the alteration of its boundaries. This involves preparation of a formal boundary alteration proposal by the authority concerned including financial, organisational and other implications, invitation of public submissions, and consultation with the other local authorities affected by the proposal, prior to submitting a formal application to the Minister. I understand that Waterford City Council is developing a boundary alteration application under the above legislation.The provisions of Parts 8 and 11 of the Local Government Act 2001, which would supersede Part V of the 1991 Act and which provide for the establishment of the Local Government Commission, have yet to be commenced.In this regard it should be noted that the Green Paper on Local Government, Stronger Local Democracy — Options for Change sets out options in relation to the Local Government Commission, and discusses the related issue of local authority boundary changes. The Green Paper is currently the subject of a public consultation process which will remain open until July 31.

The facility at Carranstown has had approval from An Bord Pleanála and the EPA for some years.  In October 2007 An Bord Pleanála approved an increase in the capacity of the plant from 150,000 tonnes per annum to 200,000 tonnes per annum.The planning and waste licensing processes operate independently and I am specifically precluded from involvement in a matter for which the An Bord Pleanála or the EPA have statutory responsibility.My Department and I hold regular consultations with stakeholders in the context of the ongoing implementation of Government policy on waste management. Consulting widely, with a range of stakeholders, is designed to ensure that my Department and I have as full as possible an understanding of the issues and concerns of stakeholders and are therefore in a position to address them, where it is possible and appropriate to do so.On 12 February 2008 my Department met with representatives of the proposers of the project in question.  The latter had requested the meeting to outline their proposals in relation to this facility and another proposed facility at Ringaskiddy. My Department took the opportunity to outline my position on incineration, which I have stated many times on the record, including in relation to the key role envisaged for Mechanical and Biological Treatment and the need therefore to ensure that there was not over-capacity in the treatment options available for the residual waste.There was, of course, no question of these discussions comprehending matters proper to the physical planning or environmental licensing processes from which I, and my Department, are precluded from involvement.The Programme for Government clearly sets out the approach to waste management that will be reflected in national policy in the years ahead. It is firmly grounded in a continuing commitment to the waste hierarchy with a renewed drive towards the achievement of international best practice in the reduction, re-use and recycling of our waste. This, coupled with an increasing emphasis on technologies for the mechanical and biological treatment of waste, will significantly reduce potential reliance on landfill and incineration.

Provisional data indicate that there were some 23,569 completions in the first five months of 2008.On the basis of population forecasts prepared for my Department, it has been estimated that some 600,000 additional homes may be required over the nine-year period up to 2015, and my Department's housing policy statement, Delivering Homes Sustaining Communities, was predicated on demand of that order of magnitude.  While my Department does not engage in long term forecasts of housing supply, it commissions an annual independent review and outlook report on the construction industry and, as part of this, an estimate of housing output in the following year is prepared. This year's report, containing an estimate of housing output in 2009, is currently being prepared and will be published in the Autumn.

The  policy statement  sets out a vision  to guide the  transformation of the Irish housing sector over the medium term, by delivering more and better quality housing responses and by doing this in a more strategic way, focused on the building of sustainable communities.  Having adopted the Bristol Accord definition, its implications are reflected in the policy statement itself, in terms of the measures to be progressed in pursuit of the sustainable communities objective.

This requirement expressly covers impacts from artificial lighting. While a very limited number of planning authorities have included objectives in their development plans in relation to the minimisation of light pollution, it is open to authorities to address this issue in the context of providing for the proper planning and sustainable development of their areas through their development plans.Under Section 34 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, planning authorities may attach such conditions to the grant of planning permission as they consider necessary for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area.The guidance document Recommendations for Site Development Works for Housing Areas, dated November 1998, is currently being reviewed by my Department to bring it in line with the sustainability agenda. The 1998 recommendations include a section on public lighting in housing areas and in the current review the opportunity will be taken to assess recommendations to avoid light pollution. When finalised, the revised recommendations will be made available to planning authorities.The public awareness campaign focusing on climate change —  the Change Campaign — has two key and overriding imperatives: firstly to change how people in Ireland think about climate change, and secondly to encourage everyone to change their behaviour patterns and play their part in tackling climate change.   The current phase of television advertisements, the website www.change.ie and the carbon calculator, in particular, are designed to raise awareness of carbon footprints and include encouraging people to switch off unnecessary lights.

The Department of Finance's Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies addresses, inter alia, the responsibilities of the Boards of state bodies in relation to procurement.  More specifically, the National Public Procurement Policy Framework has been brought by my Department to the attention of local authorities and all state bodies under the aegis of the Department, and I am not aware of any particular anomaly in this area.

Capital expenditure is being reduced by €40 million mainly in areas where expenditure has been less than expected in the first half of the year or where capital spending has not begun as in the case of the Gateways Innovation Fund. Current expenditure is being reduced by €8.3 million to reflect administrative and other operational efficiencies to be achieved this year. I am satisfied that key services and programmes will be delivered within the funding levels available this year.

My Department is working closely with the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), Bord Gáis Éireann, ESB and other suppliers to ensure a fully cohesive approach to address the challenges of energy affordability and fuel poverty.One of the root causes of fuel poverty is the legacy of older housing with poor energy efficiency standards.  Sustainable Energy Ireland's (SEI) Low Income Housing Programme was established to systematically address this legacy problem.  The Programme's primary focus is its Warmer Homes Scheme, which provides attic insulation, draught proofing, lagging jackets, energy efficient lighting, cavity wall insulation and energy advice at little or no cost to eligible households.  These measures can significantly reduce the amount of energy required to heat and light the home.  I have recently allocated a further €1 million to the Low Income Housing Programme, bringing the total 2008 allocation to €5 million.  This will enable SEI to fund such energy upgrades for 5,000 vulnerable households this year.  The scheme is delivered locally by community based organisations that cover different regions.For those who do not qualify for the Warmer Homes Scheme, I launched a pilot Home Energy Saving Scheme this year, which incentives impact on the energy efficiency of older housing.  This scheme has the potential to significantly improve the energy efficiency of our housing stock.  SEI has estimated that those upgrading the energy efficiency of their homes with the support of this scheme can expect to save up to €500 per year on their energy bills and that was before recent rises in oil prices. I am also examining the feasibility of placing an energy efficiency obligation on electricity and gas supply companies.  Such mechanisms can be a very cost effective way to improve energy efficiency in both the residential and commercial sectors and are already in place in other jurisdictions, including Northern Ireland.  Such schemes often require that a percentage of the energy efficiency actions taken by the energy companies be directed towards the benefit of those on low incomes or suffering from fuel poverty.The CER has also been given a role in protecting vulnerable customers in the energy markets.  Under the European Communities (Internal Market in Electricity) Regulations 2005 the CER was tasked with ensuring that there are adequate safeguards to protect vulnerable customers, including measures to help customers avoid disconnection.  The CER has set out guidelines for the protection of household electricity and natural gas customers, particularly the elderly, customers relying on life support equipment and those with disabilities.

It envisaged seeking to raise awareness amongst seniors of the potential benefits to them of modern communications technologies, the internet and mobile phones.As you will be aware, responsibility for Information Society — including eInclusion, under which this scheme would fall — has been transferred from the Department of the Taoiseach to the Department of Communications, Energy & Natural Resources.  In the context of the transfer it will be necessary for my Department to now consider which initiatives should now be proceeded with — having regard to current priorities and available resources.  The position in respect of this scheme will be considered in this context.  A decision will be made over the coming months.

The contribution from renewable energy sources to electricity consumed has increased from 5.2% in 2004 to 6.8% in 2005, 8.6% in 2006 and 9.5% (estimate) in 2007.There is in excess of 1,000 megawatts of renewable powered capacity currently connected to the electricity grid delivering the 9.5% contribution. It is estimated that a total generating capacity of 1,650 megawatts will be required to achieve the 2010 target.  There is approximately 1,500 megawatts of additional capacity already accepted into REFIT, the current support programme for new renewable energy powered projects. This capacity, which consists predominantly of onshore wind-powered projects, is capable of providing the additional capacity required to achieve and exceed the 15% target.  The additional categories of offshore wind and wave and tidal will contribute to the delivery of the later 2020 target.

In 2005 and 2006 my Department held competitive calls for proposals for Bio-fuel Mineral Oil Tax Relief Schemes. The schemes were open to anyone who could fulfil the criteria laid out in the Guidance Notes which were provided to all applicants.  There were specific limits on the amount of excise relief available under the various categories in each scheme and this was stipulated in the relevant Guidance Notes.  The highest scoring applicants were successful in each competition.There were 18 successful applicants in total and they have been granted excise relief on certain volumes of bio-fuel over the course of the schemes which run to 2010.  The successful companies can produce a certain volume of bio-fuel on which they do not have to pay excise to the Revenue Commissioners.  There are other bio-fuel producers in Ireland who are producing bio-fuel outside of the excise relief scheme. Details of the number of such companies would be a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  These data are not held in my Department.

To date, none of these posts has been decentralised but I can advise the Deputy that 35 staff have been assigned to posts that are relocating.Property solutions are being pursued in respect of my Department and its agencies as part of the overall Decentralisation Programme to be funded from the Office of Public Works (OPW) Vote.  Firm scale costs will emerge on foot of actual cost proposals being received from the market.  It would not be possible to give definitive costings in advance of final agreement on specific proposals.  OPW has recently identified a possible permanent HQ for the CFB in Carrick-on-Shannon and matters on that front are being progressed with the Board.  In that regard no firm timelines have as yet been established and no costs have been incurred.

As I have previously advised the House, in response to a call from the Fisheries Board's Chairpersons late last year in relation to restructuring of the boards, I requested that they develop an agreed proposal for my consideration.  This was presented to me in early May.  Following consultation with a wide spectrum of stakeholders, I am considering the most appropriate way of progressing in terms of streamlining the sector and will make an announcement in near future.

This involves the relocation of 159 administrative posts at Executive Officer or above, 72 administrative posts at Staff Officer or below and 72 professional and technical posts.  To date some 53 staff members from the Corporate Services area of my Department have relocated to Cavan.  Of these, 30 transferred from Dublin based civil service posts, 5 transferred from non-Dublin based civil service posts and 1 was recruited locally in Cavan.  The remaining staff worked in my Department prior to their relocation to Cavan.  Plans are in place to transfer the Natural Resources area of my Department to Cavan by the end of 2009.  The process of populating this area with Cavan bound staff is underway.My Department has plans and strategies in place to ensure that the risks associated with decentralisation are managed.  These include adequate overlap periods for staff training purposes and a knowledge management system, which aims to minimise the loss of corporate knowledge associated with high levels of staff turnover.  Based on our experience of decentralisation to date, I am satisfied that the staff transfers to Cavan have been undertaken without any adverse effect on my Department's business and programme delivery.

However, I would welcome and encourage debate on the issue and I have previously suggested the Oireachtas Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security as an appropriate forum for such a debate.  I would, however, stress that the Energy Policy Framework and the Programme for Government make it clear that the Government fully intends to maintain the statutory prohibition on nuclear generation in Ireland.Ireland's position on nuclear generation is shared by several EU Member States.  The EU Reform Treaty reaffirms the fundamental right of Member States to determine their own choice between different energy resources and the general structure of their energy supply.  The Government is taking a range of actions to deliver fully sustainable and diverse energy resources in transport, heating and power generation.  In each of the three areas of energy use I firmly believe that we have sustainable solutions.  In my view the priority should be to accelerate delivery on our targets for renewable energies and energy efficiency.In addition, radically improving energy efficiency, and achieving the ambitious renewable energy target set by the Government, will ensure that demand itself is more sustainable.  Indeed energy efficiency is a fundamental part of the Government's strategy to address energy costs and environmental impact and it is clear that it will be increasingly critical to ensuring sustainable supply of energy.

Following the introduction of the Mineral Oil Tax Relief Schemes, much of the road fuels sold at forecourts contain at least some bio-fuel content.  All vehicles are capable of taking blends of up to 5% without modification.There are no applications awaiting approval in my Department in relation to Bio-fuels.  Bio-fuels Mineral Oil Tax Relief Schemes were launched by my Department in 2005 and 2006 resulting in 18 projects being awarded excise relief between 2005 and 2010.  The schemes were designed as interim measures to accelerate the level of bio-fuels in the fuel mix, in advance of the introduction of a bio-fuels obligation.  As a result of these schemes, bio-fuels are already being mainstreamed in blends of up to 5% at a number of existing petrol and diesel pumps, and higher blends are being sold to identified vehicle fleets.The planned introduction of a Bio-fuels Obligation by 2009 will require all fuel suppliers to ensure that bio-fuels represent a certain percentage of their annual fuel sales.  The bio-fuels obligation will provide a long-term market based framework for the development of a bio-fuels sector and delivery of bio-fuels targets to 2020.Ireland's national bio-fuels obligation will take full account of EU and global developments in relation to bio-fuels and related sustainability criteria.  Ireland is working closely with other Member States in the negotiations to ensure that all bio-fuels placed on the European and Irish market are verifiably produced by reference to appropriate environmental and sustainability criteria.  Our collective objective in the European Union must be to ensure that production and investment in bio-fuels is fully sustainable.  I fully support the Commission's objective in relation to setting a robust sustainable framework for bio-fuels policy, which will see the EU taking a lead in this complex area.Bio-fuels are one aspect of our response to rising emissions in the transport sector.  Through appropriate RD&D schemes such as the Charles Parsons awards, we are incentivising the development of second generation bio-fuels, which will not use food stocks as raw material input.  I am also committed to progress the use of other renewable energy sources in the transport sector including electricity.

The monitoring of international developments and progress in relation to the feasibility and implementation of this technology in different situations is also an important task required to underpin policy development in this area.Accordingly, my Department is establishing a cross-cutting group which will oversee a fully joined up approach to CCS developments at home and at EU and international level.  The group will comprise my Department, the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), Geological Survey of Ireland (GSI), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the ESB, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and other players, as necessary.  I am satisfied that the need for a "joined-up government" approach to CCS activities in Ireland will be met by the cross-cutting group led by my Department, which will provide the necessary cohesion and oversight.  The assessment of the prospects for geological storage of carbon in Ireland is still necessarily at a relatively early stage.A study by SEI, EPA, Geological Survey of Northern Ireland and GSI examining the potential for such storage on the island of Ireland is proceeding.  The study is approaching completion, with a launch expected in the autumn, and at that point I will then decide how best to proceed further in the matter.An EPA-GSI project to evaluate the prospect for potentially favourable sites in the Moneypoint region is at the project initiation and scoping stage.The question of legislative underpinning for future CCS projects will be kept under review in light of developments.  The Commission's recent proposal for a Directive on the storage of carbon, which was published as part of its January 2008 climate change package, will be of particular relevance in this regard.  The Directive will be enabling rather than mandatory and will provide a framework to manage environmental risks and remove existing legislative barriers.  The detailed negotiations on the directive are taking place in the Environment Working Group.The Commission's Strategic Energy Technology Plan was adopted by the EU in at Spring Council March 2008.  It set out a proposed roadmap for energy research for the period to 2020 and a number of key EU technology challenges for the next ten years including a CO2 capture, transport and storage project of industrial scale.  I also welcomed, in principle, the overall direction of this plan and my Department is participating in the relevant implementation structures.

It does not contain an individual target for Departments for emissions reductions as the levels of reductions will vary from each sector.The energy sector will have to make a leading contribution towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions through a range of measures designed to improve energy efficiency and increase the penetration of renewable energy across the electricity, heat and transport sectors.Among the significant energy efficiency initiatives already introduced this year are the energy efficiency tax incentive aimed at supporting investment in new energy-saving equipment by companies and the Pilot Home Energy Savings Scheme.  These complement existing successful energy efficiency initiatives such as IS 393 (the Irish Standard for Energy Management), the Energy Agreements Programme, the House of Tomorrow Programme and the Power of One Energy Efficiency Awareness Campaign.The forthcoming National Energy Efficiency Action Plan will set out the Government's comprehensive programme of action to be implemented across all sectors to deliver on our national and EU targets for energy efficiency.On the renewable energy side, I am confident that we will meet our renewable electricity targets underpinned by the Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff mechanisms and the GATE 3 connections and authorisations process. I also announced a major ocean energy research and development programme earlier this year.  As well as SEI's Greener Homes Scheme, which is designed to increase the penetration of renewable heat in the domestic sector, SEI also operates the Reheat and Combined Heat and Power programmes which focus on renewable heating technologies for the commercial, voluntary, community and education sectors.On the both energy efficiency and renewable energy, I will continue to drive the implementation of the many relevant actions in the Energy Policy Framework and the Programme for Government to achieve reductions in emissions.

The advisors carried out two extensive consultations with stakeholders both within the postal sector and outside it with a view to arriving at a postcode model that would best meet the needs of the stakeholders and to measure the likely costs and benefits of the introduction, promotion and maintenance of such a postcode.In order to progress the project, my Department has recruited consultants to assist it in carrying out analysis, to establish a more complete estimate of the costs and benefits of postcodes to the public sector. To date, my Department has incurred €27,225 in consultancy fees for the project and I expect that a further €27,225 will be incurred to finalise the analysis currently under way.I will consider how best to proceed with the proposal on receipt of this analysis.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1387	I propose to take Questions Nos. 966 and 972 together.There have been no discoveries of precious ores or metals offshore in the past five years.  No new economic deposits of minerals have been discovered onshore in recent years.  However, there have been some encouraging results.  Exploration adjacent to the existing base metal mine at Navan, County Meath (Boliden Tara Mines Limited), discovered additional reserves with the potential to extend the life of that mine.Diamond drilling in northeast County Limerick by Minco and Xstrata Zinc, has encountered high grade intersections of zinc and lead.  Conroy Diamonds and Gold plc recently announced that it had increased its estimate of gold resources at its Clontibret prospect.  Although these results are encouraging, it is early to say whether economic mineral deposits occur in the areas in question.As outlined in the reply to Question No. 195 on 29 May 2008, during 2007 two finds were made in the North Celtic Sea Basin off the south coast.  Providence Resources Limited identified an oil accumulation at the Hook Head prospect in block 50/11 while Island Oil and Gas Limited encountered gas at the Schull prospect in block 57/2.  In addition, Island Oil and Gas Limited successfully appraised its 2006 Old Head gas discovery in block 49/23.In all three cases further studies are continuing in order to determine whether these accumulations can be progressed to commercial developments.  So far during 2008 no additional finds have been made.

In order to ensure the security and sustainability of our energy supply, we must reduce our reliance on imports and significantly enhance the diversity of our energy mix.While Ireland does not currently maintain a strategic gas reserve, commercial reserves of natural gas are held by licensed natural gas shippers and suppliers, including Bord Gáis Éireann (BGÉ).  At current levels, BGÉ's Kinsale reserves can supply 50% of non-daily metered customer requirements, that is, small business and domestic, for up to 50 days.The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has the statutory function of licensing natural gas storage facilities.  In carrying out its functions, the Commission must have regard to the need to ensure that there is sufficient capacity in the natural gas system to enable reasonable expectations of demand to be met and to secure the continuity, security and quality of supplies of natural gas.The CER has granted a gas storage licence to Marathon Oil Ireland Ltd to make the full capability of its depleted Kinsale facility, which has a capacity of 7 billion cubic feet (bcf), available to third parties.  Another development is the proposal by Shannon LNG to construct a liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal near Tarbert on the Shannon Estuary.  The project could potentially provide up to 40% of Ireland's gas requirements.  The connection of the Corrib gas field would also reduce our dependence on imports for the period it is in operation.In 2007, a study was jointly commissioned by my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment for Northern Ireland, to assess the medium to long-term position with regard to security of natural gas supply on an all-island basis.  The study also considered the scope for a common approach on natural gas storage and LNG.  A summary of the study has been published on the websites of both Departments.  The results of the study, which has recently been completed, are currently being assessed by both Departments.Storage facilities for oil, coal and other fuels, is a commercial matter for the companies concerned. Ireland's storage capacity for oil is estimated at 2.4 million tonnes of product storage and 417,000 tonnes of crude storage.  The National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA), which is responsible for maintaining Ireland's strategic oil reserves, meets its storage requirements by renting suitable facilities in Ireland and abroad and in line with the Government White paper, Delivering a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland, is seeking additional storage facilities both in Ireland and abroad subject to increased storage availability and value for money considerations.I have recently commissioned a study on the review of Ireland's access to commercial oil supplies, which is being carried out by consultants Purvin & Gertz and Byrne Ó Cleirigh.  The consultant's final report is expected to be available shortly and is expected to address, inter alia, the question of storage facilities for oil in Ireland.

It delivers connections, transmission and market services to generators, suppliers and customers, using the high voltage electricity system.  It is also responsible for planning the construction of high voltage transmission lines.EirGrid's Meath-Cavan project is required to provide essential reinforcement to the transmission grid in the North East. The Cavan-Tyrone project, which EirGrid is developing together with Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) in Northern Ireland, is required to underpin the all-island electricity market and provide for the free flow of electricity North and South.EirGrid launched a consultation process on these lines in 2007, and has engaged with over 11,000 stakeholders.  The additional knowledge gained during the consultation will be taken into consideration in the route selection process.  A final route has not yet been selected by EirGrid and consultation is ongoing. EirGrid will be required to complete an Environmental Impact Statement on its preferred route as part of its submission to the planning authority — the Strategic Infrastructure Board of An Bord Pleanála.In the course of EirGrid's pre-planning public consultations on proposed routes for the North-South and Meath-Cavan transmission lines, concerns were expressed locally about the impacts of overhead transmission lines.  Noting that these concerns are likely to be common to all transmission line projects, and in order to provide clarity on issues in relation to overhead versus underground transmission lines, I decided that my Department would commission an independent study on the general issue.The Independent Study on the Comparative Merits of Overhead Electricity Transmission Lines versus Underground Cables was published this week.  The study was conducted by International consultants Ecofys, in partnership with Golder Associates, a global group specialising in ground engineering and environmental services.The study represents an impartial, independent, technical assessment on the relative merits of overhead electricity lines versus underground cables, and provides important further information that can used to facilitate decision making for current and future individual projects, including the North-South and Cavan-Meath Transmission line projects.I have referred the report to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the consultants will be available to appear before the Joint Oireachtas Committee with a view to presenting the findings of the Study.  I have also forwarded the study to EirGrid.The East-West Interconnector is a 500MW High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) interconnector which will link the electricity grids of Ireland and Britain.  This project is of strategic national importance to Ireland and is recognised as such in the Energy White Paper and the National Development Plan.  It will contribute to reliability and security of electricity supply, promote competition in the market and facilitate the integration of renewables.  EirGrid has been entrusted with the development and ownership of this interconnector by the Government.  Working closely with the CER and with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, significant progress has been made.  The Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (EirGrid) Bill, has recently passed all stages in the Dáil and Seanad, with all party-support.  The Bill provides the necessary legal basis for EirGrid to construct, own and operate an interconnector.  The project remains on track to meet the target completion date of 2012, subject to the outcome of the planning processes.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1396	RTÉ's statutory mandate, as defined in Section 28(1) of the Broadcasting Act, 2001, provides that RTÉ's radio and television services shall be made available, in so far as is reasonably practicable, to the whole community on the Island of Ireland.In addition, Section 3 of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Act 2007, amends RTÉ's public service remit by requiring the national public service broadcaster to provide a television and radio service to Irish communities abroad and stipulating that any such television service must be representative of the existing RTÉ One, RTÉ Two and TG4 channels.Section 14 of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Act 2007 empowers RTÉ to utilise the public funding it receives in respect of television licence fee income in pursuance of this amended public service remit.  The method by which, RTÉ fulfils this obligation is an operational issue for RTÉ.   In this regard, RTÉ has been pursuing a number of options.  Radio services are currently provided over a wide range of media — over radio, on long-wave 252 and in the FM band, over satellite and over the Internet.Long wave is available throughout Ireland and the UK.  The Long Wave 252 transmitter which is based in Summerhill Co. Meath, broadcasts RTÉ Radio 1.  Long wave signals travel over very long distances and so a single transmitting station is sufficient to provide coverage throughout Ireland and the UK.In 2006-07, RTE replaced their long wave transmitter with a more efficient model.  As well as providing an improved analogue service, the new transmitter is capable of being upgraded to a digital service in the future.  For the listener, analogue long wave radio sets are widely available and inexpensive — prices start from as low as about €8.In 2007, RTE closed its medium wave (MW) transmitters.  MW was also used by listeners throughout Northern Ireland for reception of RTE Radio 1, but the transmitters were inefficient and expensive to operate.  The new long wave transmitter has replaced this service.FM radio offers superior quality to long wave or medium wave radio.  However, radio in the FM band is suitable for coverage over short distances only and cannot be received in certain areas in Northern Ireland or in the UK.  Coverage of RTE FM in Northern Ireland is achieved through overspill of the RTE signals from the radio transmitter sites closest to the Northern Ireland border.  Locations in Northern Ireland which are furthest from these sites cannot receive coverage.RTE has started to develop a Digital audio broadcasting (DAB) network.  As with FM, this is only suitable for coverage over short distances, but is likely to be made available through overspill within Northern Ireland.  Over satellite — Sky carries all four radio channels, serving listeners on satellite throughout Ireland, Great Britain and on the continent.In addition, RTE is planning to use an alternative satellite option — freesat — to provide access to both an international TV service and to the RTE radio services.  The coverage provided by FreeSat will be similar to the existing Sky satellite but FreeSat is not a subscription service.  Its users will pay only the once-off costs of a dish and a set-top receiver.  For both television and radio audiences, this is an important step forward.  It will provide an unencrypted television service and extend the availability of radio at a cost which is both reasonable and non-recurrent.As with the FM radio content, television services are currently available through overspill in certain parts of Northern Ireland.  This is likely to continue into the future, over the digital terrestrial television network.    No single transmission system can meet the needs of all Irish listeners across the island of Ireland and abroad.  Constraints such as cost, technical limitations and international regulatory agreements need to be considered here. Nor should the listeners be limited to using a particular means of accessing content.  In addition to the more traditional methods of receiving radio and television, access to broadcasting services over the internet and satellite continues to grow in popularity.This is why, in deciding on how to provide services both at home and abroad, RTÉ has continued to embrace different forms of distribution such as digital technologies, satellite and the Internet.Before the year's end, FreeSat will mark another stage of progress and provide additional choice for listeners in both Northern Ireland and the UK.

Ireland added 5.89 subscribers per 100 inhabitants during 2007, far ahead of the OECD average of 3.02 per 100 inhabitants and third fastest of all OECD countries.My attention is also firmly fixed on next generation broadband networks.  I recently published a draft policy paper on Next Generation Broadband Networks for consultation.  The paper considers the optimum role for Government in facilitating the roll out of high speed broadband networks and sets out the Government's commitments in that regard.  A central commitment is that there will be universal access to broadband by end 2009/early 2010 and that by 2012 our broadband speeds will equal or exceed those in comparator EU regions.

I have no statutory function in regard to this matter.

This is an issue for the Board and management of An Post to decide on.  In addition, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), the postal regulator, has responsibility for monitoring quality of service standards in relation to the postal service.
