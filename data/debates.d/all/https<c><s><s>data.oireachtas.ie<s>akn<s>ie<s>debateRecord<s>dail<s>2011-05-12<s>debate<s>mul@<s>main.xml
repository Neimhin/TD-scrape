I see there has been a rowing back and that all questions will be taken by the Minister for Finance, even though there are issues in the initiative relating to other Ministers.

He will respond to that debate and answer questions.  Second, arising from the announcement of the jobs initiative on Tuesday, a finance Bill will be introduced later in the Dáil.  That will give Deputies a further opportunity to debate the detail of the various proposals made.  A social welfare Bill will also be introduced which will give Deputies an opportunity to pursue matters in detail with the Minister for Social Protection.</p>

          <p eId="para_43">The Government regards the issue of distressed mortgage holders as a matter of great urgency.  We are very concerned about the difficulties in which mortgage holders find themselves when these matters are brought before the courts.  A personal insolvency Bill is planned for 2012 and is in the course of being developed in the Department of Justice and Equality to provide for a new framework for settlement and enforcement of debt, and for personal insolvency.  Some interim measures are planned for the civil law (miscellaneous provisions) Bill that is in the course of being drafted with a view to publication as soon as possible this year.  Account is being taken of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in its recent report on personal debt management and debt enforcement.  That report provided an in-depth review of the personal debt regime.</p>

        <heading>Jobs Initiative 2011: Statements (Resumed)</heading>
        <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_155">
          <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_157">I strenuously disagree with those who claim this initiative is a modest programme, a start, or that it is the first step in a long road.  It is none of these things.  It is a mixed bag of uncoordinated policies which does not bring any cohesion to the jobs crisis.  It simply represents furtherance of the policies already in existence.  It offers no shred of hope to the almost 500,000 people who are unemployed, whose talent is wasted and who have worked their whole lives but who will not be employed on the many important tasks which must be done.  This is apart from financial cost to society in terms of lost revenue and social welfare payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">It should go without saying that there cannot be an economic recovery without putting people to work.  Sadly, there is no measure in this proposal which does this.  Even the title has been downgraded.  It no longer has any pretence at being a job creation programme; it is a programme to create the conditions to create jobs.  This is nonsense.  It is simply a continuance of a low tax, low wages economy in the vain hope of some export-led or tourism-led recovery, which is laughable in the context of the world economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">Let us consider such measures as the removal of the airline tax which has been much lauded as an important contribution.  This measure exposes it somewhat.  The last Government reduced the tax but it did not have a knock-on effect on the number of bookings.  The idea that people in Britain, whose living standards are being decimated by the Tories, will suddenly flock to Ireland because of the elimination of a €3 tax simply does not add up.  This measure will not create one single extra job.  It is more likely to line the pockets of Mr. O'Leary than anything else.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">The measures in the plan are a far cry from the references to the smart economy, innovation, high-skill jobs in industry and so on.  Generally speaking, the only measures identified are in the lower paid sectors of the economy and the area of training.  A stark warning should be heeded when one considers the elimination of the world-leading industries that operated here, such as SR Technics, the jobs of which were simply gone overnight.  Those people were given access to a so-called training fund and to the EU globalisation fund for several months.  That began in February and the money will run out in October but it will make no impact in terms of their being upskilled into the economy again.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">If one strips away this initiative, one is left with the economic crisis being used to pin the wages and conditions that were fought for over decades under the pretence that this will somehow stimulate economic growth and deliver private sector investment to save the day.  I state emphatically that this will not happen and it is completely the wrong way to go about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">The private sector is incapable of leading the recovery.  Let us consider the figures from recent years.  Actually, what has taken place is an effective strike of capital, whereby private sector investment has reduced from €50 billion in 2007 to €17 billion last year.  This is the gap.  To tinker with such measures as halving employer PRSI and reducing VAT will not bridge that gap.  The only way to deal with the scale of the jobs crisis is through a vast, State-led stimulus programme which could put people back to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">Despite what has been said, inaccurately, about Governments not creating jobs, the reality is that the Government and the State is the largest employer.  Some 300,000 people are directly employed in the public sector, a further 40,000 people work in semi-State companies and one third of all public expenditure goes on private contracts, not to mind the indirect spin-offs and jobs created in the private sector because of State and public sector investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">The fact that those in favour of this programme are reduced to crowing about €30 million for school buildings is embarrassing in the context of the gap that exists.  The idea that this will deal with school building needs does not add up.  What will happen to those schools when no extra teachers are being employed and there is a cap on SNA resources and so on?  There will be a handful of new schools with no extra staff to work in them.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">Some €60 million has been thrown at the roads, which is fine; there is nothing especially wrong with that.  However, hundreds of buses are being taken out of the public transport network in Dublin.  This is completely wrong.  There was the option of delivering an emergency public works programme but the Government has chosen not to do this.  The only way forward is to go after those who have money and to consider such options as the wealth tax or, perish the thought, demanding that big business should contribute somewhat more in terms of corporation tax and to use the resources to spearhead a radical campaign of infrastructure projects.  The Government has chosen not to do this.  Instead, we have the ESRI stating that such projects as the metro north should not go ahead.  This does not stand up to any serious examination.  Metro north is a crucial infrastructure project and we should seize the initiative and deliver it.  What we have here is a race to the bottom, a transfer of wealth away from workers to employers.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">Everyone here moaned about the universal the social charge.  That is in place and the lowest paid people pay it.  What does the Government do then?  It reduces the level of employer PRSI.  Employer social insurance in Ireland is one of the lowest in Europe or internationally but the Government has decided to halve it.  We are halving it for the lowest paid workers which will only incentivise low pay.  Even if an employer were inclined to pay above €365, he or she would be deterred from doing so.  It will not create one single extra job.  When this is tied in with the reduction in registered employment agreements, REAs, and spurious training programmes which give people a pittance above their dole payments, one is left with nothing.  There will not be one single job created out of this scenario.  This will only succeed in the transfer of a further share of the national wealth out of the pockets of workers, who would spend it, and into the hands of employers.  It is an indictment of the poor record and betrayal of which the Government is guilty.</p>

I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and to welcome the announcement of my colleague, the Minister for Finance, of the jobs initiative.  Given our current financial difficulties, it was necessary and prudent to frame the initiative on a budgetary neutral basis.

        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_158" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources">
          <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_169">Therefore, I am especially pleased, notwithstanding the unprecedented financial difficulties which the Government faces, that we are so early in our term of office, implementing this important initiative.  The measures announced are designed to provide employment opportunities for those who have lost their jobs and it represents a first step in this Government's commitment to support the protection and creation of jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">My Department has critical contributions to make in regaining and enhancing our international competitiveness, supporting and generating employment and rebuilding Ireland's reputation on the international stage.  The energy and communications sectors are pivotal to national competitiveness and to economic and social development.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">The jobs initiative recognises the potential of labour intensive energy efficiency works to support additional jobs.  Better Energy, which I launched yesterday, is a major step forward in the Government's energy efficiency retrofitting programme.  The additional €30 million that the Minister for Finance announced will be allocated as part of the jobs initiative to this programme for 2011 represents doubling of the funding in the second half of this year.  This extra funding will be matched by a further €30 million in private sector investment, helping to generate further economic activity of at least €60 million this year.  As a result, an additional 2,000 jobs will be created in 2011, on top of the 3,800 jobs already supported by the existing budget allocation.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">Energy efficiency measures are a good use of public moneys.  They reduce energy bills thereby supporting competitiveness.  They play an important role in meeting our climate change targets and they create valuable employment opportunities.  In the light of energy price trends and growing concerns over security of supply considerations, the way we use energy is no longer simply a question of environmental responsibility but one of economic necessity.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">There is great potential within every home, business and industry in Ireland to achieve significant financial savings through the installation of energy efficiency measures.  Every euro spent by home owners and businesses on energy efficiency not only brings long term energy savings, but helps support jobs and indigenous companies.  Ireland needs a strong green building sector, founded upon sustainable principles.  The additional €30 million provided for Better Energy will help drive this agenda by building upon existing successful domestic grant programmes to take the scale of activity to a new level and in the process reward and incentivise efficiency and innovation.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">In addition, the extra funding for energy efficiency has a crucial role to play in addressing the major global challenge of climate change.  The new Better Energy programme represents an important milestone in the achievement of our 2020 national 20% energy saving target.  The existing national energy efficiency action plan, which will be updated this year, identifies a gap to target of approximately 8,000 gigawatt hours, which effectively represents a distance to target of a quarter of the 20% national target.  Better Energy is designed to be the main programme that will bridge the gap between now and 2020.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, in co-operation with the Department of public expenditure and reform when it is established, will consider the size of Exchequer funding for energy efficiency measures in future years.  A transition is envisaged over time, with the active involvement of energy supply companies, energy service providers and the construction sector, to alternative non-Exchequer funded mechanisms that ensure more energy efficiency measures can be funded through Better Energy.  My ambition is that by 2020, 1 million homes and buildings will have been upgraded, energy use reduced by 8,000 GWh, and a net societal benefit of €6 billion will have been generated.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">Renewable energy also has major potential for sustainable jobs and economic investment in the longer term.  We have made major progress in the drive to greater onshore wind energy generation.  There is also major energy and enterprise potential in the offshore sector.  I will work with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, the Industrial Development Authority and Enterprise Ireland, as well as the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, to explore the economic potential of the offshore renewable energy resources of wind and wave.  A particular focus over time will be the prospects for the export of renewable energy from Ireland to Britain.  I will meet Secretary of State Mr. Huhne in the coming weeks for a bilateral discussion on the potential for such an export opportunity.  The potential economic opportunity from developing the offshore renewable energy sector includes activities in maintenance services, operations, device testing, port infrastructure development, training and possible component manufacture.  All these prospects will be explored.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">Turning to the communications brief of the Department, smart ICT-based innovation and commercialisation is central to the economic and social vision articulated in the programme for Government.  It is pleasing to acknowledge the presence of so many of the key multinational ICT companies based in Ireland.  We must not rest on our laurels in this regard and I accept that a key element is that we put in place a national broadband infrastructure of world class standard.  We need a better broadband infrastructure to continue to attract the cutting-edge, innovative industries needed to restore Ireland's economic prosperity and competitiveness.  Availability of broadband services in all areas and a major enhancement in broadband speeds are, therefore, major priorities for the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">We are making good progress in this area.  The latest market report from the communications regulator underlines the progress made with broadband provision in recent years.  The report indicated that there were 1.6 million broadband subscribers at end of 2010.  This figure includes mobile broadband and corresponds to a penetration rate of 35.6 subscribers per 100 ofpopulation or a household penetration rate of 52% in quarter four of 2010.  Industry penetration is stronger at 83% of small and medium enterprises and 100% of large enterprises.  Themajority of broadband customers are also moving from basic broadband packages to higher speeds.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">The most recent OECD report, which includes data up to June 2010, is also testament to the considerable improvement of recent years.  It shows that the Irish broadband penetration rate over fixed lines has increased by 2.02% in the year to June 2010 which is above the OECD average of 1.72%.  It also shows that Ireland had the fourth strongest <i>per capita</i> broadband subscription growth of the OECD countries ranked.  With similar fast uptake of broadband noted in previous reports, Ireland has closed the gap on the OECD average.  This improvement measures only the performance over fixed line connections; it excludes figures for mobile broadband, an area of exceptional performance by Ireland, with a 27% increase since December 2009 in customer numbers towards 600,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">The next phase of modernisation and investment involving the more widespread availability of next generation access networks will be delivered primarily through private investment.  The Department's role will focus on facilitating not only competition but collaboration, and subject to resource availability, making investment interventions in targeted cases of demonstrable market failure.  I also underline the role that the broadband assets of the commercial State sector have to play in this regard.  I am working on this matter with the Minister of State with responsibility for the NewERA project, Deputy O'Dowd.  Our objective is that Ireland is provided with the high speed communications infrastructure links which will make the country a more competitive and attractive region for foreign direct investment and in the process leading to the increased employment which we so require.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">Energy and communications are key elements that will underpin this Government's commitment to regaining and enhancing our international competitiveness, supporting the protection and creation of jobs, restoring order to our public finances, and rebuilding Ireland's reputation on the international stage.  Tuesday's jobs initiative and yesterday's launch of Better Energy, with an additional €30 million provided for 2011, represent a down payment on these commitments.  There will soon be just short of 6,000 workers in this area and Better Energy has the potential to create more jobs, improve the way we use energy as a nation, creating savings for homes and businesses alike, and to attract investment enabling the creation of a secure, sustainable and competitive economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">The Government does not pretend that this initiative will solve the jobs problem.  It will certainly improve matters and enhance vital services.  It will further help to restore confidence.  The key is the unremitting and collective focus the Government has on fixing the financial crisis so that the way can be paved over time to using our resources as we would wish in the interests of economic and social development.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">The response of the dolly mixture that is the Opposition has been the usual combination of grandstanding and meaningless populist rhetoric.  I am disappointed but not surprised at the Sinn Féin response.  Sinn Féin is clearly revelling in the economic crisis into which our country has been plunged.  The party believes that the worse things are, the better its prospects.  It has not come up with a single workable solution that has not been plagiarised to the economic challenges that face us.  It chops and changes and trims its policies one by one as they are exposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">Achievements by the Government are always prophesied by Sinn Féin.  One day the Government has reneged on restoring the minimum wage; the next day, "Ah sure, we knew its restoration was coming anyway."  One day the Government is doing nothing about the interest rate on the bailout; the next day, "Ah sure, we all knew the interest rate would be reduced."  What is the Government doing about the weather?  "Ah sure, we all knew the weather would be good in May."  Deputy Adams cannot really believe that we can grow jobs without a functioning banking system.  Fianna Fáil knows it has about as much credibility on the economy as Osama bin Laden had on peace movements.  The attitude of Fianna Fáil is: "We must pretend to be constructive but we do not know how.  We must pretend to be constructive because we cannot be anything else, given the mess we left behind us."  Fianna Fáil is shocked at the levy on pension funds and Fianna Fáil should know because it cleaned out the National Pensions Reserve Fund for its friends in Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide.  These measure do not go far enough, according to Fianna Fáil.  A spokesman for Fianna Fáil was asked what would the party do.  Cloud computing was his answer.  Cloud cuckoo land is more like it.  It would be a small mercy if Fianna Fáil members restricted themselves to talking about something they know — like corporate donations — and stayed quiet on the economy for at least 40 years.</p>

        <speech by="#PaudieCoffey" eId="spk_159">
          <from>Deputy Paudie Coffey</from>
          <p eId="para_185">I thank the Minister for sharing his time.  He outlined his Department's intentions and his responsibilities in his contribution and his intention to explore new business possibilities in the areas of renewables, information technology and broadband.  Those areas will be where we can become competitive again and they will provide access to new markets which will be a means of creating new jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">I welcome the jobs initiative but I acknowledge it is the first of many steps.  We must realise we all have a responsibility to put our shoulders to the wheel, to get our heads down, to face into the wind and to try to help recover our economy.  I note the jobs initiative has been welcomed by employers in many sectors and they must now face the challenge because the Government is helping by creating the conditions which will help jobs to be retained and new job opportunities to be created.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">The jobs initiative focuses on the sectors with existing infrastructure and resources so that these can be exploited as soon as possible for job creation.  I refer to areas such as construction.  It is right to invest in the housing stock by means of funding for upgrading.  The existing capital infrastructure in the tourism sector includes restaurants, hotels and bed and breakfast establishments.  This sector could attract additional added-value foreign currency into the country.  Our exports are doing well and this is to be welcomed as it shows we are doing something right.  We must build on that confidence and find new avenues to new markets.  We must play to our strengths.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">I welcome in particular the reform in the visa applications system for entry to the country.  There is potential for encouraging the thousands of visitors to the London Olympics to visit Ireland and to spend their money in our economy.  The Minister should also keep an open mind on offering visas to attract additional foreign students and business people.  I refer to countries with emerging strong economies such as India and China.  I am sure many business people in those countries would be interested in doing business with Ireland and with Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">There has been controversy about the proposal on pensions in the jobs initiative.  The pension funds have benefited greatly from significant tax reliefs over many years.  The Minister proposes to impose a levy of 0.6% on those funds.  I am disappointed at the speed at which the pension fund managers have come out of the traps to say they are passing on that levy to the contributors and savers.  Those fund managers need to look at themselves and to take into account their large administration costs and the commission charged to people who have contributed to these funds over many years.  I understand they charge quite a large commission compared with other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">I have some queries which I ask the Minister of State at the Department of Finance to note.  Was the Department in consultation with the fund managers prior to this decision?  Why were the pension funds levied?  I know that these are straitened times with little or nothing in the cupboard and we have to find funds somewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">I wish to give the House some good news for a change.  I attended an event in Waterford city last week where an entrepreneurial programme run by the Waterford area partnership introduced 53 new entrepreneurs who are creating new jobs in Waterford and the south-east region.  This is a very good programme funded by the Department of Education and Skills from the labour activation fund.  The participants are supported by the Department of Social Protection through the back to work enterprise allowance.  We need to see more of these programmes funded by co-operation between Departments which incentivise people to come off the live register and to participate in training programmes so that they can become the new entrepreneurs, the new business people and new employers of the future.  This is an excellent model which needs to be encouraged and broadened to include a wider cohort across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">Traditional industries are now being regarded as providing the main planks for the recovery of the economy.  Our exports are strong and the agrifood sector is being relied upon more than ever.  Agriculture has to remain a top priority for Government.  It is a labour-intensive industry covering food production and forestry among others.  I refer to the significant potential for job creation in the tourism sector.  In my view the previous Government took its eye off the ball with regard to manufacturing industry.  This is a strong industry in my constituency and in the south-east region in general and we have suffered greatly because it has taken a big hit.  As our competitiveness is restored there will be new opportunities in the manufacturing sector and we can continue to achieve access to new markets.  I ask the Minister of State to note that the job of Government should be to assist small manufacturing companies to access these new markets so that they can manufacture high quality products.  Manufacturing will create labour-intensive employment and many skilled craftsmen and tradespeople could benefit from new markets in India and China.</p>

          <p eId="para_197">——in its short life — if I might continue — it has attempted to honour one commitment made before the election but that must also be qualified and quantified.  It can be compared to the promises made before the election.  On 23 February 2011, two days before polling, Fine Gael promised to publish a jobs budget within 100 days of coming into government and they promised it would result in the creation of 100,000 jobs.  They said the cost would be up to €7 billion and that it would be funded by the sale of State assets — a sale for which there is no support in this House and I doubt if the Minister's party will sell some of its principles and do this, but perhaps it might.  Will it really sell the likes of Coillte, ESB or Bord na Móna, to name but a few?  Even if they are to be sold, it will not be to fund a jobs budget or a jobs initiative but to fund repayments to the IMF and the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">As I said last night, the Government is now engaged in crying the mantra of "straitjacket".  When they sought to overturn the last Government, they claimed the country was "banjaxed" and suggested the Government's policies were akin to "economic treason".  They said they would rid the people of the requirement to fund the banks, of austerity and of the four-year plan.  They said they would act on such red-line issues, but they have been unable to do so.  Over the last two weeks, we have heard them say they are confined in a straitjacket with a red rose on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">I assure the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, and the Tánaiste, Deputy Gilmore, that the day will come when the members of this Government have to look the people in the eye.  As sure as night follows day, that will happen.  They will have to admit that in their quest for the power that comes with the positions of Taoiseach and Tánaiste, they were prepared to play the theatrics of fear, to play games and to play politics not only with the future of the country but also with the emotions and hopes of its people.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">I would like to acknowledge some of the positive elements of this initiative, which was referred to by the Minister for Finance as "modest".  I welcome the alterations to the PRSI code, the reduction in the rate of VAT that applies in the hospitality sector, the roads and schools programmes, the training places, the back to education initiative, the internship schemes and the home retrofitting scheme.  Each of these commendable and well-intentioned efforts was perfectly wrapped and packaged and opened on Tuesday amid great fanfare.  When the Minister, Deputy Noonan, described the initiative as "modest", it was time to look out, read into it and see the climbdowns and flip-flops that were slightly acknowledged by the Minister himself.  We took the hint that we should check it out.  When we perused it, we could see at a glance the sleight of hand, the failure to include a net job prediction and the three-card trickery of it all.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">The biggest issue that arose was how it would be paid for.  We have learned that it will be paid for by means of private sector savings and pension contributions that have already been earned and taxed.  I suppose we should not have been surprised because the Government is doing the opposite of what it said it would do before 25 February last.  It did not tell us it would do this.  It is consistent in a perverted sort of way.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">One of the great paradoxes of the initiative relates to the reduction in the rate of VAT charged on a person's five-course meal and trip to the theatre.  While that person is enjoying his night out, someone else is freezing with the cold in his house because the rate of VAT imposed on home heating has not been similarly reduced.  Many Ministers have been raving about three key areas of this initiative that were particularly well-wrapped and packaged.  Government Deputies have been rushing to their telephones and faxes to inform their constituents about these three areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">It was announced that €30 million is to be provided for the environmental retrofitting of homes and houses, but €11 million of that fund had already been provided for from within the allocation of the relevant Department.  Some €30 million is to be provided for summer works schemes in schools, but €20 million had already been committed to that end.  It was also announced that €135 million is to be provided for all other forms of capital expenditure, but €106 million of that fund is coming from existing provisions.  More than half of the almost €200 million that is to be spent under these three areas of the initiative had already been committed.  When the Deputies opposite were making their telephone calls — I am sure it sounded like they were repeating themselves — they should have bowed their heads and told the people that a Fianna Fáil-led Government had already provided 70% of these moneys at the beginning of the year.</p>

It now appears that those who led Fine Gael down that path are fallible after all.  They have been found out.  The chickens are on their way home to roost.  The penny is dropping.

          <p eId="para_209">I would like to speak about the elephant in the Chamber.  Who is paying for it?  The savers are paying for it.  The Government decided to steal from young and old workers and savers.  The people in question are not being allowed to choose whether to opt in or opt out.  There is no scaling of the theft.  A person with a €10,000 pension pot will pay the same levy rate as a person with a €1 million pension pot.  We have been told this measure is temporary and will last for four years.  I am reminded of the sporting expression that "form is temporary and class is permanent".  This Government has shown neither form nor class in its short life.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">The Government parties originally said they would fund the jobs initiative through the sale of State assets.  The McCarthy report on State assets was given to the Government four weeks ago.  At the time, the Government said it would be happy and glad to inform the House of its response to the report and its plans in this regard.  What is keeping it?  Is the Government split on the issue?  If not, we should hear its response.  I suggest it should set a date.  My constituency and the midlands in general owe a debt of gratitude to bodies like the ESB, Coillte and Bord na Móna.  The people of these communities, including the companies' workers and their families, are entitled to know where their futures lie, to hear whether assurances will be given to them and to know if their futures are to be put in doubt.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">Perhaps Irish pension companies have a role in purchasing State assets.  It would raise capital and retain the sense of State or public ownership that the Government wishes to dilute.  I appeal to the Government to get even more real than the Minister for Finance was when he used the word "modest" to describe this initiative.  The Government parties played with the emotions of the public earlier this year.  They are governing in the opposite fashion to that in which they opposed.  I ask them to re-engage with the issue of the semi-State sector and to respond to the McCarthy proposals.  It will be interesting to hear whether they say the same things they said earlier this year.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_212">I thank Deputy Cowen for sharing time.  Everywhere one went during the recent general election campaign, one heard all about Fine Gael's five-point plan to solve this country's problems, the Labour Party's plan to establish a strategic investment bank and Fine Gael's NewERA document.  It was suggested that a combination of the three proposals would solve all the problems of this country but unfortunately, they have been binned or put on the back burner.  I suppose that is where they will remain during the lifetime of this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">The job creation announcement by the Minister for Finance during the week was very mild.  He blamed the previous Government for the current Government's lack of money.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party were aware of this country's financial constraints when they made their promises during the general election campaign.  Every time one looked at the television, one saw Deputy Burton, Deputy Noonan or Deputy English going in or out of the Department of Finance.  They seemed to be getting briefed practically every other day.  I am sure they were briefed honourably and honestly by the officials in that Department.  Even if they did not accept the bona fides of the then Minister for Finance, I imagine the departmental officials would have made them aware of the situation.  Nevertheless, they continued to make many ill-founded promises.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">Although I welcome some aspects of the announcement that was made by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, I am concerned about the introduction of a new pension levy.  While I am not a financial guru, I am sure Deputy Mathews, whom I have heard speak on television many times, is well aware of the position with regard to the levy on pension funds.  Perhaps he will provide an explanation of the levy if he contributes to the debate.  I read yesterday that the levy is illogical and today's newspapers indicate it will be a tax on what were described as the "little people" as the rich will be able to move their funds out of the country.  Will the Minister clarify whether it is possible, as Charlie Weston, the personal finance editor of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, has stated, for holders of larger pensions to move their funds to Malta and other countries, leaving only the little people to pay the levy?  The measure appears to be illogical and ill thought out.  It is an unfair attack on the savings accumulated by workers over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">Pensions have already been reduced, as Deputy Ross noted last night, through poor management by greedy private sector pension companies.  It has been stated that the levy will cost private pension funds €1.9 billion over the next four years.  I ask the Minister to clarify whether it will be possible for pensions to be moved out of the country and, if so, how he intends to address the issue.  We do not want bigger players in the market to be able to move pensions abroad to avoid the levy while smaller players pay.  This is what the Minister had in mind when he proposed a levy on pension funds.  He must clearly spell out the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">I welcome the initiative on the tourism sector which has the potential to expand significantly.  The industry has suffered badly in recent years, especially as a result of a sharp decline in the numbers of tourists from the United Kingdom.  People in County Wexford in the sunny south-east, which is close to the United Kingdom, have noted an alarming decline in the number of UK visitors.  This begs the question as to whether the tourism bodies, which continue to receive substantial Government funding, are doing their job properly.  I wonder whether their promotions are outmoded and if they are doing enough to attract visitors from the United Kingdom market which is on our doorstep.  Ireland can be reached from Britain in a few hours by sea and only 30 minutes by air.  For these reasons, I welcome reductions in the lower rate of VAT and other measures to encourage the hospitality and other sectors to reduce prices.  Restaurants and leisure facilities have experienced difficult times recently.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">Bank lending is a cause of grave concern for small businesses employing between three and five people.  Many business people are visiting my clinics, as I am sure they are visiting the clinics of Deputies from all sides, to express concern about the manner in which they are being treated by banks.  Businesses with a good credit rating are unable to avail of top-up loans and are having their overdraft facilities reduced.  Many business people have informed me that they are functioning as bankers as they cannot afford to lodge cash from customers in their banks because such funds would be used to further reduce overdrafts and loans.  As a result, many of them are operating outside the banking system.  This Government must address this issue.  While I am aware that it is trying to do so, many businesses will go to the wall if decisions are not taken quickly in respect of this aspect of banking.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">On farming and food, the 20-20 Vision strategy produced by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food envisages significant expansion of the food and agriculture sectors in the next ten years.  Despite this, the Minister's document did not make a single reference to the food sector.  Agriculture and the marine have a tremendous potential to create hundreds of new jobs.  The Government promised that a single Irish food label would be introduced to emphasise Ireland's ability to provide green, quality and healthy food.  What is the current position in this regard?  Will the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food outline his plans in this area?  I am not criticising him but alerting him to the opportunities available to the food sector to exploit large markets in Europe and further afield.  We should promote the food and marine sectors as a means of creating jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">In recent weeks, the Department has prevented local development companies, including the Wexford LDC, from promoting food projects.  Surely this is not a move in the right direction.  Until recently, local development companies were able to provide grants for cheese-making, jam production and other activities related to farming and rural development.  For some unknown reason, bureaucrats in the Departments of Finance, Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Environment, Community and Local Government recently decided to issue a circular stating that local development companies may no longer provide funding to incentivise food projects.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, must address this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">I welcome the Government's decision to provide an additional few million euro for this year's summer works scheme.  The good thing about the scheme is that local builders rather than contractors from other areas or outside the country usually secure the contracts to carry out the relevant works.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">Red tape and regulations are destroying the potential for job creation.  The National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, is a quango to which the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, has referred on previous occasions.  NERA is accusing companies of not paying proper wages, even in cases where the company in question has agreed a wage rate with its workers.  It is informing such companies that they may not agree wage rates with workers, even if both parties are satisfied with them, but must pay a specified rate.  In many cases, to do so would put the company out of business and create further losses.  The role of the National Employment Rights Authority should be examined.  The Minister without Portfolio, Deputy Howlin, has been contacted by individuals in County Wexford on the matter and has agreed to examine it to ascertain what action can be taken.  This issue has created major concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">While the measures introduced by the Government are a welcome step in the right direction, more could have been done.  I look forward to more of the promises made by the Fine Gael Party and Labour Party during the election campaign being implemented in the coming months.</p>

          <p eId="para_223">I will share time with Deputies Anne Ferris, Nolan and Broughan.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">I welcome the jobs initiative launched on Tuesday, which fell well within the 100 day commitment in the programme for Government.  The initiative is in effect a mini-budget.  A modest, temporary pension levy of 0.6% over four years will fund the VAT and PRSI reductions on key products and additional expenditure measures on training, placement and job creation.  I do not know from where Deputy Cowen obtained the misguided information that it will involve the sale of State assets.  It has nothing to do with the sale of assets.   After three years of economic recession, an estimated modest 0.75% growth in 2012 will be enhanced by the new measures.  Already, exports are performing well in the foreign direct investment sector and in agriculture.  This is part of the reason there is no great reference to agriculture within this jobs initiative.  It is essential that the jobs initiative should focus on measures to boost indigenous growth and to counter long-term unemployment and this is its precise purpose.  The tourism industry, which has lost one third of its 2007 business levels over the past three years, has been targeted with a huge VAT reduction from 13.5% to 9% across the entire industry at a cost to the Exchequer of €350 million in a full year.  At the same time, the counter-productive air travel tax on passengers has, quite rightly, been abolished.  In addition, a common visa scheme was announced yesterday by the Minister for Justice and Equality between Ireland and the United Kingdom for emerging countries and in particular for rapidly developing nations such as China and India.  This will attract tourists who might otherwise only have had United Kingdom as their destination.  The halving of the lower rate of PRSI on jobs that pay up to €356 per week will stimulate job creation.  I am particularly pleased to note the increase in the minimum wage from 1 July to its previous level.  The credit guarantee scheme for small and medium businesses will finally ensure a flow of credit to that sector, which for the past three years has been starved of the necessary resources to thrive, expand and create employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">The commitment of nearly €100 million to the retrofitting of homes and the building and repair of schools will provide much-needed remedial work and employment in the construction industry.  The allocation of €75 million for the maintenance of regional and local roads and provision of cycle and pedestrian routes and park-and-ride facilities is long overdue.  The expenditure has been carefully spread throughout the country in urban and rural areas to achieve the maximum levels of employment and infrastructural development in a balanced way.  The training schemes, the back to education schemes, the post-leaving certificate courses, the national internship scheme and the third level courses amount to considerably more than 20,000 placements and will ensure that young people do not fall into long-term unemployment but will get a chance to move on.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">A sum of €4.5 billion of public capital is to be spent on infrastructural projects in 2011.  It is imperative that a cost-benefit analysis be conducted on all capital projects to ensure that employment opportunities are maximised.  In my constituency of Dublin Central, a number of significant projects are ready for development and can provide a significant return on the capital spending.  It is time to build the national paediatric hospital on the Mater campus as was agreed by the medical experts five years ago.</p>

          <p eId="para_228">A total of €400 million already has been ring-fenced for this project and the outstanding €250 million will be met without any cost to the State.  It is a win-win project and it is shameful that the treatment of sick children has been consigned to hospital facilities which are physically unsuitable and that the replacement of these facilities has been bedevilled by arguments unrelated to the welfare of children.  The Government cannot procrastinate like its predecessor but must put children first and get on with the job.  Similarly, the development of the old Grangegorman site as a new campus for the DIT is well advanced.  It can be funded on a PPP basis over the coming years with little cost to the Exchequer but a strong stimulus to the construction industry.  The transfer of 30,000 students to the north inner city and consequent major urban regeneration would constitute a huge boost to the local economy and to the city as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">The planned Luas BXD line links the entire public transport system in the city.  It connects Cherrywood on the south side with the Maynooth line on the north side.  It will transport the DIT students and staff through the Broadstone station and the Mater patients through the Phibsborough station.  It would cost a fraction of the multi-billion public transport projects that are in the pipeline but would, in effect, be the long-awaited DART interconnector for the city.  Although the days of Rolls Royce capital projects are over, there are exciting alternative projects that can provide an excellent service, stimulate job creation and cost a fraction of the original price.</p>

        <speech by="#AnneFerris" eId="spk_174">
          <from>Deputy Anne Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_230">I welcome the jobs initiative launched on Tuesday last.  As some commentators have noted, it puts pre-election words into post-election deeds and this is exactly what this Administration is about, namely, actions over words.  The programme for Government contained the commitment to launch a jobs initiative within the first 100 days of office and I therefore am delighted to see this measure being followed through.  As it stands, the overall employment rate is just under 15%, which is slightly down on figures from the previous month.  However, this means there are still close to half a million people out of work.  Given there are so many unemployed and the measures under discussion will help to kick-start economic activity and generate employment, I am amazed by the negative stance taken by some Opposition Members.  Comments by people such as Deputy Martin, who stated "Governments don't create jobs", really illustrate Fianna Fáil's continued abysmal contribution to the State's economy, even in opposition.  Given that the last Government's approach appeared to be that Governments should kill jobs, the hypocrisy of listening to a man who helped to lead us into our difficult economic position criticise measures that boost job growth would be laughable, were it not so serious.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">Fundamentally important sectors are helped by this package of initiatives, not least of which is the tourism sector, which employs thousands of people nationwide.  My native garden county of County Wicklow always has had plenty to offer prospective tourists from such old and timeless landmarks like Glendalough to new exhibitions currently on display at Russborough House.  However, the tourism industry has suffered greatly during this economic downturn and numbers visiting the country have fallen substantially.  I have seen at first hand the closure of local businesses that were dependent on the annual influx of tourists and therefore I welcome the proposals in the initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">The abolition of the travel tax on airline passengers will be vital in attracting people from abroad by incentivising more of them to visit.  I note the abolition of this pointless Fianna Fáil-inspired tax is being done in conjunction with airlines to restore lost routes, thereby bringing more people to Ireland from a wider catchment area.  I welcome the commitment to reform the visa application system for entry into the country.  Expense and red tape will be cut for those overseas visitors who already have obtained a visa from the United Kingdom.  This will be of enormous benefit to the tourism industry, especially when our close neighbours in London host the Olympic Games next year.  The focused nature of the VAT rate cuts will do much to stimulate the industry.  The 4.5% cut from the existing rate will be applicable to restaurants, hotels, cinemas, sporting facilities and a host of other venues.  In addition, will be the halving of the lower 8.5% rate on employers' PRSI on jobs paying up to €356 per week.  Overall, we hope this will give a boost to desperately-needed tourism numbers and the welcome given to the proposals by so many organisations, from the Irish Hotels Federation to the Restaurants Association of Ireland, suggests this may provide that boost.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">The challenge of getting people back to work will be directly assisted by investment in public capital projects.  Therefore, the additional €60 million funding provided for the regional and local roads investment programme is welcome.  Regional and local roads in County Wicklow will benefit to an estimated €1.5 million, affecting 18 different routes throughout the constituency.  This is in addition to the initial grant of €3.5 million made available earlier this year.  The additional funding will go to much-needed surface restoration and road reconstruction works that are essential following the damage caused by last winter's severe weather.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">Regardless of the importance of these initiatives, it also is vital to focus on young people so that they too can have a comprehensive education in adequate facilities and that their future will not amount to leaving the country upon graduation.  It is for this reason I welcome the additional €30 million that will go to much-needed works on schools nationwide.  A further 13 primary and post-primary schools in the constituency covering County Wicklow and east County Carlow will benefit from the summer works scheme, in addition to the 19 schools that earlier received funding for electrical, gas and mechanical work this summer.  The shovel-ready projects that now are being funded will not be the full and final answer to the country's education infrastructural needs but such funding is indicative of a Government that puts children at the heart of policy.  Furthermore, precisely because these projects are shovel-ready, there will be an immediate jobs boost for those working on them.  Given that the construction industry has suffered immensely during this downturn, this is especially welcome.  It is not only important to have adequate educational facilities available, but it is vital that people are able to access the educational opportunities or get the work experience they need for their future careers.  The thousands of places that are to be made available in training, work experience and educational opportunities are thus essential.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">The jobs initiative therefore is to be welcomed and not opposed.  The potential benefits are too important for Opposition Members to play politics with.  I acknowledge it will not be a magic bullet for all the ills of the economy but it certainly is a substantial beginning.</p>

        <speech by="#DerekNolan" eId="spk_175">
          <from>Deputy Derek Nolan</from>
          <p eId="para_236">This debate must be put in context and it is important that members of the Opposition realise that the Government is only nine weeks in office.  In its first month, it dealt with the banks considerably, effectively and resolutely.  In its second month, it dealt comprehensively with the EU-IMF review of our finances and renegotiated many of the deal's elements, including some of the measures contained in this package, which was announced on Tuesday.  The jobs initiative must be seen as a positive step.  Coming so soon in the lifetime of the Government, it is to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">The Government was honest about this being a modest approach and should not be attacked by the Opposition as having proposed a failure that will not live up to expectations.  We have had 14 years of spin and clever ways of displaying matters.  The public is open to an honest and up front approach to such matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">I welcome the proposals, modest as they are.  The initiative is the first step in a series of steps that the Government will take over the lifetime of its five-year term in office and is considerable in what it does.  In particular, I welcome and am impressed by the sectoral focus on the tourism industry.  As a Deputy for Galway West, I remind the House that Galway city serves as a tourism hub for our county, Connemara, County Clare and all around.  The package of measures will benefit employment when introduced.  In Galway city, an area called the Latin quarter has a focus on tourism and comprises restaurants, pubs, shops and all of the types of attraction tourists want.  The initiative will create a safe environment in which those businesses can trade.  It will also ensure that their jobs can be kept and improved.  The VAT reduction from 13.5% to 9% on those products and services is welcome.  A 1% cut across the board on the lower rate of VAT would have been less impressive and made less of an impact than a focused substantial reduction.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">I welcome the abolition of the air travel tax because it was not done as a simple abolition.  Instead, it was done in negotiation with the airlines and on the agreement that the tax would be reviewed and reimposed if the number of flights and passengers to Ireland was not restored.  The Government and private industry have taken a constructive approach so as to ensure taxes and concessions will be used and not just pocketed into profit margins.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">I also welcome the common travel visa announced by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, yesterday.  It will create a single travel area for tourists between the United Kingdom and Ireland.  This has considerable potential, particularly in the run up to the Olympics.  Many foreign visitors from outside Europe view Ireland and the UK as a single travel destination.  The ability to spend a few days in Ireland will benefit our economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">I welcome the cementing of the reversal of the minimum wage cut.  Fianna Fáil claimed it could not be done, but it has been done.  The matter was renegotiated because the reversal was the right thing to do.  It rewards people for their work, gives them dignity and respect and puts money into their pockets so that they can live decent lives and contribute to the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">Two announcements are particularly welcome in Galway West.  The €3.3 million allocation for secondary roads is a considerable increase on the year's allocation and will allow for a large number of improvements to roads that were badly damaged during the severe frost.  It will create employment and improve road safety, thereby saving lives.  We also welcome the fact that 23 schools in County Galway will have works done, from roofs to accessibility to toilets.  As these works are badly needed, the money, if properly spent, will have a real impact and will benefit children and the education system.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">The initiative as announced will put a credit guarantee scheme in place.  This must be done quickly, as we cannot run the risk of doing what Fianna Fáil did, which was to constantly announce that credit would flow when none was ever made available.  The scheme is to be welcome, but it needs to be up and running quickly and explained and communicated to people effectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">The jobs initiative is a good one and I commend the Government on its introduction.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_176" as="#Acting_Chairman">
          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_245">The ongoing unemployment catastrophe remains one of the greatest challenges facing our country.  The April CSO figures remain shockingly high, with just under 440,000 of our fellow citizens signing on the dole, constituting an incredible rate of 14.6%.  The financing of this package — the pension funds levy of 0.6%, producing €470 million per annum — is controversial and starkly reveals the extent of the EU-ECB-IMF straitjacket in which our Ministers are operating.  Ireland has an unemployment disaster and even the modest proposals of yesterday must be run past the ruling foreign troika and be revenue neutral.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">Ironically, the jobs initiative itself highlights the desperate situation our nation faces.  In recent days, we learned that Greek Government debt is passing 160% of GDP and Professor Nouriel Roubini is predicting that Greece will find it difficult to meet its fiscal targets because of the malign impact of fiscal tightening on the economy.  Indeed, Greece must run a 6% surplus up to 2040 if it is even to attempt to do this.  Clearly Ireland is not Greece, but the devastating budget cuts of 2009, 2010 and 2011 are imposing increasing hardships on our people and cannot go on for three or four more years.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">Like many other citizens and students of economics, I was struck by the powerful and accurate analysis by Professor Morgan Kelly last weekend.  His prediction that Ireland, unless we dramatically change course, will have a debt mountain of €250 billion — a quarter of a trillion euro — by 2014 is an appalling prospect that cannot be allowed to happen.  Professor Kelly has accurately identified profound errors by Central Bank Governor Patrick Honohan who, upon entering the euro bailout, repeated the disgraceful mistakes of his predecessors at the Central Bank by completely miscalculating bank loan losses and pushing our country into the arms of the ECB and IMF.  Professor Kelly's prediction of imminent national bankruptcy has, as expected, been shrugged off by the Government, which is still negotiating desperately just to get a 1% cut in the bailout interest rate.  President Sarkozy is still saying, "<i>Non</i>”.  However, the Taoiseach, with all the insouciance of the captain of the <i>Titanic</i>, continues to sail towards the iceberg of national bankruptcy and ruin.  Like that captain, and as Morgan Kelly noted, the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance are still turning the tiller in the wrong direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">I agree with Professor Kelly that no responsible Irish Government can simply burn €10 billion and more of its annual taxes and loan finance in bailout interest repayments and crazy promissory note repayments during the next decade.  Subtracting the banking losses repayment from our fiscal position, we are already significantly on course towards balancing our fiscal current account following the awful cuts of the past three years.  With fair and balanced taxes, including the fair taxation of our elites, as Stephen Collins, the distinguished journalist, has rightly written recently, we can move towards fiscal independence again in a relatively short time.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">There must be a fundamental restructuring of the bailout.  Any such negotiation on the fundamental restructuring of our banking debt with the ECB must involve a significant haircut to ECB and bondholder debt, as Deputy Mathews pointed out yesterday.  Following such a fundamental restructuring of banking debt, the Government might then propose to the House a jobs initiative that would perhaps spend €2 billion, €3 billion, €4 billion or more, as planned in our election manifestos, and make a serious dent in the horrendous unemployment figures the jobs initiative should target.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanCroweSF" eId="spk_177">
          <from>Deputy Seán Crowe</from>
          <p eId="para_250">No one on the Opposition benches opposes the Government's proposals.  While others are pointing out that the Government has only been in office a number of weeks, most of us are referring to the lack of potential contained within the proposals.  This is the great difficulty most people have.  The initiative will not tap into the potential energy and creativity to be found in the community.  Like others, I have serious questions concerning the lack of hope the initiative will give to the unemployed.  Other speakers will say we are being untruthful about this, but in the run-up to the announcement of the jobs initiative there was major speculation among the chattering classes about the content of the education, training and job placement components of the proposal.  Much of this speculation focused on the proposals outlined in the programme for Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">It is worth reminding ourselves of the promises made to the electorate by Fine Gael and the Labour Party during the election campaign.  That is the difficulty many people have.  Fine Gael promised 45,000 new employment and training places to target youth unemployment, of which 23,000 were to be in the form of a national internship programme and 17,000 were to be second-chance education places.  Also promised were 700 new apprenticeship places and 5,000 new community employment places.  The Labour Party promised 60,000 places, including 30,000 work experience and 30,000 training and education places.  Most commentators and anyone who looked at the manifestos thought there would be a marriage of convenience which would affect the figures, but this has not come about.  The announcement the other day mentioned 20,900 places.  There is a major gap between this figure and the number of places promised.  Previous speakers said there would be more later, but we do not know what is coming down the track and we have not had any indication of what is promised.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">The hope shared by those who voted for change in the general election is not being borne out.  They are not seeing anything coming through from the Government.  This is not to take away from the fact that there are 20,900 possible new places, but people were genuinely surprised.  While any increase in the number of placements is to be welcomed, the fact that the total spend will amount to €29 million, of which a meagre €11 million is additional spending, speaks volumes about the Government's commitment to the unemployed.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">The Government is willing to invest only €1,000 per person throughout these schemes, which is nothing short of scandalous, particularly in view of the €24 billion commitment to recapitalise the banks only three weeks ago, or the additional €3 billion thrown into the black hole that is Anglo Irish Bank.  This response feeds into the view that there is a lack of fairness in the treatment of the unemployed and those on low and middle incomes compared to the wealthy elite.  We can tax the bejaysus out of the former, but there is always a barrier or lame excuse when it comes to taxing the well-off in society — the ones who ultimately created this crisis.  We really must ask what priorities the Government has set itself.  There is agreement across the parties on how we are to get ourselves out of the crisis — by reducing the deficit, helping the economy to grow and creating the conditions to attract new business.  Cuts alone will not work.  However, the key component of the plan is to get people back to work.  This initiative is not giving inspiration to anyone.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">On Tuesday the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, described the breakdown of the 20,900 new places.  There will be a national internship scheme which will be open to 5,000 applicants and provide for a five to nine month internship, with participants receiving a weekly top-up on their social welfare payments.  The Union of Students in Ireland has warned that considering the low level of social welfare payments to young people, this €50 per week top-up may not be enough to convince young people, particularly those with skills and qualifications, to choose this scheme over emigration.  That is a worry shared by many of us.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">There will be three schemes targeted at people out of work in sectors with structural unemployment such as construction.  These will include 5,900 places on the third level springboard programme at level 6 on the national framework of qualifications, NFQ; 5,000 places on the specific skills short-term training programme at levels 4 to 6 on the NFQ, and 1,000 places on the specific skills long-term programme at the same levels.  The latter two programmes will be operated by FÁS.  The additional places are welcome, but they do not meet the demand for courses, particularly in areas with a high concentration of unemployment such as my constituency of Dublin South-West.  Also mentioned were 3,000 additional part-time module places on the back to education programme and 1,000 places on post-leaving certificate courses.  Unfortunately, like the jobs initiative overall, there is almost no detail on the labour market activation elements of the Government's proposal, which makes assessing the potential impact of Tuesday's announcement difficult.  The fact that so many of the places are part-time suggests the initiative will have little impact on those on the live register who most need the Government's help.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">There is no talk of measures to alleviate the difficulties faced by those offered short-term work.  I know a person who was offered a job for five or six weeks in An Post two years ago, but the difficulty was that it would take about three months to get back on the dole.  There is no scheme which allows people to transfer seamlessly from work to social welfare.  It would be cost-neutral and could be done in the morning, but it was not.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">Other speakers mentioned apprentices.  My local council, South Dublin County Council, has a scheme in place under which ten people are finishing their apprenticeships.  Again, it is cost-neutral.  There is potential for up to 100 people to complete apprenticeships under this scheme.  Perhaps one of the Ministers can tell me why the scheme is not being replicated throughout all local authorities?  It gives people the ability to move on in their lives.  This is the key point people were making on the doorsteps.  Families whose parents were getting on in years wanted to see their children obtain qualifications, but there was nowhere for them to do so.  Perhpas the Government might consider the scheme in my locality and use it as a template for similar schemes in other local authority areas.  There is no reason the OPW and other semi-State bodies could not do the same, giving kids potential to move on in their lives.  We have been talking about employment levels and so on, but the major worry about this initiative is that it does not tap into the available potential.  It will not inspire hope of a new beginning for anyone suffering the effects of unemployment.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">I echo the calls of Social Justice Ireland for the adoption of a more urgent approach by the Government to labour activation measures, particularly given the fact that many of the 439,570 on the live register are long-term unemployed.  Ultimately, increased spending on education and training is only of use if there are meaningful long-term jobs for people to take up after they have completed their placements.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">Speakers have said we are opposed to this and that.  There are plenty of plans and ideas, but we do not see them coming through from the Government.  This is a pathetic attempt to address the real needs of the long-term and newly unemployed and their families and bring them out of that system.  The people concerned are looking for leadership, but we are not seeing it from the Government.  I am being negative, as have been other speakers.  We are not seeing the potential for change that the people saw when they voted for Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  Others can talk about their records.  In Northern Ireland the Minister for Regional Development, Conor Murphy, MLA, who has responsibility for roads introduced a rule under which every contract must include an apprenticeship scheme.  Why can something similar not be done here?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_178">
          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_260">I, and definitely the 450,000 or so unemployed persons in this State, eagerly awaited the publication of the jobs initiative the Minister, Deputy Noonan, delivered here on Tuesday.  Others have already addressed whether it was good, bad or indifferent and I am of the view it is indifferent.  As Sinn Féin's spokesperson on social protection, defending social welfare rates is only part of my job because what people on the dole ultimately want is a job.  That is why I eagerly awaited the initiative.  I am not saying I am indifferent to the jobs initiative but that it is indifferent because it will not deliver on the potential, as Deputy Crowe said, that people expected.  It will not have any major effect on the jobs queue, those 450,000 or so people who want work, play a full role in our society, pay taxes and through those taxes contribute to the economic recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">Since the commencement of the recession my party has launched a number of job creation and retention proposals, one of the key ones being job retention given that, day in day out, we hear of more job losses.  The jobs initiative announced does not have as much of a proposal to retain jobs as it should have other than in respect of one or two key areas.  There are two key differences between the proposals put forward by my party and those announced by the Minister, Deputy Noonan.  The first is that Sinn Féin recognises it will take a major investment to get people back to work while the Government would rather use Ireland's wealth to bail out European banks.  The second major difference is that our proposals would create employment whereas the cost-neutral jobs initiative announced does not create real employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">Needless to say I am sorely disappointed with the Government's plan.  There are 437,524 people on the live register and the Government in its proposals has come up with 21,000 new opportunities.  That creates an opportunity, while welcome, for only 5% of jobseekers.  We are not even talking about real opportunities or real full-time jobs.  In the main they are educational or training opportunities.  How many jobs will be shed in the same period?  That is the big question.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">Only a few days prior to the launch of the jobs initiative, the figures released by the Minister with responsibility for public expenditure and reform, Deputy Howlin, showed that 2,000 public sector jobs are being shed.  What is the point in the Government funding educational opportunities while at the same time shrinking the job opportunities towards which people can move?  Thousands of people will be laid off in the State banking sector, which is what it is now.  An Post announced it will have fewer jobs by the end of this year and there will be increasingly fewer jobs in the retail industry because of the collapse of consumer demand and the continual austerity measures taken by the previous Government and endorsed to date by this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">I acknowledge the commitment in the jobs initiative to reinvigorate the national employment action plan, which is badly in need of an update as it is no longer fit to activate people in any significant numbers.  However, effective activation measures are resource-intensive and I fear the Government is not making the necessary investment to ensure people can and will go back to work.  It takes money and staff to conduct the requisite interviews and meetings with jobseekers to map out and match each and every jobseeker's skills and experience properly with appropriate education, training and ultimately job opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">Last month the Government made a commitment to the EU and IMF that it will reduce social expenditure year on year.  In that context it is unlikely that even the very basics of activation will be provided for by the Government, never mind the more extensive supports that are required, such as affordable child care, which are no less vital to enable a person to transit from the dole queue to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">There has been much discussion in the media and on the airwaves, in particular, around the jobs crisis.  Time and again commentators are depicting social welfare as a disincentive to work.  Never has there been a less appropriate time for that paradigm.  Welfare is not a disincentive to work; the absence of a job is a disincentive.  That said, a number of unemployment and poverty traps still remain and they must be addressed.  However, the solution is not to cut the rates and the schemes, rather it is to ensure that work pays by allowing recipients to move into low paid employment in some cases or to increase their hours without fear of an immediate loss of all their protections.  The Government recognises this and that is why the programme for Government committed to amend the 30-hour rule for rent supplement and mortgage interest supplements, but to date it has not presented that proposal to the House.  Hopefully, it will be done in the very near future.  However, I fear that the promise the Government made to the European Union and IMF indicates it will instead take a retrograde approach to the issue of social spending.  It will make life intolerable for people on social welfare, the most insecure and the lowest paid and the black market will be incentivised.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">The Government has committed to reducing social expenditure, which means that despite ever increasing dole queues and greater numbers depending on mortgage interest supplements, it has implicitly promised to make further cuts to social welfare schemes.  There is no other logic to that commitment it gave to the IMF.  Considering that the programme for Government commits to maintain welfare rates, the only alternative open to the Government is for it to introduce stealth cuts.  First, eligibility rules will be tightened and, second, payments will be hit by this Government.  The Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party will continue Fianna Fáil's approach to placing the burden of the economic recovery unfairly on those in our society who have the least.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">The creation of new training and education opportunities is welcome but the Government has not produced any accompanying protections against exploitation in such situations where there will be worker displacement.  If precautions are not taken, the 5,000 internships announced could easily coincide with a further 5,000 job losses or at least the deferment of what could otherwise have been new, full-time job opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">I recently listened to an employer on Newstalk espousing the tired line that social welfare payments must be cut because they act as a disincentive but he subsequently went on to reveal that he has taken on an intern for six months and if that intern does well, there will be a job at the end of it.  If a job exists the person should be employed in that job from day one rather than an employer getting six months of free labour from somebody.  What does the Government intend to do to prevent that type of exploitation and employment displacement?</p>
          <p eId="para_270">I am also concerned that there is a drift towards workfare because it is an increasing feature in some of our supposedly social protection schemes.  For instance, I met a number of young people last week who are involved in an insulation course organised by FÁS.  They were being told they had to work a 40-hour week for nothing more than €20 above their jobseeker's allowance.  That is workfare.  It is a scandal, and workers must be protected to ensure that type of activity does not continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">I am also sceptical of a number of the training opportunities announced and already I have raised some of the issues I had with the Minister for Social Protection.  Time will tell whether some of those are new.  For instance, one of the training opportunities in our area is a post-leaving certificate course, a hairdressing course, but some of the people who applied this week were told that 25% of the places on the course only were available to those who were leaving school this year and that the remainder was being ring-fenced for those over 25 who were on the dole.  That is not the purpose of the post-leaving certificate courses and if that were to be the practice it would be a scandal because it would represent displacement of opportunities for those leaving school.</p>

          <from>Deputy John O’Mahony</from>
          <p eId="para_274">I welcome the jobs initiative and see it, as the Government does, as a start in tackling the large increase in unemployment which occurred in the past two years.  Nobody would suggest the crisis can be sorted overnight.  While some may opt not to do anything, with the excuse that we could not borrow for such schemes, for those who will finish an apprenticeship or find a work placement, this initiative will be invaluable.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">I welcome the reduction of VAT to 9% for businesses and hotels in the tourism industry.  This measure will increase turnover and create a stimulus for increasing employment.  Those who provide extra jobs will be further encouraged by the measure to halve the lower rate of PRSI payable by the employer.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">The abolition of the travel tax is another positive move.  I agree with marketing the positive attractions for visitors to Ireland in our core markets abroad.  While I agree with the need for marketing our country, I regret the initiative focuses solely on the three State airports without reference to Ireland West Airport Knock which services the whole of the west and north west, areas not served by Cork or Shannon airports.  Of the western seaboard airports, Ireland West Airport Knock now has 48% of the UK market.  It needs to be considered more in aviation policy and tourism strategy.  The airport is the most cost effective in the State and serves ten UK destinations as well as servicing all the counties from the tip of Donegal to Blacksod, County Mayo, to County Longford.  These are tourism counties with all of the attractions, infrastructure and facilities to meet the needs of the thousands of tourists we are trying to attract.  Will Ireland West Airport be given a share of the Tourism Ireland marketing budget?</p>
          <p eId="para_277">This jobs initiative is just a beginning.  More is needed to provide new jobs and to protect the many jobs teetering on the edge.  It is ironic that when the Minister announced the jobs initiative on Tuesday, Cordil Construction informed its suppliers and subcontractors that it would have to suspend works temporarily on all its sites for the next two weeks.  This was because of a sudden and serious cash flow problem caused by the reduction of overdraft facilities from €2 million to €150,000 by its banks.  This company is owed more than €4 million for works done for the State.  It employs 60 people directly with a further 1,200 people affected in spin-off employment with subcontractors and suppliers.  The company has plenty of projects on its books ready to be started, with 15 live projects already <i>in situ</i>.  It has completed work for the Departments of Education and Skills, Defence, the Environment, Community and Local Government and Health and Children to the highest standards.  While I am no financial expert, I have no other agenda but the protection of jobs.  A solution must be found that will enable up to 1,200 jobs to be saved.  The consequences otherwise will be 1,200 people out of work at a cost to the Exchequer of €20,000 per job.  I appeal to those with influence to resolve this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">Recently brought to my attention was the case of a housing estate taken over by a bank that made funding available for the estate to be finished off.  The work was done by unregistered builders in the black economy.  If the banks are being bailed out by the State, they had better ensure they employ registered builders to complete the work.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">Another issue relates to the ability of companies from outside the state to tender for construction jobs within the state, paying their workers way below the rates that Irish companies pay.  I spoke recently with a roofing contractor who lost a €100,000 contract because a contractor from outside the State could pay €20,000 less in wages.  This has implications for our economy and the country because it means higher social welfare bills due to job losses.  These issues have to be tackled and will save many jobs and much money for the State.</p>

        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_182">
          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_280">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this important, imaginative and constructive intervention by the Government.  This is the first response of this nature that I witnessed in the House in the past ten years.  These are the first baby steps in an attempt to enable the economy to recover.  The responsibility for economic recovery does not rest in any one area but across the board in the public and private sectors.  It rests with each Minister and his or her Department and each Member to be realistic in our expectations and aspirations.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">I am concerned most by the degree to which people in this House call for miracles.  Before the general election everyone across the country — and outside it- knew there would be no miracles but that the country was in financial receivership.  To work our way out of it we must be realistic, taking one step at a time.  Each and every one of us must work harder, for longer and for less.  Everyone will feel pain.  Unfortunately, those at the bottom very often feel the most pain simply by virtue of the way things happen.  There is no way anyone can get more out of the economy.  The only thing we can do is to shore it up and do the best we can for the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">The Government's jobs initiative is a good and a positive attempt to deal with the employment problem.  The Government could not produce money out of a hat.  I have to laugh when I hear the Opposition call for such spending.  In recent years, when we were on the opposite side of the House, we called on the then Government to address the employment issues looming on the horizon in an imaginative way but it did nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">The results of this initiative will be positive.  Deputy Seán Crowe called for a 5% or 4% reduction in employment figures.  Even a 2% reduction would be a positive response.  We must be glad of anything we can achieve from here on that is positive.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">We must keep in mind the points recently made by an eminent judge.  As we go further down the road in this recession, issues will rise up and bite us.  The problem with indebtedness has not gone away and is in fact growing.  Just because the level of repossession has not reached the levels suggested in some quarters, they have not stopped.  It does not matter whether a house is worth €100,000 or €700,000.  The fact is that those funding the mortgage debt are unemployed and in serious difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">At this stage of my life, I have more than a little experience of dealing with banks on behalf of constituents.  Some banking executives are very helpful and co-operative.  Some are not.  The amount of bureaucracy and red tape in place to protect people within certain institutions is unbelievable.  It is no wonder we are where we are.  Elected public representatives must jump through a number of hoops when interceding on behalf of people with local authorities, financial institutions and so on.  For example, the first question one is asked in this regard is "Do you have authority to speak on behalf of your constituent?"  I remind these people that we do not need authority to speak on behalf of our constituents.  Every Member of this House received that mandate from the people and no one has the right to in any way interfere or restrict it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KieranODonnell" eId="spk_183">
          <from>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_286">I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on the jobs initiative, which I believe is practical and creative.  It covers a wide range of areas and must be viewed in context, namely, the IMF deal which restricts us in terms of the amount of money we can borrow.  Fine Gael gave a commitment to put jobs at the top of its agenda when in government and has done so in terms of the introduction of the jobs incentive scheme.  Every measure in the jobs initiative is directed at bringing about employment.  In terms of training, approximately 21,000 new places are being created.  I believe the internship programme is practical and creative.  It will allow businesses across all sectors, some of which can ill afford to take on people, to take on for €50 per week a trainee for a six to nine month period, thus benefiting the employer and employee.  The other training programmes will assist in getting people back into the workforce.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">The €135 million allocated to the capital programme will result in the creation of 6,000 jobs.  The retrofit programme will create more than 2,000 jobs and the €30 million being invested in the schools building programme will result in the creation of approximately 3,000.  Jobs will also be created through spending on repair of our roads.  Also, the jobs provided will yield benefit in terms of improved homes, schools and roads.  I welcome the smarter travel project which will be important for Limerick.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">The previous Government was focused on the smart economy.  However, we must also get people from a low skill base back into employment.  Tourism provides this opportunity.  The VAT rate for this sector has been reduced from 13.5% to 9%, which is more than a one-third reduction.  This will result in enormous practical benefits in the industry.  Limerick city in my constituency is reliant on tourism.  I welcome the visa waiver system, which again is a practical measure and the reduction in the travel tax to zero.  It was a crazy tax, day one.</p>

          <from>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_290">It made no sense.  The Government is in negotiations with the airlines on this matter.  I welcome that the taxpayer will see a return from the reduction in the travel tax.  Also, I welcome, in the context of Shannon, the tourism marketing fund which will focus on bringing extra tourists to Ireland.  From 2007 to 2010 there was a 25% reduction in passenger numbers nationally.  Tourism is an export industry, a fact often overlooked.  It is an export industry that provides jobs.  We must be export driven but must link this to employment.  Tourism will provide this opportunity in a speedier manner than will other areas of export, which, too, are to be welcomed.  Tourism is vital.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">I want now to deal with the funding of the jobs initiative through the pension levy.  It is important to put this in context.  Currently, total fees, including dealing costs and management fees, charged by pension funds amount to 1.5% of the value of the fund.  The pension levy amount to 0.6%.  We are currently seeking to reform our banking sector and other areas and must also seek to reform the pension sector.  Pension providers will have to step up to the mark.  There needs to be transparency in terms of fees charged.  I welcome that the Taoiseach has directed the Minister for Finance to examine this issue.  We must encourage people to provide for their pensions.  Our counterparts in the UK have management fees of 0.3%.  Irish pension funds charge management fees of upwards of 1%.  There is scope for change in this area.  Studies have shown that up to one third of the value of pension funds are eaten up by fees and administration costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">The jobs initiative is a practical first step in terms of job creation.  The pension industry must step up to the mark in this regard.  I welcome that the Minister for Finance is examining this area.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnPaulPhelan" eId="spk_186">
          <from>Deputy John Paul Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_293">I welcome the opportunity to support the jobs initiative announced on Tuesday by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.  Following the Minister's speech I was sitting at the back of Chamber beside a Fianna Fáil Member, who shall remain unknown, who said to me: "Why didn't we do that?  Why didn't we implement some of the initiatives announced by the Minister?"  I am not surprised that the Minister, Deputy Noonan, has taken such a personal interest in this initiative.  It is something he promoted even prior to being in Government.  I recall two or three years ago Deputy Noonan, when sitting where Deputy Crowe is now sitting, being one of the first Members of the House to highlight that we did not just have a banking or fiscal budgetary difficulty but we had a jobs disaster in this country.  There are approximately 440,000 people on the live register.  For each of those people and their families this is not alone an economic disaster but a social disaster.  Many of them are considering leaving the country.  Many people have already left.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">The jobs initiative announced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, is a first step by this Government in terms of providing hope for unemployed people in this country in terms of their being able to remain here and have a future.  I commend him on his efforts in that regard.  It is important to state what is the Government's role in regard to job creation.  I am not a statist in terms of the Government's position with regard to creating employment.  I believe its role is to create the environment through which employment can be created.  All of the initiatives contained in the Minister's announcement on Tuesday are with that in mind.  I heard a Sinn Féin speaker say earlier that interns only take up jobs.  Internships exist across the world.  Part of the reason for taking on an intern for three or six months is to see if a position can be created for him or her to fill, which underpins the Government's announcement in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">I support the changes announced by the Minister in regard to employers' PRSI and the reduction in some areas in the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9%.  I agree with what Deputy Kieran O'Donnell had to say in regard to the tourism industry.  One of the most disastrous moves by the previous Government was the introduction of the travel tax. I am heartened by the Minister's announcement that the Government is in negotiations with airlines with a view to removing the charge completely and ensuring, in tandem with this, we attract extra tourists to the country.  We have invested millions of euro, taxpayers' money, by way of tax breaks to provide top quality hotels and other infrastructure throughout the country.  We have an advantage in the tourism sector which the previous Government undermined by the introduction of the travel tax.  We should be using that advantage.  That is why I fully support the abolition of the travel tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">There have been concrete announcements by the Government of increased funding for roads, schools under the summer works scheme, as well as the retrofit scheme.  This will provide real jobs, particularly in the sector of the economy that has been most hit.  I could not begin to tell the House the number of friends of mine who left school early to work on building sites and now find themselves all over the world because of the previous Government's failed policy of over-reliance on construction.  Many of these friends are still in the country but unemployed.  With others, they will benefit directly from the Government's announcement on the retrofit scheme, the summer works scheme and roads grants.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">I support Deputy Kieran O'Donnell's point on the pension levy.  The handling fees charged by private pension scheme providers in this country are twice those charged in the neighbouring jurisdiction.  There is no reason for the 0.6% levy to be passed on to the consumer.  Pension scheme providing companies could easily absorb it and still have a larger percentage handling fee than that charged in the neighbouring economy.  As we are supporting the financial sector, it is time for that sector to support the Government's jobs initiative.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#StephenDonnelly" eId="spk_187">
          <from>Deputy Stephen Donnelly</from>
          <p eId="para_298">I am sharing time with Deputies Joan Collins, Seamus Healy and Richard Boyd Barrett.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">I commend the Government for many of the ideas in the jobs initiative.  I agree with Deputy Kieran O'Donnell that it contains creative and practical ideas.  As many Deputies said, with nearly 440,000 unemployed, which number is due to rise by 30,000 this year, anything we can do to stimulate job creation is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">I am delighted to see the focus on tourism.  I know this will be particularly welcome in County Wicklow which has huge untapped potential.  I also welcome the lower VAT levels which will continue to drive prices down.  Again, this should stimulate the tourism industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">I urge the Government to track the prices of the goods and services it is targeting.  There is much economic evidence to suggest tax incentives are taken almost exclusively by the seller.  I urge the Government to look at prices and have a plan for getting them down if they do not fall.  Economic evidence suggests that if left alone, prices will stay largely where they are and that sellers will pocket the difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">There are many other good initiatives.  Establishing the microfinance fund is a fantastic idea and will boost entrepreneurship all over the country.  The stimulation of research and development is welcome.  I hope it will create high paid jobs, both now and for many years to come.  Lowering the cost of employment by halving employer PRSI contributions and the review of sectoral wage agreements is also welcome.  I hope this will make it easier for employers to boost employment in the coming months and years.  I am delighted to see the Government has targeted graduates who are in an extremely tricky position.  I hope the national internship programme works and that it will be scaled up.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">I wish to highlight three concerns which I will share with the Government.  My first concern is with the level of funding.  An additional investment of €470 million is not enough.  This figure is in stark contrast with the debt of €35 billion we are paying, rightly or wrongly.  We are paying €35 billion to cover the losses of private companies both here and abroad, but we are putting less than one seventieth of that amount into stimulating jobs in Ireland.  That does not feel like the right balance.  I know the matter is complex and that there are all sorts of pieces to the puzzle.  However, one euro for every seventy we are paying to meet other people's losses does not feel right to me.  We need a far bigger stimulus package.  As I have outlined on previous occasions, there are various options that would allow us to do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">My second concern is with the funding mechanism.  This is, essentially, a tax on savings which happen to be in the form of pensions.  It is not a tax on the profits of the pension industry, as referred to by previous speakers; rather it is a tax on savings.  Pensions are not as liquid as savings or as easy to move offshore.  However, a tax in this form on the amount of savings, rather than on the profits from them, like DIRT, begins to move us to a dangerous position and could, if continued, have serious implications for the banking sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">My third concern is with the lack of targets in the jobs initiative.  While the initiative contains great ideas, there is a lack of targets, although there are some.  We do not know what the €470 million is meant to get us.  We know targets are essential, make for better policy decisions and lead to better outcomes during implementation.  We also know that we need to check that our money is being well spent.  I am puzzled, therefore, by the lack of targets.  If there are targets, I ask the Minister to publish them in order that we can take a look at them.  If there are no targets, I ask him to go back to his policy team and have some.  It is important to know whether initiatives are succeeding and which are the best in order that we can invest further in achieving them and stop doing the things that do not seem to be having an impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">I will finish with a few further suggestions.  The first is to publish a gender analysis.  The vast majority of politicians and senior policymakers are men.  There is a tendency in these cases to favour job creation in traditionally male areas.  Therefore, I would love to see a gender review of the proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">I would love to see also a radical reform of teaching in third level institutions.  Our teaching quality is low.  The Government could take a variety of revenue neutral measures to improve it very quickly and the quality of our graduates.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">We need to lower local authority rates.  This issue has been discussed in the House on previous occasions and a vast number of potential savings have been identified.  I would love to see this happen soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">We can free up dormant buildings for entrepreneurs.  A huge number of people are looking for space to create businesses and we have a vast number of commercial properties available.  We could be creative and try to match these two items.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">I urge the Government to consider scaling up the jobs initiative.  One euro invested in job creation for every 70 spent to cover the debts of failed businesses does not feel like the right balance.  I ask the Government if that is the best outcome for the 440,000 people out of work and the additional 30,000 people who may lose their jobs this year.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoanCollins" eId="spk_188">
          <from>Deputy Joan Collins</from>
          <p eId="para_311">Before the general election, Fine Gael and the Labour Party called for a jobs stimulus plan to kick-start the economy.  After the election they spoke about a jobs budget which has now been downgraded to a modest jobs initiative.  I agree that it should be called modest.  These proposals are very modest.  The figure we have heard is, in effect, 10,000 jobs.  This will hardly make a dent in the number — 440,000 — officially unemployed, not to mention the many thousands unofficially unemployed.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">The Government is committed to cutting 20,000 jobs in public services, with a knock-on effect in the private sector of at least 5,000 job losses.  The IDA has always calculated that the creation of one productive job leads to the creation of a further three.  The loss of one productive job will, obviously, have the opposite effect of causing the loss of a further three.  Therefore, the figure of 5,000 could be much greater.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">The deflation of the economy through massive austerity tax measures in the past two years is a key factor in the high rise in the level of unemployment.  I agree with the Tánaiste, Deputy Eamonn Gilmore, that Fianna Fáil Members should hang their heads in shame every time they come into the Chamber.  In fact, they should wear sackcloth because they were the ones who brought us to this position.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">What will be the effect of a further three years of austerity measures?  We will have minimum economic growth — the best possible scenario is one of stagnation.  The rate of growth in GDP will remain at approximately 2%, while in the case of GNP it will be 0.5% to1%.  Moreover, the best possible scenario depends on the continuation of economic recovery internationally and growth in world trade, which is not guaranteed.  The other issue is whether we can meet IMF-EU targets, which is also not guaranteed, as it depends on growth being achieved.  This will mean even deeper austerity being demanded.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">The idea of a job creation programme which this initiative is certainly not and talk about creating jobs while the key thrust of Government policy is massive austerity amount to a contradiction.  We cannot deal with the problems associated with mass unemployment and emigration while continuing to deflate the economy.  Not one country has got out of recession by deflating its economy.  The first step of any serious strategy to tackle the jobs crisis would be to fundamentally break with the idea that we can cut the deficit by making cuts.  It would also require breaking with the crazy idea that the resources available such as the National Pensions Reserve Fund cannot be used to stimulate the economy but can only be used to pour further billions of euro into zombie banks.  Unless the Government is prepared to break with the policy of austerity and pouring billions of euro into a black hole, all that can be done is what the Government has done, namely, come to the Chamber and through sleight of hand move figures around in capital programmes and bring in another crazy levy on pension funds, while claiming there will be no more new taxes.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">With regard to pensions, there was a clever sleight of hand today when the Labour Party announced that people were receiving big tax incentives owing to measures brought forward by Fianna Fáil.  Many workers, such as those in Guinness, were conned into taking out pension plans to protect their futures when they retired and they will now be affected by this measure.  It is a con job and those on the Government benches know it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusHealy" eId="spk_189">
          <from>Deputy Seamus Healy</from>
          <p eId="para_317">This is a minor and totally inadequate response to what is, in effect, a national economic and social emergency.  It was highlighted first as a jobs budget, then as a jobs initiative and, more recently by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, as a modest measure.  It certainly bears no comparison to the various commitments given by both Fine Gael and the Labour Party in the course of the last general election campaign.  My recollection is that there was talk of 100,000 jobs and 50,000 training places being created.  This is a very modest measure, as admitted by the Minister, when what we need is a very serious jobs initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">The past three years have effectively seen a jobs destruction programme which has destroyed approximately 100,000 jobs each year, yet the Government assumes power and effectively takes over the programme of the outgoing Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government and continues a deflationary programme of cuts to services and benefits, as well as increases in taxes.  That deflationary process is making the crisis and number of job losses even worse.  We also have the continuation of job destruction in the public service, in which the Government is committed to not filling posts to the tune of approximately 25,000 jobs.  In summary, we have a very modest proposal, to use the Minister's own words, and an overall programme which is being carried on by the Government from that of the previous Government and which is, effectively, a jobs destruction programme.  In addition, we have the destruction of 25,000 jobs in the public sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">In the past three years we have taken €14 billion out of the economy, which means less money is available for job creation.  It has also had a particular impact on small businesses and service industries.  If one walks down the main street of any town in the country, one will find numerous shops and offices closed and continuing to close.  This year we will pay approximately €5.9 billion to the European Union.  However, by 2014 we will be paying €10 billion to €11 billion, which is completely unsustainable.  What is happening is that middle and low income families and those generally dependent on social welfare are paying for the recession they had no hand, act or part in creating.  On the other hand, very wealthy individuals are not being taxed and pay no wealth tax.  At this stage, we cannot afford to make the repayments to the European Union and the IMF.  Therefore, we cannot afford to have tax exiles who pay no tax in this country and we cannot afford a situation where the super rich 6% of the population, with €250 billion in assets, are paying no wealth tax.  As I have said previously in the House, the bondholders have to be burned.  I support a default, which I would like to see done in a structured and negotiated way.  However, if it cannot be done in that way, it will have to be done unilaterally.  Nonetheless, these measures will not be enough.  We need to ensure moneys will be made available through taxing very wealthy individuals.  There should be a little patriotism shown by the super rich.  An emergency 20% levy should be applied to the super rich and there should be an ongoing wealth tax of approximately 5%.  After all these measures, the individuals concerned would still be super-rich.  It is time the Government ensured they paid a proper wealth tax and an emergency levy in the current year.</p>

        <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_190">
          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_320">I agree with the Government and the earlier comments made by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, in dismissing with contempt the criticism and prescriptions of the Fianna Fáil Party when it comes to the Government's jobs initiative.  The unemployment crisis arises directly from Fianna Fáil's collusion with bankers and developers whose greed stoked up the property bubble that has caused the economy to crash and led to mass unemployment.  It arises from Fianna Fáil's decision to collude with the European Union to protect the bankers and bondholders and transfer their gambling debts onto the backs of Irish workers in the form of brutal, unjust and economically crippling austerity measures.  The deficit problem we face which is essentially denuding us of the revenues necessary to fund a real fiscal stimulus programme arises from Fianna Fáil's squandering of successive massive budget surpluses in the form of tax breaks for the super wealthy which have narrowed the tax base to unsustainable levels.  However, if it was the cabal of Fianna Fáil, the bankers, the developers and, more recently, the EU authorities which created the economic crisis which has led to massive unemployment which is blighting the lives of 450,000 people and their families, the Government comprising Fine Gael and Labour Party has a responsibility to clear up the mess.  That is why it was elected with the slogan "Let's get Ireland working".  A centrepiece of the pre-election sloganeering was talk of the jobs budget.  At the time it was said this measure would inject massive stimulus and produce in the region of 100,000 jobs.  In that context it is very important to say that when we talk about jobs we must mean net jobs.  It is no good claiming these initiatives will create so many thousands of jobs if, at the same time, the Government's other actions lead directly to tens of thousands of job losses elsewhere.  There are 2,000 jobs to go in AIB, for example, with many further thousands likely to go as a result of the Government's bank restructuring problems.  Net job losses number tens of thousands as a result of the public sector recruitment embargo.  Other tens of thousands are being lost yearly as a result of small business closures due to the impact on people's spending power of measures such as the universal social charge and other income cuts or the job losses that will certainly follow if the Government insists on going through with the sale of vital State assets and companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">It is in the context of the massive haemorrhaging of jobs, as a result of depressed demand, the public sector recruitment embargo and a devastating hangover from the collapse of the construction sector, that we must judge this jobs budget, which was, first, an initiative, then a fiscally neutral initiative and latterly a modest proposal.  In this context the modest proposal is a spectacular non-event, a damp squib to beat all damp squibs.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">Reductions in employers' PRSI for employees earning up to some €356 per week and the plan to review the JLCs and REAs effectively mean incentivising low pay in the economy which will further depress demand and attack the wages and conditions of workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">The stimulus elements of this initiative, by my calculation, will produce perhaps some thousand jobs directly.  The focus on tourism, while it may be welcome and may produce some stimulus in that area, frankly worries me.  When one looks at other countries where the IMF has come in and devastated the indigenous manufacturing and domestic economy all that is left is tourism.  Essentially, poor countries are left begging for the tourist dollar while the rest of the economy goes down the toilet.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">The jobs initiative simply does not address the root or scale of the problem and, in many cases, goes in the wrong direction.  What is needed is serious direct investment in strategic industries, public works programmes that put people back to work and the development of vital infrastructure, services, schools, hospitals and all the rest of it.  In this regard, this budget is a spectacular failure.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_328">This Government was elected with a mandate to sort out the country's extremely difficult fiscal and banking crises.  I do not believe anybody expects that will be done in an incredibly rapid period.  Rather it will be a piece of work whereby actions are taken across a series of different fronts, with the aim of getting people and business back to work.  That is the critical issue.  Although the measures announced on Tuesday are relatively modest and were presented by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in a modest fashion, the hubristic presentations of the Celtic tiger years would not be appropriate.  The initiative will be judged by its outcome which will take some time to work through.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">Across a range of Departments where Government has influence over spending, the Government will direct spending in a way that will help to create employment, specifically in shovel-ready projects and those that are localised and relatively small in scale.  That will be a way of ensuring the spend goes into the economy.  Equally, the reduction in VAT on tourism services and other services such as hairdressing relates to services which are provided at a local level throughout the country and are not concentrated in one specific sector, area or city region such as Dublin.  This will have the greatest possibility of producing jobs at a local level, one consequence of which should be assistance to consumer confidence.  No modern economy runs without consumer confidence in spending.  All of us know that although many people have lost employment or have had enormous reductions in their income and take home pay, equally there are people who have a spending capacity but who, by and large, are nervous and frightened of spending, for all the reasons we know.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">The Government is serious about helping people to get back to work.  This is what joined-up Government looks like — measures to help job creation together with measures to help people who take advantage of these jobs, which is where the training places will apply.  I will make some points on that issue and on the role of my Department in the national internship programme.  This is a different type of recession and the skills needs of those who find themselves unemployed are widely varied.  There are tens of thousands of people from the construction industry who did much hard work and made good earnings during the high years of the Celtic tiger but many of them have relatively low education levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">There are two areas which had gaps in provision and these are addressed in this package.  People who already have a degree or diploma who want to do a Masters or to requalify to do something else can do so and retain their social welfare payments through the springboard, part-time, third level programme.  In Germany, for example, every time there is a recession and workers go on short-term the balance of their time is made up by investing in quality training and skills development.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">The second part of our programme is internships for people, which in the main is targeted at and, I suspect, will be largely taken up by those people who have come out of college relatively recently or who have finished their apprenticeship and served their time.  They need a foot in the door.  The national internship programme is a way of breaking the cycle in which one cannot get a job without experience and cannot get experience without a job.  For many people who have qualified in recent years, either as apprentices or as graduates, this is a Catch-22.  Employers will not look at one unless one has the magic of experience; equally one cannot get experience unless one has some kind of placement or job.  This is one way, therefore, of giving valuable experience, the foot in the door, the start on the ladder, to people who have qualifications but have not been able to exercise them in the current very depressed jobs market.  It is also a way of stemming the brain drain and keeping this young talent in Ireland, at least for some time.  Most people in this situation have already been thinking about, if not actually applying for, emigrating for a period.  Nobody has a difficulty with any person from Ireland going and living abroad for a few years.  I went abroad and worked in Africa for three years during the 1980s.  Many people in this Chamber have gone abroad, worked and got valuable experience abroad before returning home.  That is what we hope will happen to those who go abroad nowadays.  Equally, however, there are people who do not have that option and those who simply cannot get their foot in the doorway of jobs experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">We expect the private sector companies that will benefit from such talent and which have been specifically invited to support the national internship programme to step up to the plate and provide decent internship opportunities.  We will call on companies, including those in the semi-State sector, to play their part together with the public sector and the voluntary and community sectors if they are interested in the internship scheme, as I hope they will be.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">We are in a national emergency.  Some 444,000 plus of our fellow men and women, citizens, are on the live register.  Some 80,000 of the people on the live register are under 25 years of age.  One half of those classified as unemployed are long-term unemployed.  The increase of 20,000 training and internship places catering to different levels of skills and different needs is simply the beginning of a stepped up effort by the Government to help people back into employment or to prepare for new kinds of jobs.  The internship scheme will provide 5,000 unemployed people with an internship opportunity ranging from six to nine months in an organisation in the private, public, community or voluntary sectors.  This happens in other countries, especially in the United States of America and in the institutions of the European Union.  Many people in the House will be familiar with the notion of internships or <i>stagiaires</i> in the European Union.  These programmes provide a valuable opportunity for high-level graduates with high-level qualifications and people who have practical training to get work.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">Participants in the national internship programme will continue to be paid social welfare payments as well as an additional payment, a top-up allowance of €50 per week, on top of their existing social welfare entitlement.  The internship proposal serves to break the cycle of not being able to get into the jobs market in the current situation because of a lack of experience.  One key benefit of the national internship scheme is that it will step in.  The scheme will provide participants with a chance to prove that they have the necessary skills and commitment to make a valuable contribution to the work of an organisation.  Many multinational companies which operate in Ireland already run such schemes, especially in their home countries.  In some cases they run internship schemes in Ireland already.  People from these companies have said to me and other members of Government that they are especially interested in supporting such an initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">I trust there will be widespread interest in this measure.  Will it solve the whole financial crisis?  No, it will not.  However, as Mao said, a journey of 1,000 miles begins with one small step.  The announcement by the Government this week is the beginning of an intensive focus on jobs, training and how to get people to have the skills they need to operate in the modern economy.  Improving our skills basis will be one critical element in making Ireland more competitive.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">The national internship scheme will go live on 1 July.  It will be supported by appropriate information and websites for sponsors and people who wish to apply for the scheme.  I am confident there will be strong interest in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">We will evaluate the scheme to determine what the experience has been.  I was very pleased that there were 5,000 places on the Tús scheme but I was somewhat shocked to find out when I came to the Department that, some four or five months after the scheme had been launched and advertised, there was no one on it.  The critical thing in all these initiatives announced by Government is to ensure that from the announcement we move to implementation and take up.  I am confident that there will be more than 1,000 people on Tús by the end of June.  Once the internship scheme begins in July I am confident there will be a significant pick-up in a relatively short period.</p>

        <speech by="#PaschalDonohoe" eId="spk_195">
          <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe</from>
          <p eId="para_339">Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett and his colleagues might be disturbed to note that when he was speaking I was in mind of something President Barack Obama said.  The title of his book is "The Audacity of Hope".  From listening to the contributions of those speakers, it strikes me that we are approaching the point where there is almost something audacious about saying that we have hope, about believing that we can make a difference and about stating that the economy is still rich in possibility and still has many options.  The job of this Government is to be alive to these possibilities and to do all it can to put in place measures to allow people to fulfil their potential.  This is what the jobs initiative is all about.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">Let us recap briefly some elements of the jobs initiative.  We will abolish a tax, we will halve another tax and we will significantly reduce another tax, the rate of VAT, on labour intensive industries.  A colleague of mine, Senator Michael D'Arcy, summed up the matter well when he stated that there is much focus on the green economy and the smart economy but we must have greater focus on the cash economy, that is to say, the money people are spending today, its potential and the money people have in their bank accounts.  They need confidence to spend it and we need the ability to get new people into the State to spend the money they have.  This is the reason the initiative should be supported.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">As I was listening to some speakers earlier today I was reminded of the dreariness of Opposition, wherein, no matter how good the ideas, one was compelled at times to stand up and oppose them.  I am certain that in the case of many of the ideas these speakers were criticising, including the national internship programme and the increased spend on schools, the same speakers will have been contacting people in their constituencies to let them know of the schemes and will have contacted schools to ensure they were aware of the potential expenditure that could be coming their way.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">The Government is faced with an Opposition divided.  One part is made up of the party that led the State to the brink and the other part with individuals and some parties that are determined to push the State over that brink.  The Government will not allow either to happen.  In her speech, the Minister, Deputy Burton, referred to the fact that 80,000 people under the age of 25 years of age are without a job in this State.  There are 80,000 reasons to support this initiative, to ensure the money is well spent and delivered against the targets.  Deputy Donnelly made a good point in this regard: we must understand the targets and we must ensure they are verified.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">Two initiatives on which the Government is working in the longer term will supplement this work.  We must continue to do all we can to tackle the issue of rent reviews.  Unless we do this the cost of doing business in Ireland will not fall aggressively and quickly.  We must reduce the cost of failure by reforming and changing bankruptcy laws in the State.  We must reduce the costs associated with people caught up in unanticipated difficulties when they start a business and who are not allowed start all over again.  This work, which is longer-term in nature and is perhaps somewhat softer in comparison to the harder plans announced yesterday, will provide the framework within which the Government will tackle the greatest social crisis we face, that is to say, the hundreds of thousands of people who are unemployed and the vast level of stress and difficulty this is causing their families.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatrickODonovan" eId="spk_196">
          <from>Deputy Patrick O’Donovan</from>
          <p eId="para_344">It was refreshing to listen to Deputy Stephen Donnelly, an Opposition Member, speak in the Chamber having listened to the other contributions made in recent days and to hear an Opposition spokesperson taking his role as responsibly as he is.  I found his contribution refreshing and enlightening.  It shows that he is taking the stance that for him it is not opposition for opposition's sake and he has not joined the ranks of the ATM soundbites that have graced the halls of this place since the election.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">It may have escaped the notice of some people but there is a crisis facing the country with close on 500,000 people who do not have the quality of life such that they can get up in the morning and go to work.  It may have escaped the notice of some people in the Chamber that this measure is simply a start.  All the criticism that we received focuses on the promises we made during the general election.  Promises and commitments were made during the general election but they were for a Government and this Government plans on staying in office for five years.  This is day 63 of the Government's tenure so I applaud the Minister for Finance and his Government colleagues for this initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">I welcome the comments of the Minister for Social Protection.  The internship programme will be essential in getting us out of this because there are two critical areas for the future of the economy: the indigenous tourism and agriculture sectors.  Emphasis has been placed on tourism but it is appropriate the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is here with the Minister for Social Protection.  There is scope for those who are not the sons or daughters of family farmers to engage in internship programmes on farms and to bring back farm apprenticeship schemes.  The European Union and the rest of the world will need food and Ireland is very good at providing a welcome to tourists and is exceptionally good at producing high quality food.  That must be looked at.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">Deputy Donohoe referred to the air travel tax.  It is now up to the two airlines, Ryanair and Aer Lingus, to put their money where their mouths are.  They were vocal in insisting that the air travel tax be abolished.  It is now gone.  I am interested in the routes out of Shannon Airport that were closed because they offer the potential for massive numbers of people to come to the mid-western region and we have a great deal to offer people in the Limerick-Clare-Tipperary region.  I hope the airlines that have previously closed lines there will now reopen them.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">The Minister for Finance mentioned labour activation measures and the Minister for Social Protection has agreed with him, pointing out that it is difficult to get a job without experience and difficult to get experience without a job.  This is hugely welcome.  I have seen people my age coming out of university to wander around aimlessly before eventually leaving the country.  Anything that can be done in Ireland to encourage graduates to stay at home must be a good thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">I ask the Minister to consider the whole area of apprenticeships.  Apprentices are being left in limbo at present, where they are nearly but not quite qualified.  In some cases, even if they have a job to go to, they cannot start it because they cannot get their papers.  If there is anything the Minister can do to support small indigenous business to bring back those apprentices so they can finish and enter the labour market, I would fully support her.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">The self-employed and small businesses are competing with people who are being subsidised by the Department of Social Protection while they operate in the black economy.  I have raised this issue with the Minister before but we must clamp down on this, we cannot afford to send out the signal that it is acceptable for a person not to pay a fair share while expecting a neighbour to subsidise him.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanSmith" eId="spk_197">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_351">I welcome the opportunity to make contribution on the jobs initiative announced by the Minister for Finance on Tuesday.  Along with my Fianna Fáil colleagues, I welcome some of the initiatives while questioning some of the omissions and some of the measures that have been introduced.  I welcome the emphasis on tourism, which is appropriate in view of the high profile visits to the country in the next two weeks, which give us the opportunity to showcase our people, our products and our welcome for visitors.  We all hope those visits go well in every way.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">We also welcome the labour activation measures.  I had the opportunity in Private Members' time to table a motion, which was accepted by the Government, and to discuss with the Minister for Education and Skills, on the need to grow numbers as quickly as possible to facilitate people to take part in labour activation measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">I welcome the reduced costs and the reduction in VAT for restaurants and other outlets.  I hope those reductions will be passed on to consumers, we have seen in the past the Government reducing costs but the benefits were not passed on to the consumer.  We hope there is a proper response by the hospitality and tourism sector to a worthwhile initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">The Minister referred in his speech to the fact that our economic recovery will be export-led.  I am glad Deputy McEntee, the Minister of State in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is here, because his Department and the relevant agencies have a critical role to play to ensure we maximise the potential of those sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">To mark Europe Day last Monday, we had the opportunity to listen to an address by Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, the European Commissioner for Science, Research and Innovation.  She made a good speech to Members and following her statement that our tax cannot be changed unilaterally in Europe, that it must be a unanimous decision by all member states, the Minister for Finance referred to the 12.5% rate of corporation tax as being here to stay, and said there can be no deviation.  We put a motion to that effect before the House a number of weeks ago during Private Members' time but the Government did not accept the wording.  I hope the commitment outlined here by the Minister for Finance will be strictly adhered to by his Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">The Minister for Finance referred to the research and development tax credit scheme and the Commissioner spoke about the huge opportunities for Government, the statutory agencies and the private sector to draw down substantial funding in the whole area of research and development because there is a new emphasis by the European Commission on a ring-fenced budget for research and development and innovation.  People may not be aware that many of our agencies and Departments have been very successful in drawing down substantial funding through different EU programmes.  My knowledge comes from the success of Teagasc in drawing down major funding in the areas of research and innovation that are critical so we can develop new products to add value.  Many of our top quality young scientists and researchers are gainfully employed by Teagasc and other agencies because of funding that comes from central Government and worthwhile programmes it has devised.  The worthwhile nature of such proposals was recognised by the European Commission and funded accordingly.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">I am glad the Minister has improved the tax credit scheme.  Once, as a Minister, I met a multinational company in the United States that has a significant base in this country.  The executives spoke in particular about the importance of the research and development tax credit scheme and corporation tax.  These are critical measures to ensure we retain jobs and grow additional job opportunities for our people.  That whole area of research and development is critical and I am glad the Irish nominee to the European Commission is the Commissioner charged with responsibility for this area.  Central Government, Ministers and officials in Departments and the relevant statutory agencies have ready access to the Commissioner and her officials to ensure we continue to draw down the maximum level of funding to assist us in the investment, research and innovation that will be commercialised and that will create jobs on this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">When we speak about Irish submissions, we are referring very often to submissions that have been made on an all-island basis.  We have very good co-operation between the two agriculture Departments, North and South, and between all the relevant agencies.  A huge level of co-operation is ongoing between universities, third level institutions and other research agencies, which is good because we cannot live in isolation.  It is appropriate those applications are often jointly submitted.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">Over the past number of years we have been in a position to provide new laboratory facilities.  Those are of critical importance but equally important is the cohort of well qualified and enthusiastic young people in our research institutes.  They are critically important for food and other industries.  Research and development covers all sectors of manufacturing.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">Deputy Patrick O'Donovan referred to the need to ensure that the agrifood sector is encouraged and I agree with him.  I was disappointed that the Minister for Finance did not refer to the agrifood sector in his contribution last Tuesday when he referred to export-led growth because, thankfully, over the past 18 months in particular, there has been a resurgence in the agrifood sector, including fisheries.  There has been a growing realisation in the past 18 to 20 months of the potential of that sector to contribute significantly to the regeneration of the economy and to the creation of much-needed employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">I am pleased that the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee is present.  We must ensure a good result from the Common Agricultural Policy review.  I listened to the contributions of the Members of the European Parliament who spoke here on Monday.  I hope the finalisation of the review will occur during the Irish Presidency in early 2013 because such support for the primary producer and the agrifood sector is critical to ensuring resultant job creation in manufacturing and in food enterprises throughout the country. There are more than 600 enterprises widely dispersed and by their nature they are very well accommodated in rural Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">Some members of the Government have been putting out a message that the previous Government disengaged from Europe.  This is incorrect.  I had responsibility for the agriculture, food and fisheries sectors and we were very involved at both political and official levels in all discussions on the Common Fisheries Policy, the Common Agricultural Policy, talks on Mercosur or on the World Trade Organisation.  At different times, like-minded member states have grouped together to deal with particular issues such as the WTO talks or the Common Agricultural Policy.  On most occasions those groups have been established, led and chaired by the Irish Minister, as was the case with me and many of my predecessors.  I am sure the Ministers and their departmental officials will still do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">It is incorrect for any Minister to say that the previous Government was not totally engaged in Europe at all levels.  We put forward the Irish arguments and viewpoints and we ensured, as Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn said, that in most instances, Ireland punched above its weight with regard to schemes and policy reviews which are common to the European Union.  The Common Fisheries Policy and the Common Agricultural Policy are the two policies within the European Union which are common to all 27 member states and which are critical to Ireland.  Along with the then Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, I had the opportunity to argue that Ireland needed a properly and adequately resourced Common Agricultural Policy.  We need direct payments to continue and we need to ensure support for environmental schemes and that active farmers are prioritised in the disbursement of funds.  These are important measures and policies which the previous Government supported and they need to be continued.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">We must ensure that we will achieve a successful outcome in the review of the Common Agricultural Policy.  The decoupling payments and direct payments to Irish farmers need to be continued.  Given the volatility in commodity prices in world markets the market must be supported when prices take a downturn.  President Barroso and the European Commission were adamant about the need to secure agreement with the Mercosur countries but this would not be to the advantage of Ireland and the proposal is not acceptable.  I hope the Government continues to make strong representations at every opportunity at political and official level and at ministerial and heads of government level that the Mercosur deal as proposed and considered by the European Commission and by the trade Commissioner is not acceptable to this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">The extra funding for school building projects announced in the jobs initiative is welcome.  I do not understand how it can be announced in a press release that €40 million more is available for school building projects.  I acknowledge that €30 million is available this year and this is to be welcomed but I understand that €20 million of this funding is being diverted from the third level capital fund.  The facts should be laid out clearly.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">I am pleased there is additional funding for the summer works scheme because all of us as public representatives have seen the value of this scheme and the devolved grants scheme.  They represent a good return on the money spent, a much better return than in the old days of the planning and design and the tendering processes which did not result in value for money.  During the past six or seven years, the introduction of the devolved grants scheme, the contingency grants scheme and the summer works grants scheme have all been beneficial from the point of view of upgrading, at good value to the taxpayer, so many classrooms and the provision of additional classrooms and accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">The value for money audit of smaller schools is a concern for people in rural Ireland.  There has been a welcome and much-needed investment in the upgrading of facilities in small schools over the past years and which is giving a good return for money.  I know of instances in my own constituency and county where a summer works scheme costing €80,000 to €100,000 has transformed a school as opposed to hundreds of thousands being spent on projects.  I welcome the additional funding provided in the summer works scheme which I am sure will be put to good use.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">Small rural schools are central to rural communities.  I attended an event in my own county yesterday at which the Protestant community was very well represented.  Many senior church figures spoke to me because they are concerned about the possible threat to small schools.  County Cavan has five or six Church of Ireland schools spread over a big rural county.  Most have enrolments of under 50 pupils but all of these schools have been refurbished or will have new accommodation provided over the next years.  We need clarification as quickly as possible that such schools are not under threat because the communities are concerned.  I have raised this issue with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, and I am sure he will be receptive to the needs of those schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">The unfortunate growth in unemployment in the past few years has resulted in an increased demand from jobseekers for upskilling, reskilling and activation measures and approximately double the number of places were provided in the period 2008 to 2010.  Fianna Fáil has been committed to a policy of vocational retraining for many years and to the type of training opportunities close to the labour market which ensure jobseekers remain ready for work.  We also believe in the importance of providing training for people according to their own abilities.  Not all learners are suited to a training or academic environment and therefore it is essential to ensure there is flexibility and diversity of provision in order to meet the training needs of Ireland's modern economy.  Whether in Government or in opposition, Fianna Fáil firmly believes in outlining its clear policy that it is right for the State to play a role not just in the facilitation and quality assurance of training activation measures but in their direct provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">The State's training and employment agency, FÁS, has had mixed coverage over the past years.  One's view of FÁS is often influenced by where one comes from.    I have a good view of the work of FÁS in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan and in the north east in general.  I refer particularly to its provision of schemes and services at local level.  It is wrong for us to make bland general assertions about the usefulness, worthiness and ability of any major private or public sector organisation or agency in meeting its remit.  I am biased in the case of FÁS because I am familiar with the quality of the personnel who work for it in my local area.  I know they have worked extremely hard over the years to serve the north east well.  They have worked with local communities to offer community employment schemes and other services.  They have also worked with individuals.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">A number of changes have been initiated over recent years to improve the delivery of employment, training and community services to the public.  Related responsibilities in those areas have been brought together.  A commitment was made to ensure a freshly mandated State training provider would be put in place.  That process was commenced by the Tánaiste in the previous Government.  The current programme for Government provides that a new skills agency will be established.  I hope that will be done at the earliest possible date.  This is one of the crucial factors that is affecting the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">I would like to say two or three things about tourism.  I have already referred to the high-profile visits to Ireland that will take place in the coming weeks.  My colleague, Deputy Browne, mentioned this morning that the marketing initiatives of the relevant agencies are often quite outdated.  I have noticed that newspaper advertisements encouraging people to visit counties Cavan, Monaghan or Meath, for example, seem to be more numerous towards the end of the year.  I have often wondered whether additional funding is made available to State tourism agencies at that time of the year.  Perhaps such agencies have to spend the money at that time or risk having it taken from them.  That might not be a fair comment on my part.  I hope it is not the case and that this phenomenon is part of a better marketing initiative.  Thankfully, Tourism Ireland has been established on an all-Ireland basis.  I understand there is good co-operation between the relevant Departments on either side of the Border.  When I served in government, I was pleased to have an opportunity to work with a Northern Ireland Minister, Arlene Foster, on the launch of a tourism initiative in counties Cavan and Fermanagh.  I am sure that will continue under the current Government here and the new Executive in the North.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">The relevant promotion agencies have failed miserably to promote Ireland to the domestic market.  One of my colleagues, Councillor Pat Conaty, rang me last year after the opening of a new motorway to ask why the then Government was not placing a significant emphasis on reminding the public that Ireland is an extremely small island.  If one is in south-west Cork, nowadays it does not take one as long to travel the distance to the Glens of Antrim, Derry or other parts of the northern half of this country.  Similarly, journey times from west to east have decreased.  The fact that all parts of this small island are within easy reach of potential visitors and tourists should be more effectively marketed.  We understand the need to attract visitors from overseas, but there should be a new emphasis on ensuring people realise that the Glens of Antrim are now more easily accessible from counties Wexford and Waterford and other parts of the south east, or counties Cork and Kerry and other parts of the south west.  The reverse is also the case, of course.  The significant progress that has been made in reducing journey times across this island, for example by completing the motorways and improving the road network, offers great potential to the tourism sector.  We should ensure we derive the maximum benefit from our infrastructural strengths in the context of an all-island economy.</p>

          <from>Deputy Dominic Hannigan</from>
          <p eId="para_376">I am delighted to speak on the jobs initiative, which is one of the first pieces of good news this House has had with regard to jobs for some time.  During the recent general election campaign, I encountered at first hand the consequences of unemployment in this country.  Almost 12,000 people in County Meath are without work.  Many people have emigrated to find work elsewhere.  Some unemployed people are not registered as being unemployed.  Each of them represents a loss of potential to this country and to themselves.  We need to get them back to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">My own background is in business.  When I established a small business in the early 1990s, I learned that a good business environment is vital if small and medium sized enterprises are to survive.  Some 90% of businesses in County Meath employ fewer than nine people.  They are not global brands — they are local, family-run businesses.  Over half of the workforce of County Meath works for such companies.  If we are to get out of the recession, we need to make sure that such companies — new and existing ones — can create new jobs.  It is important for the Oireachtas to stimulate a climate that is friendly to enterprise.  The jobs initiative that was published this week provides for policies like the reform of the PRSI system and a programme for graduate internships.  I know that these targeted sectoral initiatives will help to create a positive business environment because many of the measures in the jobs initiative were suggested by small businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">Before the election, I held a series of seminars across County Meath with business people from various sectors including green energy, arts and crafts, artisan foods and tourism.  At the seminars, I asked them to highlight to us the obstacles and problems they face as they run their businesses and to suggest some solutions and improvements.  Some of the suggestions that were made should be easy to implement.  It was proposed that we should make it easier to get planning permission to erect signs for rural businesses.  Many such businesses find it hard to generate business because people simply cannot find them.  Other suggestions were made as well.  The issue of access to credit was raised at every seminar.  The establishment of a partial credit scheme that was announced in the jobs initiative will allow some businesses to expand their operations.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">Many business people have told me they are positive about the possibility of further growth in the export market.  The US, the UK and other EU countries are all set to enjoy significant economic growth over the coming years.  I would like to refer specifically to five countries.  It is estimated that Brazil will enjoy economic growth of 4% this year and that Russia will have 4.5% growth.  Both India and China will experience economic growth of 9% this year.  The relevant figure for South Africa is estimated at 6%.  These countries represent 40% of the world's population and 15% of its economy.  Each of them has a growing middle class with an increasing amount of discretionary spending power.  There is ample opportunity for Ireland to develop a marketing strategy to ensure our small, medium-sized and large Irish firms can sell their products in such countries.  Our embassies and consulates in these countries have good links in the local economies.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs recently met our ambassadors from our EU embassies.  I suggest he should call our ambassadors to Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa to ask them to transmit the message that Ireland needs jobs and is open for tourism.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">On that note, the creation of a tourism VAT rate of 9% is positive news.  I think it will lead additional tourists to come to Irish shores from traditional and newer markets.  Restaurants, hotels and travel companies can expect to benefit from this measure.  I have no doubt that it will lead to the creation of thousands of jobs.  We are realistic about the jobs initiative.  We know the measures that have been proposed will only go so far.  This is not the end of the story as far as we are concerned.  We see the initiative as the beginning of a process that will get this country back to work.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CiaraConway" eId="spk_201">
          <from>Deputy Ciara Conway</from>
          <p eId="para_381">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Government's jobs initiative, which should be seen for what it is — a positive beginning that will bring certain benefits and represents a small step on the road to recovery as we clean up the mess that was left behind by the previous Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">Like Deputy Smith, I am keen to focus on tourism.  He made a valid point when he said we should focus on the internal market in Ireland.  We have a great deal to offer to people throughout the country.  The Minister for Finance has made a number of welcome changes which I believe will be very beneficial to this sector.  This area can be expanded on in Ireland as a whole and especially in my constituency of Waterford.  The 9% VAT rate will become effective from July.  As we have heard, it will benefit a number of businesses including restaurants, catering companies, hotels, cinemas and other cultural attractions.  Ireland is well known for its culture and history.  I do not doubt that it can be used to bring many thousands of visitors to our shores.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">It has been well documented that Ireland will receive two high profile visitors in the coming weeks.  I draw Deputies' attention to a third high profile visit, which will take place between 30 June and 3 July when the Tall Ships Festival comes to Waterford city.  The festival will be beneficial to traders, as will the reduction in the VAT rate, as they prepare for the 500,000 visitors expected in the city.  This is an unprecedented event which I am sure the rest of the country is also looking forward to.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">County Waterford is building on its reputation for food.  The south and south-east region is fast gaining a reputation as the culinary centre of Ireland.  We have a strong tradition of producing top quality, locally grown food and Waterford boasts some of the nation's top chefs, including one who has been awarded a Michelin star, who are committed to using the best quality local produce.  I draw attention to this area because the food sector relies heavily on agriculture.  We hope the reduction in the VAT rate will have a ripple effect and will benefit growers and others involved in agriculture by stimulating an increase in demand.  I commend the Government's efforts to build on the tourism trade and hope initiatives in this area will create positive effects for those who have been affected by the scourge of unemployment.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">The initiatives to create training places and employment through schemes such as the summer works scheme and the upgrading of roads are to be welcomed as a first step in the right direction.  The Government is barely in the door, having not yet passed the 100 day mark, and we have much cleaning up to do.  I, for one, am prepared to roll up my sleeves and do what is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">I remind the House of some of the figures on unemployment which, thanks to the previous Fianna Fáil led Government, have soared.  In the final quarter of 2010, unemployment stood at 14.7% compared to 13.1% in 2009 and 8.1% at the end of 2008.  In April 2011, 28,270 people were signing on the live register in County Waterford, of whom more than 11,700 were in the city.  These are staggering statistics and I am mindful that they refer to many lives and households.  The Government must do everything in its power to reverse these worrying figures and in that respect this week's jobs initiative must be viewed as a positive step forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">The reversal of the reduction in the minimum wage is an important step.  Let us hope the reversal of this cut, which should not have been made in the first instance, will put more money in the pockets of lower earners and restore some of the spending power stolen from them by the previous Government.  Under the programme for Government, the Labour Party is committed to getting people off the dole queue and back to work and as an elected representative for Waterford, I am committed to securing jobs for people in my constituency.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">The health implications of long-term unemployment have been well-documented.  We know that unemployment affects emotional well-being and career prospects and its effects endure the longer a person is out of work.  A title of a study published in the United States in July 2010 — Lost Income, Lost Friends — and Loss of Self-Respect — succinctly summed up the impact of long-term unemployment.  Let us hope this initiative will provide better employment prospects and help restore the self-esteem many people have lost.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KevinHumphreys" eId="spk_202">
          <from>Deputy Kevin Humphreys</from>
          <p eId="para_389">I join the previous speaker in welcoming the jobs initiative which was introduced only nine weeks into the life of the Government.  While it is a modest proposal and first step, it is also a statement of intent by the Government that despite the economic troubles, our focus is on getting the country back to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">I welcome Deputy Brendan Smith's positive approach to the initiative, especially as some of the previous responses from Opposition Deputies were highly negative.  Today's contributions have been notable for their greater positivity, with the exception of those of Deputies from the People Before Profit Alliance which objects to everything and does not find positives in anything.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">I propose to respond to Deputy Crowe's positive comments on the apprenticeship scheme.  As a member of Dublin City Council, I was heavily involved in getting a pilot scheme up and running to allow apprentices finish their term.  We must allow young people to complete their apprenticeships and obtain a qualification in order that they have an opportunity to secure employment when the uplift comes or can emigrate for a number of years, as I did, before returning to contribute their skills to the economy.  I welcome Deputy Crowe's remarks and ask the Minister to consider carefully his proposal to establish a scheme to allow those who have served three or four years to complete their apprenticeship.  I also ask him to expand the schemes in place in local authorities in the Dublin region and perhaps extend them to the Office of Public Works and local authorities nationwide.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">The recent general election campaign will have made all Deputies aware of the pain of unemployment being experienced by virtually every household.  We all know someone who is long-term unemployed and all of us are familiar with the effects of unemployment, including depression and chaotic lifestyles.  As I stated, the jobs initiative is only a first step and will not resolve the problem of 460,000 people unemployed.  I hope, however, that it sends a clear message that this House is serious about working together to get people back to work.  The majority of Deputies who spoke today made positive contributions and put forward good ideas which can be built on and expanded.  I commend Members who have approached this debate in a positive manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">The number of people signing on in Dublin continues to rise.  The latest figures from the Central Statistics Office show an above average increase in unemployment in Dublin compared to the rest of the country.  Every organ of Government must focus on job creation as we tackle the mess we inherited from the previous Government.  The proposals on tourism are important, particularly in Dublin where the sector provides employment opportunities for people on relatively low incomes, many of whom did not have an opportunity to access third level education.  The reduction in the VAT rate will result in growth in the tourism sector, as will the forthcoming visits of President Obama and the Queen and the UEFA Cup final, which will be held in Dublin.  The reduction in airport taxes and introduction of a visa waiver scheme as the Olympic Games in London approach should also boost visitor numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">Deputy Smith briefly referred to tourism and strongly welcomed the reduction in VAT and PRSI.  I fully concur that this must be monitored to ensure the reductions are passed on to tourists and customers and result in a boost in confidence and business.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">The measures on education, including an increase of 1,000 in the number of post-leaving certificate places, are welcome.  In this respect, I ask the Minister to ensure the capital is not overlooked as it was in the past when it did not receive a fair share of PLC places.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">The master plan for Dublin Port provides for the development of a cruise liner terminus.  It would require only a relatively small investment to attract cruise liners to Dublin, boost tourism in the city and showcase the country as a whole.  I ask the Minister responsible to work with Dublin Port to fast-track this development as it would make a meaningful contribution to the city.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his patience.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnLyonsLab" eId="spk_203">
          <from>Deputy John Lyons</from>
          <p eId="para_397">Listening in my office to Deputy Joan Collins's contribution, I heard her attack the Government for imposing a small levy on private pensions.  I consulted the Deputy's website to ascertain her opinions on pensions during the election campaign.  On her website, Deputy Collins calls for the elimination of "all tax subsidies on private pension funds for those on incomes over €100,000" and argues that such subsidies to the wealthy must be "clawed back to fund the stimulus package necessary for the rest of society."  She needs to decide which side of the fence she is on because she cannot have it both ways.  I welcome the Government's decision on Tuesday on its range of initiatives.  For years, Members have discussed the various problems arising in the banking sector almost to the exclusion of jobs.  For the public, the feeling must have been that banks, rather than jobs, are the priority.  Confidently, I am proud this package of measures demonstrates that even with the challenging position the Government has inherited, it can offer real opportunities for job creation and economic growth.  All Members seek more jobs for those they represent.  However, they must be honest with people and tell them there is no silver bullet.  Massive job growth is required to replace the devastating effects of the economic collapse and this will take time.  Many people also need time to retrain or to up-skill to return to employment.  Similarly, many newly-qualified graduates need work experience to apply their learning to help them to secure employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">Tuesday's announcement demonstrated the Government is willing to stand by the people and to give them the time and supports they need to get back to work.  In total, 20,900 places were outlined in the jobs initiative, including 5,000 internships and 3,000 back to education places.  This figure also includes a range of additional skills training to be delivered by FÁS.  These places will open up new avenues and opportunities for people, particularly those who worked in sectors, such as the construction sector, that have been hard hit by the economic collapse.  All Members are aware of the massive loss of jobs in that sector over the past four years.  It was the first sector to begin to shed jobs and consequently, thousands of primarily young people, and men in particular, are in danger of falling into long-term unemployment.  All evidence indicates that the longer one is unemployed, the harder it becomes to return to employment.  The retraining places announced in the initiative will give such people new opportunities to pursue and will help ensure that this generation will not be allowed to fall by the wayside and become long-term unemployed.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">In addition to providing the necessary training and up-skilling places, a range of initiatives was announced that will help to develop sectors of the economy with high growth potential.  All Members were pleased by the recent growth in export figures but accept the export elements of the economy cannot provide all the requisite job growth.  The initiative sets out priorities for such growth in areas such as tourism, which is a massive source of employment nationwide.  Between 2007 and 2010, the number of overseas visitors to Ireland fell by 2 million, which had a massive knock-on effect on businesses.  This decline must be reversed and measures to regain this lost ground were included in the jobs initiative, three of which I will mention.  First, I believe the abolition of the counter-productive air travel tax will make airfares more competitive and will bring more visitors to Ireland.  Second, the Government also has introduced a reform of the visa system to make it easier for visitors from fast-growing economies such as India and China to visit Ireland.  Third, a reduction on the rate of VAT on tourism-related goods and services is intended to improve competitiveness and increase Ireland's attractiveness to foreign visitors.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">Further initiatives announced, such as the additional €30 million in 2011 for the national retrofit programme, will support jobs and will help consumers to lower their energy bills.  The additional funds for road maintenance will create jobs while facilitating necessary repairs.  Additional funding for the summer works schemes in schools also was announced, which is particularly welcome because all Members will be aware of schools in their respective constituencies that require essential repairs and to learn properly, students need an adequate physical environment.  These measures will support jobs and provide a platform to create new ones.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">The measures outlined in the jobs initiative set out practical first steps to begin the process of rebuilding the economy along more sustainable lines.  They provide stimulus in the form of immediate investment, while also creating the conditions for longer term jobs growth.  Finally and most importantly, this jobs initiative gives people a chance to overcome the challenges facing them.  I am proud both to support these measures and that the Government is fulfilling its promise to make job creation its first priority.</p>

          <from>Deputy Martin Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_405">Thank you, a Ceann Comhairle.  As my party colleagues already have pointed out, the most notable aspect of the jobs initiative is its modesty in comparison with the election promises made by both Government parties.  Gone are the ambitious plans to create multi-billion job creation programmes and to initiate a comprehensive stimulus programme.  Instead, they are reduced to raiding the private pensions sector, having already followed the previous Government in committing the National Pensions Reserve Fund as collateral for the overwhelming and unsustainable bank debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">The simple fact is that by agreeing to continue to implement the IMF-EU austerity programme, both parties have been forced to abandon their undoubtedly genuine desire to have tackled the unemployment problem in a more meaningful way.  The reason they have been forced to do so is that the IMF and the EU have no interest in the sort of stimulus package that would help to get us out of this mess but are insistent that whatever money is floating around will be used primarily to pay off the outstanding debts.  It is apparent from the updated agenda underlying the ironically named IMF-EU stability programme published last week that they do not envisage any real improvement in the jobs situation.  Indeed, on page 13 of that update it is bluntly stated "the unemployment rate is set to remain high over the forecast horizon".  This is despite the fact the IMF takes a fairly positive view of global economic growth, which it is forecast will be reflected within Europe over the next few years.  Unfortunately, the benefit of any such upturn will not accrue to those in this State who will remain on the dole, whose wages will remain under attack and whose overall standard of living will continue to fall as we remain indentured to the bank debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">It also appears the IMF and EU believe that whatever employment growth might take place will come about not as the consequence of a stimulus package but through cutting wages.  It will be interesting to hear what the Government's response will be to the current review of the employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements, if as expected, it recommends that employers be allowed to opt out of agreements setting wage rates for 300,000 mainly low-income workers.  The publication of that review, which I understand already is in the hands of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, comes at a time when low-wage employers in the fast food sector are awaiting a High Court decision on their application to opt out of the employment regulation order, ERO, in the catering sector and other similar applications are pending.  It is clear that both the IMF-EU and the employers' organisations expect the reversal of the cut to the national minimum wage will be offset by the undermining of the structures and agreements in place to protect other low-paid workers.  If the review complies with the clear intent of the IMF as stated at the time of the bailout, to review the wage orders with a view to elimination, then the race to the bottom will have begun in earnest.  Employers will regard it as a green light to slash wages across a whole range of sectors with a view not to creating new jobs but to increasing profits.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">Profits in low-wage sectors already are healthy.  According to February statistics on European hotels, Dublin hotels enjoyed an increase in profits of 40%.  As occupancy rates were also among the highest in Europe, there is not much of a case to be argued that the sector requires that its staff have their wages slashed.  Moreover, it is ironic that at the very time it was presumably reaping the benefits of those profits, the O'Callaghan Group, which owns the Davenport Hotel, attempted to force members of staff to agree to the cut in the minimum wage as part of their contract.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">I certainly agree with the Minister, Deputy Noonan, and with my constituency colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, Deputy Deenihan, that tourism represents a way to create jobs.  However, this will not be and should not be done by attacking the wages and conditions of the people whose work forms the basis for tourism in this State.  Moreover, those who are employed in this sector primarily are women on low incomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">Another aspect of the jobs initiative should be touched upon.  As I already have noted, the ambitious plans to create a major jobs fund have been downgraded to a levy on private pensions.  Moreover, as stated previously, the reason is that the IMF and EU will not allow the State to inject the sort of funds promised during the election.  However, large amounts of money could be accessed were the State more imaginative.  For example, recently released statistics show that more than 90% of Irish pension funds are invested overseas.  We also know from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, that staggering amounts of money nominally under the control of Irish residents and institutions are invested in overseas securities.  At the end of 2009, these amounted to a total of €1.25 trillion.  When we contrast this with what someone described as the pathetic level of private capital investment in the State during the Celtic tiger years, something is drastically wrong.  Not only are the ordinary people of the State forced to pay off the gambling debts of a small number of failed bankers and speculators, but others of that ilk continue to refuse to invest in the real economy when there are more than €200 billion of funds owned by Irish residents and institutions invested in Britain.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">This has been the pattern over the history of the State.  It was the refusal by Irish banks and people with wealth to invest in manufacturing that led to the arrival of overseas firms attracted by IDA grants and a skilled workforce.  That sector remains important, but we also need to examine ways to ensure that a proportion of the vast funds invested abroad are instead invested in the real economy.  It would represent a massive stimulus to job creation in place of the modest proposal we are debating.  Ironically, €29 million will be spent on this jobs initiative, but the visits of the Queen and the President of America will cost us more than €30 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">In my constituency, approximately 26% of workers in Tralee in County Kerry are unemployed, twice the national average.  Under an initiative begun by the global pharmaceutical centre of excellence, GPCE, some 5,000 jobs will be created in Tralee.  This number would not only be significant for Tralee and north County Kerry, but for the entire region.  It is an ambitious programme, a great deal of money has been invested and much has been done to try to make the dream become a reality.  I do not say this lightly, but the State agency, IDA, has done nothing to help.  Time and again, requests for meetings with the leadership of the IDA have been refused.  The Taoiseach has met the group behind the GPCE proposal while the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, Deputy Deenihan, representatives throughout the county and I have been actively supporting the proposal's fruition.  A proactive approach on the part of the Government is urgently needed.  It must instruct the IDA to be proactive in trying to secure the GPCE.  The project can and will happen if this type of commitment is forthcoming.  The GPCE would provide a significant lift to a depressed area.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">Coastal areas have suffered considerably.  Rural coastal areas have depended on the fishing and construction sectors primarily and, to some degree, small to medium-sized farms.  Unfortunately, the fishing sector has suffered a large decline, not just during the past two or three years, but in the past decade.  This has been because of insufficient quota to make a viable living.  Small family farms are under significant pressure, with many of those employed on such farms having been raised on them.  Their escape valve was the construction sector.  Once the economic stimulus in peripheral Ireland, it has since collapsed.  I cannot stress enough the importance of proactively trying to ensure that people with skills, ability and training are allowed to make a contribution to society via meaningful jobs with meaningful wages.  If we create jobs with meaningful household wages, we create spending power and, consequently, more jobs.  It is essential that this consideration be taken on board.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Colreavy</from>
          <p eId="para_414">I understand that the Government has a difficult job to do and was handed a poisoned chalice by the outgoing Government.  The jobs initiative is well intentioned and parts of it are welcomed by Sinn Féin, in particular the proposal on 20,900 new training places.  However, two underlying principles should be borne in mind by anyone who is trying to tackle the economic mess that is Ireland Inc.  First, we cannot fix the national economy by taking money out of the pockets of the very people who sustain local economies.  Second, we should be making it easier for people to do the right thing.  Unfortunately, there is nothing in the well intentioned jobs initiative that meets with these two fundamental principles for fixing the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">Deputy Adams had it right when he stated this jobs initiative was a plan for a town, not a nation.  It is not ambitious enough and does not do or encourage the right things.  Little in the plan would indicate to jobless people that the Government supports them and will help them to get off the dole and to set up businesses of their own.  For example, we could have examined Government impediments to existing business.  The system of rateable valuation for businesses makes no sense and is grossly unfair.  It is based on the size of a building rather than the income generated by the business therein.  Businesses are closing because they cannot afford to pay assessed rates.  The system is unfair and should be changed.  This could be done in a cost neutral way by ensuring that the businesses that generate the most income pay the most.  Similarly, many businesses will need to close because of the high water charges imposed on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">This initiative represented an exciting opportunity to propose an exciting and progressive schools development programme.  Sinn Féin would advocate that 125 schools should be taken through the construction stage in 2011.  This would cost €3 million per each 16-classroom generic repeat design project and €375 million in total, but it would create 4,000 jobs.  The opportunity has been missed.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">For the life of me, I cannot understand why the Government and State agencies are paying large amounts for leases while NAMA-owned buildings are lying empty.  It does not make economic sense.  Those buildings should either be used for State purposes or by entrepreneurs who would use them to set up businesses at low rental levels.  Surely this would make doing the right thing easier for people.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">I am disappointed that the Government is downplaying our natural resources' potential for revenue generation.  It is a little bit like I am trying to sell a car but telling a potential buyer than it is not much of a car and is heavy on fuel.  I would not sell too many cars were I to do that.  Our natural resources have great potential to generate revenue.  This is in line with the Democratic Programme of 1919 which states: "The Nation's sovereignty extends not only to all men and women of the Nation, but to all its material possessions, the Nation's soil and all its resources, all the wealth and all the wealth-producing processes within the Nation".  We saw the mistakes made by the previous Government with regard to the Corrib gas field.  In the dying days of that Administration's hold on power it signed off on exploration licences.  We have to make sure such mistakes are not repeated.  We are calling for a complete review of the licensing and revenue terms and the immediate revoking of the consent given to the Corrib consortium.  We also call for a review of the exploration licence on Lough Allen where there is potentially a large find to be made.  We have called for the establishment of a State oil, gas and mineral exploration company which would hold a 51% majority share in all oil and gas finds and have its own research facility in order to collect and validate up-to-date information on the reserves available.  We have called for the imposition of a 50% tax on oil and gas profits and a 7.5% royalty.  We should consider the difference that would make to the economy, national and local.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">The next heading in my contribution is "Bunker management".  The way Departments, State agencies and semi-State bodies work needs dramatic change.  I hope this is something the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, will consider.  Decision making in Departments, particularly in tendering, is done within the confines of each Department.  For example, when the National Roads Authority is approving a €500,000 tender for a roads project, it may decide to save €50,000 by going for the lowest tender, but nobody considers the potential to take 100, 200 or 300 people off the jobless register.  Every major investment decision made by the Government, irrespective of the Department in which the decision is made, must take into account the only real common denominator — the taxpayer who is funding it.  We must get rid of the walls between Departments and every decision must be informed by the need to fix our local economies and the national economy.  However, I do not see that happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">There is major potential for job creation in the maintenance of roads.  There are many counties in which roads need major work.  The Dublin to Sligo road which I hope to be on shortly is generally good and a pleasure to travel, until one hits a lovely little spot called Cloonamahon.  Then, all of a sudden, this good road, for some reason I do not fully understand, turns back to being an old road for 12 km.  I do not know how many have been killed on that stretch of road, but it is something like 21 or 22, yet nobody is talking about it and it has not been fixed.  The N16 Sligo to Blacklion road which is part of the Sligo to Belfast road is a disgrace and unfit for purpose, but it does not appear on the NRA's plan.  The R280 from Tullaghan to Carrick-on-Shannon and the N59 Sligo to Ballina road badly need investment.  There are people who could be doing that work, but instead of working and contributing to the economy, they are jobless and taxpayers are paying for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">If we want to tackle the economy, let us tackle the delays in paying grants to farmers.  Those who should have been paid by December have not yet been paid.  If Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food officials were told that their pay cheques would not be ready until June or July, they would not be too happy about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">The nation needs a Government with vision, courage and a passion for getting the small things right.  It needs a Government which will work towards an economy that works for the people, rather than the people working for the economy.  What it needs is a real jobs initiative.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DamienEnglishFG" eId="spk_209">
          <from>Deputy Damien English</from>
          <p eId="para_423">I welcome the jobs initiative.  To pick up on what the last speaker said, what the country needs is a Government which will do what it states it will do and fulfils its election promises.  That is what the Government is doing.  It is following through on initiatives talked about during the election campaign and commitments made at the time.  It is a step in the right direction to try to restore some credibility in what the Government does and what it plans to do.  We also need to restore some faith in politics which has been damaged in recent years.  We campaigned to achieve these things and will do them.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">It has been said the jobs initiative is not enough.  Of course, it is not enough.  We know that; it is a small step in the right direction to restore confidence midway through a budget year.  We cannot perform magic overnight.  However, we can put things in place and start moving in the right direction in order that in the next couple of budgets we can start to deal with the situation we are in.  Unemployment is a massive problem that is causing great social and financial stress for everyone.  We will tackle it with the help of everyone here.  Everybody has ideas, but we have to be practical.  Nobody can fix the problem overnight.  It will take time.  We will bring forward some initiatives that we hope will kick-start the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">The reduction in the rate of VAT on tourism services will lead to the creation of jobs.  It will kick-start things by making us more competitive.  It will give us a chance to do more business and create jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">With regard to the funding being made available for shovel-ready projects such as schools and roads, the aim is to provide money for projects that will create employment and also be of benefit to the people.  The roads are in a mess in many places and schools need to be done up.  We are trying to solve two problems with the same budget.  It is about using our imagination, but it is also about taking action.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">Others speakers have been complaining about the embargo on recruitment in the public sector.  We have no doubt it is causing problems because it is not functioning properly.  We want to try to bring the numbers in the public sector down by around 25,000 while protecting front-line services.  That did not happen with previous Governments and it is something we will be working on in the next three or four years.  It is essential that we reduce the cost of governing the country and that means reducing the number employed by it.  From 2001 to 2008, when Bertie went on his spending spree, he was throwing money left, right and centre.  What he and his Government did, in allocating money that would not be available in the future and taking on an extra 70,000 workers in the public sector, was not sustainable.  We would love to keep all the people concerned, but it is not practical.  The country cannot afford it.  We must cut our coat according to our cloth.  That is what we are doing and it will be done in a proper and organised way while protecting services.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">In this initiative we have introduced a partial loan guarantee scheme through which we will get money out to businesses.  We know this has to be done.  We have taken the first step, which is to make sure the banks have money to give to businesses.  They have been capitalised sufficiently to allow €30 billion of credit in the next three years.  The next step is to make sure the money gets out.  We know it is not enough to say it is available; we must deliver it.  That is why the partial loan guarantee is a step in the right direction.  We will take other initiatives in the next few months and years to make sure the money gets out to businesses which need it.  They need it to provide services but also to create jobs.  That is what the scheme is about.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">There are many other things about which I could talk, but I cannot cover them all in three minutes.  This is a good initiative.  It is about taking action as a first step.</p>

          <p eId="para_430">I commend the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, on the sensible measures he has taken to improve the country's international competitiveness and promote job creation.  As my time is limited, I will focus on one aspect of the jobs initiative, namely, tourism.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">Last Monday afternoon the Oireachtas Members for County Clare addressed the members of Clare County Council.  This was a welcome initiative by the Mayor of County Clare, Councillor Christy Curtin, to improve communications between the Oireachtas and the local authority.  All of the councillors present spoke about the importance of boosting tourism in County Clare and the need to develop Shannon Airport and increase passenger numbers.  As we all know, the number of overseas visitors fell by 15% last year.  This sent a real shock wave through the tourism sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">Tuesday's jobs initiative announcement is the exact medicine we need in the mid-west region to boost our tourism numbers.  The €3 travel tax will be axed on 1 July if the airlines agree to carry additional passenger numbers to our main airports.  I spoke to the Taoiseach yesterday and he is committed to that proposal.  He said that both he and the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, will shortly meet the Irish airline chiefs to hear their proposals in that regard.  I hope that with cheaper airport charges and no travel tax, Michael O'Leary will live up to his promise and reinstate the lucrative routes from Shannon Airport that he axed as a result of the travel tax back in 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">I call on Aer Lingus also to follow up on its success with Aer Arann at Shannon Airport, where they now operate together a number of very successful cross-channel UK routes, and give serious consideration to services to mainland Europe for 2012.  The German and Italian markets are there for the taking.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">I spoke to Mr. Marcus White, a hotelier in County Clare from the Whites Hotel Group, last week.  He is bringing in 8,200 tourists from Germany this year to Clare for one week's vacation.  They are travelling through Dublin as they cannot go through Shannon because there are no flights to Shannon Airport.  Mr. White told me this will be worth €8 million alone to the Clare region.  There are other operators like him who would do that if they had the opportunity and if there were direct flights into the airport.  I call on Ryanair and Aer Lingus to live up to their proposals in this respect.  That is only one such example.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">Cheaper airport charges, a strong tourism marketing front and the reduction in VAT from 13.5% to 9% could result in thousands of additional tourists coming here each year if the tourism industry and the airlines have the will to bring that about.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">Yesterday in the Dáil the Minister for Justice and Equality announced a common UK visa entry system for tourists and business people from 14 countries entering the State from the UK.  Those countries include the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China, from the latter of which huge numbers of tourists travel to mainland Europe every year.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">I recently had the Korean ambassador visit County Clare.  Some 3.5 million Korean tourists travel to mainland Europe every year but unfortunately they do not go any further.  I hope that South Korea will appear on that list of countries in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">To complement this initiative we need the airlines to play their role by providing cheaper tickets to Ireland through linking up with foreign carriers.  The Government has set the wheels in motion to promote tourism in this country like no other Government had done previously.  Next week and the week after we will see the showcase of Barack Obama and Queen Elizabeth come to this country.  We can boost tourism numbers from the UK and US on the back of those visits.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">There are many other aspects I would have liked to discuss but unfortunately time does not permit me to do so.  They include the allocation of €2.6 million for regional roads in County Clare and the allocation of €30 million for the school works programme, with allocation having been made for 16 schools last March and seven at this time.  I welcome the jobs initiative and commend the Government and the Minister on it.</p>

        <speech by="#SimonHarris" eId="spk_211">
          <from>Deputy Simon Harris</from>
          <p eId="para_440">Setting the context in any debate is important.  Debates and initiatives do not occur in a vacuum.  The jobs initiative that the Minister unveiled in the House this week is only required due to the gross incompetence and failure of the previous Fianna Fáil-led Government.  It is difficult to take in this House or anywhere else lectures on limitations, or perceived limitations, of any initiatives from a party which has brought us to this brink.  The steps proposed here could have been introduced by any Government at any time but they were not.  It is telling that the first major initiative of this new Government has recognised that job creation is at the core of its mission.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">I very much want to welcome the targeted 4.5% reduction in the VAT rate.  This was a clever, targeted and focused measure and, from my experience as a former director of the board of Wicklow Tourism, I agree with the Minister that there is huge potential for growth within our tourism industry.  This measure will also provide crucial and essential assistance for local small and medium businesses.  Only yesterday morning I heard on radio a hairdresser outline how this new rate will help her business remain sustainable and retain local employment.  The halving of the lower rate of PRSI will also make it easier for businesses like hers to take on additional employees in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">The additional funding for capital projects is also a very welcome initiative.  In my constituency of Wicklow the €1.39 million of extra funding for our roads will help create jobs while also repairing some of the damage done in our locality in the recent past due to the severe weather.  The retrofit programme aimed at helping householders to save money by increasing their energy efficiency is also to be praised.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">I was encouraged by the comments of the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, on national radio this morning that he will work with both pillar banks and energy supply companies to ensure consumers can get the maximum benefit from this scheme.  This effort in itself makes this Government more energy conscious and green friendly than the previous Government.  There is clearly no need for a Green Party here.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">However, I want to ask the Minister to take up the need for a European-wide jobs initiative with his colleagues.  The Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs should pursue this with colleagues in the European Union.  Europe has been seen as talking purely about banking in this economic crisis but there is a role for the EU and ECB to play in terms of job creation.  The European Union and the ECB could learn from this Government's initiative.  We saw what happened in Argentina where they created more than 2 million jobs in less than four months with a job guarantee scheme.  I ask the Minister to raise this issue with his colleagues in the European Union.</p>

          <p eId="para_446">I thank the Minister for attending and for taking some questions on the jobs initiative on which there has been a positive debate during the past few days.  The levy on pension funds could be described as a wealth tax except that it does not appear to apply to the wealthy, instead it applies to ordinary workers, pensioners and the unemployed who may have pension funds.  Will the Minister confirm the position in regard to approved retirement funds, ARFs, and whether they will be subject to this new levy on pension funds?  I am sure people like Michael Fingleton with his €27 million pension fund would have channelled it through an ARF.  It appears the Government's initiative exempts people like that from this levy while applying it to the unemployed, workers and pensioners.  Will I ask the remainder of the questions I have or will I have an opportunity to ask them later?</p>

          <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
          <p eId="para_449">As the Deputy is no doubt aware, in government it comes down to a very simple decision and in this case it is a question of whether one does something or nothing.  Everybody in the House agrees the jobs crisis is getting worse and that it needs specific and focused action.  The previous Government decided to do nothing; we have decided to do something, which is the basis for this initiative.  It must be seen as a first step.  We are not bringing it forward as a full solution in any way whatsoever.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">Once one decides to do something, what one does has to be paid for and the Deputy will know that it specifically has to be paid for under the rules that the previous Government, of which his party was a member, negotiated, namely, that initiatives must be fiscally neutral.  When we were examining how to fund the jobs initiative, we wanted to collect money on a basis that would not damage other jobs.  If one increased income tax, which is directly related to work, it would result in a loss of jobs.  If one were to consider any of the alternatives across the spectrum, one would realise they had the potential to result in a loss of jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">We picked the pension levy because when I was spokesman for finance in opposition, the first proposal on a pension levy came to me from the pensions industry.  They were trying to trade a levy as a <i>quid pro quo </i>for continuing to apply tax relief on pension contributions at the marginal rate of tax.  The <i>quid pro quo</i> has been rather overtaken by events but we are doing a full expenditure review and in that context we will look at its proposal.  The very fact that the pensions industry would propose this as a <i>quid pro quo</i> for something that it wanted to maintain shows it has no objection in principle to the levy.  It does not believe it will damage pension funds at the level we have brought it in and a good deal of what it is saying now is a very strong attempt by a very well-organised and well-funded lobby to overturn a Government decision.  I gave my views on this on the night following the announcement of the initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">The specific reason the Government chose this route is because only 6% to 7% of pension fund resources are invested in the Irish economy.  The rest of Irish pension funds are invested abroad.  We could access money, therefore, without damaging the domestic economy.  The pension funds are right to spread their risks; I am not criticising them on this.  However, 93% to 94% of their investments are outside of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">The imposition is quite small and will be temporary.  In the finance Bill to be published next Thursday, it will specifically state it is a levy for four years and will end after that.  In the discussions I had with the industry when I was Opposition finance spokesman, it made the point, based on actuarial advice, that a temporary levy would have no impact on funds but a permanent one had the potential to do so.  I agreed that any measure would be temporary.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">Regarding the Deputy's specific question concerning this morning's newspaper reports, approved retirement funds are not covered by the levy because they are not pension funds.  Approved retirement funds are not tax free, however.  They are close to annuities and on exit they are subject to income tax at the marginal rate.  As well as that, there is an imputed drawdown of 5% ascribed to the fund and a tax on the imputed drawdown.  In the Finance Bill 2011, the previous Government increased the annual notional distribution from 3% to 5% and applied the tax to that 5%.  It is not that the approved retirement funds are exempt.  It is that the previous Government got there first under a different tax heading.  Our predecessors imposed the additional tax in January 2011.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">I am open to discuss these matters with the pension funds representatives.  However, I would prefer if they debated the issue in a more rational way, especially when they proposed it in the first instance.</p>

          <from>Deputy Peadar Tóibín</from>
          <p eId="para_456">The pension levy proposal has already been mired in controversy in several ways.  Sinn Féin believes it is a flat tax and income blind.  In other words, those who are rich and those struggling will still be taxed at the same level.  Moreover, as reported in the media, those at the very top of the earnings scale, such as company directors, will be exempt from the levy.  It reminds me of the universal social charge where low and middle-income earners saw their contributions increase while those earning over €75,000 saw their contributions decrease.  There is also confusion about defined contribution pensions and defined benefit pensions.

This is a reasonable levy.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">The lobbies involved will claim the levy will not work, ruin the industry and is unconstitutional.  We hear the same arguments when any imposition is introduced.  The Government got legal advice in the normal way and it was applied when this proposal was drafted.  The provisions can be spelled out in more detail in the forthcoming finance Bill.  A certain amount of flexibility is still available.  I am prepared to talk to the industry on that basis.

We have brought forward this jobs initiative as a first step in a jobs programme to try to build confidence.  Beyond that, it is difficult to have a meeting of minds with Deputy Higgins.

          <p eId="para_486">In terms of direct job creation, some of my colleagues in Government involved in the capital programmes mentioned in the initiative have produced estimates of in excess of 6,000 directly created jobs by the capital programme.  I have also said that underpinning the programme for Government from 2011 to 2015, a net 75,000 to 100,000 jobs will be created.  That is the net figure.  Many jobs will also be lost, including through a reduction in the number of people employed in the public service.  The strategies we are putting in place to give incentives and confidence are targeted towards an increase in jobs of 100,000.  Whether that will be achieved or exceeded is difficult to say.  It is difficult to estimate now what will happen in the next three months, never mind in four years.</p>

          <p eId="para_488">I am confused about retrospection in relation to the pension levy.  Will the levy be calculated from 1 January this year but not come into effect until a particular date after the finance Bill has been enacted or will it be calculated on pension funds for the whole of this year?  If the latter is the case, as far as I am aware one cannot retrospectively impose a tax.  Does the same apply in respect of a levy?  A number of pension funds are in deficit.  Has the Minister quantified those funds and the impact this levy will have on them?  Some commentators have argued that this levy will put such pension funds into even more serious difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">I welcome the internship programme, which will provide work experience.  Has the Minister quantified the number of people eligible under this programme and in receipt of a social welfare payment?  A considerable number of students are not in receipt of a social welfare payment.  Their income is often just above the threshold to qualify for a grant.  The point I am making is that €50 per week will not be enough for a person not in receipt of a social welfare payment.  I am curious to know how these interns will be selected.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">The Minister said this initiative was modest and that further initiatives would be introduced.  Is it likely initiatives that will target other funds will be introduced or will such initiatives include changes in areas such as social welfare which seek to address, say, poverty traps?</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_244" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
          <p eId="para_491">The levy is not retrospective.  It is being calculated on the annual value of each pension fund as of 1 January of each year from 2011 onwards.  The levy is similar to stamp duty.  It is on the value for the year and will be paid in two tranches each year.  It will be paid in two tranches in 2011 for the full value of the fund and then each year thereafter, ending after four years.  The Revenue Commissioners will be responsible for its collection, in respect of which I do not envisage much difficulty.  The Deputy will be aware that pension fund managers impose charges for their services.  The industry has assured me it will be simply a case of adding 0.6% to its charges and transferring the value of that to the Revenue Commissioners.  The levy will be paid to the Revenue Commissioners at the same time as pension funds pay normal charges.  This will be done twice a year.  There is no particular difficulty in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">On pension funds in difficulty, we have made two exceptions, as announced by me on Tuesday; namely, pensions for the benefit of non-residents are exempt because levying them would be unfair and probably not legal and where a motion has been passed by May of this year to discontinue the activity of a fund, such fund will be exempt.  As I said previously, hard cases make bad law.  If there are hard cases to which the industry wishes to bring my attention I am prepared to discuss them with it.  This is a modest proposal on a group of people who have built up funds having received a generous 40% tax relief.  It will end after four years and will not drive anybody to the wall.  This is a modest proposal.</p>

          <p eId="para_493">The Minister will be aware that most defined benefit pension funds are experiencing a funding crisis.  How does he suggest such funds should meet the obligation of this levy?  The Minister is putting in place a disincentive for companies wishing to bridge the deficit in their pension funds.  For example, where a company's pension fund has a deficit of €40 million and it wishes to bridge that deficit, it will be taxed for doing so as the Minister will take €1 million of that €40 million.  The Minister is putting in place a disincentive for companies which wish to do the responsible thing for their employees.</p>

          <p eId="para_495">There is well over €80 billion in the pension funds.  We are not speaking here about little pools of money.  There is well in excess of €80 billion in the pension funds about which we are speaking.  Many of those funds have been accumulated because of the tax relief.  As I stated previously, I believe it is reasonable to take a small stamp duty for four years from the accumulated value of the pension funds because of the difficulties we are in, in particular given people in receipt of €80 per week are expected to pay the universal social charge.  There must be some equity in this.  As I said, I have yet to identify a popular tax or one that is universally popular.  There are difficulties with any tax, but this has the least impact on the domestic economy.  There are some difficulties, but they are not typical.  Pension funds lost money in the middle of the crisis, but in the last 15 months or so they have been going well again.  The international markets, whether in the United Kingdom, elsewhere in Europe or the United States, are booming.  If the Deputy looks at the Dow index on the financial television stations some night, he will see it has gone away up again.  It is heading towards a figure of 13,000, back to where it was at the peak of the market.  It is not true to say pension funds have not been going so well.  The figure I have been given is that funds are expected to grow by an average of 6% in the next three or four years.  That is the estimate, although it is subject to checking.  That would be a reasonable return.</p>

When we asked how many jobs would be created, some Ministers said they could not tell.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources said 2,000 jobs would be created in retrofitting, while the Minister for Education and Skills said 3,000 jobs would be created under the schools summer works scheme.

Did he read the article in <i>The Sunday Times</i>  last Sunday that showed that the rich were getting richer, while the poor were getting poorer?  Instead of raiding pension funds and continuing with unjust measures such as the universal social charge, there seems to be no willingness on the Minister’s part to consider generating significant revenue which could be used to provide a real stimulus by creating an extra tax band for those earning more than €100,000 a year, and-or a wealth tax on the assets of the super wealthy, which tiny group has accrued even greater wealth in the last year.

          <p eId="para_519">There are various arguments about pensions funds.  I will meet representatives of the industry and ask them what their problems are.  I will ask them why before Christmas they thought a levy of 0.5% was a great idea and would do no harm to funds and why a levy of 0.6% would cause the sky to fall in.  I will start by asking them that question.  I will meet their difficulties if I can.</p>

          <p eId="para_527">Defining wealth as a fixed asset and saying €5 million in a pension fund is not wealth is a long way from reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">I thank everyone who contributed.  It was a good and interesting debate.  Members met it fairly.  It was negative on the afternoon of the first day, but it improved as the week went by.  Yesterday parts of the debate were constructive and good ideas came from all sides of the House.  Choices must be made and the new Government faced the choice of doing nothing about the state of the country, particularly unemployment, or trying to attack it.  We tried to attack it.  Of course, this is only a first step.  To accuse us of not doing everything we intended to do in a five year period in the first couple of weeks is not valid.  It is not a fair argument.  I draw Deputies' attention to the economic thinking underpinning what we are doing.  We do not believe it is possible for a Government to create jobs directly.  It is not the role of the Government to rely on huge capital injections to create jobs right across the economy, first, because the huge capital injections are not available and, second, even when it is approached in that way, one does not get sustainable jobs because when the roads are built, the workers become redundant and the JCBs sit there with no work happening.  We have to re-examine the economy and approach it in a different way.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">We know what happened in regard to the way the country was run and we know that business model has failed, so we must look at a new business model.  In the new model, I have a very simple philosophy.  Rather than inventing everything from the beginning, let us look at what is working and build on that.  Then, let us look at what might work and build on that.  Following that, let us look at the people involved and do something specific for those most hit by the recession and the most vulnerable.  That is the thread of thought that underpins what we have done.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">What is going well in the country?  Manufacturing industry is going very well and exports are driving forward.  Exports from multinational companies increased last year by approximately 9% and they continue to do very well this year, although the activity has changed somewhat because it has moved from the foreign investment multinationals into the indigenous sector.  Many of the Irish owned and based companies are now exporting as well, which is particularly true in the agrifood area.  Members will be familiar with literature which shows emerging middle classes in China, India and across east Asia with family ambitions to have more protein and dairy products for their children.  This has resulted in a huge demand for Irish agrifood products and there are now huge sales into south east Asia of dairy and meat products, which is creating employment at home.  This is why it is very important to keep saying we will not move from the 12.5% corporate tax rate, which is one of the main planks of our set of incentives which attracts industry and drives the economy forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">We want to tweak this process a little more, and there were two proposals in this regard.  One related to research and development, which Fianna Fáil welcomed and Deputy O'Dea commented on when expressing his understanding of how that works, so there is no need to go over that ground again.  The second proposal is a reversal of a measure in the last budget which I believe was a mistake, namely, where employers' PRSI was imposed on the value of share options.  Many of the multinationals enhance their remuneration packages by giving share options or share offers as well as salary.   As soon as one puts employers' PRSI on top of that, it is an immediate disincentive to the company.  Worse, when it was presented initially, it was announced as if it would be retrospective.  If a person had been offered a share option four years ago and exercised it in 2011 or 2012, the idea was that the person would pay retrospectively the PRSI for the entire period.  However, the Revenue Commissioners then redefined the impact of the measure and stated it would only apply going forward, which took away most of the yield, so we abolished it.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">Even though this seems a very small issue, one would be surprised at the concern this has caused in the corporate headquarters in the United States, where companies were considering projects for Ireland.  I could name projects that were at the point of announcement but were held back because of this.  I hope they will now be announced.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">Overall, this is an area where modern Ireland will continue to drive forward, particularly in regard to the IT, pharmaceutical and agrifood industries, so many of the bright young people coming out of the universities will get jobs in those sectors.  It is amazing how balanced the process can be at times.  There are already skills shortages in the IT area, in particular shortages of software engineers, for example, where a person would require four or five years experience to be the architect of a particular piece of software development.  It is hard to find people with such skills now, which is a situation that must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">The next issue we are examining concerns the areas with potential.  The biggest potential area of job creation and investment I can identify is the tourism industry.  Tourism is really an export industry, except those that buy the goods and services bring their money here to do so, and it has the same value as manufacturing industry.  The big hits over the past three years have taken their toll.  It is not just that tax breaks drove the building industry with the result we have all these under-used five-star hotels and golf courses throughout the country — that is only half the picture.  In addition, the number of visitors to the country declined by up to the 30% over the past three years, the number of visitors coming from the UK has declined by 32% and the spend has declined by some 35%.  These are extraordinarily big figures.  If we only recovered the ground lost, it would be a huge shot in the arm to the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">This is why we are focusing on the tourism industry, and it is an opportune time to do so.  Many Members have referred to the forthcoming visits of the queen and President Obama.  We will get huge publicity across the world.  The Irish brand will go out and, if it is presented cleverly as background to the visit, Ireland will be seen for the very attractive country it is.  However, we must also incentivise the industry.  When we began to examine our commitment to reduce VAT from 13.5% to 12% and went into the detail of that, we decided this would have very little economic effect, so we decided to concentrate on the tourism-related activities, where the rate could be brought down to 9% with a cut of 4.5%.  This changes the arithmetic and might have some effect.  While the industry will have to do its share also, hotels and restaurants have already been cutting costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">In addition, we will provide some marketing funds and, arising from the visit of the queen, we will focus on particular regions of the UK.  Many people will dismiss this and say it is too late in the year to do anything but that is not the case.  If we were marketing in America, it would be too late in the year because Americans tend to arrange their holidays 12 months in advance.  People in the UK are like ourselves in that they could decide today they were coming to Dublin on Friday week and then check on a website for a cheap flight and a value hotel.  It can be done quickly when it is a case of Europe or the UK, which is where we will try to put in some marketing resources.  We hope we can bring people back again.  When we combine that with the changes to PRSI, given that many working in the hospitality industry are not paid very well, this will encourage an uptake of workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">The changes the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, is making with regard to visas will also help.  Members will remember, although not all are as old as myself, that 25 or 30 years ago if a person visited London, one of the risks was that a Japanese citizen swinging a camera would take out that person because the Japanese were everywhere, taking photographs.  More recently, Chinese tourists have been coming in numbers and if one visited London in the past year, the number of Chinese tourists would have been quite obvious on the streets.  Some of them want to come to Dublin but they cannot make the add-on trip for four or five days because they must get a separate visa which could take up to 12 months to obtain, certainly six months.  What will happen now is that anybody travelling from the set of countries announced by the Minister, Deputy Shatter, including China and India, who produces a UK visa in Dublin Airport can enter and stay for the term of the validity of their visa, and we will not undertake a second check.  As soon this scheme becomes slightly more developed and various security measures are put in place, this will be retrospective so a person will be able to come to Ireland first before travelling on to the UK.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">It is a series of small ideas but I want to give the House a flavour of the thinking.  Capital projects are a further issue.  In my area, the people who are most obviously unemployed are those who used to work in the building industry, such as electricians, carpenters, plumbers and plasterers.  Therefore, we are trying to progress the shovel-ready projects.  We are trying to get them to build school extensions, all with their pitches and playgrounds, to do painting and decorating, retrofitting for energy conservation purposes, and so on.  That is the direct job area targeting for people who have many skills but who cannot get work at present.  We are doing this to keep their skills going and keep them in Ireland in order that as the economy turns, there will be a natural pick-up and they will again find private sector employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">I wanted to give Deputies a flavour of the thinking concerned lest they think this is simply a checklist of separate initiatives.  The intention is that it is joined-up thinking with a pattern to it.  Will it work?  I hope it does but it is only the first initiative and we will continue to try other measures.  The alternative is to stand still, do nothing and wait for the truck to hit.  This way, one starts doing things.  Not all of them will work but some will and, in doing this, there is nothing like activity to build up confidence.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Fergus O’Dowd)</from>
            <p eId="para_544">The Government has clearly set out its intention to ensure the semi-State sector plays a full role in Ireland's economic recovery.  The State companies are engaged in a wide range of strategic activities and have significant investment programmes in place.  We want to ensure these investment programmes are delivered to best effect in the interests of jobs and growth.  The New Economic and Recovery Authority, NewERA, is the planned vehicle whereby the State's holdings of the key State companies will be managed to ensure cost effective investment in key priority areas.  These include the energy networks, broadband, water and the bioenergy sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_545">Under the NewERA plan, a sharper focus and more structured shareholder engagement will ensure the State companies will make the necessary and appropriate strategic investments over the coming years in these key sectors of the economy.  Such investment will not only ensure the delivery of the key economic infrastructure required but will also ensure an economic and jobs stimulus for the country.  This is essential and our country is entitled to it.</p>
            <p eId="para_546">I am totally committed to ensuring speedy progress is made in establishing the NewERA entity.  To that end intensive work is under way to shape the programme in my Department and in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I am working with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, and all other relevant ministerial colleagues to deliver effectively on the Government's ambition.</p>
            <p eId="para_547">A key issue is the opportunity for the State companies to channel the necessary funding at the best cost achievable to the energy, broadband, water and forestry sectors.  The structure of the NewERA model must deliver on that objective.  As we refocus and restructure across the relevant State companies, it is important to ensure their capability to access additional funding for new and existing investment priorities.  We are also examining how best to leverage the National Pensions Reserve Fund and shape the new national development plan to ensure indigenous jobs and growth through the NewERA entity.  This is a key priority for the Departments concerned to work on collectively in the short term.</p>

            <from>Deputy Martin Ferris</from>
            <p eId="para_548">I thank the Minister of State for his response.  I am sure such a NewERA programme would be welcome but wonder how it might be affected by the downgrading of State companies and the sale of the assets of such companies, as recommended by the report on State assets and liabilities.  Will the Minister of State provide assurance that the programme investment will go ahead and nothing will be done in respect of the two component parts of the proposed State bioenergy companies, Coillte and Bord na Móna, that would prevent that taking place?</p>
            <p eId="para_549">In the light of what has happened in Greece, whose Government has been pressurised by the IMF and the European Union into selling off some €15 billion of state assets, can the Minister of State provide assurance this will not affect the NewERA programme, given the concerns that exist, especially in one part of the Government which is opposed to selling off any State assets?</p>
          </speech>

            <from>Deputy Fergus O’Dowd</from>
            <p eId="para_550">The key point is that the Government is <i>ad idem</i>, of one mind, on this.  I refer the Deputy to page 14 of the programme for Government which makes very clear that, after due consideration, there will be a sale of State assets amounting to up to €2 billion which will be part of, and in addition to, the national development plan.  We need to keep the State companies focused on what they do best.  If there are investments or companies as subsets of those State companies which can be sold off because they are not essential, the key point being that non-essential State assets are intended, these could be used productively to get a stream of revenue into the State companies and, through NewERA, create thousands of jobs.  If we do not get the wake-up call across clearly to everyone that this must be done, we will not be able to recover in this recession or be able to create the jobs that are so essential in broadband, water, bioenergy and so on.  This is the situation and that is exactly what we will do.  We are united and absolutely committed and dedicated on that principle.</p>

            <p eId="para_552">The programme for Government states that up to €2 billion will be invested in NewERA.

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Pat Rabbitte)</from>
            <p eId="para_554">Part 7 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides for public service broadcasting in Ireland and the provisions relating to the public service broadcasting corporations, RTE and TG4, including their principal objects.  These objects provide the companies' statutory mandates and encapsulate national policy in terms of public service broadcasting.  They include the specific objective of providing for national, free-to-air public service broadcasting services as well as the provision of a broad range of other additional services that are seen as fundamental to the role of the public service broadcaster.  In their pursuit of these objects, the provisions of the Act subject the public service broadcasting corporations to a range of additional requirements.  These statutory objects and requirements clearly set the State-owned public service broadcasters apart from their commercial counterparts who, while bringing choice and competition to the market, are privately owned and funded companies that have entered the market on the basis of a commercial proposition.</p>
            <p eId="para_555">The funding of the public service broadcasters, RTE and TG4, is met through a mix of licence fee revenues, Exchequer grant-in-aid and commercial revenues obtained largely from advertising.  The rationale for providing State funding for public service broadcasting is to provide an independent and reliable income flow that allows these corporations to attain their public service objects while ensuring they can maintain editorial independence.  This is especially important in the context of news and current affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_556">In regard to the television licence fee moneys, I point out that not all these are allocated to the public service broadcasters and that a proportion is available to both public and independent broadcasters through the broadcasting funding scheme.  The purpose of this scheme is to encourage the inclusion of additional programming of a particular character in broadcasters' programme schedules.  The scheme is open to independent producers and all free-to-air broadcasters.  It is funded by way of a payment of 7% of net licence fee receipts which is paid to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland in respect of this scheme.  This amount was increased from 5% to 7% under the Broadcasting Act 2009.  I am aware that the funding of the public service broadcasters has been subject to criticism by private sector broadcasters and, in particular, that there has been criticism of the dual public and commercial funding model as applied to RTE and that there have been calls to extend the current scope of funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_557">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_558">The broadcasting sector in general has faced a challenging funding environment in recent years with a large fall in commercial advertising revenues.  In addition, change in the way content can be transmitted is adding to the challenging environment.  It is understandable in such a situation that extending further the scope of funding of public service content would seem attractive to some.  However, great care should be taken in considering any such course of action.  The provision of balanced, adequately resourced and independent public broadcasting services is fundamental to democratic society.</p>
            <p eId="para_559">Therefore, we must ensure that the ability of our public service broadcasters to deliver on their remits and obligations is not undermined through decisions that cause a slow but certain erosion of their economic base.  As the Deputy may be aware, the importance of ensuring continued and appropriate funding for public service broadcasting is recognised in the programme for Government.  In this document, the Government commits to examining the role and collection of the television licence fee in light of existing and projected convergence of broadcasting technologies and to transform the television licence into a household-based public broadcasting charge to be applied to all households and applicable businesses, regardless of the device they use to access content.</p>
            <p eId="para_560">In line with this commitment, my Department is currently undertaking an exercise whereby it is examining the effectiveness and efficiency of the current model of television licence fee collection in the context of the changing technological environment, and examining the efficiency of various international models for the funding of public service broadcasting.  The results of the exercise will be an analysis of the most effective models in terms of efficiency, capability to fund our public service broadcasting service and equity of applicability.</p>
            <p eId="para_561">The scope of work being carried out under this review is extensive.  Nevertheless, I expect to receive recommendations arising out of this review by the year end.  Following this, work will begin on developing any legislation that may be required to facilitate implementation of any recommendations that I decide to take forward.  I accept that the broadcasting sector, in common with other sectors, is facing challenging economic circumstances.  I recognise these challenges and I look forward to working with all broadcasters, including public, commercial and community, to ensure that broadcasting can continue to play its important and distinctive role in society and maintain quality standards in the process.</p>

            <p eId="para_562">I congratulate the Minister as this is the first time we have had Priority Questions here since I became the spokesperson for Fianna Fáil.  I thank him for a comprehensive, if somewhat predictable, answer from the Department.  The nub of the matter is that I agree with the idea of public service broadcasting and I fully support the Minister in this.  Has the Minister any ideas on how to ensure measurement of the public service output compared to the commercial output of the public service broadcasters?  How can the Minister ensure that in allocating the licence fee between the various public service broadcasters the moneys are allocated for public service broadcasting and do not subsidise commercial output within those companies?</p>

            <p eId="para_563">I thank Deputy Ó Cuív for his remarks.  I doubt if there is much difference between his philosophy and mine on this issue.  There are specific statutory obligations in respect of the public service broadcasters, including TG4.  They must fund the service without fear of intrusion into their independence.  Public service broadcasting is about more than funding.  It is about content and structures as well.  The broadcasting fund has been successful.  It has spawned a not-insignificant number of independent producers who have carried out some quality work.  Given the current climate, perhaps the commercial sector is finding it more difficult to remunerate those independent producers.  However, in terms of innovation and imagination in the sector they have made a valuable contribution and it represents a beneficial use of the money.  The Deputy will be aware that the last budget allocated some €10 million of the broadcasting fund directly to TG4.  I intend to give effect to that.</p>

            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_564">I welcome the commitment from the Minister today.  I have always believed from the time TG4 was set up, including when I was Minister and since, that TG4 should be funded from the same fund as RTE and that if there is to be an Exchequer subvention, the lot should go into one ball of wax and then be spread out.  We give a licence fee to public service broadcasters.  Let us leave aside the broadcasting fund, or the fund that goes to bidding and concentrate on TG4, RTE and its various manifestations.  Is there any measurement by the Department of the application of the funds in terms of public service broadcasting to ensure that what we get back in terms of public service broadcasting from the licence fee money is a good return and an equitable return on the money?</p>
            <p eId="para_565">Will the Minister clarify whether any of the licence fee is used to pay inflated salaries and fees to broadcasters in RTE?  The licence holders would be upset if they believed this was the definition of public service broadcasting, that is to say, paying people €600,000 and €700,000 per year in a time of economic downturn.  Will the Minister clarify whether any mechanism exists between the giver of the money, that is, the Department, and the recipient to ensure that public service broadcasting money is put to public service broadcasting and not to the enrichment of private individuals?</p>

            <p eId="para_566">Are we getting value for money or could it be reapportioned to specific programming types within the broadcaster?  To some extent, that is in the eye of the beholder.  Deputy Ó Cuív may take the view that RTE does an immense job in public affairs, especially were it to recognise his inherent outstanding qualities, but were it to decide to apply the same to this side of the House he may believe it is not so great.  We all react more or less like that.  In particular, the broadcaster's coverage of public affairs is in the eye of the beholder.</p>
            <p eId="para_567">I am keen to see the quality content of RTE being the focus of RTE all the time.  I realise that in comparison with the broadcasters across the water RTE's budget is small.  None the less, it has produced quality output, although perhaps not enough of it.  Some of the stuff imported from outside the jurisdiction is pretty terrible.  Perhaps that is a subjective view.  However, if one tunes in to any of the other channels one gets the same pap.  I am unsure whether it does anything to raise the intelligence quotient in the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_568">Regarding the inflated salaries aspect of Deputy Ó Cuív's question, the honest answer is that some of the moneys must, inevitably, go towards the remuneration of contract staff because they are all paid from the same purse.  I do not disagree with Deputy Ó Cuív.  Given the times we are in and that RTE is projecting a deficit at the end of the year in excess of €30 million, it would be appropriate to consider all levels of salary and remuneration packages in the corporation because it must survive in a more difficult climate.  There has been a dramatic collapse in its commercial revenues in the past two years.  I have discussed the financial provision of RTE with the management and sought assurances that quality will not suffer as a result.</p>

            <p eId="para_577">EirGrid, the State-owned independent electricity transmission system company, is building the east-west interconnector between Ireland and Britain.  The construction of this vital strategic infrastructure by EirGrid is on budget and on schedule for completion next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_578">I have no role in the planning and construction of transmission infrastructure, which are operational matters for EirGrid.  The planning process for strategic energy infrastructure is a matter for An Bord Pleanála under the Strategic Infrastructure Act.  It would not be appropriate for me or any Minister to intervene in respect of the planning process.</p>
            <p eId="para_579">The interconnector obtained full planning permission from An Bord Pleanála in September 2009.  This approval followed a comprehensive assessment process, including an oral hearing, at which all stakeholders were present including Rush Community Council.  It is being developed and constructed in line with all relevant national, EU and international guidelines for health, safety and the environment.  EirGrid has advised that construction of the ducts for the cable is well advanced with approximately 75% of the construction of the ducting in Rush now completed.</p>

            <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
            <p eId="para_580">The Minister could have saved himself a lot of time and just said "no", which seems to be the short answer to the question as to whether he would consider the rerouting of the cable away from the population of Rush.  It is irrelevant that the project has been through the planning process.  In many instances, ventures that are given planning permission have the permission altered and Eirgrid, as the Minister has acknowledged, is State-owned.</p>
            <p eId="para_581">Rush is the only populated area through which this high voltage cable has been laid and while the ducting is largely underground, the cable itself has not been inserted.  Could the Minister comment on the status of the Kema report into the safety concerns of residents about the cable, why it has not been factored in and why he has not instructed Eirgrid to wait for the report to be done?  Crucially, why did his ministerial and party colleagues, while in opposition, give a commitment to the people in that town that if they were in Government after the election, they would ensure the cable was rerouted?</p>

            <p eId="para_582">I have been unable to find any colleagues who gave any such undertakings before or since the election.  After all that has happened in the past 30 years, the idea of the Minister interfering in the planning process is an extraordinary proposition for Deputy Daly to advance.  If I interfered in a project like this, why should I not interfere in one of Deputy Wallace's construction projects?  What sort of accusations would that leave me open to from Deputy Daly?</p>

            <p eId="para_584">I am sure there is a measure of agreement between Deputy Daly and myself that this is vital strategic national infrastructure.  It is imperative this is concluded.  I am glad it is coming in on budget and on time.  The ducting is already in place and I am confident it will meet the targets.</p>

            <p eId="para_585">No one opposes the cable; the issue is that it is being inserted in a heavily populated area, feet away from schools, crèches and houses.  The fact that a State organisation seeks and is granted planning permission for a project is neither here nor there.  The organisation falls under the Minister's jurisdiction and he can instruct it to seek an alternative planning route that will take it away from densely populated areas.  That is all that is being sought.</p>
            <p eId="para_586">The Minister did not comment on the safety report that has not been commissioned yet.  It is becoming the norm for Eirgrid to not bother waiting for reports to be commissioned, it just ploughs ahead regardless.  Ultimately Eirgrid reports to the Minister and it is not good enough.</p>

            <p eId="para_587">I assure the Deputy that I have gone to considerable lengths to establish if there is a safety risk and I am absolutely, and I stress that, assured that no risk exists.  I agree that just because this is a State body making a planning application, it does not make it right.  The proposition, however, that I should interfere is wrong; it is a matter for the planning authorities to decide if it is right, if it is in compliance or if it is a health risk.  The planning authorities have gone through all of this and I am assured there is no health risk, that this is a project of profound value to everyone on the island because of concerns of security of supply and ensuring we have an energy supply in the future, and the hope that it will bring down prices.  This is vital national infrastructure and if I thought there was a 0.1% risk to health as a result of the project, I might take a different view.</p>

            <p eId="para_589">The North West Mayo Forum was established in 2008 with the dual objectives of providing an opportunity for dialogue between parties with an interest in the Corrib gas project and offering an opportunity for furthering the socio-economic development of the north-west Mayo region.  While it was intended that membership of the forum would include a broad representation from local community groups, those groups opposed to the Corrib gas project declined to participate in it.</p>
            <p eId="para_590">Over the course of its first year, five meetings of the forum were held.  In the past 18 months the forum met only once, and that was just over a year ago.  A decision has not been taken to convene a further meeting of the forum at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_591">The construction phase of the project is well advanced, with construction of the gas terminal, the offshore pipeline and the sub-sea facilities almost complete.  The principal remaining element of the development is the construction of the onshore section of the pipeline.  That work is due to commence this summer.</p>
            <p eId="para_592">The consent conditions monitoring committee, being established by my Department to monitor implementation of the conditions of the section 40 gas pipeline consent, will provide an opportunity for representatives of the local community to engage in a meaningful way on the construction of the onshore pipeline.</p>

Does the Minister accept that the forum was a good way to resolve issues on the ground and that it did extraordinarily good work?  Does the Minister agree the challenge was to secure greater participation, although some of the groups who were opposed to it in various forms attended the meetings as observers?</p>
            <p eId="para_594">Does the Minister agree that one of the roles of the forum was to ensure the area would benefit from the development and that issues of conflict within the community would be resolved?  Does he accept there was wide community participation in the forum by many groups and that it helped to resolve problems on the ground?  I ask the Minister to reconsider calling a meeting of the forum in the near future as it was doing very good work.</p>

            <p eId="para_595">I do not dispute it was a good idea.  Unfortunately, it has not been the success all of us might have hoped.  There has not been a meeting for more than a year and Deputy Ó Cuív is aware that on the last couple of occasions, when great efforts were made to convene a meeting, it broke up in some disarray because of the activities of a small number of people who are not representative of the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_596">Deputy Ó Cuív properly raises the issue of the benefits that might redound to the local area.  That is a useful aspect of the dialogue.  A great deal has happened since Peter Cassells was brought in by my predecessor.  I was involved in that decision myself.  He went to do a task that was very useful with tangible, beneficial spin offs for the area as a result of the Cassells report.  I do not intend to disband the forum, I will be briefed by its chairman within the next couple of weeks and I will listen to what he has to say.</p>

            <p eId="para_597">Who does the Minister think is representative of the area?  The issue in north-west Mayo is that people have very different views on this project and those views vary from area to area of the Erris region, a huge geographical area.  Those who were opposed to the gas pipeline comprise both outsiders and local people and they must be respected for their views.  Will the Minister accept that the only way forward in such situations is continuous and slow dialogue?  He is absolutely correct that some of the meetings were acrimonious but some of the most productive meetings we had were quite acrimonious; my view was we were making progress.  Considering what the Minister said about the deep-freezing of the forum in some limbo, will he reconsider reverting to the situation where it would be proactively driving reconciliation and also development within the Erris area?  Is it intended to make natural gas available in Ballycroy, Carrowteige and Belmullet?</p>

            <p eId="para_598">It is beyond my powers to answer the Deputy's first question about who represents the area.  It is, unfortunately, very divided.  I acknowledge the patient work done by the members of the forum under the chairmanship of Mr. Joe Brosnan but I would have to draw attention to the fact that three of the groups opposed to the project for one reason or another did not attend and this is a great pity.  I do not know who represents the area and I suppose the best yardstick would be the results in the ballot box but they did not seem to bear out or were not directly related to the groups that can raise most decibels in the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_599">I heard what Deputy Ó Cuív said and I have told him it is my intention to talk to the chairman and to weigh up the advice he gives me.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</b>
          his views on the application by An Bórd Gáis for an increase in the prices it charges to its customers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_304" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_601">Responsibility for the regulation of gas prices is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation which is an independent statutory body. Bord Gáis Energy's gas tariffs for domestic customers and small businesses are still regulated by the Commission for Energy Regulation and reviewed each year.  I have no function in the matter.  Decisions on gas prices by the commission involves reviewing all the controllable cost inputs and forecasting the likely wholesale gas costs.  The objective is to ensure that tariffs are cost reflective.</p>
            <p eId="para_602">The largest component of gas prices is the wholesale global cost of gas.  The last increase of 20% in regulated gas prices was in September 2008.  Wholesale gas prices moved downwards from autumn 2008 until recent months.  This has resulted in consistent reductions in gas tariffs for domestic and small business customers.  However, wholesale gas prices have been trending significantly upwards in Europe in recent months.  This is driven by geopolitical events in the Middle East and North Africa and high demand in Asia, including Japan, in the wake of the nuclear crisis.  The regulator and Bord Gáis Energy estimate that increases in wholesale prices in October are likely to result in a significant increase in tariffs for Irish customers.  The extent of the increase has not been quantified as yet but this should be seen in the context of a cumulative decrease of 27% for consumers since January 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_603">The regulator will undertake its detailed annual review of the Bord Gáis energy tariff during the summer months.  This will involve assessment of Bord Gáis Energy's own submission on gas prices which will be made in June or July, followed by a consultation process.  A decision by the regulator will follow in early September on whether any variation should be applied to the tariff from 1 October next.</p>
            <p eId="para_604">The continued entry of new suppliers into the residential gas market, offering discounts on the BGE rates, shows that regulatory policy to encourage the growth of competition in gas supply pays dividends for consumers.  Customers can also help to reduce the impact of rising prices by shopping around for the best deal.  They can also take steps to improve the efficiency of their gas usage as this will deliver demonstrable savings.</p>
            <p eId="para_605">The regulator is currently considering the timing for complete deregulation of the residential and small business segment of the gas market, as has happened in the electricity market.  Full deregulation leading to further competition will keep downward pressure on prices for consumers.  However, Ireland is a price-taker for gas and the outlook for the European gas market is for a continued rise in the commodity price.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MartinFerrisSF" eId="spk_305">
            <from>Deputy Martin Ferris</from>
            <p eId="para_606">I do not believe the application by Bord Gáis Energy for an increase of 20% in gas prices and 10% in electricity prices is justified.  As the Minister correctly stated, the company has cited global prices as a mitigating factor, despite the fact that the company made €120 million profit last year.  The company also admits that many of its customers are in arrears.  The obvious knock-on effect of an increase in prices will mean more people will fall into arrears of payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_607">When the Minister sat on this side of the House he tabled a Private Members' motion on the issue.  Does he intend to fulfil the Labour Party's election commitments to introduce a fuel poverty Bill?  Will that Bill include criteria to deal with exorbitant increases such as Bord Gáis's 20% and 10% increases in order to ensure that people on low incomes will have adequate fuel and heating and will not be cut off as has happened to ESB and Bord Gáis customers?</p>

            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_608">The Deputy is correct in that I responded to the huge increases in 2008.  Since then, the cumulative decline in prices has been 27% which does not mean that for the consumer the prospect of Bord Gáis raising its consumer price in the coming winter will be welcome.  I have expressed this view to the company and to the regulator.  I have been working with my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, on the fuel poverty dimension.  Deputy Ferris will understand the difficulty is that 95% of our gas is imported.  The Kinsale field is winding down and notwithstanding all that gas which Deputy Ferris and his colleagues discovered out there — I asked him to tell me where it is exactly so I can bring it ashore——</p>

            <p eId="para_610">We need to be able to pin it down because the extent of our reliance on a gas pipeline from elsewhere is not the ideal situation to be in.  If we could get the liquified natural gas project under way down in the Deputy's neck of the woods in Tarbert this would be a contribution and bringing the Corrib gas on stream would also make a contribution.  However, unfortunately, at the moment, because of events in Libya, the nuclear accident in Japan — a country which will have a voracious appetite for gas — because nuclear reactors are being shut down in mainland Europe and because China has an endless demand for gas, therefore, unlike the situation in the other Continent, in the United States, prices are trending upwards here.  The use of shale gas in the US means prices have come down there.  It does not seem to be having any effect on Europe, where market power is continuing to keep prices up.</p>

            <p eId="para_611">Will the Minister try to ensure the proposed fuel poverty Bill, which he has made a commitment to introduce, includes a provision that would prevent substantial price hikes like those being experienced at present?  He made the point that prices have decreased by 27% since 2008, but I make the point that people are far worse off than they were in 2008.  Given that Bord Gáis made a profit of €120 million last year, it is grotesque that it should be seeking gas and electricity price increases of 20% and 10% respectively at this time.</p>

            <p eId="para_612">The Deputy has made a fair point.  He is right to say that those who are in distress are in more acute distress now than they were in 2008.  I do not advance the fact that gas prices have decreased by 27% since then as any kind of excuse for them to increase.  I do not know how much it is intended they will rise by as no figure has been set.  The companies have put figures out there in broad terms.  It is ultimately a matter for the regulator.  It is true there are people in distress.  I have raised this directly with the chief executive and chairman of the company.  They have argued that they are going to great pains to introduce pay-as-you-go meters and other strategies to help those who find themselves in these circumstances.  I hope we will be able to soften the blow.  I do not know how severe the blow will be when it will come.  I imagine the regulator will take all factors, not just submissions from the companies, into account.</p>

            <p eId="para_614">As the Deputy is aware, the remit and obligations of RTE, as an independent national public service broadcaster, are set out in the Broadcasting Act 2009.  Section 114 of that Act sets out the principal objects and associated powers of RTE.  Section 98 provides that it "shall be independent in the pursuance of its objects", subject to the requirements of the Act.  Therefore, as Minister I have no function in RTE's general day-to-day operations, including matters relating to the management of its broadcasting infrastructure.  Having said that, I have contacted RTE to seek the information requested by Deputy Ó Fearghaíl.  RTE has advised that some of the sites which will not be used for digital terrestrial television are in use for other services, such as radio services, or are leased to telecommunications operators.  RTE will continue to use them after the analogue switch-off takes place.  Most of the other sites are owned by third parties.  I understand that RTE plans to decommission its television equipment from these sites as soon as the analogue signals have been switched off.</p>

Bhí sé ag iarraidh a fháil amach an mbeidh na crainn cumarsáide agus tarchuradóirí seo ar fáil do na comhlachtaí sin.  Can I take it that the Minister has been reassured by RTE that these sites will continue to be available for other purposes?  Will they be available to radio stations, emergency blue-light services and telephone companies?  If these masts were to become unavailable, it would interfere with the daily lives of those who depend on them for the provision of services.  Can I take it the Minister, who has general responsibility for communications, will ensure these sites continue to be available to those who need them in order to provide services to the public?</p>

            <p eId="para_616">The Deputy is right to suggest that these are valuable State assets.  There are crainn cumarsáide at 149 locations, but just 51 locations are needed to transmit digital terrestrial television.  That does not mean it is as simple as subtracting one from the other.  Quite a few of these facilities are used for other purposes.  I assure the Deputy there is no question of interfering with other functions, such as radio or mobile and fixed telephone services that are used for broadband purposes.  I do not rule out the possibility of using these masts for additional services after the switch-off.</p>

Will it be possible to ensure the future use of such sites for other services is ascertained before any of them are sold or disposed of in any way?  As the Minister is aware, people in many rural areas have encountered difficulties in getting suitable sites for masts for a range of services, including telephone services.  Can the Minister assure the House that he will pursue a policy of ensuring none of these sites, which are already in our possession, is disposed of until it is absolutely certain that it cannot be used for another communications purpose?  This is particularly important at a time when new spectrums are about to become available, as the Minister said, and when we are trying to upgrade rural broadband services, which are very important.</p>

            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_624">I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 23 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_625">The programme for Government commits to the provision of a feed-in tariff for microgenerators producing electricity for their own homes, farms and businesses and selling surplus electricity to the grid.  The programme also states that the tariff will not be significantly above the single energy market price for electricity.  In line with the programme for Government commitment, my Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland are finalising a cost-benefit analysis of a feed-in tariff programme for microgeneration.  I expect their assessment to be submitted to me shortly.  Any microgeneration programme must be fully cost-effective, taking into account the overall cost implications for all electricity consumers.  As part of their analysis, the authority and my Department are assessing the varying potential kilowatt levels of microgeneration installations in terms of the levels of support they would require.  The kilowatt size of installations and related costs and benefits will be factored into the overall assessment of a cost-efficient programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_626">ESB Electric Ireland is the only electricity supplier in the market that offers microgeneration tariffs to domestic customers who generate up to 11 kW.  ESB Networks agreed in 2009 to provide the necessary import export metering free of charge to the first 4,000 domestic microgeneration customers.  ESB Networks provides a support payment of ten cent per kilowatt hour for those eligible customers for the first 3,000 kW hours exported back to the grid annually for a period of five years.  The take-up of 364 customers has been disappointingly low despite a potential overall tariff rate of 19 cent per kilowatt hour being available.  This tariff is significantly above the single electricity market wholesale electricity price, which currently averages 7 cent per kilowatt hour.</p>
            <p eId="para_627">The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland is in an 18 month micro-generation pilot scheme which entails close monitoring of the performance of the 42 installations taking part.  Those participating in the pilot have been able to avail of the tariffs offered.  The findings from the pilot scheme are providing useful data which will inform the overall assessment of the optimum way forward to encourage the micro-generation sector.</p>

            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_628">Does the Minister agree that we do not need to reinvent the wheel given the large amount of information on micro-generation available internationally?  With an average tariff threshold for micro-generation of 50 kW in the rest of Europe, is it not self-evident that economies of scale arise the larger one designates the threshold?  Does he also accept that the average energy requirement of a farm — perhaps not in my part of the country but certainly in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's part of the world — is approximately 50 kW?  Permitting output of 50 kW would make such farms energy neutral and dairy and other farms would have zero net energy usage because they would be able to supply as much electricity to the grid as they took from it.  Will the Minister give a timescale for the completion of the various reviews, taking into account the European example?  Will he indicate when decisions will  be made?</p>

            <p eId="para_629">I do not know enough about the issue but I am trying to find out and learn about it.  I do not entirely agree that the Deputy is entitled to put on the béal bocht for Galway West as compared to Galway East given that farms in the east of the county tend to be small and the area does not have many milking parlours.</p>

            <p eId="para_631">Yes.  While stimulating the micro-generation sector is probably a positive thing to do, one has to consider the economics of the issue.  I set out the figures on the cost of the current feed in tariff and the minuscule amount of electricity going back into the grid.  I do not know whether economies of scale apply, as the Deputy suggests, although I am open to examining that proposition.  It is interesting that none of the other suppliers has entered the market and the ESB is on its own in that regard.  There will come a point at which it will no longer be economic, especially if only one of the electricity suppliers is playing a part in stimulating the micro-generation sector.</p>

            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_632">On the economics of the system at national level and for private companies and producers, the micro-generation of electricity is potentially a good source of income for farmers and would put their land to good use.  Does the Minister agree that in assessing the economics of the case for micro-generation, one must examine its potential for making small farms more viable, which is an objective to which the Government and European Union are committed?  It would also be economical from the point of view of the State in that it would use freely available resources, namely, wind and water.  One then has the economics for the private company.  Where the economics of micro-generation for the country and producers trump those for private companies, does the Minister agree that the State must adopt a policy to ensure the economics of private companies do not overrule the national interest and that, on that basis, a national policy is required?  Will he undertake to examine the reason the tariff threshold here is 11 kW on three phases and 6 kW on a single phase when the average tariff threshold in Europe is 50 kW?  Is this connected to the robustness of our grid?  Is upgrading the grid not the answer to the problem?</p>

            <p eId="para_633">I will undertake to examine the issue raised by the Deputy.  I do not know whether the position here is exactly analogous to the position in other EU member states.  While I support the idea of micro-generation in principle, we must examine the economics of the case.  If it is the Deputy's case that the level at which the tariff threshold means inherent failure is likely and that a higher threshold would allow micro-generation to make a meaningful contribution, I will certainly examine that proposition.</p>
            <p eId="para_634">It would perhaps be an understatement to say I receive occasional representations on the matter.  I receive a regular dribble of representations from different areas, primarily in the south, which could indicate they may be from farmers with significant land.  Now that the days are getting longer, I will examine the issue of micro-generation.</p>

            <p eId="para_637">I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 10 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_638">The metropolitan area networks, MANs, were built by the State throughout the country to deliver telecommunications infrastructure where the commercial telecommunications operators had not invested and market failure had therefore been identified.  The MANs are fibre optic networks mainly built in a ring formation around towns with populations above 1,500 persons.  Each MAN has a co-location centre where service providers can house their equipment.  The MANs contain more than 1,000 km of duct, sub-duct and high capacity fibre optic cable offering virtual limitless capacity.</p>
            <p eId="para_639">The MANs are a middle mile solution meaning that they fit between the local access delivered in towns by service providers and the national backhaul network, for example, ESB Telecoms and BT, which carries the traffic from the MANs to the central points of international connectivity in the country.  All the metropolitan area networks, including the MANs in Bantry, Skibbereen and Dunmanway, County Cork, are managed and operated by e|net, a company appointed by my Department following a procurement process.  e|net makes the networks available to the telecommunications sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_640">The MANs are operated on a wholesale carrier neutral and open access basis.  This means any service provider can use the network without having to invest privately and replicate network footprints throughout the country.  The MAN in Bantry is now delivering telecommunication services to that area.  In the case of the Dunmanway and Skibbereen MANs, there are no customers yet connected.  e|net is available to discuss the options for connection to these MANs with interested parties.  However, it is understood that there has been insufficient market demand for fibre connections in these towns to date.</p>

The report of the review group on State assets and liabilities has been published and is under active consideration by the Government, including consultation with stakeholders.

            <p eId="para_645">As I already have advised Members, the Government has clearly set out its intention to ensure that the semi-State sector will play a full role in Ireland's economic recovery.  The investment programmes of the State companies must be fully focused on delivering for the State as a shareholder and on the Government's strategic priorities.  Under the NewERA authority, existing and new investment programmes by the State companies will continue to be funded primarily by revenue streams, regulated income and appropriate borrowings.  They must also ensure the best possible return for the State as a shareholder.</p>

            <p eId="para_649">Clearly, before coming into government, the plan was to use the money in the National Pensions Reserve Fund, the vast majority of which, or more than €10 billion had to be used to bail out the banks.

            <p eId="para_650">On the sale of State assets, there are two ways to do this.  The first would be to write off the debt and the other, as my ministerial colleague, Deputy Rabbitte has stated, would be to create jobs.  Obviously on an individual basis the Government would be obliged to work with the IMF and EU in respect of the sale of any assets.  The clear preference of this side of the House — and I presume also on the Deputy's side — is that were those assets to be sold, job creation would be a productive way in which to use them and they would add to the money that is so urgently needed to create the infrastructure and jobs in broadband, in water and in bioenergy.</p>

The troika has told the Government that it will examine fully any proposals the latter may have for the disposal of State assets for the creation of employment, such as the NewERA projects.  I hope this response is crystal clear to the Deputy.</p>

            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_672">I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 27 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_673">The tragic events in Japan and the geopolitical events in North Africa and the Middle East underline the imperative for Ireland and the European Union as a whole to reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels.  Radical improvements in energy efficiency and the continued development and deployment of renewable energy are key priorities for the Government and this fully resonates with EU energy policy objectives.  In line with Ireland's legally binding target of 16% for renewable energy by 2020 under the renewable energy directive, the Government is committed to ensuring the progressive deployment of renewable energy across the transport, heat and electricity sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_674">The significant level of growth in renewable energy required over the next decade is challenging.  Ireland's national renewable energy action plan, which was submitted to the European Commission in 2010, sets out the projections for achieving the target and outlines the challenges to be addressed.  These challenges include timely delivery of grid infrastructure, planning permission, regulatory certainty and managing the interaction between renewable energy and environmental and biodiversity obligations.  Ireland's overall EU target will be largely achieved through the electricity sector with a target of 40% of electricity consumption from renewable sources by 2020.  This will be combined with a target of 12% in the heat sector and 10% in the transport sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_675">The incremental increase in renewable electricity is being delivered through the roll-out of projects under the Gate 3 grid connection process overseen by the Commission for Energy Regulation.  I have no role with regard to the consideration or approval of projects under this process.  The grid connections for these projects require the corresponding building out of the grid infrastructure, under EirGrid's Grid 25 strategy.  Most of the 3,900 MW in Gate 3 is made up of onshore wind projects.  By 2020, 36% of Ireland's electricity consumption will come from wind — proportionately the highest in the EU.  At present, there is 1,448 MW of wind connected to the grid, which represents approximately 15% of the country's electricity demand.</p>
            <p eId="para_676">Our targets for renewable energy are ambitious but achievable.  They also are vital to reducing Ireland's economic and strategic dependence on imported fossil fuels and to the progressive de-carbonisation of the economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_677">I thank the Minister for his comprehensive answer.  I have two brief supplementary questions.  Work was under way on a wave energy project in north-west County Mayo and I understand there was a great deal of interest in developing that form of energy on a commercial basis.  What is the updated position in respect of that work?</p>
            <p eId="para_678">Many of our wind energy resources are on the west coast, be they on land or sea.  Has the Government plans to consider providing national finances to ensure we can access that energy and have a grid to carry the energy?  Many of the areas in question do not have robust grid connections.</p>

            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_679">The Deputy is correct, in that the quality of wind supply along the west coast is the best in the country.  There are those who would argue it is the best in Europe.  Deputy Ó Cuív fully understands how the Government is constrained in terms of sourcing investment for this type of project.  None the less, the commercial sector in this area is growing and it is our task to facilitate such growth.  As the Deputy knows, a feed-in tariff would be required.  It is regrettable that we are constrained, as this sector is already making a significant contribution to the reliance of electricity production on wind.  There is tremendous further capacity.</p>
            <p eId="para_680">The Taoiseach asked me this week to examine the wave energy research project in more detail than I have managed to date.  I will let the Deputy know the outcome.</p>

            <p eId="para_681">Resources have always been constrained but we managed to provide national infrastructure in times when we were much poorer than we are now.  If infrastructure is required to bring large quantities of electricity from the west coast to the market, will the Minister ensure that its absence will not serve as a constraint on realising the potential of these resources for the people?</p>

            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_682">As one can infer from the Deputy's question, he knows that feedback to the grid is an expensive part of the process.  He will also be aware of EirGrid's ambitious investment plans for its development programme.  Notwithstanding recently published reports to the effect that, due to the dramatic step down in economic activity, we could afford to pull back on some of these plans, we are not minded to do so.  It is possible to build out some of the plans at a lesser cost than was the case only a couple of years ago.  I can give the Deputy support on that question.</p>

          <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_356">
            <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy</from>
            <p eId="para_686">I had the pleasure of meeting a group of employees of Clongowes Wood College last week.  Approximately 80 staff are employed in non-teaching roles, for example, in the kitchen, housekeeping, maintenance, the library, administration and so on.  Some of the jobs are relatively low paid.  While the subject I am raising affects these workers, it also affects staff like caretakers and school secretaries in most schools around the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_687">When the workers in Clongowes were recruited, they signed contracts with the school in the same way as any other private sector worker would have signed a contract.  They asked me what was the difference between them and the bankers who were not required to repay large bonuses because of private contractual arrangements that predated the banking failure.  The provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2.) Act 2009 preclude the renegotiation of that aspect of the bankers' contracts.  What is the difference between the school's workers and the senior bankers who could not have their contracts renegotiated?  These workers did not have the benefit of benchmarking or public service salary increments.  They ask how the Government can interfere in a private contractual arrangement when no public funds are used to pay their wages.</p>
            <p eId="para_688">If Clongowes is not the largest employer in Clane, it is close to it.  Of the 140 staff, 80 are in non-teaching roles and are directly affected by this measure.  The money has been taken out of their wages and, in turn, the local economy.  Since some of the workers are required to sign on during the summer, we are not referring to wealthy people.  They have ordinary jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_689">The legislation was accompanied by circular 70/2010, which states that all staff employed by a recognised school or vocational education committee fall within the definition of a public servant solely for the purpose of the Act.  This "applies regardless of the source of the money used to fund the salary", notwithstanding the fact that the Minister does not determine their terms and conditions of employment and irrespective of whether they are eligible for or members of a public service pension scheme.  The jobs initiative announced this week will dip into their pockets again, this time through their pension contributions.  It makes their situation doubly unfair.</p>
            <p eId="para_690">The 2009 emergency measures are due for review in June 2011.  Perhaps the Minister of State will confirm at what point the review will occur and whether it is intended to amend the section that applies specifically to workers in this category.  They are also seeking the withdrawal of circular 70/2010.  They have private contracts and are not paid out of the public purse.  As they are private sector workers, how can they be targeted in this way when they have private contractual arrangements with their private employer, namely, the school?  While I stress that they are not the only people affected, as caretakers and school secretaries are also involved, they comprise a particularly large group in a boarding school.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnPerry" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Innovation" eId="spk_357">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation (Deputy John Perry)</from>
            <p eId="para_691">I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue and extend to her the apologies of the Minister, Deputy Howlin, who is on Government business.</p>
            <p eId="para_692">In the context of the extreme economic and fiscal conditions of the State, the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 provides for the reduction in the pay rates of all persons employed by bodies deemed to be public service bodies for the purposes of the legislation with effect from 1 January 2010.  Such reductions apply irrespective of whether a particular post is funded in whole or in part through non-Exchequer funds or income.</p>
            <p eId="para_693">The non-teaching staff referred to, such as catering, maintenance and administration staff, are deemed to be public servants within the meaning of and for the purposes of the Act, whether employed in recognised public or private schools.  This position has been confirmed by legal advice.  The former Minister for Finance approved a temporary exemption under section 6 of the Act for certain categories of workers in the education sector, including caretakers and secretaries, until 31 December 2010.  Accordingly, the Act has been applied to those specific categories of workers in the education sector since 1 January only, in contrast to all other public servants.</p>
            <p eId="para_694">It is important to understand that while there are a variety of staff across the education sector who are employed by public service bodies as defined under the Act but are either wholly or partly funded from non-Exchequer sources, there are also staff undertaking the same or similar duties whose posts are fully Exchequer funded.  All of these staff have now been subject to the terms of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_695">It is also important to note that approximately €22 million in savings will be secured in 2011 through an average 5% reduction in funding grants to schools and vocational educational committees.  The reduced funding will reflect the reduction in pay since 1 January.  There is, therefore, a real saving to the State from this measure and all savings are important in maintaining public services.</p>
            <p eId="para_696">Section 7 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act provides that the Minister shall, before 30 June 2011 and every year thereafter, carry out a review of the operation, effectiveness and impact of the Act, having regard to the overall economic conditions in the State and national competitiveness; consider whether the provisions of the Act continue to be necessary having regard to the purposes of the Act, the revenues of the State and Exchequer commitments in respect of public service pay and pensions; make such findings as he or she thinks appropriate consequent on the review and consideration; and cause a written report on his or her findings resulting from the review and consideration to be prepared and laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  However, that review will not involve the consideration of the position of individual public servants.</p>
            <p eId="para_697">Full consideration of the position of the group in question was given by the previous Minister for Finance and there are no plans to reconsider the application of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act to the categories of staff referred to.  As mentioned, the application of the legislation to such staff has been confirmed by legal advice, given that the staff are employed by public service bodies within the meaning of the legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_698">The Deputy also asked about the application of the proposed pension fund levy to the individuals in question.  I am unaware of the circumstances of the individuals concerned, but the pension fund levy will apply to the market value of assets in funded pension schemes at a rate of 0.6%.  It will be a matter for the trustees or administrators of individual pension schemes to determine whether or to what extent individual pensions will be affected.  The purpose of the pension fund levy is to fund the measures announced in the jobs initiative, including the reduction in the lower rate of VAT on certain services from 13.5% to 9% and the reduction in employer PRSI, both of which will benefit lower paid workers.</p>

            <from>Deputy John O’Mahony</from>
            <p eId="para_699">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this major issue for discussion on the Adjournment.  I raise it because of my concern for Cordil Construction, a major construction company which has been trading for many years in the west — in fact, all over the country — and completed numerous projects for both the State and private clients to the highest standards.  It has continued to grow and be profitable, even in the teeth of a recession in the past four years.  It has successfully completed projects for the Departments of Education and Skills, Defence, Environment, Community and Local Government and Health and Children, as well as many other State agencies.  It employs more than 50 workers directly and hundreds indirectly when subcontractors and suppliers are taken into account.</p>
            <p eId="para_700">It was ironic that last Tuesday, just as the Minister was announcing the jobs initiative, which I welcome, this company was getting ready a letter to its subcontractors and suppliers and temporarily suspending work on 15 sites throughout the country because of a serious cash flow problem caused by the withdrawal of overdraft facilities by its bank.  The facility was reduced from €2 million to €150,000.  However, the company is owed up to €4 million for projects already completed for the State and has many live projects ready to start.  I appeal to someone to explain why there is no joined-up thinking on this issue.  The bank involved is State-owned and the contracts involved are State contracts.  Could one side of the house not help the other in order to save more than 1,000 jobs and the State the cost of putting all these workers on the dole queue at more than €25,000 per head?</p>
            <p eId="para_701">I am glad to see the Minister of State with responsibility for small business, Deputy John Perry, is taking this matter because I know of his keen interest in this topic and the great work he has done on the jobs initiative projects and in bringing jobs to his area.  I have no agenda whatsoever for this company.  My only interest is to keep people at work and paying taxes to the State rather than drawing social welfare payments from it.</p>
            <p eId="para_702">In the past few days alone I have been contacted by a number of suppliers and subcontractors who are facing ruin if this company goes under.  It would cause ruin to all of the people concerned and their families and cost the State more than €11 million per year in social welfare payments.  It would also delay all of the State projects mentioned, as well as the other work in which the company is involved, and cost extra money to put these projects back on track and award them to some other company.  As I said, I have been contacted by a number of subcontractors and suppliers.  I have also been speaking to employees of the company who are willing to restructure in any way possible if it will keep the jobs alive.  I appeal to whoever is in power to do whatever is necessary.  I am sure there are many other companies in a similar position.  It just does not make sense to let this company go over a simple cash flow problem.  We have spoken here on many occasions about recapitalisation of the banks and so on.  This is a classic example of a bank squeezing a company and not allowing it to trade or continue to employ workers.</p>

            <from>Deputy John Perry</from>
            <p eId="para_703">I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter on the Adjournment and assure him of my concern about the matter.  I know he has been working on this case for some time and his concern is evident.</p>
            <p eId="para_704">I understand the company yesterday informed various employers and subcontractors that it intended to suspend all works on its projects for a period of two weeks owing to unforeseen factors encountered by it on its building sites, with the temporary loss of approximately 450 jobs.  I am informed that it is involved in a number of contracts with Departments, including some school building and Health Service Executive projects.  It has stated it is owed payment for building projects undertaken on behalf of the State and that it is experiencing cash flow problems due to difficulties in securing credit from its suppliers.  Officials from my Department have been in contact with the Department of Education and Skills and I have been assured that all moneys due to be paid under the terms of the main contracts have been paid to the company.</p>
            <p eId="para_705">From contact made with the Department of Health and Children, I understand that, following a number of openly advertised tender competitions, the Health Service Executive contracted the company to construct a number of health care facilities.  The company successfully tendered on the advertised terms and each awarded contract was a fixed price contract in line with Department of Finance procedures.  The executive was not made aware until recently of the contractor's dissatisfaction with the fixed price contract process.</p>
            <p eId="para_706">I have been informed that, currently, both the executive and the contractor are engaged in a confidential conciliation process to which both parties are bound and, as a consequence, the executive cannot comment on the specifics of each project.  The HSE is committed to working within the conciliation process.  As Deputy O'Mahony stated, it is important to have State involvement, State contracts and this conciliation process, which I sincerely hope will go some way towards resolving this difficulty.</p>
            <p eId="para_707">While I am very concerned about the difficulties being experienced by the company and the effect that even these temporary job losses have on the workers involved and their families as well as the local community, the Deputy will appreciate that there is a conciliation process under way and it would be inappropriate for me to intervene at this time.  However, I urge all parties involved to engage meaningfully to expedite the process.  I cannot overemphasise the importance of this process, including the role of banks in providing a credit line to companies having regard to the cashflow difficulties encountered.  As Deputy O'Mahony stated, if the process is not resolved, the job losses will be immense and, on foot of such an action, there would be a massive reaction in the locality.  I sincerely hope this process will be effective.</p>
            <p eId="para_708">One of the key issues that impacts on the ability of viable businesses to create jobs is that of access to credit.  It is essential.  This is a challenge the Government is determined to address and we must not underestimate that challenge at present.  The recently announced plans to restructure and recapitalise the banking system form the principal response to this challenge.  These plans are designed to secure an adequate flow of credit into the economy to support economic recovery, even as the banking system is downsized.  The banking system must provide substantial new lending into the economy.  The business plans submitted by the pillar banks provide for more than €30 billion of total new lending over the next three years across their core business areas.  Up to €20 billion of this figure, which represents a huge investment, will go to small and medium-sized businesses, which are the backbone of our economic recovery.  Deputy O'Mahony stated that the need for such investment in the economy in his region is critical.</p>
            <p eId="para_709">Against this background, I note from the correspondence my office received on this Adjournment matter that the company has been in continual discussions with its bank during the past fortnight in regard to the provision of a temporary facility and, given the large number of jobs at stake, I will not name the bank.  I encourage all the parties involved to take a pragmatic approach in agreeing a mutually satisfactory arrangement to maintain the jobs of the workers involved.  This is a very important issue.  It is at the core of this economy.  It involves 450 jobs directly and indirectly.  It is critical that those involved in the conciliation process, the State bodies and the bank play a meaningful role in the resolution of this matter and save the jobs in this important region.  I thank Deputy O'Mahony for raising this important matter and one hopes a resolution will be forthcoming.</p>

          <heading>Health Service Funding</heading>
          <speech by="#MattieMcGrath" eId="spk_360">
            <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath</from>
            <p eId="para_710">I am delighted to have the opportunity to raise this matter.  The HSE has made a decision to terminate the funding of Rape Crisis Network Ireland and SAFE Ireland, the national network for domestic violence services.  These two networks between them deliver an expert national programme of work on sexual and domestic violence.  They join up services across Ireland and establish standards and access for survivors.  They also deliver evidence and knowledge without which the Government, specifically Ministers across six Departments, would be hard pressed to form coherent or effective policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_711">The HSE will effectively terminate many of these valuable services on 1 June.  I understand the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy James Reilly, has extended this deadline for one month while he conducts a review, which is very welcome, of the decisions taken by the HSE.  Some of the networks' functions have now gone out to a limited tender.  In regard to one of those functions, data collection, I have to hand an independent, expert assessment conducted by Dr. Maureen Lyons, the director of research design and methodology in the equality studies department in UCD, of the RCNI data collection system, which is due to be terminated, and a comparison with the HSE replacement.  Dr Lyons's assessment is that the HSE data collection is not fit for purpose.  That is an important point to note.  It is clear that the HSE does not have adequate capacity in this regard.  Who assesses the HSE and its capacity?  Clearly it does not have adequate capacity in this respect.  Where is the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, and the other groups when it comes to these vital services and the survivors who are lucky to be alive and are trying to live with the effects of what they have suffered daily?  We are all aware from articles in the newspapers today of the situation in Donegal affecting 25 assault victims.</p>
            <p eId="para_712">The HSE has decided to terminate all funding to the Rape Crisis Network Ireland and SAFE Ireland affecting all existing and planned work on preventing and addressing child sexual abuse and sexual and domestic violence, and the terms of reference issued for the selection of a future service provider are totally inadequate.  I would like to know who drew up the terms of reference.  They are inadequate and betray a lack of expertise in and knowledge of the area.  They indicate a lack of capacity on the part of the HSE to fulfil its functions to protect those affected by abuse and domestic and sexual violence.  The HSE is effectively dismissing the gold standard data collection system which it has funded and which has been developed by Rape Crisis Network Ireland over seven years.  It is an international model of best practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_713">I seek a reversal of the HSE decision and suspension of actions under implementation by the HSE.  This is very alarming for groups locally and national umbrella bodies.  If it is considered that there is some fat at the top in the national bodies, which I do not believe there is, we will accept change.  The tender documents that have been issued are totally inadequate.  We need a reversal of these decisions.  The Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, Mr. Sean Aylward, has also sought a reversal of this decision.  The Minister has stood down that board of the HSE and who is in charge there now?  There are senior officials of the Department in place.  Accountability and transparency are vital but above all what is badly needed is certainty regarding the continuation of services.  The angst and anxiety experienced by all the groups and their users — the service users are the people this is all about — must be alleviated by confirming certainty regarding the continuation of services.</p>

          <speech by="#RoisinShortall" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_361">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Róisín Shortall)</from>
            <p eId="para_714">I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy James Reilly.  I thank Deputy Mattie McGrath for raising it as it provides an opportunity to clarify any confusion and address any concerns on this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_715">Domestic, sexual and gender-based violence are a serious health and human rights issue.  The Government's commitment to tackling this problem is clearly demonstrated by its continued support of Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence.  It was established in 2007 under the aegis of the Department of Justice and Equality.  Cosc's key task is to ensure the delivery of a well co-ordinated whole-of-government response to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence against women, men and older people in the community.</p>
            <p eId="para_716">In March 2010 Cosc launched a four-year strategy to provide a framework for sustainable intervention to prevent and effectively respond to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  The Health Service Executive published its policy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence which dovetails into Cosc's national strategy.  The HSE's policy states a health-focused analysis of violence is crucial, not only because the consequences of such violence require a significant amount of health care system resources, but most important because the health care system is often the first route through which victims seek to access supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_717">The HSE, as per its statutory responsibility, is committed to funding organisations that provide domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services.  Based on the level of resources available, the HSE is examining how to meet the needs of victims of domestic and sexual abuse and to ensure that value for money and accountability are paramount with the avoidance of duplication.</p>
            <p eId="para_718">As part of this process, changes to funding arrangements have been proposed by the HSE.  The Minister for Health and Children has instructed the HSE to extend the current funding to the Rape Crisis Network and SAFE Ireland until 1 August.  This will allow him and his officials time to continue their review of these proposals and to satisfy themselves as to their nature.</p>
            <p eId="para_719">These two network organisations, the Rape Crisis Network and SAFE Ireland, do not provide any direct services to victims of abuse.  These are provided by 62 other organisations funded by the HSE, including 20 crisis refuges, 27 domestic violence support services and 16 rape crisis centres.  Total expenditure in this area in 2009 came to over €19 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_720">HSE officials in the directorate of families and children social services have assured the Minister that if the changes to the funding arrangements are put in place, all current funding will be staying in this sector of service provision, aimed at supporting victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  However, it is planned that some of the funding will be redirected towards activities identified by the national strategy.  I will relay Deputy Mattie McGrath's points about data collection to the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_721">This initiative is not a cost-containment project but rather seeks to ensure value for money, to reduce duplication and promote a greater focus on victims.  There is no plan to decrease the financial allocation to support domestic and sexual violence services in excess of any agreement between the HSE and Government allocation.  The terms of reference for the selection of providers for future projects were agreed between the HSE and Cosc and include, among other factors, the capacity and relevant experience of the organisations applying.</p>
            <p eId="para_722">The Minister is committed to ensuring all efforts are made to make adequate provision for the victims of violence.</p>

            <p eId="para_746">As I am sure the Deputy is aware, the current TV licence system is that, except for certain classes of social welfare recipients, if you own a television set in Ireland you are liable to pay a television licence.  An Post is currently responsible for the collection of television licence fees and for identifying those persons who have unlicensed television sets.</p>
            <p eId="para_747">The Programme for Government commits to examining the role and collection of the TV Licence Fee in light of existing and projected convergence of broadcasting technologies and to transform the TV licence into a household based Public Broadcasting Charge to be applied to all households and applicable businesses, regardless of the device they use to access content.</p>
            <p eId="para_748">In line with this commitment, my Department is currently undertaking an exercise whereby it is examining both the effectiveness and efficiency of the current model of television licence fee collection, in the context of the changing technological environment, and examining the efficiency of various international models for the funding of public service broadcasting.  The results of the exercise will be an analysis of the most effective models in terms of efficiency, capability to fund our public service broadcasting service and equity of applicability.</p>
            <p eId="para_749">I would emphasise the need to provide certainty as regards the funding base for public service broadcasting.  The licence fee has provided much certainty although it is subject to a certain degree of evasion.</p>
            <p eId="para_750">Any changes that may be proposed and implemented must continue to provide a secure base for public service broadcasting funding whilst also recognising the reality of new mechanisms to access TV content.</p>

            <p eId="para_756">Mobile telecommunications are an electronic communications service under the terms of European legislation.  The relevant national regulations in respect of mobile service provision have been updated over time to reflect developments in the EU and market developments generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_757">In 2003, national regulations were introduced to transpose the liberalised EU telecommunications market, as reflected in the 2002 EU regulatory framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_758">The 2003 EU regulatory framework has since been amended at European level.  My Department has been consulting with industry on the transposition of the new framework.  Drafting of the necessary national regulations is ongoing with a view to full transposition later this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_759">The individual licensing of any wireless communications equipment is a function of the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts 1926 to 2009.  Under those Acts mobile telecommunications service providers and operators are required to obtain licences from ComReg.</p>
            <p eId="para_760">They are also required to comply with licence conditions set by ComReg in accordance with regulations made by ComReg under the Acts and in accordance with the 2002 EU Regulatory Framework. The relevant regulations are made by ComReg with the consent of the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_761">I am satisfied that the existing and proposed new Regulations currently meet the needs of industry and consumers.

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Pat Rabbitte)</from>
            <p eId="para_764">I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 32 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_765">The planning, development and routing of transmission line infrastructure is a matter for EirGrid, which is the State owned body responsible for the electricity transmission system.  I have no statutory function regarding the planning and construction of energy networks.</p>
            <p eId="para_766">The Government fully endorses the strategic national importance of investing in Ireland's electricity transmission infrastructure.  In that context the Meath-Tyrone 400KV interconnector is a key strategic project for the economies and consumers both North and South.  It is also critical to ensuring energy supply adequacy on the island of Ireland.  Subject to planning permission North and South it is due to be completed by 2016 or 2017.</p>
            <p eId="para_767">The costs of building and maintaining the national electricity transmission system are met through network tariffs charged to electricity consumers and are regulated by the Commission for Energy Regulation.  The cost is not borne by the taxpayer.</p>
            <p eId="para_768">The all-island Generation Capacity Statement 2011-2020 notes that while there has been a fall in electricity demand due to the economic downturn, a recovery in electricity demand is projected from 2012 and annually up to 2020.  The report notes separately that the generation adequacy situation for the next ten years is positive and will be enhanced by the additional capacity provided by the interconnector.</p>
            <p eId="para_769">The North-South interconnector is a long term investment which is critical to the security of electricity supply on the island, to the achievement of renewable targets North and South, and to the effective operation of the Single Electricity Market.  It is not just a prudent but an essential investment in the interests of both economies and all energy consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_770">The absence of the second North South interconnector is posing significant costs on electricity generators and consumers on both sides of the border.  These costs are in the region of €20m to €30m each year and are set to increase every year the interconnector is not in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_771">I have no information to support the assertion that it will take many years before the Northern Ireland section of the Interconnector project is evaluated by the planning authorities there.  The timeframe for the completion of the planning process is clearly a matter for the planning authorities in Northern Ireland.  The necessity and urgency of the project is fully recognised by the Northern Ireland administration given the very serious implications for energy cost and security of supply should the project not proceed.</p>
            <p eId="para_772">The current economic downturn does not diminish in any way the need for the North South interconnector as a long term strategic investment for decades to come.  To postpone its development would not be in the interests of the economy and consumers North and South.</p>
            <p eId="para_773">The Programme for Government commits to the establishment of an independent international expert commission to review within six months the case for, and cost of, undergrounding all or part of the Meath-Tyrone line.</p>
            <p eId="para_774">EirGrid has begun a new round of non statutory public consultation in relation to the Meath–Tyrone interconnector preparatory to a formal new application to An Bord Pleanála.  A key aspect of the pre-planning process is an assessment of the environmental and agricultural impacts.  This needs to be carried out in the growing season.</p>
            <p eId="para_775">This preparatory work by EirGrid does not in anyway pre-empt or undermine the Programme for Government commitment.  There is no requirement in the Programme for Government that EirGrid should halt all preparatory work and EirGrid has publicly stated that they will fully cooperate with the review and have due regard to its findings.</p>
            <p eId="para_776">As soon as I am satisfied with arrangements for the proposed commission I will be announcing its establishment and I have asked my Department to expedite those arrangements in the coming weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_778">The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has statutory responsibility for grid connection offers and for oversight of EirGrid's grid connection process, including the Gate Three process for renewable energy projects which are primarily medium to large scale wind projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_779">I welcome the fact that the CER took the decision two years ago, to adopt a more pragmatic and responsive approach to the need of small scale renewable energy generators.  Essentially all such grid connections are dealt with outside the Gate Three process and therefore are receiving priority access.</p>
            <p eId="para_780">The categories of renewable technologies covered by this arrangement include bioenergy, Combined Heat and Power, and small scale wind projects of 0.5MW or less.  Within those headings, small scale anaerobic digesters and district heating are included.</p>

            <p eId="para_782">The informal Energy Council held on the 3rd   May in Budapest discussed progress to date on the Energy 2050 Roadmap which is being developed by the Commission.  There was general agreement to the overall strategic direction proposed by the Commission to decarbonise Europe's energy system as part of the overall EU commitment to decarbonise the Economy by 2050.</p>
            <p eId="para_783">It was agreed that the set of long term roadmaps being developed by the European Commission, including energy and transport, should be fully consistent with each other.  The achievement of a decarbonised European economy is fully dependent on clear synergies between sectoral roadmaps.</p>
            <p eId="para_784">The strategic priorities of energy efficiency and renewable energy were highlighted.  There was also a discussion on the merits of setting intermediate targets in due course for 2030 in order to focus and reinforce progress. The three pillars of European energy policy (security of supply, competitiveness and sustainability) should be reinforced by the addition of job creation as a key objective for energy policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_785">The informal Council also underlined the imperative of delivering essential energy infrastructure investment across Europe together with Research and Development and an enhanced focus on the needs of energy consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_786">There was also a discussion on Europe's external energy policy challenges in light of current geopolitical events.  The need for European solidarity in external energy policy matters was emphasised as was the importance of delivering on the EU's internal energy policy objectives to ensure credibility in external energy negotiations.</p>

            <p eId="para_789">I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 29 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_790">I have responsibility for a range of commercial semi-State bodies that play critical roles in the Irish economy, not only by providing essential infrastructure and services but as significant employers.  Most of them also contribute substantial dividends to the Exchequer on foot of their successful investment programmes and resultant profitability.</p>
            <p eId="para_791">The Report of the Review Group on State Assets and Liabilities, chaired by Mr Colm McCarthy, has recently been presented to Government and published.</p>
            <p eId="para_792">The Government is currently considering the recommendations of that Report in line with the Programme for Government commitments, the new national development plan, and the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland.  The Government is also consulting the key stakeholders.  Future decisions in relation to the recommendations of the Report will be a matter for the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_793">With regard to the locus of ownership of the electricity transmission assets, Directive 2009/72/EC, which allows for various options in relation to the unbundling of the transmission assets, entered into force in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_794">Extensive analysis of the options in the Irish context has been carried out, most recently in the completion of a report by Frontier Economics, under an Independent Chair.  The Independent analysis included an assessment of the costs, benefits and regulatory impact of the legal options for unbundling under the Directive set in the context of overall EU energy policy developments and the All Island single electricity market.</p>
            <p eId="para_795">I will be bringing proposals to Government in due course with a recommendation on the next steps with regard to the future ownership of the electricity transmission assets.

            <p eId="para_798">Energy and communications are key elements underpinning the Government's commitment to our international competitiveness, and supporting the protection and creation of jobs.  This week I launched "Better Energy" — a major step forward in the Government's energy efficiency retrofitting programme.  Under the Jobs initiative an additional €30 million will be allocated to this programme in 2011 matched by a further €30 million in private sector investment.  As a result, an additional 2,000 jobs will be created in 2011, on top of the existing 3,800 jobs supported by the existing budget allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_799">I will be working with Minister Bruton, and State Agencies under both our remits, on the economic and employment potential of renewable energy resources of wind and wave.  Activities including areas such as maintenance services, operations, device testing and port infrastructure development will be explored.</p>
            <p eId="para_800">A significant beginning was made this week and I will continue to actively work with my colleagues to assist and support job creation and opportunities, in as far as possible, across relevant sectors.</p>

In common with many rivers in the South West fishing on the River Laune is weather dependent.  According to Inland Fisheries Ireland, weather conditions in 2010 were such that the days on which an angler could fish were limited.  In light of this, I am advised that the preliminary catch figure of 1256 fish for 2010 is in fact reasonably good (the final verified catch figure for the Laune will be published later this year by Inland Fisheries Ireland in its annual catch statistic report).</p>

            <p eId="para_840">I assume the recent reports to which the Deputy is referring relate to Licensing Option 08/2 which was granted to Providence Resources plc and Star Energy Oil and Gas Ltd in 2008.  Star Energy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Petronas International Corporation Ltd.  The Licensing Option was awarded to the companies for a three year period to 17th   August 2011 and covers an area of approximately 960 square kilometres in the Kish Bank Basin, off the coast of Dublin.  The Option is subject to an agreed work programme to assess the hydrocarbon potential of the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_841">The companies identified an exploration prospect in the licensed area from a new analysis of existing seismic data.  The prospect, known as "Dalkey Island", has not been drilled to date and therefore is not an oil discovery.  The commercial hydrocarbon potential, if any, of the prospect will not be known until the structure is drilled and fully evaluated.  By the end of the Option period in August this year, the companies must either apply for a Petroleum Exploration Licence or surrender the acreage.  Any Petroleum Exploration Licence awarded over the area would be subject to a commitment by the licensees to drill an exploration well in the first three years of the licence.</p>

Officers wishing to be considered for posting are required to notify their language skills with their applications.  The Department's Training Unit assists and facilitates staff in improving their foreign language proficiency levels both prior to and during foreign assignments.  All staff working in these missions would have some facility in the local language. A number have reasonable to good fluency.</p>

            <p eId="para_881">We have received reports, including from our Embassy in Cyprus, regarding the arrest of a group of people by Turkish military personnel in Famagusta, northern Cyprus on 12 March.    Those arrested included four members of the European Parliament, a clergyman and two other citizens of the Republic of Cyprus.  It is reported that on 12 March some of the group entered a church in Varosha, the fenced-off area of Famagusta, where they were arrested by the Turkish Army.  The visit to the church was part of a trip organised by a Cypriot MEP to check on damage to Christian churches in the occupied part of the island.</p>
            <p eId="para_882">Most detainees were released shortly after their arrest. However, two Greek Cypriots were tried and found guilty of allegedly entering a restricted military zone, and were released on 14 March after paying a fine.</p>
            <p eId="para_883">We understand that spokespersons for Commissioner Füle and European Parliament President Buzek expressed regret at the detention of the MEPs and welcomed their subsequent release.  We are not aware, however, that this matter has been the subject of specific representations at EU level.</p>

            <p eId="para_886">The provision of consular assistance by my Department is governed by the terms of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations which was incorporated into Irish law in 1967.  Art 37 of that convention stipulates that where a foreign citizen dies in the host country, the relevant authorities of the host country have an obligation to advise the resident/accredited Consular Mission of the deceased's country of citizenship as soon as possible after the death has been confirmed.  When an Irish Mission is notified of the death of an Irish citizen, every effort is made, either by the Mission or our Consular Assistance Section, to inform the deceased's next of kin, via the police, as quickly as possible.  I am informed that that the number of cases where the relevant Irish Mission was not officially notified of the death of an Irish citizen in that country is extremely rare.</p>
            <p eId="para_887">Following on from a media report some months ago which suggested that Irish citizens were being buried in the UK without contact being made with next of kin and a subsequent enquiry by the Deputy, our Embassy in London made enquiries with a number of local authorities in areas with significant Irish populations (Camden, Ealing, Hammersmith, Southwark, Brent) and found no evidence to suggest that the "public burial" of Irish citizens occurs in anything other than very rare cases.  I am also informed that while the local authorities do not record such burials by nationality they could not recall any recent cases of Irish people requiring public burials.</p>
            <p eId="para_888">I can assure the Deputy that our Embassy assists the police and local authorities in locating relatives of deceased Irish people with no next of kin who come to their attention.  Also Irish community and voluntary agencies, which are supported by Government funding, provide a similar service.</p>
            <p eId="para_889">I can also advise the Deputy that our Embassy has written to all local authorities in areas with significant Irish populations to ask that it be contacted in cases of deaths of Irish citizens where no next of kin can be located.</p>

            <p eId="para_891">The position is that the universal social charge (USC) applies to all emoluments of an employment, including anything treated as a taxable benefit-in-kind.  The USC also applies to a person's aggregate income before granting relief in respect of pension contributions, including contributions to a personal retirement savings account (PRSA), a personal pension plan, additional voluntary contributions or a retirement annuity contribution.  For the purposes of determining the overall contribution to a PRSA, the amount contributed by an employer is specifically treated as the employee's own contribution and, for this reason, both are subject to the USC in the same way as any other type of pension contribution made by an employee. In contrast, an employer's contribution to a non-PRSA occupational pension is not treated as the employee's own contribution and is not taxed as a benefit-in-kind.  If this treatment were not to apply and if the employer contribution, which for PRSA purposes is treated as if it were made by the employee, were to be exempt from USC, an employee who is in a position to influence his or her employer to make contributions to a PRSA on his or her behalf would not pay USC on these contributions, but an employee who is unable to get his or her employer to contribute to his or her PRSA, and instead personally makes contributions of the same amount from his or her own resources, would suffer USC on those contributions.</p>
            <p eId="para_892">I should point out that there is a commitment in the Programme for Government to carry out a review of the USC and I would anticipate that the review will be completed in time for Budget 2012.  The USC treatment of PRSA's may well be within the ambit of the review.</p>

            <p eId="para_896">I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 44 and 45 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_897">The Deputy will be aware that, under the EU/IMF Programme of Support for Ireland, we have certain commitments in relation to the credit union sector.  One of these commitments is to have the Commission on Credit Unions established by end-May 2011.  I intend to meet this target.</p>
            <p eId="para_898">The Terms of Reference for the Commission will be agreed later this month by Government Decision.  The Programme for National Government 2011-2016 sets out the Government position with regard to the credit union sector.  The Government recognises the important role of credit unions as a volunteer cooperative movement and the distinction between them and other types of financial institutions.  It is intended that, as described in the Programme for Government, the Commission will review the future of the credit union movement and make recommendations in relation to the most effective regulatory structure for Credit Unions.  This will take into account their not-for-profit mandate, their volunteer ethos and community focus, while paying due regard to the need to fully protect depositors' savings and financial stability.</p>
            <p eId="para_899">It is clear that legislation will be necessary.  The Government has made a commitment under the EU/IMF Programme of Support to submit legislation to the Oireachtas by end-2011 to assist credit unions with a strengthened regulatory framework, including more effective governance and regulatory requirements.  The Commission will be required to design a strategy for the future evolution of the sector and while I would not wish to preempt the outcome of the Commission's deliberations, I would envisage that the legislative provisions contained in the Credit Union Act 1997 will have to be amended to underpin the structure, operation and regulation of a modern credit union sector.</p>

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that while corresponding updates of the cost figures are not yet available for the tax year 2009 the necessary work of assembling the basic data to enable this to be done is ongoing.  No data is available for 2010.</p>

Most such construction contracts are publicly advertised. In other instances the equipment could be included in specific heating works contracts.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Ciarán Cannon)</from>
            <p eId="para_992">I propose to take Questions Nos. 53, 54 and 61 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_993">The changes to school transport services were announced in the 2011 Budget by the previous Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government and derive from a recommendation in the Value for Money Review of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_994">It is important to stress that there are a number of dimensions to the cessation of the Closed School Rule. The first of these, which will be implemented from September 2011, involves the uniform application of the distance criterion to all pupils travelling under the primary transport scheme, including those travelling under the closed school rule.  This means that children residing less than 3.2 kilometres from the school of amalgamation will be deemed ineligible for school transport. In such cases, these children may apply for concessionary transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_995">The second element of the change is scheduled to take effect in September 2012 and will apply only in the case of pupils commencing their primary education from that date, who meet the distance eligibility criterion and are travelling to their nearest school.  Available statistics, based on sampling undertaken as part of the Value for Money Review, indicate that the impact of this change will be limited as the majority of pupils categorised under the closed school rule are in fact attending their nearest school and will not be affected by this change.</p>
            <p eId="para_996">Before implementing this second main change which is proposed for 2012, my Department has requested Bus Éireann to conduct a detailed analysis of the "on the ground" impact for individual schools and the rural communities they serve, including County Donegal.  This analysis will be based on the most up to date information available on current school transport usage patterns and I expect to have this information available to me this summer.</p>
            <p eId="para_997">I will then have an opportunity to carefully examine the likely affects of this change well in advance of the 2012 implementation date. Given the major financial constraints facing the country, I regret that I cannot reverse the changes to school transport as announced by the previous Government.  We all have to understand the legacy of economic mismanagement which the last Government gave to the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_999">I wish to advise the Deputy that the decision to withdraw Resource Teacher for Travellers was taken by the previous Government as part of the last Budget.  The requirement to make expenditure savings and to ensure that staffing numbers remain within the Public Service Employment Control Framework prevent me from re-visiting this decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1000">Resource Teacher for Traveller posts/Teaching Hours for Traveller pupils will be withdrawn, effective from 31st August 2011.

All schools should select students for learning support on the basis of priority of need.</p>

The schools involved have already received their staffing allocations for next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1003">For schools other than DEIS schools in receipt of enhanced pupil teacher ratios, alleviation measures are being provided to assist schools with high concentrations of Traveller pupils who were previously supported by RTT posts.  Any alleviation measures must be considered in the context of the limited resources that are available to my Department.  As such, alleviation measures are being concentrated on schools which had 33 or more pupils supported by RTT posts, based on 2009/10 school year enrolments.</p>

            <p eId="para_1012">I understand that the changes to the student grant schemes introduced under Budget 2011 by the previous Fianna Fail — Green Party government were designed to manage additional cost pressures arising from a significant increase in the number of students qualifying for grants, a proportionate increase in the number of students qualifying for higher rates of grants and payment of the Student Service Charge on behalf of grant-holders.</p>
            <p eId="para_1013">These changes include removal of the automatic eligibility of mature students to the higher non-adjacent rate of grant.  This will come into effect from the start of the 2011/12 academic year.</p>

In addition, some €5 million remains available through the access offices of third-level institutions to assist students in exceptional financial need.</p>

            <p eId="para_1100">The provision of electronic communications services, including broadband, is, in the first instance, a matter for private sector service providers.  Significant improvements have been made in recent years in terms of broadband availability and broadband quality.  For example, broadband products with speeds ranging from 25 megabits per second (mbps) up to 100 mbps are now available to over 500,000 premises using coaxial cable.  Basic telephone lines now provide  digital subscriber line quality (DSL) offering speeds of up to 24 mbps, depending on distance from exchanges. In addition to these improvements in fixed line services, developments in wireless technologies are also delivering higher speeds.  WiMax products, which are increasingly available, offer speeds of up to 10 mbps while mobile broadband speeds of up to 21 mbps are also available in some areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1101">Under the NewERA proposals in the Programme for Government there is a commitment to co-invest with the private sector and commercial Semi State sector to provide Next Generation Broadband to every home and business in the State.  Consideration of how best to advance these proposals, for which my colleague Minister of State O'Dowd has specific responsibility, is being advanced by my Department with other stakeholders across Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1102">In order to accelerate the development of high speed broadband, my colleague, the Minister of State Deputy O'Dowd, and I intend to engage intensively with industry.  The discussions will focus on identifying private and State sector investment plans, removal of barriers to investment where appropriate, and establishing appropriate targets and programmes.  The Next Generation Broadband Taskforce (NGBT), which includes representatives of large and smaller telecommunications network providers, will consider how best to roll out Next Generation Broadband.  The NGBT will meet shortly to discuss policy and related matters.  I expect that the NGBT will be helpful in terms of identifying the optimal policy position to deliver wider customer access to high-speed broadband.</p>

            <p eId="para_1215">I wish to inform the Deputy that Charities in Ireland have been unregulated since the foundation of the State.  The purpose of the Charities Act 2009 is to enact a reform of the law relating to charities in order to ensure accountability and to protect against abuse of charitable status and fraud.  It will also enhance public trust and confidence in charities and increase transparency in the charities sector.  The Charities Act 2009, together with the Charities Acts 1961 and 1973 and the Street and House to House Collections Act 1962, will provide for a composite regulatory framework for charities through a combination of new legislative provisions and retention of existing charities legislation, with updating, where appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1216">The enactment of the charities legislation did not immediately bring the Charities Act 2009 into force.  In this regard, commencement of the majority of the Act is contingent on a Charities Regulatory Authority being in place.  The Charities Regulatory Authority, as well as establishing and maintaining a register of charitable organisations, will also have the power to ensure and monitor compliance by charitable organisations with the Charities Act 2009 and to carry out investigations in accordance with the Charities Act 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1217">The Department is currently working towards the implementation of the Charities Act 2009 which will entail the establishment of a new Register of Charities and the Charities Regulatory Authority (CRA) but there is a substantial body of work to be carried out before the CRA and the Charities Register can be established.  In other jurisdictions it has taken a number of years to achieve this and that will be the case in this country also.</p>

In conjunction with the Jobs Initiative, I announced yesterday in a speech to the Dáil details of a short term visa waiver scheme for visitors travelling to Ireland from the UK.  This will be my Department's contribution to the range of supports and incentives which will be provided to support the tourism industry, especially in its efforts to attract visitors to Ireland from new and emerging markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1225">The Short-Stay Visa Waiver Programme will provide for visa-free travel to Ireland for the holders of UK visas from 14 additional countries.  The Waiver Programme will cover tourists and business people from the countries concerned, which are in Asia, the Middle East, certain former Soviet and Yugoslav republics and Turkey, and which include the important emerging markets in China and India.  Approximately 30,000 Short Stay visas were issued to visitors from the target countries during 2010.  Under the Waiver Programme, visitors who are in possession of a valid visa to enter the UK will be able to travel to Ireland from the UK without the need to obtain a separate Irish visa.

            <p eId="para_1251">In the period from 2003 to 2008 Justice for the Forgotten received total funding of over €1.2 million through the Remembrance Commission, which was financed by my Department. Given the severe financial restraints under which my Department, in common with other Government Departments, must operate, there is unfortunately no further funding available to me to direct to Justice for the Forgotten.</p>
            <p eId="para_1252">As the Deputy will be aware, from 2003-2008 the Remembrance Commission operated a Scheme of Acknowledgement, Remembrance and Assistance for Victims in this Jurisdiction of the Conflict in Northern Ireland.  Under the Scheme, payments could be made to individuals under various categories such as acknowledgement payments, economic hardship payments and medical expenses payments. The Scheme also contained a provision to enable payments to be paid to groups offering support services to victims of the conflict. Under this element of the Scheme payments were made to Justice for the Forgotten for the purpose of meeting the counselling and other needs of victims or their family members.  During the period of operation of the Scheme Justice for the Forgotten received €1.2m of the €1.5m allocated for victim support services and was the only recipient of money under this heading. In addition the organisation had received over €890,000 from the Department of the Taoiseach in the period 2000-2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_1253">The term of appointment of the Remembrance Commission came to an end on 31 October 2008 and funding under the Scheme ended at that stage. Nevertheless, a decision was taken at that time to grant further funding to Justice for the Forgotten totalling €190,300 to enable it to continue to operate while seeking to put alternative funding options in place.  I understand that Justice for the Forgotten has been integrated into the Pat Finucane Centre and is still in operation.  I can assure the Deputy that those victims who require ongoing medical treatment for injuries sustained in bombings and other incidents arising from the conflict in Northern Ireland will continue to be provided for by my Department, through the Victims of Crime Office.</p>

            <p eId="para_1312">No entitlements have been surrendered to the National Reserve in 2010 as a result of the review of the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS).</p>
            <p eId="para_1313">Under EU regulations entitlements must be used at least one year out of every two years. "Used" in this context means that the farmer must declare one hectare of eligible land for each entitlement held.  The vast majority of Irish farmers hold one set of entitlements of equal value.  In these cases the usage of entitlements is rotated each year so that entitlements not used in year one of the cycle will be deemed to have been used in year two and so on.  Under this arrangement a farmer holding only one set of entitlements will never surrender any entitlements to the National Reserve provided he can declare, each year, a number of eligible hectares at least equal to 50% of the number of entitlement held.  Where a farmer holds two or more sets of entitlements of different values the pre-printed Single Payment application which issues each year will identify those entitlements that will be lost to the National Reserve if not used in that year.  The farmer then has the opportunity of changing the payment order of his entitlements so as to avoid losing any entitlements to the National Reserve.</p>
            <p eId="para_1314">Where a farmer does not change the payment order of his entitlements the higher value entitlements will automatically be used first.   Where a farmer holds a number of entitlements in excess of the number of eligible hectares available to him he has the option of transferring the excess entitlements by sale/gift or, alternatively, he can acquire extra eligible land by way of lease/rent/purchase.</p>
            <p eId="para_1315">Under EU Regulations, payment entitlements may only be declared for payment once per year by the farmer who holds them at the latest date for lodging the Single Payment application which, for 2011, is 16 May 2011.</p>

            <p eId="para_1347">I propose to take Questions Nos. 140 and 141 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1348">The Nursing Homes Support Scheme provides financial support to individuals in need of long-term nursing home care. Under the scheme, individuals contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 5% of the value of any assets per annum towards their cost of care. The first €36,000 of an individual's assets, or €72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1349">An individual's principal residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the 15% or ‘three year' cap. It means that individuals pay a 5% contribution based on their principal residence for a maximum of three years regardless of the time they spend in nursing home care. After 3 years, even if an individual is still in long-term nursing home care, they will not pay any further contribution based on the principal residence. This ‘three year' cap applies regardless of whether an individual chooses to opt for the loan or not. The intention of this three year cap is to protect the family home.</p>
            <p eId="para_1350">There are several important safeguards built into the scheme which ensure that both the person entering long-term nursing home care and their partner are adequately provided for.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1351">1. Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1352">2. The first €36,000 for a person's assets, or €72,000 for a couple, is not taken into account during the financial assessment.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1353">3. The principal residence will only be included in the financial assessment for the first three years of a person's time in care.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1354">4. Individuals keep a personal allowance of 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1355">5. If there is a spouse/partner remaining at home, he/she will retain 50% of the couples income, or the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1356">6. There is a financial review mechanism which takes account of the fluctuating value of assets and the fact that cash assets will naturally deplete over time as payments are made to the nursing home etc.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1357">7. Certain allowable deductions are taken account of during the financial assessment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1358">The allowable deductions taken account of during the financial assessment are:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1359">health expenses,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1360">interest on loans related to the principal residence,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1361">rent payments, for individuals who live in rented accommodation, and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1362">maintenance payments to another person.</p>
            <p eId="para_1363">In addition, the definition of ‘allowable deduction' was expanded by the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Allowable Deductions) Regulations 2010 which commenced on the 1st January 2011. The effect of these Regulations is to include borrowings in respect of a person's principal residence as an allowable deduction. This enables individuals to deduct the full value of mortgage repayments from their income prior to calculating their income-based contribution. Where an individual chooses to avail of this deduction, he/she cannot also seek to offset the same mortgage against the value of the asset concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1364">The Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Allowable Deductions) Regulations 2010 were introduced to take account of the situation referred to by the Deputy, i.e. a young person who may have an outstanding mortgage entering long-term nursing home care.</p>
