            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_7">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_8">These are political agreements that my predecessor entered into as leader of the Fianna Fáil Party with individual Independent Deputies.  I have confirmed to those Deputies concerned that I will continue to implement those agreements.  The House is aware such agreements have existed for over 11 years.  The House is also aware of the decision taken by Deputy Finian McGrath to withdraw from his agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_9">The agreements are confidential but they are, as always, based on the programme for Government which incorporates the national development plan, approved Government programmes and annual Estimates for capital and current expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_10">I have continued the practice whereby a staff member in my office assists the Government Chief Whip's office in its work in liasing with these Deputies.  This official meets with these Deputies on a regular basis and arranges to keep them briefed on issues as they arise.  The official dealing with the Deputies is an assistant principal and he assists the Chief Whip in this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_13">He is reflecting on Ringsend today.  As I understand it there was a specific agreement with the Independent Members of the House, including Deputy Finian McGrath, who is not here now.  He seems to have withdrawn his support for the Government so is the agreement that was in place with him now withdrawn?  Does it stand or have any relevance?</p>
            <p eId="para_14">What is the arrangement that now applies between the Government and the remaining Independents?  Is there a weekly meeting, how many officials attend that meeting, if so, and is there a prescriptive list being followed from the documents that are supposed to be worth millions?</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_5">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_15">As I outlined in my initial reply, Deputy Finian McGrath has withdrawn from the agreement on the basis that he can no longer formally offer support to the Government.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_19">That was the basis on which it was provided.  I am sure he will continue to make representations and seek to obtain benefits for his constituency as he is entitled to, like any other Member.  There is a liaison arrangement, as I have said, with the Chief Whip, who is assisted by a person from my office in dealing with other Independents who support the Government, and they meet from time to time as required.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_10">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_20">In the case of Deputies Healy-Rae or Lowry, for example, does the Whip meet with both Independent Deputies on a weekly basis, together with somebody from the Taoiseach's office?  Is that a good use of a public servant's time?  These are so-called secret deals that nobody knows anything about except the Government, the Whip and the person from the Taoiseach's office.  Are these meetings a progress report on road X or project Y?  Is that the kind of format the Whip and the person from the Taoiseach's office goes through in order to see that the Independents in question are kept comfortable?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_11">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_21">As I stated in both my original reply and the supplementary, there is a liaison arrangement so the Chief Whip, as he would with Members from all parties, has ongoing contact with regard to the business of the House and any other issues arising that would be of interest to the people who support the Government.  The arrangements and contacts are informal and could take the form of a meeting, phone call or other form of contact.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_12">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_22">I have a final point.  The Taoiseach rightly states that every Deputy is entitled to make representations.  Is there any priority accorded to these Independent Deputies in representations they make, along with other Deputies from the Government side, with regard to particular projects or issues that may arise in constituencies from time to time?  Is the effect of the meetings with the Whip and the person from the Taoiseach's office to accord the Independents any priority over Deputies on the Government backbenches or those in other parts of the House who make perfectly legitimate representations?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_13">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_23">In his dealings, the Chief Whip extends courtesy to all Members.  Those who support the Government get his particular attention.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_14">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_24">The Taoiseach referred to an official in his Department assisting the Independent Deputies and their special arrangement with the Government.  I understand, from previous replies, the person is at the level of assistant principal officer.  An assistant principal officer is on the same scale as a Deputy and would earn up to €100,000 a year.  I understand the person spends much time minding the Independent Deputies but even if only a third of his or her time was used in this way, in current economic conditions, when the Government is withdrawing foreign language support teachers etc. and when the Estimates have hit various elements of service very severely, how can this be justified?  Surely they could mind themselves.  They hardly need the ministrations, for however long, of an assistant principal officer.</p>
            <p eId="para_25">As regards the economic situation, the Taoiseach said he would take whatever steps are necessary and whatever temporary adjustments are required.  The Taoiseach has deals with the Independent Deputies and when Deputy Finian McGrath was in that category it amounted to tens of millions of euro.  We have been told, for instance, that extra officials are being deployed to the Equality Authority in Roscrea.  Has the fact that we are facing very difficult economic times meant any reduction in the cost of the deals the Taoiseach has done with Independent Deputies?  Given the serious economic situation we now find ourselves in, has there been any variation in their part of the programme for Government that is to be implemented at constituency level?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_15">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_26">As I said in the reply, there is an assistant principal officer who, in the course of the duties he undertakes, helps to liaise with Independent Deputies as required.  On the question of agreements with them concerning their support for the Government, as I pointed out here last week, all commitments are predicated on the overriding consideration of trying to ensure that we maintain healthy public finances.  As we know, there has been a sharp deterioration in the public finance position over the past 12 months in the context of the contraction that has taken place in the international economy generally, which is having its effect here.  Ireland is a very open economy, which depends on the demand for exports of goods and services in order to provide revenue, jobs and investment.  Priorities must, of course, be established in respect of all aspects of Government administration.  That must continue to be the case in the months and years ahead as we try to work our way through this particularly difficult period.  The political agreements which have been reached with Deputies who support the Government are also dealt with in that context.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_16">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_27">The Taoiseach and his Minister for Finance have announced the establishment of an bord snip nua specifically to address public service numbers and efficiency.  How can the Taoiseach stand over the time of an assistant principal officer being devoted to ministering to Independent Deputies as part of a governmental sweetheart deal?  Is this not precisely the kind of waste of Civil Service time that ought to be addressed by some of the legions of Ministers of State who are already very well paid, rather than a civil servant?  Such a civil servant earns a salary in the region of €100,000 — the same as Dáil Deputies.  If the Taoiseach was serious about cutting back economically, how can he justify this?  The Taoiseach may say that the person does not spend much time, but sorting out the various issues that Deputy Healy-Rae raises from time to time would require a degree of ingenuity and thoughtfulness that could take up days or even weeks of a civil servant's time to address fully.  I do not understand how the Taoiseach can justify using a civil servant for this arrangement in this time of cutbacks when language teachers are being cut in schools.  There are other cutbacks across a range of services, yet we continue to have a senior civil servant, much of whose time is devoted to ministering to these individuals.</p>
            <p eId="para_28">The Equality Authority is part of a specific agreement that Deputy Lowry has spoken about in the context of the authority decentralising to Roscrea in his constituency.  Some 15 staff of the authority have already been decentralised there, while 25 others are staying in Dublin.  Given the cutbacks, what economic sense does it make to have half and half arrangements whereby people are given travel expenses for travelling between Roscrea and Dublin?  It is part of the botched decentralisation programme, which has cost the taxpayer up to €1.5 billion so far.  Can we afford this kind of largesse, given the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_17">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_29">The main liaison in respect of political arrangements is the Chief Whip, but if a person wishes to contact my office, the normal arrangement is for a designated person to handle it.  On the one hand, the Deputy argues that no one should be appointed as liaison, as he or she would not have time to do his or her other work and, on the other, the Deputy states that it takes weeks to deal with certain issues.  Neither argument is true.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_18">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_30">The Taoiseach should ask the Ceann Comhairle.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_19">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_31">The normal liaising arrangements apply.</p>
            <p eId="para_32">For the purpose of accuracy, a Deputy's salary equates to that of a principal officer, not an assistant principal officer.</p>
            <p eId="para_33">The Deputy referred to the decentralisation of the Equality Authority.  I do not know from where she got her figures.  Last week in the House, I indicated that the amount of money spent in respect of the property aspects of the decentralisation programme is less than the amount obtained through the sales of properties in Dublin vacated as a result of the programme's implementation.  Last week's replies to parliamentary questions outlined the details.</p>
            <p eId="para_34">This being the case, the system of Departments having more than one location has worked well for the Departments of Finance, Education and Science and Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners.  I do not see why this should not be the case for the Equality Authority.  I assure the Deputy that the rental costs of accommodating people in Roscrea will be much less than what they are being charged in Dublin.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_20">
            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_35">Were the agreements reached between the Independent Deputies and the Government negotiated directly with the Taoiseach's predecessor?  If so, was the Taoiseach privy to the detail of what was agreed to secure the support of Deputies Healy-Rae, Finian McGrath and Lowry?  If he did not have prior sight of the agreements, has he been given copies?  Will the Taoiseach clarify whether my assumption that there were written agreements is correct?  Upon ascending to his current position, was he made aware of the detail of the agreements?</p>
            <p eId="para_36">The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, the leader of the Green Party, is sitting beside the Taoiseach for Question Time.  Were the agreements with the then Taoiseach, the Fianna Fáil Party or the Government?  The Deputies gave their support to the Government and have voted with it continuously since last year's general election, irrespective of the issues.  If the agreements were with the Government, was the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, who was then leader of the Green Party, is an integral part of the Government and a co-signatory to the programme for Government, made aware of their details?</p>
            <p eId="para_37">Given Deputy Finian McGrath's decision to withdraw his support, what were the negative consequences for the issues addressed in his agreement with the Government?  Did his withdrawal have a down side for specific projects and commitments entered into?  What is the <i>quid pro quo</i> regarding the debit side of the balance sheet as opposed to that relating to the support the Government clearly committed to provide when the agreement entered into with Deputy Finian McGrath was finalised in the aftermath of the general election in 2007?</p>
            <p eId="para_38">In view of the fact that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, no longer belongs to a political party and will be an independent member of the Government, will the Taoiseach be entering into negotiations with her in respect of her continued support?  Is the Taoiseach happy to allow the Minister to continue to run riot in respect of the health service?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_21">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_39">I reject the Deputy's assertion in respect of the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_40">I answered the other questions he posed in my initial reply.  The agreements in question are political in nature and were entered into by my predecessor as leader of the Fianna Fáil Party with individual Independent Deputies.  The House is aware that such arrangements have existed for over 11 years.  The decision taken by Deputy Finian McGrath to withdraw from the agreement made with him obviously has its own implications.  That is understood.  These agreements are confidential but are, as always, based on the programme for Government, which incorporates the national development plan, approved Government programmes and annual Estimates for capital and current expenditure.  That answers the questions Deputy Ó Caoláin asked.</p>
            <p eId="para_41">These are normal arrangements that have been in place for 11 years.  The agreements were entered into by my predecessor.  I am aware of their contents and can confirm that they exist in written form.  Upon becoming Taoiseach I met those who have given their support to the Government and confirmed my intention to assist in the implementation of their agreements — consistent with the provisions in the programme for Government and overall economic and social policy — in good faith and to the greatest extent possible.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_22">
            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_42">I appreciate the confirmation that the negotiations involving the various Deputies concluded with written agreements and that the Taoiseach is privy to their detail.  Will he clarify the position as to when he became privy to their contents?  Was it prior to taking up the office of Taoiseach?</p>
            <p eId="para_43">Will the Taoiseach also indicate what knowledge Deputy Gormley, leader of the Green Party — an integral part of the Government — and Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, possesses in respect of these agreements?  Has the Minister been brought into the loop with regard to what was agreed with Deputies Michael Lowry, Jackie Healy-Rae and Finian McGrath following last year's general election?</p>
            <p eId="para_44">The Taoiseach made an extremely important statement in his reply to the initial supplementary questions I posed when he indicated that Deputy Finian McGrath's decision to withdraw his support for the Government "has its own implications".  Outside the obvious implication that the Government no longer enjoys the Deputy's voting support in respect of matters dealt with in this Chamber, will the Taoiseach explain the meaning of the term "has its own implications?  From what I understand of Deputy Finian McGrath's interests, I believe his agreement related to matters that go beyond the bounds of his constituency.  What are the implications for the areas in respect of which he sought agreement and on which, we are informed, he secured commitments from the Government in the context of funding, resourcing, etc.?</p>
            <p eId="para_45">The Taoiseach indicated that there are implications.  I ask him to indicate in exact terms the nature of those implications.  The House, the wider public and the people who live in the specific areas to which parts of the Deputy's agreement related and who will be directly affected have a right to know the position in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_48">Absolutely.  As already stated, the agreements in question are based on the programme for Government, which incorporates the national development plan, approved Government programmes and annual Estimates for capital and current expenditure.  The implication regarding the public finances and the need to prioritise the programmes to which I refer is obviously a matter of extreme importance for the Government.  The then leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, in an effort to ensure sufficient support for Government in the House and to allow it to get on with the programme for Government for five years, entered into political negotiations with Independent Deputies, a practice tried and utilised by others when the numbers suited them or they believed an opportunity presented itself to allow them put together a programme for Government.  These are the type of normal political arrangements entered into in negotiations.  As I said, they are based on the programme for Government and other public documents, which are available, and one continues to seek to implement them to the best extent one can.  They are agreements completed through negotiation on the basis of support for Government.  If Deputies or any individual seeks to modify, address or change that stance, that has implications, which we all understand.  However, this does not mean the Deputy will not continue to make representations or continue in his or her efforts on behalf of their constituents, as would other Members of the House, whether in Government or in Opposition.</p>
            <p eId="para_49">Ministers seek to address all issues on the basis of their intrinsic merit in any event.  That aspect of the interaction will, I am sure, continue.  With respect to the agreements, it is obvious they are dependent upon continued support for the Government.</p>

            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_50">I fully understand the downsides in terms of the Budget Statement announced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, on 14 October.  We have seen the consequences of the Government's interaction in preparing that budget in terms of the cuts and slashes announced.  However, there is something we are not seeing.  The Taoiseach has confirmed to the House that there are implications in respect of Deputy McGrath's decision to withdraw his support for Government.  I put it to him that it is not through reading the headlines or watching the nuance of some news report that we will get an understanding of these implications.  We do not know, in the first instance, what is in these agreements, which I argue we should.  We know only by way of confirmation from the Taoiseach today that there are implications in this regard.  I believe it is the Taoiseach's responsibility to spell out what exactly are those implications.</p>
            <p eId="para_51">We understand, though we oppose, the decisions announced in the budget and which will be followed through in the Finance Bill.  However, there are other forces at work here.  Other decisions have been taken in regard to resources, which are to be either withdrawn, withheld or delayed.  We do not know what is the position in this regard.  I am asking that the Taoiseach spell out what is the Government's decision and response in this regard.  Deputy McGrath and every other Deputy continues to lobby on all of the interests and issues of direct concern to them and they have a right to that hearing by every Minister and Minister of State, without question.  A specific agreement was made with Deputy McGrath, who has withdrawn his support for Government.  The Taoiseach has stated there are implications in this regard.  It is not good enough to just brush off the questioning today and to tell us the information is contained in the subtext of a report and so on.  We want this information spelled out.  We have every right to know what is contained in the agreements and what are the consequences of Deputy McGrath's withdrawing his support for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_52">I share the concern of Deputy McGrath in respect of many of the issues he has pursued, not least in regard to people with special needs, of which Deputy McGrath is an ardent advocate.  A representative body of people with special needs will appear before a committee of this House this afternoon.  Are there implications for children with special needs?  The Taoiseach cannot leave the question hanging in the air with people not knowing the implications of this — people who have real concerns as to what exactly the Government is intent on doing in response to Deputy Finian McGrath's decision.  He should spell it out.  He should manfully get up before the Dáil this day and state exactly what are those implications.  Let us hope there are none, but that is the answer we would like to hear.  The Taoiseach has told us there are implications and we have every right to know what they are.  I ask the Taoiseach again to spell out to the House this afternoon exactly what the implications are for any of the interests Deputy Finian McGrath had pursued in coming to the agreement to support the Government following the election in 2007?</p>

            <p eId="para_56">If I may say so, that was a long way of stating the obvious.  One enters an agreement for the purposes of support for a Government, if one withdraws support from it, then obviously the relationship changes.  That is obvious.  There is nothing surreptitious or sinister about it.</p>
            <p eId="para_57">In regard to specific areas of policy, the Government has outlined its intentions in this and other respects.  In terms of my own interests in that area, I defend the Government's policies in those areas.  Our efforts to prioritise those areas in the past compares favourably with any predecessor Government one would like to mention.  I do not have any problem standing over those particular aspects.  As the Deputy Ó Caoláin said, they are not the preserve of any one, two or three Deputies, these are interests we all share.</p>
            <p eId="para_58">What political agreements allow us to do from time to time is to bring a focus to certain issues on the basis that we can in that way maintain sufficient numbers in the House to pursue a programme for Government.  What we have seen since then is a deterioration in the public finance position of which we must take serious note.  All programmes for Government worth their name are constructed on the basis of trying to maintain and restore order to the public finances in order that we can have a sustainable level of service going forward.  Where there are changed economic circumstances, one must take cognisance of that.  If one is in opposition, perhaps one does not have to worry about that aspect, but if one is in government, one has to do so.</p>

Is that the case at the moment?</p>
            <p eId="para_67">The expenditure in the Taoiseach's Department on consultancy in first six months of 2008 came to €385,896.  By the end of August the figure had jumped to €639,000, which is an increase of 66% in only two months.</p>

            <p eId="para_69">For consultancy.  In the first six months of 2008, it was €385,000 and by the end of August the figure had jumped to €639,000, an increase of 66% in two months.  That may have been because some payment was due for work already done.  In announcing his package of savings of €440 million in July, the Minister for Finance said all expenditure by Departments and agencies on consultancies, advertising and public relations would be significantly reduced for the remainder of this year and by at least 50% in 2009.  Can the Taoiseach explain the reason for the major jump of 66% in his expenditure on consultancy in just two months?</p>

            <p eId="para_70">I am not sure where the Deputy is obtaining those figures, but on the specific question of expenditure on consultancies, there has been no spend in my Department's administrative budget on PR between January and October 2008.  However, the National Forum on Europe spent €108,182 on public relations as at 31 October 2008.  Expenditure on consultancy services by my Department as at the end of October 2008 was €195,323.  That relates to the spend under subheads A7 and A10.  In addition, the following amounts were spent on consultancies by programmes under my Department's Vote between the period January 2008 and October 2008.  The spend by the National Forum on Europe was €6,939.  The spend of the Ireland-Newfoundland Partnership was €1,028.</p>
            <p eId="para_71">Further to the Department of Finance requirements, the Department has reduced the budget allocation for consultancy by 50% in 2008 and we will continue to monitor spend in this area closely.  In addition, a total of €393,401 was spent by the Department of Finance through the change management fund.  Every effort is made by the Department to minimise expenditure on consultancy services, however, where it is necessary to engage consultants in order to avail of their particular expertise or experience the procurement of consultancy services is subject to public procurement guidelines and, where applicable, EU procurement rules and guidelines with selection criteria geared to select the most economically advantageous tender.</p>
            <p eId="para_72">It is also our policy that skills transfer from consultants to departmental staff takes place as an integral part of all consultancy engagements.  The purpose of that is to increase the knowledge and expertise of departmental staff and to reduce and, if possible, eliminate further dependence on consultants in the areas concerned.</p>

I understand €100,000 of that was for the National Forum on Europe and the task force on active citizenship, including expenditure on PR.  What was the other €500,000 spent on?  For the first two months the Taoiseach's expenditure on consultancy came to €386,000 but it more than doubled up to August.  A total of €100,000 of that was for the National Forum on Europe and the task force on active citizenship.  Does the Taoiseach have information on how the other €500,000 was spent?</p>

I will have to come back to him in a written reply because the subhead in regard to that matter is A7 and I do not agree with the figures he is quoting.  The Revised Estimates provision under A7 for 2008 is €275,000.  The expenditure to 31 October 2008 under that heading is €103,000, which is 37.5% compared to the amended Revised Estimates volume, as of 31 October.  The figures Deputy Kenny is quoting are not the figures I have before me.</p>

            <p eId="para_75">I wish to ask the Taoiseach about a matter of policy, namely, the business of awarding consultancy payments in the first instance.  In recent years I find the public service has been sidelined to a great extent by the Government conducting so many consultancy reports.  Is it a matter of course that the public service in any Department is asked whether it has the capacity to do a report on a particular issue before a decision is made by a Minister or by Government to request an outside consultancy report into some aspect of Government?  If one considers the range of reports published, at a very expensive cost, in all Departments over the past ten years, one will note that many could have been produced and agreed by the public service itself.  In that regard, the quality of the public service has been undermined by the prevalent practice of running for consultancy reports at every moment.</p>
            <p eId="para_76">If a report is required in the Department of the Taoiseach, is it a matter of policy that the Taoiseach asks the Secretary General and the staff whether they can produce it themselves or whether it is necessary to spend more public money on further consultancy reports?  It is a question of policy in terms of the quality of the personnel working for the Taoiseach and their capacity to produce reports as distinct from running to outside agencies for consultancy reports at public cost at every turn of the road.</p>

            <p eId="para_77">The allocation for the Moriarty tribunal last year was €10 million and that has been reduced to €7.5 million for 2009.  Does the Taoiseach not accept that if the report is to be published before the end of the year, a significant proportion of the costs will become payable next year?  Does he, therefore, expect to have to introduce a Supplementary Estimate to cover these costs?</p>
            <p eId="para_78">Did the Taoiseach see the reports in the newspapers that <i>The Irish Times</i> apparently had to junk approximately 20,000 copies because of approaches from the tribunal in respect of matters pertaining to the tribunal.  Similarly, <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> had to address matters raised by the tribunal.  Has the Government obtained additional legal advice on the possible findings of the tribunal and possible press reports on adverse findings or potentially adverse comments, perhaps in regard to public servants?  Would the Taoiseach care to comment on that?</p>

Will the Taoiseach give us an understanding of the steps undertaken in his Department under the various headings?

            <p eId="para_81">Up to the end of October 2008, the Moriarty tribunal has spent €3.302 million.  While it is expected the second and final report of the tribunal may be published by the end of this year, the latest information suggests it may be published early next year.  It is not anticipated that third party costs of award will be finalised in time for payment this year.  It is estimated that there will be savings of at least €3 million on the total allocation for this year.  Additional costs that may arise at the end of the year include those for the concluding briefs for legal teams.  That is the latest information on the matter.  I do not comment on media reports when a very important process is still ongoing.</p>

            <p eId="para_83">Electrical vehicles offer an increasingly realistic solution in terms of reducing the transport sector's greenhouse gas emissions and Ireland's dependence on imported fossil fuels.  There has been very significant global investment in research and development in this field.  The technology is now maturing to a point where large scale commercial deployment is looking feasible in the medium term.  It is all the more important therefore that Ireland is positioned as a centre for electric vehicles.</p>
            <p eId="para_84">Last week, with my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, I launched our plans for the large scale deployment of electric vehicles in Ireland.  We are setting a target of 10% of all vehicles in the transport fleet to be powered by electricity by 2020, a figure of approximately 250,000 electric cars on Irish roads over the next 12 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_85">My Department is working with the Department of Transport, Sustainable Energy Ireland, the ESB, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, and other stakeholders to ensure we have a fully cohesive approach in facilitating the development of the electric transport model.  We have introduced tax incentives for businesses to purchase electric vehicles, allowing them to write off 100% of the cost of purchase against tax under the accelerated capital allowance scheme.  Sustainable Energy Ireland will fund a €1 million project to research, develop and demonstrate electric vehicles nationally and has also published a buyers' guide and a cost of ownership calculator to aid individuals interested in purchasing electric vehicles.  Sustainable Energy Ireland also recently published reports on hybrid electrical vehicles and battery electric vehicles.  These reports highlight potential measures that could be used to stimulate uptake of electric vehicles in Ireland and they make recommendations on how this might best be achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_86">The collective work to date will be carried on by a national task force which will examine the infrastructure options for the national roll-out of electric vehicles, including street charging.  We have sent out a clear message that Ireland is open for business and the work of positioning this country as a centre for electric vehicles will continue over the next number of years, in tandem with global developments in technologies and commercialisation.</p>

            <p eId="para_87">I welcome that the Government is showing some initiative in promoting the use of electric vehicles.  When will the task force be set up and who will be on it?  How will the Minister determine who will be on it?  When will it report with recommendations?</p>
            <p eId="para_88">The target of 10% of electric vehicles by 2020 is very unambitious when one considers what is happening in other parts of the world.  Israel, for example, is planning for the complete replacement of petrol and diesel-driven cars.  Denmark is planning to do the same, as are regions of Australia, but Ireland is still at the stage of setting up a task force.</p>
            <p eId="para_89">Is the Minister open to reviewing that target, with the intention of increasing the ambition of Government in the replacement of petrol and diesel-driven cars?  It is an initial step but there are also implications for the public transport fleet.</p>

            <p eId="para_90">The membership of the taskforce will include persons from the Departments of Transport, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Finance, from Enterprise Ireland, the IDA, Sustainable Energy Ireland and agencies such as the ESB which has already set out a significant amount of work in this area.  It will continue work that has already been done by Sustainable Energy Ireland, including visits by officials from the agency to Denmark and Israel.</p>
            <p eId="para_91">I disagree with Deputy Coveney on the issue of targets.  I believe the target is pitched exactly right.  It takes time for any country to turn its fleet over to electric power.  Any cars bought today will still be on the road in ten years' time.  In looking at what other countries are doing, we set ourselves at the top level with such countries as Denmark and Israel, recognising that they also are only at the starting phase in this.  No country has yet deployed the infrastructure needed to support a wide electric fleet.  This work is starting and it will take a number of years for car companies and the infrastructure-building companies to deploy the infrastructure.  I believe that in this regard the target we set ourselves is at the right level.</p>
            <p eId="para_92">Targets are not limits to our ambition in this instance.  We must reduce our dependence on oil and the transport sector is the biggest user of oil.  If we can exceed that target, then certainly I shall be more ambitious and push beyond it.  However, given where the technology is at present and where other countries are, it is the right target for us.  It allows us to work with those countries — Israel, Denmark and Portugal in particular — and with the international car companies and our infrastructure providers, to provide a scale that makes the development of electrical vehicles commercially viable more quickly.</p>

            <p eId="para_93">This is where I strongly disagree with the Minister.  He proposes that Ireland should follow the more ambitious countries that have a vision of a shorter time period for the transformation of their transportation fleet.  The main driver behind this is emissions.  Emissions coming from the transport sector since 1990 have increased by 168%, and are continuing to increase.  As regards the area the Government has responsibility for in terms of emissions, and for which it has made commitments to the European Union, some 80% of that comes from transport and agriculture.  We are not going to make the type of gains that are needed in agriculture and therefore we need to make them in transport.  Some 10% of our fleet by 2020 will reduce carbon emissions by 400,000 tonnes, and that is it.  What is required is a far more ambitious approach.  Ireland should take a leadership position in this instead of the usual "wait and see" approach, while allowing other countries to make ambitious investments.</p>

            <p eId="para_94">The key driver in this is also energy security.  The reason Israel is promoting the move to electric vehicles is that it is concerned about the availability of oil coming from the Middle East——</p>

This helps us to reduce our emissions and that is a crucial second motivation and it is where we have a competitive advantage and will not be following, but leading.  In setting a 40% renewables electricity target, particularly for variable power supplies such as wind, we have a competitive advantage that allows us to power an electric fleet cleanly.</p>

            <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_101">I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 76 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_102">The preferred tenderer for the national broadband scheme, NBS, was appointed following an open tender process using the competitive dialogue procurement process.</p>
            <p eId="para_103">Significant time, expertise, human and financial resources have been invested to ensure the optimum outcome and best possible broadband service, from the procurement process.  The process has been overseen by a steering committee comprising officials from my Department, representatives from the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, a representative from the Border, Midlands and Western Regional Assembly as well as an independent electronic communications consultant.  A working group, comprising officials from my Department and representatives from ComReg developed the procurement and scheme specifications with the assistance of legal advisers and technical, commercial and financial consultants.  The working group was provided with all necessary administrative and clerical support.</p>
            <p eId="para_104">The initial stages of the procurement process resulted in strong interest from service providers.  Four service providers pre-qualified and two of them responded to the final invitation to tender, ITT.  The responses to the ITT were evaluated by a team comprising five different evaluation sub-groups.  The evaluation team's final ITT report was considered and unanimously approved by the steering committee.  Accordingly, "3", a Hutchison Whampoa company, was appointed preferred tenderer on 25 November 2008.  The contract will be finalised for signature in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_105">I am satisfied that the comprehensive procurement process has resulted in the appointment of a preferred tenderer that will make available high quality broadband to all premises in the NBS area at the most economically advantageous cost.  As regards the accuracy of the mapping undertaken for the scheme, a comprehensive mapping process has been undertaken.  The process involved contacting service providers for details of their broadband coverage; inserting service provider data on a broadband coverage map using specialist expertise and software; consulting with regional authorities to request that they confirm, as far as was possible, the broadband coverage information provided in the maps; requesting from the regional authorities information on any other service providers excluded from the mapping process; and contacting additional service providers identified by the regional authorities and including their coverage on the map.</p>
            <p eId="para_106">The resulting broadband coverage led to the creation of the indicative map, which was updated during the procurement process as appropriate, in consultation with the service providers.  My officials have taken all reasonable steps to maximise the accuracy of the map.  As regards the timeframe for completion, the ITT requires that all houses and business premises must be provided with a broadband service within 22 months of the signing of the contract.  3's response to the ITT meets that requirement.  The finer details are being worked out at present and will be finalised at contract signing which is expected to take place on 11 December 2008.  As regards the bandwidth and download speeds, 3 will extend its network to provide mobile broadband services into the NBS area.</p>
            <p eId="para_107">In recognition of the fact that some areas will be very difficult to reach using standard infrastructure, 3 will make available a satellite product.  The specific details are being discussed with 3 at present and will be finalised at contract signing.  In order to protect the integrity of the procurement process, I do not propose to release details of the value of the NBS contract at this time.</p>

            <from>Deputy Liz McManus</from>
            <p eId="para_108">I thank the Minister for what was not a very informative answer.  After such a long delay, he might have expected to get some kudos for finally announcing the contract, but in fact he put out a very short statement to be met by very widespread disappointment, dismay and at times downright hostility as regards the choice of 3.  The Minister has already posted his message on <i>www.boards.ie</i>, running to something like 370 pages on this particular issue and the vast bulk of the responses are negative.  There is considerable experience now in terms of customer service, erratic provision, difficulties in speeds and a whole range of issues that have been raised by current customers.  I should have thought the Minister could spell out to the House what safeguards are in place to ensure that he simply has not added to the list of complaints by this announcement. </p>
            <p eId="para_109">The map is a matter of some concern.  Areas in my constituency are indicated, but it is an indicative map, solely dependent on service providers to give the relevant information.  Does the Minister accept that, in fact, there are people who are not in the broadband scheme and are unable to access it even though their area might be described as having such access within the indicative map?  We are going to end up with the anomalous position where people cannot access, for example, the 3 service, but because they are described as having access, they will not be able to avail of opportunities under the broadband scheme.  Could he, perhaps, give us details of the technology platform, the guarantees in terms of speed, the penalties if the target of 1 megabyte is not met, as well as the coverage targets?  Cost seems to me to be the only reason 3 got the contract, but how do I know, since I am not getting the information.  The Minister is not willing to give us the cost, but he should at least give us the information about safeguards.</p>

            <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_110">I am reluctant to give this information until the contracts are signed, which will be within the week.  It is better and proper to have that hurdle overcome, and then we may provide the more detailed information.  To a certain extent, we must learn from processes in the past, where, for whatever reasons we may have tried to push through a process in terms of procurement, particularly in the telecommunications area, that just ended up getting us into further difficulties.  I was particularly pleased in terms of this whole process that even if it took time we were able to work on real detail with the bidding companies, winner and losers, in the process I have set out, to try to ensure that what we contract here is right and meets the public's expectations.  It would have been very easy to try to do something quickly, to put it through for political short-term expediency, in order to be seen to be doing something.  I believe in the process we have undertaken.  Even if it has taken longer than we originally thought, that was in order to get it right.</p>
            <p eId="para_111">The service that will be provided will meet with widespread public support.  There have been concerns with regard to the start of the roll-out of certain mobile broadband services over the past year.  We should recognise those services have just started and there are naturally teething difficulties.  That said, we now have approximately 250,000 people who have signed up for such mobile broadband services.  We must also recognise that because 40% of our houses are one-off houses in the countryside, we will always be a country where mobile broadband services are in higher demand than in other countries.  We may develop a benefit from this, particularly where we can get new evolving mobile, wireless and other connections onto fibre quickly and provide good high quality services.</p>

            <from>Deputy Simon Coveney</from>
            <p eId="para_112">I want to tease out some of the things the Minister said because I am more confused now than when the questions on this issue started.  My first concern relates to the map.  The objective of the national broadband scheme is to cover the approximately 10% of the footprint of the country that is not coloured in red, because it does not have current broadband provision, via a wireless, fibre or copper service.</p>
            <p eId="para_113">The company 3 is the preferred bidder for the contract and I have no problem with that.  I do not care who provides the solutions as long as the contract is right and the company can deliver.  However, the Minister seems to suggest that part of the solution will be provided via a mobile product, but one can get a mobile broadband service in a number of these grey areas already, whether on top of a mountain or wherever.  The issue with regard to broadband connectivity is not about mobile services.  Is the Minister suggesting that 3G or 3 will put up mobile masts in these areas to provide for broadband via a mobile phone?  If he is talking about wireless services, that is different, but he needs to clarify what he is talking about.</p>
            <p eId="para_114">It is not acceptable to provide for broadband services via mobile phones in rural areas.  That may be a useful service for people who want to access the Internet on their mobile phones, but it is not a consistent enough solution for people opening businesses in parts of rural Ireland that cannot get broadband currently.</p>

            <p eId="para_119">I am not restricting people in terms of how they access the Internet.  However, we need broadband access.  In this case, we will have speeds of over 1 megabit download and over 200 kilobits on the upload.  There is also provision for those speeds in the services to be improved in the five-year period the contract will cover.</p>
            <p eId="para_120">The crucial issue is to provide customer satisfaction.  The nature of the contract and the work that has gone into it provide that if customers do not get the level of services we are setting, there are implications for the service providers.  We have checks and balances to ensure the sort of speeds and the service quality we want are provided.  This is a significant improvement for those parts of the country that cannot currently get any broadband services.  This is a strategic and significant investment by the State to provide coverage so the whole country will have broadband availability.</p>
            <p eId="para_121">With regard to the map, provision will be made in terms of electoral districts and will set out the areas that can be covered.  This covers a significant area of the country, particularly in the west, north west, south west and rural parts of the country that currently do not have any service.  Therefore, this is a significant and crucial action in terms of the next generation broadband strategy set out earlier this autumn.  We recognise that universal accessibility is a key development and that is what our national broadband scheme will deliver.</p>

            <from>Deputy Liz McManus</from>
            <p eId="para_122">It is a matter of concern that there is now a body of opinion about the provision so far.  I do not hold a brief for any company, but I want to see the service provided, particularly in Wicklow where it is an issue.  The Minister has stated there will be a five-year contract.  I understood that originally the scheme was to take 22 months, plus, presumably, the period before that for normal consultation and getting planning permission for masts.  Why then is there to be a five-year contract?</p>

            <from>Deputy Simon Coveney</from>
            <p eId="para_123">How much will this cost people in rural areas and how will the cost be determined?  Will it compare with costs for people in urban areas who can currently get broadband?  Under this scheme, when will broadband finally be available to those people who cannot get it currently?  How much does the Government plan to spend on the national broadband scheme in 2009 and how will it determine whether people will be offered a satellite or mobile solution in terms of broadband delivery?  In terms of future planning, will the Minister clarify whether capacity to upgrade speeds is being built into the contract or whether we will need a national broadband scheme 2 for next generation broadband in five years' time?</p>

            <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_124">It has the ability to cater for increased speeds over time.  The 22-month period mentioned is the time it will take for the infrastructure to be put in place to cover all the districts to be covered.  The cost to people will be similar to costs for what is available in the rest of the country and a cap will be set above which costs cannot go during the five year period.  I cannot give the cost details of the contract until contracts have been signed, in the next week or so.</p>
            <p eId="para_125">One of the key benefits of the contract is that it does not restrict other operators from developing services such as opening exchanges, providing cable, mobile or fixed wireless solutions.  This is a further step towards a competitive, universal, ubiquitous service throughout the country.  This is significant.</p>

This is of major significance in the development of broadband and is something I am proud to have delivered.</p>

            <p eId="para_129">Under phase 1 of the metropolitan area networks, MANs, 27 MANs are available to customers from eNet which is operating, managing and maintaining the networks on behalf of the State under a 15-year concession agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_130">Under phase 2 of the MANs programme, 58 of a total of 60 MANs covering 64 towns have been completed during 2007 and 2008.  Construction of the remaining two networks will be completed during 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_131">All completed phase 2 networks are being managed on an interim basis by technical services firm Magnum Opus on behalf of my Department, pending the engagement of a management services entity for the phase 2 MANs, MSE 2.  The engagement of an MSE 2 is currently the subject of a procurement process, which is expected to conclude in the first quarter of 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_132">The phase 2 MANs contain duct, sub duct, dark fibre and co-location facilities.

            <p eId="para_134">People will now see the irony in the Minister's final statement on the previous question, that he is proud to be delivering broadband for Ireland.  This is, perhaps, the greatest example of the Minister's lack of priority for delivering an IT infrastructure in the country.  We have spent €80 million putting 64 MANs into the ground, but only three of them are giving a return to the State currently and providing a positive contribution to improving our backbone infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_135">The other 61, however, although many of them have been built for up to two years, sit there unlit while the Minister prevaricates on who he will allow to manage phase two of the MANS project.  My understanding is that a preferred bidder was chosen in July.  As five months have elapsed, why has the preferred bidder not been given a contract to manage the second phase of MANS?  When one considers the success, in respect of return on investment, of the first phase of MANS, why is an investment of €80 million in public moneys allowed to lie in the ground unlit, while delays from the Minister continue?</p>

            <p eId="para_136">While the Deputy opposite might have me signing contracts left, right and centre, I must be cognisant of the public interest and the taxpayers' interests in how we manage the development of our infrastructure.  I believe I was absolutely correct to commission the value for money report examining our overall MANS project, to publish it in the Dáil and to act on the recommendations emerging from it, as well as being involved in the consultation process pertaining to the development of next generation broadband.  I believe that rather than rushing in and signing a contract immediately, as the Deputy opposite may advocate, the correct approach was to get it right and to work through a process in the appropriate framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_137">I am confident my Department will be able to do so in the first quarter of next year and one should recognise that while the metropolitan area networks constituted a proper investment, they were a long-term investment.  While in the long term, investment in fibre will provide a crucial solution, it is not a short-term or immediate measure.  As the value for money report indicated, even were one to switch on every MANS nationwide, one would not necessarily get an immediate and instant uptake, particularly in the smaller towns.  It is a long-term investment.</p>

            <p eId="para_160">The home energy saving scheme implemented by Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, will make grant assistance generally available from next year to householders to install energy efficiency measures.  The objective of the scheme is to significantly reduce energy use and emissions in the residential sector by incentivising households to upgrade the energy performance of their homes.  I launched the scheme on a pilot basis earlier this year in a selected number of areas and with a budget of €5 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_161">Under the pilot phase, grant aid is being provided for cavity wall insulation, wall lining insulation, external insulation, attic insulation, heating controls and low emission double glazing.  The results of the pilot phase are informing the design of the national roll-out of the scheme in 2009, for which provision of €20 million has been made in my budget.  First results from the pilot phase indicate that the targeted supports can bring a house from an F-rating starting point on the building energy rating scale to a D2 rating.  This represents an energy saving of up to €700 per year for each house, equating to reduced carbon emissions of 3 tonnes per year.</p>
            <p eId="para_162">The warmer homes scheme is overseen by Sustainable Energy Ireland and is delivered principally through community-based organisations.  There now are 20 such groups currently approved by Sustainable Energy Ireland.  The scheme is targeted at households on low income.  The warmer homes scheme installs insulation, draught proofing measures and energy saving light bulbs.  Advice is also provided to householders on minimising energy use.  These measures are provided free or at a nominal cost.  Householders in receipt of energy efficiency improvements under the scheme potentially can reduce energy consumption by up to 60%, depending on the number of measures implemented and their energy behaviour.</p>
            <p eId="para_163">I doubled the funding for the warmer homes scheme this year, allowing for a corresponding doubling of the number of homes upgraded this year to 5,000.  Funding of €10 million has been made available for this scheme in 2009, which includes a total contribution of €5 million between the ESB and Bord Gáis.  This will allow for a significant further extension of the scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_170">Following on from the pilot programme, the 2009 allocation of €20 million shows a decided lack of ambition.  This is sad because I believe the Minister and his colleague from the Green Party, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, are eager to try to implement such measures.  However, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, has not shown strength of character by standing up to fight for additional funds.  Were the Minister to be allocated more than €20 million to spend on this measure, it would enable him to adopt a carrot and stick approach regarding the many homes that are more than ten years old and are very poorly built and insulated and so on.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael D’Arcy</from>
            <p eId="para_172">Is there scope to try to expand the fund of €20 million, especially as, apart from the warmer homes scheme to which the Minister referred, he also finished off the greener homes scheme.  Consequently, no real additional funding is available, which is disappointing from someone who espouses views that he intends to improve the energy efficiency of properties.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_98" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_173">As no one has finished up the greener home scheme, that point does not stand.  In order to get this right, our approach was correct, namely, to start with a pilot and test it out because this is highly innovative and different from what applies elsewhere.  I believe the home energy savings scheme is exactly right.  I am told by Sustainable Energy Ireland that expanding it to €20 million next year demonstrates an appropriate level of ambition in respect of being able to manage the new assessors and the processing of the scheme.  However, ambitions are not limited in that if there is a huge take-up, I would like to see it ramped up further because I believe it is the correct type of project with which the Government can generate economic activity at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_174">A key development is the State's involvement will not constitute the only expenditure in this regard.  I have been in discussions with the banks to ascertain whether it can be made more easy for householders to be given credit for such a project.  The State's input may constitute 20% or 30% of the total.  For example, in a €10,000 build, the State's investment, in respect of supports, might be in the order of €2,000.  However, other funding and financing will be available from the banks that will allow householders to do this more easily.  Saving €700 per year is a brilliant payback and constitutes a really good lending investment, compared to some of the other lending that has taken place in recent years, which helps householders to cut down their emissions by approximately 3 tonnes per annum each, helps them to save on their fuel bills by approximately €700 per year each and provides Ireland with economic activity in an area in which none is taking place.</p>
            <p eId="para_175">This scheme is perfectly appropriate for our times.  I was proud to be able to introduce it and it is working in the areas in which it has been tried and tested and I look forward to rolling it out across the rest of the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_177">The Minister's lack of ambition can only be described as startling.  A grant of €2,000 for a house — any of those older houses — is not even a carrot on the stick; it is just a stick with the string and no carrot.  Frankly, anybody who has an old property to be converted for energy efficiency will tell him that.</p>

            <p eId="para_181">The banks were very enthusiastic about the scheme because they saw the sense of it.</p>
            <p eId="para_182">This scheme is different.  It is changing from a long tradition of just throwing a grant at a particular material that one buys.  This is going about it in a different way.  It is providing a service and providing financial support, not to any one product.  In the past the price of such a product rose to the extent of the grant and no one gained.  In such cases the householder pays more and the State just transfers money to the company making the product.  This scheme is innovative in that the grant is going into the process, both in doing the assessment and also providing a percentage contribution to the work undertaken, and that is absolutely right.</p>
            <p eId="para_183">What we have seen in the pilot scheme is that there is keen public demand for it at a time when it is not easy for people to spend or lend money.  There is a keen interest in the banks to support it.  We can put together a package of measures that has significant effect and that has not been tried anywhere else in terms of the level of sophistication and support provided.</p>

            <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_186">I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 111 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_187">The planned introduction of a bio-fuels obligation will require all fuel suppliers to ensure that bio-fuels represent a certain percentage of their annual fuel sales.  The bio-fuels obligation is designed to provide a long-term market based framework for the development of a bio-fuels sector and delivery of bio-fuels targets to 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_188">The public consultation process on the bio-fuels obligation scheme has recently been completed.  More than 30 submissions were received as part of the consultation process.  My Department is now analysing these submissions with a view to finalising a bio-fuels obligation scheme informed by the consultation process.  I will be bringing a proposal to Government in the coming months, including introduction of the necessary legislation to put the bio-fuels obligation in place by the end of 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_189">Ireland's national bio-fuels obligation scheme will take full account of EU and global developments on bio-fuels and related sustainability criteria.  Ireland is working closely with the Commission and other member states to ensure all bio-fuels placed on the European and Irish market are produced in a manner that does not harm indigenous communities, does not give rise to food security issues and that delivers real and worthwhile savings in greenhouse gas emissions.  The trilateral discussions between Parliament, Council and Commission are coming to a close, and I expect to see the item on the agenda for the Energy Council later this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_190">This process provides a critical opportunity to set realistic and worthwhile criteria to govern the bio-fuels sector as we move towards our 2020 energy in transport targets.  Given that bio-fuels will form an increasingly important component of European transport fuels in the coming years, it is absolutely vital that these criteria are not alone robust and effective in protecting those most at risk in the developing world, but also set the agenda for further investment in more efficient bio-fuel production, and for investment in second generation bio-fuels.</p>
            <p eId="para_191">Sustainable bio-fuels will play an important part in delivering the 10% renewable energy target for transport fuels by 2020.  Electric vehicles will also play a key role in this regard.  Through the full application of the EU sustainability criteria, the bio-fuels obligation scheme mechanism will allow us to ensure the bio-fuel we use is sustainably sourced, and evolving technologies will allow us to increase the penetration rate without any impacts on food prices.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_106">
            <from>Deputy Simon Coveney</from>
            <p eId="para_192">The Minister might clarify what he means by sustainably sourced because I am not sure that bio-fuels will play an increasingly important role in terms of transportation fuel across the European Union, and he knows this as well.  There will be a role for bio-fuels in the future but many are not quite sure what that role is.</p>
            <p eId="para_193">I am also surprised the Minister has not mentioned the Government's bio-fuels pilot projects currently being proposed.  My understanding is that the Government has incentives in place to encourage a certain number of people who are part of that scheme to produce bio-fuels into the future.  Is that not the case?  Could the Minister give us the detail of those pilot projects?</p>
            <p eId="para_194">The concern in the industry is that by taking the current approach where there are pilot projects on bio-fuel production over the next number of years to address the issues of feasibility, viability and sustainability, we kill the rest of the industry.  While the Minister gives a certain small number of producers of bio-fuels preferential treatment to get them going on pilot project schemes, nobody else will invest in the industry.</p>

            <p eId="para_199">Second, the development of second generation bio-fuels — the technology must be delivered here — from algae or from other lignnocellulose material that currently cannot be transferred into bio-fuels but which scientists state may become a reality, would be a further sustainable source.</p>
            <p eId="para_200">Third, if we are to use bio-fuels from land use, produced either at home but particularly abroad, rather than from the first two processes I mentioned, it is crucial that they be sustainable in that the emission reduction achieved is real, not as in the case of some corn-to-ethanol or maize-to-ethanol bio-fuels that have come, particularly from the United States, in recent years.  They should not come from land use processes that themselves are unsustainable, either in terms of the effect on food prices or on the natural environment.  The definition of sustainable bio-fuels is those that meet such criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_201">In the absence of us supporting the European Commission in this proposal, two things happen.  The first is that the entire European climate change package falls apart or certainly encounters difficulty because the renewables component, of which bio-fuels is one component, is a central structure keeping the European package together.</p>
            <p eId="para_202">The second, which is more crucial, is that while bio-fuels will develop regardless of what the European Union does, if it does not set targets and procedures, there will not be any sustainability criteria in place.  Supporting the European Union targets is a way for this country to support proper standards in distant parts of the world because the European Union has the buying power to affect the standards that apply across the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_203">The pilot scheme contracts were signed and cannot be unsigned.  The reason I want to put in place a bio-fuel obligation scheme is that it will treat all people in the industry on a level playing field where as long as they meet such sustainable criteria they have the ability to supply the market.  That is a better approach than the approach taken to date of grant-aiding or giving a tax break to particular companies.</p>

            <p eId="para_205">I presume the Minister accepts that the meeting of targets requires a considerable amount of imported bio-fuels and the issue of traceability is crucial.  I have been struck by the fact that when I raised this in the past the Minister was not even able to tell me what percentage of bio-fuels were imported as opposed to indigenous, let alone from where it was coming, and yet other countries and companies are able to set down requirements to ensure that ethical standards are met.  We hear a great deal of talk from the Minister but, in terms of practical requirements on producers and suppliers, what will he do to ensure full traceability so we can be comfortable in the idea that we are not causing depredation across the developing world?</p>

It is right for Ireland to attach itself, and to meet its interests in the sustainability criteria via such a European mechanism.  For Ireland to try to do it alone would be incredibly difficult.  Recognising that some of the fuels we import from the UK are already pre-blended with bio-fuel inputs, it is difficult for a country the size of Ireland to determine world trade rules in terms of bio-fuels.</p>

            <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_221">I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 117 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_222">The Government's energy policy framework 2007–20 underlines the importance of ensuring the continued availability of reliable, secure and competitively priced energy supply.  This is vital for the competitiveness of Irish industry and Ireland's long-term economic and social development.</p>
            <p eId="para_223">In delivering on this imperative, the energy policy framework committed to the publication of a grid development strategy and to the delivery of the North-South and Meath-Cavan transmission lines and the east-west interconnector.  EirGrid's grid development strategy, grid25, was launched on 8 October 2008.  This sets out a road map for the development of the electricity transmission network for the next 17 years and aims to double the capacity of the national grid during this period.</p>
            <p eId="para_224">The North-South and Meath-Cavan transmission lines and the east-west interconnector are interrelated projects which are of strategic national importance to Ireland.  They will link Ireland to the wider UK market and facilitate competition as part of the all-island electricity market.  They will also lead to major improvements in the reliability and quality of supply, both locally and nationally, to the benefit of business and consumers and will facilitate higher levels of renewable electricity penetration in line with Government targets.</p>
            <p eId="para_225">While I have no direct role in regard to routes and the planning of transmission lines, I am mindful of the concerns expressed about specific developments and the development of the grid generally.  To this end, earlier this year my Department commissioned an independent study on the comparative merits of high voltage overhead electricity transmission lines versus underground cables.  I published the study in July 2008 and conveyed it to the Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_226">The study concludes that underground transmission cables can be expected to have forced outage rates which are at least ten times greater than those expected of overhead lines.  The consultants describe this as a severe limitation for underground cables and, consequently, underground cables do not compare favourably to overhead lines in terms of adequacy of the electricity transmission system and reliability of electricity supply.  The consultants describe this finding as the dominating criterion when comparing overhead and underground technologies.  They note that the associated negative impacts cannot compensate for any of the advantages of underground cables.  The study also concludes that the cost implications of underground cable proposals are difficult to quantify but would be significant.  Based on case studies conducted by the consultants, they state that the cost of underground cables would be approximately five times greater than the capital cost of overhead lines and three times the life cycle cost.</p>
            <p eId="para_227">I am aware of the ASKON report commissioned by North East Pylon Pressure and I am advised that EirGrid is examining the aspects of this report that have been made available.  EirGrid has also had a number of constructive meetings with North East Pylon Pressure.  Arising from these meetings, EirGrid has stated that they would welcome an opportunity to meet the authors of the ASKON report to more fully inform its understanding of the basis for the report's conclusions.  This engagement with North East Pylon Pressure is part of ongoing pre-planning application consultations by EirGrid on the North-South transmission line.  In its planning application to An Bord Pleanála, EirGrid will be required to submit full details of its proposed route and technology selection, as well as a full environmental impact assessment.  In addressing technology selection, EirGrid will provide An Bord Pleanála with a full report analysing the issues involved with undergrounding the 400 kV project.</p>
            <p eId="para_228">EirGrid expects to submit a planning application for the North-South transmission line to the strategic infrastructure board in 2009.  The target completion date for the line is 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_229">I thank the Minister for his reply but I disagree with much of what he said.  He stated that he has no direct role in determining whether Ireland's infrastructure should go underground or over ground but that is not the case.  He is the policy leader in this area.  This issue does not solely affect EirGrid.</p>
            <p eId="para_230">In Denmark, politicians and policy makers have agreed under a compromise arrangement that all power lines built in the future, including 400 kV lines, will be put underground.  I understand that has been formalised in a new law.  Let us have a frank discussion instead of saying it is EirGrid's problem.</p>

            <p eId="para_236">The Deputy misquoted me.  I did not say I have no role but that I have no direct role in regard to routes and planning applications for transmission lines.  The Department retains a policy role on how we develop our electricity supplies and network.  That is why we commissioned an independent study on the merits of this clearly contentious issue.  I have regard for that report, as well as the ASKON report.  I have considered both reports.</p>

            <p eId="para_238">Yes.  For the Deputy's information, I travelled to Denmark earlier this year, where I met the engineers responsible for the development of that country's transmission line.  They had every interest in putting their 400 kV lines, which are similar to ours, underground.  They desperately wanted to construct the interconnector because they are to Denmark's economic advantage in terms of the trade in energy between the north pool and the German markets.  Similar planning concerns arose in regard to whether the lines should be installed underground or over ground.  The engineers were pulling their hair out because they said, in an honest way, that it was not technically feasible to put them underground.  This response is similar to the findings of the independent report commissioned by my Department.  Deputy Coveney heard in committee from a professor of electronic engineering in UCD who is an independent expert and has no vested interest in the matter but who gave exactly the same answer.  Transmission systems of this type and over this distance cannot be built underground.</p>

That means the economy in this country is now in freefall.  Some 10,000 jobs per month are being lost and while the British Government reduced its VAT rate, our Government has increased it with devastating consequences for retailing within 50 miles of the Border and beyond.  There is still no credit flowing from the banks to small businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">The budget and bank guarantee system was supposed to deal with these problems but it has not.  If these reports are correct — we will know at 4.30 p.m. — will it be the view of the Taoiseach that the budget figures for 2009 will be in shreds?

          <p eId="para_299">There is a clear need to instill confidence in the Irish consumer and economy.  Everybody is afraid to spend a euro now.  The Government's budget cut back capital projects by almost €1 billion.  Carbon credits were paid out to power generators when it was not necessary and the position in Northern Ireland is now devastating for the retail trade across a swathe of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">Will the Taoiseach revisit the capital budget arithmetic because investment is needed in serious infrastructure projects to allow people continue to work if they have been out of work since the collapse of the housing industry?  Is the Taoiseach prepared to look at the question of a reversal of the 0.5% increase in the rate of VAT, which is crucifying retail at the moment?  Will he consider the implications of the investment available to the Government from a pay freeze, the money from which could be reinvested into the economy to upskill and retrain, provide schools and retain teachers and be used in many other areas which are causing difficulties in the health and agriculture sectors and so on?</p>
          <p eId="para_301">Is the Taoiseach prepared to consider again the budgetary arithmetic of 14 October in view of the devastation that now faces us and the lack of confidence that the Irish consumer has in the economy?  What is the Government's plan to inject confidence into the economy so we can kick-start it again through infrastructure, retraining, upskilling and getting back to a point where we can begin to trade increased exports?  What is the Government's plan now in view of reports that the Exchequer returns for November are seriously off line with those forecast in the budget on 14 October?</p>

          <p eId="para_302">As Deputy Kenny is aware, we are experiencing a sharp deterioration in the economic situation internationally and that obviously affects an open economy like Ireland's, as any other.  The Government's approach has been to invest over €8.2 billion in direct Exchequer funding in a capital investment programme, together with the possibility of up to a further €800 million in public private partnership money for next year's capital programme.  That represents about 5.2% or 5.3% of GNP, which is more than twice the average capital investment in other countries.  The package being suggested relates to a stimulus of the order of 1% of GNP.  There are various responses from various countries to be envisaged in that, in terms of the draft Commission proposal for consideration at the European Council meeting next week.  We are already investing about 2.5% more as a percentage of GNP in capital infrastructure next year, based on existing plans, than the European Union average.  We have kept up capital expenditure to the greatest extent possible because we believe that is an important part of providing for a more competitive economy when the upturn comes.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">As regards the current budget deficit, an increasing amount of funding will have to be provided next year for a deficit on the current side.  We need to address that issue over a period of years to ensure we bring current budget spending back into balance, which will require primarily continuing to look at expenditure programmes.  That is the reason Mr. Colm McCarthy's group will come forward early next year with proposals for what other areas of expenditure we will have to examine in order to ensure that we provide some stabilisation in the public finances.</p>

          <p eId="para_304">The Exchequer figures for the first 11 months of the year will be announced at 4.30 p.m. — very probably before the Taoiseach and I conclude our exchange of questions and answers here.  Will he take this opportunity to inform the House what the tax returns were for the first 11 months of this year, and how they compare to the Government's projected figures?  Can he say specifically by how much the tax figures for November were behind the projected level?  Can he also tell the House what is now the projected Exchequer deficit for the end of the year?</p>
          <p eId="para_305">Does the Taoiseach accept that the Government was mistaken in increasing VAT to 21.5% in the budget, making our VAT rates the third highest in Europe?  Does the Government have any plans to change the VAT regime, particularly after what has happened in the United Kingdom and the implications that has for cross-Border activity?</p>
          <p eId="para_306">On a related issue, I also want to raise with the Taoiseach what appears to be the Government's response to the €200 billion recovery plan proposed by the European Commission.  A spokesperson for the Minister for Finance is reported to have said that while the Government welcomes the European Commission's proposed €200 billion recovery plan, the Government's feeling is that enough is already being done.  Quite clearly, however, not enough is being done.  I doubt if the 150 workers who were told today that they will lose their jobs at FBD think enough is being done, or the other 150 workers at Element Six in Shannon who have been told they are to be let go before Christmas.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">Will the Taoiseach inform the House what are the Exchequer figures for the first 11 months of the year?  Will he also tell the House what steps the Government intends to take to address this situation?</p>

          <p eId="para_308">Expenditure for 2008 is broadly in line and we estimate that the reduction in overall revenues over those projected will be approximately 13%.  November is a disappointing month and next month will be also.  It reflects not just the situation in the construction industry but also, more broadly, a slowdown across the economy which we have all observed in recent times.  Economic forecasters have indicated a difficult year coming up in 2009 also.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">While I want to maintain the convention regarding the issuing of the November returns with the Department of Finance in the normal way, there will be a deterioration on the projected 5.5% deficit for this year.  It will be above that because of the slowdown in the economy and the fact that the reduction in taxation concerns not only property-related taxes but also other taxes which have performed disappointingly, as one would expect, including corporation tax returns which reflect reduced profitability in the more exacting economic circumstances they are now contending with.</p>

          <p eId="para_311">That deterioration must be addressed by the Government examining further programmes to see in what way we can ensure that going into next year, as challenging as it may be, we can seek to stabilise finances further.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">The Deputy mentioned further borrowing in order to borrow our way out of a problem, but that is not necessarily a lesson that remains unlearned in this country.  We must recognise that, even in the difficult times in which we are operating, there is a considerable commitment by the Government to invest in a capital programme of over €8.2 billion.  That is, quite rightly, a significant commitment by the Government given the part of the economic cycle we are in at the moment.  It certainly does not offset the reduction in economic activity in the private sector in view of the openness of the economy and the difficulties we now face, but it is a considerable commitment of over 5.2% or 5.3% of GNP in next year's capital programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">The real issue is the need to continue to work on stabilising day-to-day expenditure in excess of revenues.  That is the structural issue that must be addressed and on the basis of figures to emerge we will have to continue our work in that area and identify measures to ensure the sustainability of the public finances.  Our top priority is to ensure we do so because that is the basis upon which we can determine a sustainable level of public services in future.  On the basis of a deficit on the current budget side and in the overall public finances at the end of this year and into next year, one must consider the question of a stimulus package.  We already have in our expenditure a stimulus package on capital investment which is, on average, double that which our European partners are in a position to commit to in respect of public investment programmes.</p>

          <p eId="para_314">The Taoiseach answered a lot of questions but unfortunately not the one I specifically wanted him to answer, so let me put it another way.  I do appreciate the convention but since it is now 4.30 p.m. the Taoiseach is released from that convention.  By how much will tax revenues this year be less than projected, either at the beginning of the year or in the budget?  That is the bottom line we want to know.  The Taoiseach should express the figures in money terms rather than in percentages.  Will the Taoiseach resist the temptation to discuss capital expenditure and so on and give the House the bottom line figure of how far tax revenues will have fallen this year compared to projections?

          <p eId="para_315">When the Taoiseach states that programmes must be reviewed, reconsidered or revisited, is he discussing another budget?  Will he address the issue I raised, namely, the Government's budget decision to increase VAT rates?  Our neighbouring state and the one with which we have a land border has reduced its VAT rates considerably.</p>

          <p eId="para_319">While the UK's standard VAT rate will have an impact on the price differentials between North and South in respect of some goods, it should be pointed out that the UK has increased excise duties on alcohol, cigarettes, petrol and diesel to offset the 2.5% reduction in VAT on those items.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">Approximately half of the value of goods and services purchased in the State are not subject to the standard rate of VAT and, therefore, are unaffected by the change therein.  For example, all Government services, local authorities, hospitals, schools, the majority of foodstuffs, oral medicines, books, children's clothes and so on are subject to a zero VAT rate.  Housing, electricity, gas, domestic fuels, restaurant services and labour intensive services, such as hairdressing and shoe repair, have the reduced VAT rate of 13.5% applied to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">As part of a fiscal stimulus package, the UK Government decided to reduce its standard VAT rate from 17.5% to 15% on a temporary basis with effect from 1 December 2008 to 31 December 2009.  The exchange rate is the determining factor rather than the VAT rate.</p>

This serious accusation was made following a postponement of two years, but we are again being asked to prevent elections being called for a fourth year.  It is not just cowardice; it is incompetence.  The promised reform package has not been introduced, nor have the heads of a Bill or other legislation.  The Minister is responsible for the fisheries boards and the management of same and has overseen a decentralisation process that has been most incompetent.  In fact, that decentralisation did not happen but the process cost a huge amount.  The money relating to decentralisation was taken from a fisheries budget that was quite small from the outset.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">I request a full debate on this matter so that the House does not merely rubber stamp this incompetence.  There is a great deal of discussion from those on the Government side about reducing waste.  However, when options are provided and opportunities are presented, we are again asked to defer matters and to play the patsies.  That is unacceptable.

One of the most worrying aspects of this was that of road haulage drivers driving without brakes, which apart from being an exploitation of workers, also exposes other road users to considerable risk.  Legislation in respect of tightening up the rights of employees and to deal with problems of exploitation in the workplace has been promised for some time.  When will the Employment Law Compliance Bill 2008, published in March, nine months ago, and not yet dealt with, be debated in the House?

          <p eId="para_520">As the Ceann Comhairle will know, since my election to this House I have taken an interest in the large number of State agencies operating in this country and, in particular, the actions of some of them.  It was announced in the budget that approximately 40 agencies would be merged, requiring some 20 items of legislation.  I have been in touch with all the Departments about this and of those 20 mergers, Bills are only anticipated in respect of five of them.  I do not want to go through all of them, but I would be interested to know if it is the intention of the Taoiseach and the Government to bring before the House, in this session or next year, the necessary legislation to bring about all the amalgamations and abolitions outlined in the Budget Statement?  In respect of the 20 proposed mergers, there are only five Bills to amend legislation. Legislation exists to allow for one other merger by way of ministerial order, but there is no legislation to allow for the other proposed 14 mergers.  I would interested to know if there is a commitment from Government to publish 14 Bills in respect of those mergers and, if so, when that will be done?</p>

The fact that there are a number of agencies to be rationalised and merged does not equate to the number of Bills that would be required to effect that.  The state of readiness of the legislation, where it is applicable in various Departments, would vary from place to place.  The important point is that a decision has been taken to proceed along the lines announced in the budget in respect of the agencies mentioned.  It is for Ministers now to proceed with that with all due haste in consultation with the management and unions of those agencies.</p>

          <p eId="para_569">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_570">I am pleased to introduce this important legislation.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to extend the remit of the Ombudsman and thereby ensure that members of the public have recourse to the Ombudsman in respect of the administrative actions of a much wider range of public bodies than heretofore.  The Bill also provides the Ombudsman with additional powers and updates various provisions in the Ombudsman Act 1980 in the light of the passage of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">The Bill represents the most significant extension of the Ombudsman's remit in almost 25 years.  At present, the Ombudsman is empowered to investigate complaints about the administrative actions of Government Departments and offices, the Health Service Executive, including the public voluntary hospitals, local authorities and An Post.  The Ombudsman also has certain functions under the Disability Act 2005.  When the Bill is enacted, the Ombudsman will be empowered to investigate the administrative actions of vocational education committees and higher education institutions.  A range of other bodies whose administrative actions have not previously been subject to investigation are also being included.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">Last Wednesday, 26 November 2008, the Taoiseach launched the report of the task force on the public service, Transforming Public Services.  The task force report builds on the analysis and conclusions of the OECD review and provides the framework for a comprehensive new approach to the reform of the public service.  It is particularly appropriate that the Bill is being considered at this time given the renewed focus on public service modernisation and reform and on the responsiveness of public bodies to the citizens they serve.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">The term "Ombudsman" derives from a Swedish word meaning, literally, "agent" or "representative" of the people and it was in Sweden that the first equivalent to a modern day office of Ombudsman was established in the 18th century.  The starting point for the establishment of the office of Ombudsman in Ireland is somewhat more recent.  In 1969, the report of the Public Services Organisation Review Group recommended the appointment of a commissioner for administrative justice, the theoretical prototype for the Ombudsman who would emerge much later.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">Six years after the publication of that report, a Dáil Private Members' motion led to the establishment of an informal all-party committee to consider the possibility of appointing an Ombudsman.  That committee reported in 1977 and recommended the establishment of an Ombudsman's office.  The Bill establishing the office was enacted in 1980 and came into operation by Government order in July 1983.  Ireland's first Ombudsman, the late Michael Mills, RIP, a former political correspondent of the <i>Irish Press</i> newspaper, was appointed in 1984.  Michael Mills served in the post until 1994 when Kevin Murphy, former Secretary General, public service management and development, in the Department of Finance was appointed Ombudsman.  The development of the office continued under Kevin Murphy.  He was also appointed as Information Commissioner in 1998.  He was succeeded in June 2003 by Emily O’Reilly who was a well known political journalist before becoming the current Ombudsman and Information Commissioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">The role of the office is not simply to examine individual complaints but also to ensure a better quality service to customers or clients of public bodies by improving the system of public administration.  The provision of advice to members of the public on issues and areas which do not fall within the Ombudsman's remit has become a growing area of activity for the office over the years.  That is an important service for people.  By the end of 2007, in excess of 69,000 valid complaints had been handled by the Ombudsman's office.  On average, approximately 38% of complaints have been upheld in whole or in part.  The number of valid complaints received each year runs at approximately 2,500 at present.  Inquiries, as distinct from complaints, are now running at a rate of approximately 10,000 a year.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">I am conscious that the wider improvements in public administration which the office of the Ombudsman can help bring about are often achieved through the unearthing of systemic issues that come to light, in the first instance, through individual complaints.  The positive spin-off that this yields manifests itself in a number of ways.  For instance, while the primary purpose of the Ombudsman's annual report is to report to the Oireachtas on the carrying out of her functions, it also serves the wider role of alerting the public and public bodies to cases of interest that the Ombudsman dealt with during the previous year.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">Many of the public bodies which the Ombudsman deals with deliver services or administer schemes that are similar in nature.  For instance, all hospitals face similar challenges in seeking to provide first-class patient care and all local authorities have to apply complex planning legislation and deal with large numbers of planning applications, while the various regions of the Health Service Executive administer a variety of programmes to deliver on health and social care needs.  Thus, an individual case where the Ombudsman finds fault with a public body and suggests improvements in practices and procedures can provide a valuable learning experience for other public bodies that carry out similar work.  In order to strengthen the role of the Ombudsman in this area, a provision has been included in the Bill for the Ombudsman to make a general recommendation to any of the bodies coming within her remit where, following an investigation, she considers it appropriate to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">A further benefit arising from the work of the office is the correction of issues involving a public body which, in turn, leads to a retrospective review of similar cases that had arisen previously and where appropriate redress may be warranted arising from the decision reached in the individual complaint.  That can yield benefits for a class of people who had never actually complained to the Ombudsman.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">The annual and special reports published by the office of the Ombudsman show how the office can make a difference in the lives of many people while at the same time helping to raise the standard of public administration in Ireland.  Public bodies can use the outcome of Ombudsman investigations as an opportunity to turn complaints into a positive learning experience for the benefit of the organisation and the members of the public with whom they deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">For example, in her 2005 annual report, the Ombudsman reported on an investigation into a complaint against Sligo General Hospital from the members of a family, whose father died in January 2000, two days after he had been admitted to Sligo General Hospital.  The Ombudsman's investigation identified a number of failings in the standard of patient care which the hospital had afforded the patient in that case.  In a follow-up article in her 2006 annual report the Ombudsman singled out the hospital for praise for a range of initiatives it had taken in response to the investigation.  Among those initiatives was a philosophy of care which was drawn up by the nursing staff working on the ward in which the patient at the centre of the complaint was treated.  A steering committee was also established to drive new initiatives in regard to patient autonomy, integrated care, communication skills and dignity and design.  The committee was also charged with ensuring those initiatives are acted upon, and are continuously evaluated within the hospital itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">Most recently, in October 2008, the Ombudsman published a systemic investigation report into the operation by local authorities of waiver schemes for refuse collection charges.  That investigation was prompted following a complaint to the Ombudsman by a public representative on behalf of a number of low-income householders who had been refused waivers by Waterford County Council.  The Ombudsman subsequently decided to carry out a general investigation into waste charges waiver schemes, as operated in a representative sample of 23 local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">The investigation identified a range of inconsistencies and differences of approach by local authorities.  For instance, a total of seven local authorities had no waiver system at all in place, on the grounds that the service was provided exclusively by private operators, others only gave waivers for refuse not collected by private operators, one county had three different waiver schemes in place, while the average value of an annual waiver varied from €40 to €357.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">Given the responsibilities of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in local government matters, the Ombudsman recommended that the Department would take a lead role to help and encourage local authorities by carrying out a review of the administrative inconsistencies and anomalies that exist in waiver schemes throughout the country; devising guidelines for local authorities that would assist them in achieving fairness, equity and consistency in the administration of waiver schemes; addressing the legal position relating to the provision of waiver schemes where the waste collection service has been fully privatised; expediting consideration of the regulation of the waste management sector with particular reference to the needs of low-income households with a view to ensuring that all households availing of such services, from whatever source, are facilitated with a waste waiver scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, welcomed the report and accepted that the existing regulatory framework required modernisation.  The Department also assured the Ombudsman that it would give the report and her recommendations the fullest consideration, in the context of the ongoing review of the regulation of the waste management sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">The main change introduced by the Bill relates to the Ombudsman's remit.  Her remit will now include vocational education committees and higher education institutions.  In addition, many agencies which, until now, have not come within the remit of the Ombudsman will be included.  Organisations such as the National Roads Authority, the National Treatment Purchase Fund, the Courts Service, FÁS and many other State bodies whose activities affect the daily lives of citizens are being included.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">The bodies which are reviewable by the Ombudsman are set out in the First Schedule.  The 1980 Act has two Schedules.  The First Schedule has two parts.  Part 1 lists bodies that are subject to investigation by the Ombudsman.  Where certain functions or elements of the bodies listed in Part 1 do not come within the remit of the Ombudsman those are listed in Part 2 of the First Schedule.  An example of that is the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which comes within the remit of the Ombudsman and, accordingly, is listed in Part 1 of the First Schedule.  However the Garda Síochána, which is excluded from the remit of the Ombudsman, is listed in Part 2 of the First Schedule.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">For the most part the Bill retains the approach taken in the original Act.  However, as well as considerably extending the number of bodies listed in the First Schedule we have also deleted Part 2 of the First Schedule.  Any exemptions, which are limited, are now listed as part of the public body with which they are associated.  The intention is to make the Ombudsman's remit as clear and concise as possible.  The Second Schedule lists bodies that are excluded from investigation.  Generally those are commercial bodies, although the Schedule also includes, for example, the Attorney General's office and the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Again, we have retained that approach and the Second Schedule has been updated to take account of a number of commercial State bodies that have been set up since the office of Ombudsman was established.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">I will briefly outline the remaining sections of the Bill.  Section 1 contains the Short Title and provides for a commencement date to allow some time for the office of Ombudsman to prepare for the significant expansion in her remit.  Section<b> </b>2 is a standard provision defining the term “Principal Act” for the purposes of the Bill as the Ombudsman Act 1980.  In dealing with the remaining sections of the Bill, I will refer to that Act simply as “the 1980 Act”.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">Section<b> </b>3 amends section 1 of the 1980 Act by introducing a number of definitions of particular terms which are used throughout the Bill.  The terms “reviewable agency”, “entity”, “eligible person” and “exempt agency” are introduced and defined to clarify which bodies and which elements of bodies come within the remit of the Ombudsman, who may complain to the Ombudsman and the bodies, or elements of bodies, which are not subject to investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">Section 4<b> </b>amends provisions in the 1980 Act whereby the Government can add to or remove bodies from the Ombudsman’s remit by order.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">Section 10 of the 1980 Act contains a provision that allows the Government to amend the First and Second Schedules to the Act after consultation with the Ombudsman and the relevant Minister.  Following the Supreme Court judgment in the Mulcreevy case and on the advice of the Attorney General, specific criteria are being introduced which bodies must satisfy before they can be brought within the remit of the Ombudsman by order of the Government.  The criteria are very similar to those contained in the FOI Act and each such order must be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Moreover, under section 6 of the Bill, provisions whereby the Government could, by order, remove bodies from the First or Second Schedules to the 1980 Act are being removed.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">Section 5 updates the reference to "European Parliament" in section 2 of the 1980 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">Section 6 replaces a number of provisions contained in section 4 of the 1980 Act and deletes others as consequential amendments.  Section 4 of the 1980 Act sets out the functions of the Ombudsman.  The purpose of the amendments to this section is primarily to take account of the new definitions of "eligible person", "reviewable agency" etc., that are being introduced in section 3 of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">Section 6 will allow the Ombudsman to investigate a failure by a body to comply with the provisions being introduced in section 7 of the Bill.  The relevant provisions in section 7 require bodies under the remit of the Ombudsman to give reasonable assistance and guidance in dealings they have with members of the public.  Section 6 also provides additional grounds for the Ombudsman to decide not to undertake an investigation, or to discontinue an investigation.  The additional grounds are where she is of the opinion that satisfactory measures to remedy the cause of a complaint have been, or are proposed to be, taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">Section 7 introduces a new provision in regard to the rights of citizens in their dealings with public bodies on administrative matters.  This section sets out the entitlement of citizens to a high level of service from those bodies that come within the remit of the Ombudsman.  Consistent with the resources available to them, public bodies will be required to give reasonable assistance and guidance in their dealings with the public; ensure that the business of individuals is dealt with properly, fairly and impartially; and provide information on any rights of appeal or review that people have.  Individuals will have recourse to the Ombudsman in regard to compliance by public bodies with these new provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">Section 8 amends section 5 of the 1980 Act, which concerns matters excluded from the Ombudsman's remit.  For the most part, the excluded areas are the same as those contained in the 1980 Act.  One notable change concerns the exclusion of matters relating to recruitment or appointment and the terms and conditions according to which a person in a reviewable agency is employed.  The limitation in the 1980 Act, which excludes these matters for people working in a reviewable or an exempt agency only, will no longer apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">The Bill now provides that, in respect of these types of employment-related issues, the Ombudsman will have no jurisdiction regardless of the organisation concerned.  The rationale for this is clear: the role of the Ombudsman is to safeguard the rights of individuals and society in dealing with public bodies and not to investigate issues concerning terms and conditions of employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">Section 9 of the Bill will strengthen the powers of the Ombudsman.  At present, following an investigation, the Ombudsman may recommend that a body take a particular course of action but she is not empowered to make general recommendations to other public bodies.  Section 9 provides that the Ombudsman can make general recommendations to such bodies within her remit as she considers appropriate.  The Ombudsman will also be empowered to request bodies to notify her within a specified timeframe of their response to her recommendation.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">Section 10 also strengthens the powers of the Ombudsman.  At present, the Ombudsman can require a person who is in possession of information relevant to a preliminary examination or an investigation to provide it to her office.  The Ombudsman will now be enabled to apply to the Circuit Court for an order directing the relevant person to comply should this prove necessary.  Section 11 of the Bill is a consequential provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">Section 12 reflects the fact that legal issues may arise from time to time in an investigation or an examination by the Ombudsman.  Based on similar powers available to the Office of the Information Commissioner under the FOI Act, this section will allow the Ombudsman to refer a question of law arising in an examination or an investigation to the High Court.  The decision of the High Court will be final and conclusive.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">Section 13 amends section 9 of the Ombudsman Act 1980 to align the latter with the Freedom of Information Act 1997.  At present, under section 9 of the 1980 Act, a Minister or the Revenue Commissioners may notify the Ombudsman that the disclosure of a document, class of document, or information, would be prejudicial to the public interest.  The Ombudsman is not authorised to reveal any such document or information.  Section 13 of the Bill will bring these provisions into line with the Freedom of Information Act in providing that only an "exempt record" within the meaning of the FOI Acts can be the subject of such a notice.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">Section 14 deletes subsection (4) of section 10 of the 1980 Act.  The latter provides that the Minister for Finance can delegate powers exercisable by him under the Civil Service Regulation Acts 1956 to 2005.  This provision is no longer necessary as the Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Act 2005 provides that the Ombudsman is the appropriate authority for staff, within that office, at the grade of principal officer and above, and the head of the office is the appropriate authority for staff below that grade.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">Section 15 limits the use of the title of "Ombudsman" to positions that are either authorised to use the title by an Act of the Oireachtas, have obtained the consent of the Minister for Finance to do so on foot of consultation by the Minister with the Ombudsman and relevant Ministers, or had commenced using the term before 9 July 2008.  The purpose of these provisions is to prevent a proliferation of entities using the term "Ombudsman" and safeguard the position and status which the Ombudsman and related offices hold in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">Sections 17 to 21 of the Bill contain a number of consequential amendments to other Acts to take account of the definition of "reviewable agency" introduced by the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">I trust Deputies will strongly support this Bill and will welcome the new powers being given to the Ombudsman and the significant expansion of her remit.  The Bill comprises a positive set of measures which will empower citizens in their interaction with public bodies and help further to improve standards of public administration.  I commend it to this House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_608">I welcome this Bill, which has been long anticipated.  Over the years in which the Ombudsman has been in action, there has been a quiet revolution in the attitude within the public service to responding to needs and complaints.  This is a welcome development although there are still cases — these are the ones that command headlines — in which people's needs seem to have been trampled upon.  It is very important that the Office of the Ombudsman exists and that we strengthen its powers.  There has been great progress since the appointment of the Ombudsman.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">A number of elements of this Bill are to be welcomed.  I welcome the general recommendations that can now be given by the Ombudsman.  The existing power, which is essentially to provide an adverse report to the Dáil, is very limited.  It is a long stop and is not likely to be used in respect of an individual agency.  It is important that general recommendations can be made by the Office of the Ombudsman.  The Ombudsman has been gaining considerable experience in dealing with issues of complaint and dissatisfaction.  There is no doubt that the lessons being learned in her work could apply in many areas.  I suspect that some of those lessons could even be applied in areas that are not considered to be within their scope, such as to clinical issues in the area of health, in respect of which the lack of a satisfactory way of dealing with complaints is not only a frequent cause of considerable disquiet but also of litigation at a later stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">It is welcome that the Ombudsman has the capacity to require legal cases to be stated.  I welcome the fact the Bill envisages that bodies under the remit of the Office of the Ombudsman will have systems for dealing with complaints promptly and that there will be a statutory power to achieve this.  One could well ask why the Bill does not go a step further, for example, by giving the Ombudsman's recommendations and guidelines for bodies the legal force of a code of practice.  Thus, if accepted by the body concerned, the guidelines would have legal force.  Such codes of practice are now commonplace among financial regulators, including the Financial Regulator.  Such codes of practice allow a regulator or ombudsman to extend the boundaries over time.  This sort of growth, which would have the force of law, would be beneficial.  I am interested in hearing the Minister of State's response to that idea.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">Perhaps we need to examine dispute mechanisms other than the traditional ones in the public service.  Perhaps the Ombudsman should be given the power to recommend mediation to a body rather than adopting the rather cumbersome approach of investigating each case and making an ultimate decision.  The Minister might consider giving to the Ombudsman, as an additional option in her armoury, the flexibility to ask a body with a difficulty to proceed to mediation.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">A continuing cause of unease is the very long list of bodies excluded from the Ombudsman's remit.  I am surprised that regulatory boards are excluded.  It is hard to understand why regulators who make decisions about institutions and their behaviour would not themselves be subject to the services of the Ombudsman.  They deal with complaints and cases put to them by members of the public and the opportunity for maladministration clearly exists in the way a regulator might deal with such an issue.  The basis for these exclusions is not clear and I would like to hear the Minister restate why he believes bodies with a commercial mandate should be excluded.  Many bodies with commercial mandates are excluded, such as Dublin Bus, the ESB, CIE and Bord Gáis and their regulators.  Can the Minister justify why he believes this should continue to be the case?  There is little reason for so doing.  One reason that might be offered is that some of these companies compete with private operators who would not similarly be overseen by the Ombudsman.  It would be difficult to present a credible commercial case that cited the right of appeal to an Ombudsman as a  burden on a commercial State body.  I would like to hear the Minister justify this position.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">The Ombudsman has rightly spoken about the interplay between her office and our work.  Ultimately the Oireachtas is the body to which she reports.  She made the point that in recent times we have created hundreds of new agencies which have not been subject to proper parliamentary scrutiny.  Many on this side of the House would agree.  The democratic model we must promote is that of strong parliamentary accountability, with right of appeal to the Ombudsman in cases of failings in individual cases.  We must revisit this matter of the accountability to this House of many agencies.  Many Members on this side of the House are driven crazy when they deal with bodies such as the Health Service Executive and try to get responses from it.  Some of us were amused to hear that Cabinet Ministers find such bodies equally impenetrable when they try to get answers or discover what is happening internally in some of the agencies which we set up, all unwitting.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">Perhaps parliamentary reform is not within the Minister of State's mandate but it must be addressed.  The Minister of State did not explain why he did not accept the recommendation made to include asylum and immigration matters within the remit of the Ombudsman.  The Ombudsman presented a case for that seemed credible because there is such precedent in other jurisdictions. The Minister of State did not indicate the reasons for his response.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">Significant public service reform is coming on to the agenda and is long overdue.  There must be a serious quality assurance revolution within the public service.  The Ombudsman pointed out that our endeavours must be to drive better systems of public service delivery and I believe these will be accelerated in future times.  We must also be cognisant of the important values that underpin public service in the treatment of individuals.  These include fairness, equality, integrity and recognition of the common good, values that got squeezed in Ireland in recent times by the economic model we pursued.  As we embrace public service reform it is important to ensure that those important values remain core to the public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">The Ombudsman cited cases of people losing right of access to waiver schemes in the privatisation of certain services.  That is a fundamental part of a fair system of service charges which has been lost.  As we reform public services, one of the considerable challenges we face is ensuring that stakeholders, namely the users of public services, have an enhanced role.  We must see that reform does not become a top-down, HSE-style driven efficiency.  The model we must adopt is one that makes agencies accountable for the delivery of performance.  The agreements agencies enter into must involve a greater role for stakeholders.  Why should stakeholders not be able to make choices?  Why should schools not offer choices?  That is the brief of the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Haughey.  Why should schools not be in a position to present choices to parents?  In an enhanced design people might be able to design websites and teaching might involve something new.  Why do we not consider after-school clubs as a way of dealing with challenges in our schools?  Why are those choices not presented to parents in a systematic way?  Why should we not give more authority to schools and to principals to develop options for enhancing their schools?  In that way they would become more accountable to their stakeholders.  The notion of top-down, one size fits all control has been a bad feature of our public service model and we must reform it.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">The Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, will agree with me that when it comes to the really tough issues like the drugs problem, school drop outs and anti-social behaviour, the State models are extremely poor.  We must enlist the support of communities if they are to have any impact.  Our systems are often poorly attuned.  We must to develop a system where it is standard that agencies funded by public money offer choices to the stakeholders.  Ideally, people will be able to choose the type of service and the most appropriate service for their needs.  On a broader level, there must be choices about the direction a particular agency should take in serving local community needs.  We have not established that in our system and, as a result, communities get frustrated with many agencies that are seen to be insensitive to local needs.  The great challenge we now face is that, unfortunately, we are re-modelling public services against a tough background and a lack of resources.  We must recognise that the crucial issue is to empower those who serve.  Hospitals would be run in a considerably better way if patients had a stronger stake and the ability to command the way  resources are spent.  That would be a great advance.  I see that the Acting Chairman is getting ready——</p>

          <p eId="para_622">I ask to be called after ten minutes.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">I very much welcome this Bill which is opportune.  The recent OECD report outlined proper reform in the public sector, particularly with reference to a customer-oriented public sector.  This extension of the powers of the Ombudsman lies very much in this direction.  In bringing in extra bodies, we have given power to the Ombudsman to make a general recommendation rather than merely specific ones relating to particular complaints.  From now a general recommendation can be made to a body following an investigation.  This is welcome and will bring about proper standards.  Deputy Bruton made the point that it might lead to a code of practice or conduct for particular bodies.  That is most opportune and should perhaps be put on a statutory footing.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">Up to now the Ombudsman could request information during investigations but there was no legal obligation on the body under investigation to provide it.  The legal route can now be taken in order to obtain that information.  That is very important.  If needed, recourse to the High Court on a point of law will also be possible and that is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">Some 450 State agencies and bodies are now in existence.  One might question the validity of many of them, which are outside the remit of Departments.  Ministers are increasingly telling the House that they have no remit over a particular function and that in effect it is now the bailiwick of organisations such as the HSE and FÁS.  Power must be brought back within the executive function of Departments.  This debate raises the broader question, as to why we have 450 State agencies and bodies, and what they are doing.  They are bad value for money for the taxpayer, doing work that Ministers and their Departments should be doing — certainly this is something that must be looked at in depth.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">My second point is that Schedule 2 refers to exempted agencies.  Why are such agencies exempted?  If they have regulatory powers and are involved in regulation, they should be subject to some form of oversight and regulatory procedures in their own right.  A typical example is An Bord Pleanála, some of whose decisions are not consistent, and that should be looked at.  Every ordinary person is dealing with An Bord Gáis and the ESB on a daily basis.  If a person has a query, he or she should be able to register a complaint through the Ombudsman's office.  State bodies should have no concern, in the event, if they are operating proper systems in line with suitable codes of practice for dealing with customers.  That should not be an issue.  We are seeking to bring about a customer centred environment.  At the moment a great many public bodies are not customer centred, and basically employ a top-down approach rather than dealing with the customer on a proper basis.  Effectively, if a private sector concern is not performing adequately, the customer will go elsewhere.  Access to a proper complaints procedure is necessary within the public sector as well.  There is no reason that bodies such as CIE, Bord na Móna, the Commission for Energy Regulation and the Commission for Taxi Regulation should not be brought under the ambit of the Ombudsman, in terms of complaints procedures as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">The Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly, has indicated that the new legislation should have within it provisions for dealing with queries as regards immigrants and asylum matters.  That should have been taken on board.  We have to provide a consistent system across all areas, so that people are able to make complaints, as appropriate.  Overall, the thrust must be that the Ombudsman's office should be capable of providing ordinary individuals with the facility to make complaints without fear — and allow the Ombudsman to adjudicate as to whether further investigation is required.  My understanding is that the Act, in a prudent manner, provides that the Ombudsman can provide formal mediation, if needed.  It is a question of looking after the customer.  I believe it will also have the effect of improving the quality of services being provided by State agencies, and that is the key focus here.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">In summary, I welcome the legislation, which is long overdue.  However, other bodies need to be brought within its ambit.  The general regulations now being provided for under the legislation mean the Ombudsman can intervene as regards various bodies, rather than making specific recommendations on particular points.  That should be examined in a manner that will give rise to codes of practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">Furthermore, specific proposals that may be made in particular cases that currently have the status of recommendations should be strengthened to ensure they can be enforced.  However, these are wider questions that can be looked at on Committee Stage.  I welcome the Bill, but there are points that require further examination.</p>

        <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_316">
          <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_630">Any extension of the Ombudsman's remit is to be welcomed.  However, where a new body is being created that takes over the functions of an incumbent body covered by the Act, it falls outside the legislation unless there is an order, approved by both Houses.  As indicated by previous speakers, it has become the practice of this Government to create and establish a whole series of bodies, taking over what used to be direct ministerial functions.  As a consequence when a body comes into being, the Minister concerned frequently replies to Dáil questions to the effect that as this is a dedicated body, he or she will no longer answer parliamentary questions.  Thus, the very important recourse in a democracy, namely legitimate questions about the action of a public body in regard to individuals or specific issues, is lost.  This has been a very strong feature of Government over the past ten years.  The principle should be that all State bodies are subject to the Act, as they are created or where they are in being, unless they are specifically excluded.  That means if a new quango is created, delegating unto itself particular ministerial functions, as happened for instance with issues relating to the security industry, fresh legislation would not be needed.  This means a new body, from the time of its establishment date, should be legitimately subject to inquiries by the Ombudsman, therefore rendering some degree of accountability, particularly to individuals who might have issues to pursue with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">I welcome the extension of the remit of the Ombudsman's Act to the bodies mentioned, particularly the educational institutions.  That will be important where, for instance, a student could have a difficulty with an examination result or some other element of college or university administration.  The tendency nowadays is to have recourse to legal remedies and to seek injunctions and so on.  It would be much better if an Ombudsman examines the issue and either directs mediation or makes a preliminary finding.  In most cases, that might well settle the particular problem, because very often people want information more than anything else.  This is particularly true in the medical area where often something happens to a patient or where a patient dies, and all the grieving family wants is information on what happened to their relative.  At present, where people seek information in such cases, hospital and medical authorities and the HSE are legally highly defensive.  Instead of giving information, they tend to clam up and basically reserve their positions, because they anticipate potential legal action.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">Mediation, information and no-fault information in a whole series of situations over a range of public services would both save people a great deal of anguish and much court time.  It would also save a great deal in legal costs for individuals and public bodies.  This is something we have not encouraged.  We are very litigious and our manner of reacting to complaints or inquiries about public bodies is to up the ante and almost call in the lawyers automatically.  We should consider developing procedures in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">I regret that a number of functions of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform are excluded from the remit of the Bill.  In her report last year, the Ombudsman made specific reference to the Bill.  She welcomed the principle of the Bill extending her jurisdiction to bodies such as FÁS, the Health and Safety Authority and so on.  However, she went on to say that she regretted the fact that decisions on immigration and asylum matters would not be covered by the Bill.  She pointed out that, by coincidence, there was a Bill before the Houses dealing with significant changes in immigration, residence and protection matters which proposed further radical changes to the administration of the asylum system.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">There is no provision under existing legislation for such complaints to be referred to the Ombudsman's office.  I am aware the Ombudsman made a submission to the Department on the matter as long ago as July 2005 and that she has been in contact with Mr. Thomas Hammerberg, a Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, and has expressed her concern about the restrictions in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">We need to think further about the implications.  I would like to point out one area that has caused frustration for me and many other Deputies.  Significant numbers of Irish people are married to people from countries throughout the world.  In my constituency I frequently come across cases involving an Irish person married to someone from places such as India or Pakistan.  After the birth of a child, the parents often want the grandparents to visit and it is a tortuous procedure to assist these people in getting a visitor visa.  I have raised the issue with the Minister on a number of occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">There are ways to address this issue.  I have dealt with cases where the families seeking a visitor visa were significant people investing in this country.  They have lived here for a long period and are willing to go guarantor and comply with any reasonable request to confirm that their relatives, if given a visitor visa, will honour its terms and conditions.  However, it is impossible to discover a defined procedure that is as fair as possible to deal with such situations so that people applying to embassy offices around the globe to visit their relatives who are settled here and married to Irish partners can do so.  There appears to be no logical and transparent system for applying for visas.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">We understand the examination of such visa applications must always be subject to intense scrutiny by the Department.  Nobody objects to this, but the problem is that sometimes a visa is granted, but more often it is not and it is extremely difficult to understand the reasons for the rejection of the visa application.  In this situation, the administration of the system could be vastly improved.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">The situation could be improved even further if an attempt was made to deal with the consequence of the Government encouraging massive immigration to Ireland.  In the newspapers this weekend there was mention of a visit of the former Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, under FÁS sponsorship, to various job fairs in Cape Town and South Africa.  The purpose of that visit and expenditure was to encourage people from South Africa to emigrate to Ireland.  The Minister spent significant sums encouraging skilled workers to come to Ireland.  Many came, but if they want relatives to visit, they may find that while FÁS was hiring a grand piano to draw them into its job fairs, they may not be able to get permission for their relatives to visit, despite the fact that relatives coming to visit must have a return ticket and sufficient funds to meet their needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">Another area of asylum and immigration legislation difficult to understand is the regulations relating to work permits for people coming here to work.  Last night's television programme, "Prime Time Investigates", demonstrated the arbitrary way in which employers can act.  They hold the work permits and vulnerable immigrants like the lorry drivers or domestic workers mentioned in the programme have few rights.  They may suffer abuse unless the light is shone on how the work permit system operates.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">The Office of the Ombudsman would be a good office to investigate whether the work permit system operates fairly, both in the interest of Ireland and of the employees invited here on foot of work permits obtained by their prospective employer.  Oversight by the Ombudsman of this area could result in a better system and reduce potential abuse by employers of people coming to work in such situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">With regard to asylum provision, from the 1990s on my area received approximately 500 families from Bosnia as a consequence of the war there, some of whom had been injured in the bombings in Sarajevo.  Those people are now in Ireland almost 20 years and have integrated very well into the community.  They came as programme refugees and were invited by successive Governments to live here.  However, the rules relating to family reunification are extraordinarily difficult to understand although they are a recognised part of refugee law for programme refugees.  Allowing the Ombudsman the capacity for examination and oversight of this area would significantly improve the quality of the administration of the law in this regard.  It is obvious this should be an area the Ombudsman should have the power to inquire into.  I am sorry this Bill chooses to duck these difficult issues.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform pretty much puts forward the theory that it is exempt from all inquiry by the Ombudsman, except with regard to the court system.  The Department's approach is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">The Garda Síochána and elements of its operations could also be the subject of legitimate inquiry by the Ombudsman.  The issues relating to members of the force who have issues with the administration of the force could also be an appropriate area of inquiry.  I do not believe the walls of the Department would fall down if that were the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">I welcome the extension of the Ombudsman's powers and I understand she has agreed to appear before the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on foot of an inquiry she conducted into waiver schemes for refuse collection.  A series of different schemes operates across local authorities in Ireland and my Labour Party colleague, Deputy Ciarán Lynch, has raised a number of times the need for a national waiver scheme to clarify people's entitlements, particularly those of pensioners, to reductions in the cost of their refuse charges.  Having examined the issue, the Ombudsman made findings that are helpful to the administration of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and local councils.  Her appearance before the aforementioned joint committee to set out her views is a positive development.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">Much of what the Ombudsman does and many of the rights of that office are paralleled by freedom of information.  I wish to mention two areas that cry out to be addressed by someone like an ombudsman.  The first pertains to the issue of management companies because no legislation exists in this regard other than an entitlement under company law for the formation of a management company.  Tens of thousands of people, particularly young people, have found the properties they purchased at great cost are subject to control by a management company.  Such companies are necessary in the case of apartments.  In recent years, however, traditional housing estates have been built in which local authorities have stipulated in the planning permission that the estate or development would be subject to a management company on completion.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">The idea is that the developer has the management company and that on completion of the development, it is handed over to a management company of the residents.  However, this system is not working.  Residents are being charged enormous fees by managing agents and management companies, often for work of a poor or non-existent quality and there is no one to whom to apply.  Although a National Property Services Regulatory Authority was established approximately 18 months ago and while it wishes to be helpful, it has no legal status.  Moreover, given the current climate of difficulty regarding house sales, management companies have collapsed and people in apartment developments are finding it difficult to process the sale of their apartments because the management company comprises a clause in the titles to the property.  This issue affects tens of thousands of people and as public administration has almost no remedy to offer people caught in such difficulties, this must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">I refer to house repossessions.  Ireland has had a Financial Services Ombudsman in recent years who has been doing some excellent work.  Every Monday, however, a procession of people, whose houses are being repossessed, comes before the masters of the various courts.  Some mortgage companies are very eager to repossess mortgages at the first sign of difficulty and there is no code of practice or standard as to how this is applied.  For example, one half of a couple with mortgage repayments of €1,500 to €1,600 per month may lose his or her job in the construction industry and as soon as the first payment is missed, the penalty charges begin to clock up like a cash register.  The case is handed over to lawyers by the third month, when three months of arrears amount to a debt of perhaps €4,000 to €5,000.  Within five months, by the time such companies have finished and the legal fees have been included, the debt may exceed €20,000.  Moreover, the mortgage company will only accept total payment and will not accept part-payments.  The total payment includes the arrears, penalties and astronomical legal fees included by such companies.  This is crazy given the present climate, because who will buy such houses after they have been repossessed?  There are no purchasers in the market and in some cases, the local authorities will bear the burden when the people affected go on public housing lists or apply for rent supplements.  At present, there are aspects of public administration in which people's capacity to make applications under the Ombudsman's provisions would aid public administration.  More particularly, it would aid individuals and families who suffer as a consequence of the failure to legislate or even to think out regulations that would address some of the difficulties into which we now face.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">I refer to small business people who are finding that banks are cutting down on their credit and overdraft entitlements.  Many banks are doing this at present.  For example, a business may have permission to avail of an overdraft facility of €10,000 or €20,000, which it may not use.  At present however, the banks are writing to such businesses to notify them that the value of their overdraft is being reduced.  This has consequences if the business's debtors are slow to pay or, for example, they ask for an additional month's credit on the basis they are known entities who always pay.  In the present climate, business people may wish to be able to make an offer whereby they take 50% and extend an additional month or two of credit on the balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">However, their banks in turn are not making any allowances for such practices.  This is an administrative issue in which a response that is both business-like and fair is required because circumstances have changed so dramatically.  The remit of the various ombudsmans' structures could be used to inform banks that although it is acknowledged they must be business-like and seek to avoid bad credit risks, at the same time, good businesses are experiencing difficulties and were everyone to work together and were some leeway given, people would be able to get out of this mess.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">While I seek imagination in this respect, unfortunately and surprisingly, the imagination to understand what people are suffering appears to have deserted Fianna Fáil almost completely.  While I do not know whether the Green Party has any input in this regard, no such imagination appears to emanate from Fianna Fáil these days.  The role of the offices of the various ombudsmen, which help with specific areas of difficulty by sorting out administrative rulings, making them more human, understandable and fair to the citizen or to businesses is an essential part of a modern democracy.  Ireland improved dramatically in respect of its economy and everything else when we opened the door to freedom of information and let the light shine in.  Ireland has nothing to lose as a country or an economy by letting in the light on how its public bodies perform.  While I welcome this Bill, before Committee Stage the Minister should consider broadening its remit to include in particular the areas related to justice.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_317">
          <from>Deputy Seymour Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_650">While I have not engaged in much preparation on this issue, I felt obliged to say a few words on this Bill because the Office of the Ombudsman has provided a tremendous service over the years.  The 2,500 complaints per year and 10,000 telephone inquiries per year give an indication of how the service is respected throughout the country and how people use it.  Unfortunately, up until now there were a number of areas that the Ombudsman could not cover and I welcome the fact that those areas are included in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">I was interested in the example of a complaint in Sligo General Hospital that the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, chose to use in his script.  It is purely coincidental that the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, is in the House but if he reads the Minister of State's script he will find it.  By dealing with the complaint in Sligo General Hospital, the hospital services improved dramatically in the subsequent period.  That was a positive outcome and I was glad that the Minister of State highlighted it.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">There have been so many inquiries and reports done by private groups on the hospital services.  Specifically, I recall the Pat Joe Walsh report on a not dissimilar case in Monaghan General Hospital.  Initially, it was used to try to close the hospital.  They could not manage that at the time.  The HSE and the Minister did not learn from it, as obviously happened in the Sligo case.  That is an important element of what the Ombudsman has been trying to do.  The Ombudsman has been trying, not only to sort out problems but to give guidance on how improvements can be made in the future.  When I look at the present situation of our hospital in Monaghan and the failure of the Minister, Deputy Harney, to even meet with its personnel, the consultants or the hospital alliance to look at how things could be done better, the Ombudsman has still much to do in that area to save money and to ensure a better service.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">The previous speaker, Deputy Burton, mentioned that the Ombudsman will attend the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to speak about some of the issues she has dealt with in that area.  I wish to be associated with the comments on the waiver system and how the Ombudsman improved that structure.  I welcome it because in my constituency there was a reluctance to give any waivers at all, no matter how difficult the circumstances.  Especially in the case of the elderly or the handicapped on low incomes who would not be able to dispose of some of their waste in the way some of the rest of us would, in the garden or wherever else, the charges for waste were an imposition and the efforts of the Ombudsman in that regard were extremely important.  I can see her having a much greater role in the area of local authority services.  With the economic position getting much tighter, no doubt there will be efforts to cut back.  It is important that the Ombudsman has the courage and the opportunity to ensure the provision of the best possible such services.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">I welcome the fact that a large number of new organisations has been included in the legislation.  Specifically, I welcome the inclusion of the vocational education committees.  While many of these do an excellent job, no doubt, according to records from the past, there were serious problems in some of them.  It is only right that a person who has a difficulty with a vocational education committee or any other such organisation using public funds has the right to bring the issue to the Ombudsman to ensure that it is properly teased out.  The Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, stated the Ombudsman's remit will also now include the higher education institutions as well, and that is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">The Minister of State went on to state that organisations such as the National Roads Authority, the National Treatment Purchase Fund, the Courts Service, FÁS, etc., are being included.  One cannot help but be pleased to hear that FÁS is to be included.  What has happened in FÁS in the past while is an indication of how difficult matters can be.  I congratulate those in my party and in the press and elsewhere who exposed the FÁS issue.  When I think back on the great work done by community organisations together with FÁS workers, people who were on social welfare who felt they had no hope were taken on by FÁS and given the opportunity to do good for their areas, and in many cases this led to employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">I support the work of FÁS in places such as Dundalk and Drogheda in the provision of apprentice and other such services, but when one sees the Minister and chairman both involved in such wanton waste one realises that there is a dire need for the Ombudsman to be able to deal with such matters.  We do not want inquiries and tribunals.  We want structures like the Ombudsman to deal with such matters in a clinical and proper fashion and come up with the results in an open and transparent way.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">I welcome the fact that the present Ombudsman, Ms O'Reilly, is prepared to come in to the Oireachtas to discuss the role of her office in such an open and frank way.  It is important that Members of the Oireachtas and the public know exactly what services she and her office can provide.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">While I have the height of respect for the great work done by many officials of the National Roads Authority down through the years, there have been major problems with cost factors on projects such as the Dublin Port tunnel.  There needs to be openness and transparency in such matters and there needs to be accountability.  Some of the work the NRA has done in more recent times is excellent, but it is not above the law and the fact that we cannot ask the Minister a question in this House about a road or anything to do with the NRA is not acceptable and is extremely difficult.  I have raised this point on many occasions when such organisations were being set up, and I especially raised it at the time the HSE was being set up.  The bottom line is that under this Bill the National Roads Authority will be included.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">I also welcome the inclusion of the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  I also have asked questions about the fund and been told it is a private organisation and we do not have any right to know.  This is an organisation that is being paid for out of taxpayers' money.  I am aware of umpteen cases where the patient concerned should have been dealt with by the public health service but because of total mismanagement of that service, for which the mangers got bonuses, they must be passed on to be dealt with by the fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">I welcome that two of my constituents will be dealt with by the fund but this is being done because a ward in Navan hospital was closed.  The theatre and staff are available for the operation but the management decided to close the doors.  Many people are suffering as a result of that decision.  This issue needs to be investigated at minimum cost rather than by means of big inquiries or another quango.  The Ombudsman does a great job in this context.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">I welcome the inclusion of the Courts Service in the remit of the Bill.  A case was recently brought to my attention involving a young couple who built a house in which they intended to live for the rest of their lives.  They wanted the best for their only daughter.  They were assured by their architect that he was insured for €320,000 if anything went wrong.  Unfortunately, things went badly wrong and the house developed cracks into which one could put one's hands.  The house has not fallen down but the rear of the foundation was found to be utterly useless.  I am reminded of the biblical story about whether one should build a house on sand or on rock.  It appears that half of this house was built on sand.  When the problem was brought to the architect's attention, he admitted that he was fully at fault.  However, the insurance money also had to cover the legal costs of the case.  To the best of my memory, the insurer's solicitor took €63,000 and the man who was supposed to be advising the couple and their daughter on how the system worked is seeking €137,000.  Anybody who knows the law will understand that if somebody holds up his or hands and pleads guilty, there is no case.  The couple is left with €120,000, which will not go far towards rebuilding their house.  Will this type of situation be covered under the Bill?  The case has been considered by the Law Society and it is now with the Taxing Master but it is difficult to get support from these parties.  I have no doubt that the Ombudsman would take this case seriously and ensure that justice is served and the rights of people upheld.  Imagine employing a solicitor who looks after his own rights instead of his clients.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">I welcome the Bill and hope that it will address issues such as those which I outlined to the House.  Other issues, including agriculture, also merit attention.  The appeals system in the area of agriculture does not always reflect the reality of situations.  I am not happy with that area and I hope the Minister can bring in further measures in that regard.  I cannot overemphasise the positive impact the Office of the Ombudsman has made over the years.  It has solved a great many problems and has done more than most in terms of improving administration.  We have heard a lot about benchmarking.  I do not want to give the impression that Sligo General Hospital is not a good facility but improvements have been made there on foot of an investigation by the Ombudsman.  Similar progress was made in county councils and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The Office of the Ombudsman has a bright future and I welcome the expansion of its remit.</p>

          <p eId="para_664">I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate and acknowledge the cross-party support given to the Bill.  All Deputies would agree that the Ombudsman has made an important contribution over the past 25 years in terms of promoting high standards of public administration.  This Bill will enhance that contribution.  It comprises a progressive series of measures which complement the recent announcements made by the Government on broader public sector modernisation and reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">The Bill is being introduced at a time when we are facing a number of significant challenges.  We are currently experiencing such severe economic and fiscal challenges that it is critical our public services are organised and delivered in as efficient and effective a manner as possible.  The economic environment has deteriorated sharply and the turnaround is occurring with unprecedented speed and severity.  Our focus must be on positioning the economy to take advantage of the upturn in the global economy when it eventually emerges.  In other words, enhanced competitiveness in all sectors of the economy, including greater efficiency in the public sector, is imperative in returning to more normal rates of growth once the current difficulties recede.  It is appropriate that our public service is subject to scrutiny if we are to ensure that it continues to contribute to national development, provides excellent services to the public and makes effective use of resources.  This is even more critical in view of current economic circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">Significant progress has been made in reforming and modernising the public service since the strategic management initiative was launched some 14 years ago.  During that time, our public services have undergone a major transformation and substantial improvements have been made in many areas, such as the delivery of quality customer services, regulatory reform, financial management and human resource management.  However, if are to continue to remain competitive and support the growth of the broader economy, then we must ensure that our commitment to reform is ongoing.  The programme of public service modernisation must be constantly updated.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">The current partnership agreement, Towards 2016, builds on the progress made under previous agreements and ensures continued co-operation with change and modernisation initiatives, as well as improvements in productivity right across the public service.  It provides an important framework for meeting the economic and social challenges ahead and, critically, sets out a mechanism for the verification of progress in the public service through the performance verification groups for each of the sectors.  The recent review and transitional agreement under Towards 2016 recognises that the public service must review continuously its systems, processes and procedures to ensure that it is responsive and efficient and that it provides high quality, value for money services.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">The OECD review of the Irish public service acknowledged the central role played by the public service in our national development by ensuring the right economic, regulatory, educational and social conditions are in place.  At the same time, however, it stated there is a need for a more integrated public service with a greater performance focus.  It also acknowledged that in a tighter fiscal environment there is a need to prioritise spending within budget frameworks.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">The House is of course aware of the range of other recent initiatives which have been focused on ensuring public bodies deliver the highest standards to citizens and that the public sector is positioned to respond effectively to the challenges which we now face.  Last Wednesday, the Taoiseach launched the report of the task force on the public service, Transforming Public Services.  The task force report builds on the analysis and conclusions of the OECD review and provides the framework for a comprehensive new approach to the reform of the public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">The pilot phase of the organisation review programme, ORP, which was also published last week, underlines the need for real, immediate and meaningful action to modernise the public service.  Like the task force, the ORP highlights the need to put the citizen at the centre of our public services, manage performance better, address cross-cutting issues, and be flexible across traditional organisational boundaries as priorities emerge.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">The task force report and ORP were published as part of a major Government policy statement on transforming our public services which sets out how the recommendations of the task force will be implemented.  That statement contains details of a number of initiatives to address public service numbers and expenditure and achieve value for money.  The Government is also continuing to drive forward the programme aimed at securing increased value for money in public spending through the value for money reviews.  The first round of these were scheduled to be carried out between June 2006 and December 2008 and the Government has recently decided that a new round covering the three year period, 2009-11 should be undertaken.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">The Government is making a number of improvements to the process which will ensure a greater focus on the biggest spending Departments, more independent reviews, and a more direct role for the Department of Finance in carrying out the most significant reviews.  The findings of these reviews are considered directly as part of the annual Estimates process.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">Deputies have raised many issues in their comments and these will be subject to more in-depth debate on Committee Stage.  With regard to the reasons the recommendations of the Ombudsman are not technically binding, it is clearly the case that when she does issue a finding or recommendation, it is virtually always taken on board by the relevant body.  Her position and the respect which that position commands are taken very seriously by public bodies.  In discussions between the Department of Finance and the Office of the Ombudsman, it is not the view of the office that the recommendations are not taken on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">A point was made on bodies excluded from the remit of the Ombudsman.  It is important to take into account that we have sought in this Bill to prioritise those bodies which have a significant interface or interaction with citizens and whose administrative actions affect large numbers of people.  Commercial State bodies do not come within the remit of the Ombudsman, and this has always been the approach of an Ombudsman Bill.  It is not seen as appropriate that bodies subject to commercial pressures and which operate in a commercial environment should be included.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">This Bill complements these measures and comes at an appropriate time.  As the Taoiseach has said on a number of occasions, public service modernisation is about placing the public at the centre of our public service.  The Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill does precisely that.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Kennedy</from>
          <p eId="para_679">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation, primarily because of its emphasis on accessibility and affordability.  These are two of the most important elements of any measure taken relating to health care, and they have never been more important than with regard to nursing homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">Like most of our colleagues in the Dáil, I have been flooded with queries relating to nursing homes over my time as a public representative.  I appreciate the level of worry being felt by older people in Ireland about their future.  There is no denying that the current nursing home system is far from perfect, as there is an abundance of private beds and a shortage of public beds.  The associated cost of care depends on whether a patient is public or private and the availability of a suitable bed.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">Reflecting on it, I realise the current system is an <i>ad hoc</i> collection of various local schemes, with varying degrees of subvention available depending on a person’s circumstance and location.  This inconsistency means there is little transparency and much confusion.  It is impossible to determine the needs of patients and therefore no consistent information exists which would allow authorities to allocate particular beds to those with the greatest need.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">Another consideration and a serious contributing factor to the need for this legislation is the growing number of older people relying on the State.  The implications of this trend go across the board from social welfare to pensions and finally to nursing home provision.  By 2036, the Government estimates that there will be an astonishing 1.1 million people over the age of 65, representing 22% of the population.  One can imagine the cost of providing care for these people, especially under the existing scheme, where the State pays for a large proportion of the both private and public care.  A fact which must be emphasised now is that the State will still fund the largest part of the case costs overall and that individuals are being asked to pay only a small contribution where they are able to.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">The current nursing home provisions are the product of years of alterations and a failure on the part of successive Governments to grasp the system by the neck and shake some sense of consistency into it.  What should be an easy and compassionate process is reduced to an overly complex, stressful and ultimately expensive ordeal.  The Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, and her Department have addressed these difficulties and kept them to the forefront of their minds when penning the new legislation.  The main selling point of the Bill is its simplicity, as it promotes transparency and equality.  All those availing of the measures contained within will pay an identical proportion of their estate for their care.  The fair deal is easy to understand and it will supersede the existing subvention scheme.  Nobody who cannot afford it should be expected to foot the entire bill for their nursing home care, yet this is the aim of the current subvention system.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">Unfortunately, the State cannot afford to fully pay for the care of the elderly.  This issue is undoubtedly on the forefront of any older person's mind as they enter into a nursing home.  I can only imagine their fears in terms of whether they are eligible for subvention or if they or their family can pay the rest of the bill.  They will not want to be a burden to their family and may wonder what will happen if they cannot pay the bill.  We frequently hear such concerns from our own family or neighbours.  Such people would also wonder who will take care of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">With the fair deal scheme, such questions are answered.  Under the new scheme, an individual will make a financial contribution to care based on income and there is no distinction based on age.  Their families and partners will not be liable for the expense of the care and once it is decided to apply to the new scheme, a care needs assessment will be carried out.  The assessment includes an evaluation of patients' needs, including whether they can dress, feed and bathe themselves unaided, as well as their ability to communicate.  Once a person's need is established, a means test will be carried out by the HSE and the individual's financial contribution assessed.  The eventual figure arrived at will be a combination of 80% of a person's assessable income — their pension perhaps — per annum, along with 5% of their assets, possibly their savings over a year.  There is a disregard set at €36,000 for individuals and €72,000 for couples, after which the 5% will apply.  If the older person's assets include land or property, this element of their contribution can be deferred until after their death, and can be collected from their estate.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">The 5% contribution will be applied per year for the first three years and, importantly, will be capped at 15%.  That is an important issue.  In the case of couples, this will be capped at 7.5%, where one person remains in the home.  If a partner or other dependants remain living in the home, payment can be further deferred.  If the individual in question is unable to make the decision to go into a nursing home, then he or she can be appointed with the approval of two medical professionals.  In these cases, an application must be made to the local circuit court.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">There is a certain level of confusion over whether, under the scheme, the State will move to take a person's house from the family after their death.  This is not the case.  If the deferred contribution option is chosen, the most the State will ever get from an estate is 15%.  There is also a perception that this percentage could be increased, but it cannot be.  It is capped at 15% for an individual and 7.5% per couple, where one partner remains in the home.  While there has been confusion about it, we must stress that fact, which should put many people's minds at ease.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">The new scheme provided for in this legislation will be implemented by the HSE with the assistance of the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  Whilst the HSE is to be responsible for the care needs and financial assessments and then the provision of information on the available suitable home, the National Treatment Purchase Fund will be the agency to negotiate the price of beds.  The price of care will then relate to the needs of the patient, with higher prices charged to those who need more care, which is in line with the equitable nature of the proposed legislation.  It is worth noting that same-sex relationships and co-habiting couples are viewed as having equal rights under the scheme to those who are married.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">The new scheme will make long-term care more affordable.  It will remove anxiety thus providing older people with peace of mind.  It will ensure that the same level of State support is available to everyone, whether they are public or private patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">I look forward to debating subsequent Stages of this legislation, which I hope will have a quick passage through the House.  As public representatives, we have all heard the concerns of those affected by the need for nursing home care.  I hope all sides of the House will support the Bill expeditiously.</p>

          <from>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_692">I am pleased to contribute to the debate on this Bill.  We all know of families who are worried about the cost of nursing home care, which is the biggest single issue facing elderly people at the moment.  In addition to being worried about the costs involved, such people and their relatives are concerned about how they will be looked after in their later years.  We must get the details of this legislation correct so that such people's worries will be alleviated and they will be able to avail of proper nursing home care in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">The Bill must deliver what is expected of it.  There is a feeling among elderly people that it will enable them to afford comfortable nursing home care.  We have all been approached by constituents asking about the details of the Bill and whether it will benefit them.  The general thrust of the legislation is welcome but I am concerned about some elements of it, which will have to be examined on Committee Stage.  We must deal with people's concerns by ensuring that the Bill's provisions are correct.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">Deputy Kennedy referred to the cap on elderly people's assets, but the cap is only on the principal private residence which, at 5% for three years, is 15%.  However, there is no cap where people have non-principal private residence assets.  There is 5% per annum for the time they are in the nursing home and it is stated that it will not exceed the cost of nursing home care.  That was not the purpose of the Bill, however.  It was to make such care affordable for people.  That provision needs to be examined.  Typically, a retired farmer may have a house and a farm.  His house may be worth less than the farmland and he may not be earning a large income.  He will be assessed on 5% per annum for three years on his house — his principal private residence — plus one acre, but he will be assessed for 5% per annum for the duration of the period he is in a nursing home.  That measure needs to be examined because it is penal.  Equally, a person's assets could be tied up in their home, which may be worth €2 million or €3 million, and would be capped at 5% for three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">My second point concerns the interest the State will apply to the time for which people are in a nursing home and the moneys advanced by the State during that period.  Schedule 2 states that moneys advanced by the executive pursuant to ancillary State support in a year shall be aggregated and the consumer price index, which relates to mid-December in that year, shall be taken to be the base figure in respect of those payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">There is an inherent flaw in that provision, however, because the consumer price index over the last ten years has, in many cases, exceeded the market interest rate.  The consumer price index could exceed the cost of borrowing money and therefore such people would be penalised.  On Committee Stage we should consider applying a charge which would be the lower of either the consumer price index or the market interest rate applying on that date.  That would be fairer and would not penalise the elderly who constitute one of the most vulnerable sections of society.  Take, for example, the issue of medical cards for over 70 year olds.  When people grow older, their two greatest worries are for their health and their savings.  Demographics have changed and it is no longer the case that the elderly can rely on their extended families.  Rather, they must go into nursing homes and, because they are living for longer, they quickly find their savings gone.  Their security vanishes in a short period.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">This Bill must ensure that nursing home care is affordable, equitable and consistent, be it public or private, so that people can feel secure.  An allowance of €36,000 for a single person or €72,000 for a married couple is available against the value of assets before liability arises under the scheme.  However, there appears to be no commitment to indexing the thresholds.  Consequently, the liability in real terms will increase with the length of care.  I hope that the value of assets will increase after the recession, but we must ensure that the exemption level is increased in line with inflation in the consumer price index, CPI.  The State will apply the CPI to the interest rate charged on the repayments under the scheme, but not to the allowance.  I hope that the Government takes this important matter on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">We must be positive and constructive concerning issues not addressed in the Bill.  Its introduction is positive, as is the Government's decision to ensure, via the Finance Bill, that the higher rate of tax relief will be given on nursing home care.  I hope that continues to be the case, but tax relief at the standard rate has been introduced on medical expenses, a model based around private medicine.  This is a penal measure.  The message from the Dáil tonight must be loud and clear, namely, taxpayers should submit their 2008 medical expenses before the end of the year to ensure that they receive relief at the higher rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">It is important that we get the scheme's details right and ensure that the cap on principal private residences is extended to other assets.  Will the Minister of State take this suggestion on board?  Our debate on agriculture is opportune.  A retired farmer and his or her spouse and family should not be penalised because their money and assets are tied up in their farm and home rather than in their home alone.  This matter must be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">People may avail of the scheme in respect of family members.  However, the Bill is vague about the method to be applied in valuing the assets of a deceased person's estate.  I assume that the method will be the same as that applied to capital acquisition tax, but the point should be clarified.  When a parent enters a nursing home, the property in question is the family home, farmland, etc.  Instead of selling an estate's assets to meet the charges, family members could reach an arrangement whereby they could save, but they would receive no tax relief on this.  It is critical that people can afford the scheme, which is resource-capped.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">Any new scheme must address the difficulties encountered in the old scheme.  Under the current scheme, the cost of nursing home care is prohibitive for those who seek it and their families, who are the ones who pay in many cases.  Like many Government schemes, the Disability Act, for example, promised needs assessments, but those measures were resource-capped.  Aspirations are great, but schemes fail if content and funding are not delivered.  For this reason, it is critical that the Bill's scheme be enacted in a form that gives the elderly and their families comfort in terms of affordability and the provision of appropriate care.  How much time have I remaining?</p>

          <p eId="para_703">I agree with the broad thrust of the Bill, but several key points must be addressed on Committee Stage.  First, we must ensure a cap on the principal private residence and other assets.  Second, the allowance of €36,000 or €72,000 should be index-linked so that people are not penalised if their assets increase in value.  Third, it is important that the lower market rate in the CPI be applied to repayments.  Fourth, proper funding should be made available to ensure that the scheme can operate.</p>

          <p eId="para_720">I am disappointed with and annoyed by the tenor of the Government amendment to the motion.  If the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, wishes to engage in a debate on the CAP health check, the proposals to take an additional 5% in modulation fees from single farm payments or his abject failure, in the aftermath of that health check, to deal with the sheep farmers who have been camped outside his Department for a number of days, I will facilitate him.  However, when I table a motion relating to disadvantaged area payments, installation aid and the early retirement scheme, I expect him either to defend the decisions he has made or, preferably, to support my call for the reintroduction of the schemes and payments to which I refer.  The lengthy Government amendment to the motion does not once refer to installation aid or the early retirement scheme.  This is typical of an Administration that makes decisions over which it is afraid to stand or for which it does not want to be accountable in the House.</p>

Banks are squeezing the life out of small businesses and multinational companies are relocating to low cost economies.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">Fine Gael is only too well aware of the difficulties facing the economy.  If confirmation in this regard is needed, people need only consult the Exchequer figures published today.  Fine Gael is also aware that difficult choices must be made, that spending must reflect value for money and that waste must be eliminated.  For many years, ours has been the lone voice on this side of the House to preach caution and frugality with taxpayers' money.  As a result of Government recklessness, probably best summarised by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, describing the €50 million wasted on e-voting machines as "small change", we will be obliged to cope with the difficulties we now face.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">The Government's ineptitude in managing the economy through the boom years is matched only by its inability to chart a clear course for recovery.  Fine Gael has published a clear and alternative budgetary strategy that gives us the scope to reverse the Government's proposals in respect of agriculture.  This strategy includes a pay freeze for those in the public sector who earn over €50,000; reform of the public sector so that the many decent people who work within that sector will have the shackles of bureaucracy removed, thereby allowing them to reach their true potential; a €1.5 billion levy on the banks; and a windfall carbon tax on energy generators.  These are but some of the alternatives Fine Gael has put forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">I recently called for rationalisation of the myriad agencies involved in policing food safety and labelling.  The Government's efforts to secure changes to our labelling legislation at EU level have met with abject failure.  At present, officials from the Departments of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Health and Children, the Health Service Executive and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and local authority staff are all employed in this area.  Savings could be made if this confusion and duplication were tackled and if responsibility for this matter lay solely with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">I wish to call for further savings in the area of laboratory services to the State.  At present, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the regional fisheries boards, the Environmental Protection Agency, local authorities and possibly others provide such laboratory services.  There should be a single State laboratory service, providing analysis and testing to these various bodies and thereby eliminating the duplication that leads to a substantial cost for the taxpayer.  My proposal in this regard does not include hospital-based laboratory services.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">Farmers have never shirked their patriotic duty.  However, their steadfastness in this regard should not be confused with their being a soft touch in the context of attempts to shore up the position following the Government's mismanagement of the public finances.  No other sector has been asked to accept cuts of the magnitude envisaged in respect of agriculture.  It is typical of the budget that the most vulnerable in the farming community are being targeted.  I refer here to young farmers in need of assistance, their older counterparts seeking to avail of the early retirement scheme and those eking out a living on marginal land in marginal enterprises.  Is this surprising?  No.  It has all the hallmarks of a Government that tried to take medical cards from those over 70 years of age, to take entitlements from those with disabilities who are over 16 years of age and which denies 12 year old girls life-saving cancer vaccinations.  Farmers will shoulder their fair share of the pain — no more and no less.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">Those in farming currently face enormous challenges.  World Trade Organisation negotiations again loom large on the horizon.  Conflicting signals from Europe regarding the true value of food security and the highest standards of production and environmental care make it imperative that we attract the best and brightest into our agriculture industry.  In such challenging times, the Government, at the stroke of a pen, suspended the scheme of installation aid.  At the same time, this Administration and its agencies are travelling the globe and seeking to attract foreign inward investment at a multiple of the cost per job that obtains in respect of the scheme of installation aid.  What signal does this send to the industry and, in particular, to those students who flocked to our agricultural colleges in recent years?  The signal it sends is that they are second class citizens and that we value jobs in industry more than those in agriculture.  Shame on the Minister for turning his back on our indigenous sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">I previously referred to the likelihood of a successful legal challenge, based on the principle of legitimate expectation, to the decision to suspend the scheme.  I predict that this suspension will be successfully challenged in the courts and will end up costing the State more than the meagre cost — in the region of €4.3 million — of restoring the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">People in farming are crying out for a resolution.  Some 8% of farm holdings are owned or managed by those under 35 years of age.  There is a definite need for new blood during this most challenging time for agriculture.  One of my constituents, an elderly gentleman farmer, died earlier this year.  His son, who had completed his green certificate, gave up a well-paid job outside the agriculture sector to take over the family farm.  The elderly individual had, before his death and under the farm waste management scheme, embarked on a major development of his property.  He had received approval for this and it is hoped the work will be completed before the end of December.  Farmers in Northern Ireland will not be obliged to complete works by that date because they obtained an extension.  Such an extension was never sought for farmers in this jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">Due to the fact that matters relating to the transfer of ownership of the farm holding to which I refer have been delayed by probate, the late farmer's wife will no longer be entitled to early retirement scheme payments and her son will not receive payments under the scheme of installation aid.  This is notwithstanding the fact that much of the investment made in the farm was contingent upon the funding they hoped to secure under these schemes.  What does the Minister propose to do in respect of this and the many similar cases that have been documented by the IFA, Macra na Feirme and other organisations, details in respect of which have been presented to the Department?</p>
          <p eId="para_731">In conjunction with stamp duty exemption and installation aid, the scheme of early retirement was the third policy initiative to encourage land mobility.  This scheme is co-funded by Europe and is, in the case of most farm families, inextricably linked with installation aid.  All over the country family farm settlements, retirement plans, financial planning for dependant children — years of careful planning — have been thrown into disarray for the sake of a meagre €9.3 million.  What does "suspend" mean?  When will the scheme be reinstated?  What is to become of those "installed" on their farms in the interim and who may remain so installed for more than 12 months before the scheme is reinstated?  Will they be disqualified from benefit?  What of those who lose out under the ten year provision of the early retirement scheme?  Will they be compensated at the other end by access to the early retirement scheme post-66 years of age?  At a time when a cloud of uncertainty hangs over the industry from the World Trade negotiations, and from Europe, it is totally unacceptable to have uncertainty on such critical matters fuelled by one's own Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">The suspension of both of these schemes at such a critical juncture in our economic history clearly highlights the Government's thinking on the capacity of the sector to contribute to revitalising the economy.  On the contrary, we in Fine Gael believe that now is the time to realise the true potential of our greatest indigenous industry.  Now is the time to recognise that this is an industry for the long haul, contributing both socially and economically, and whose true potential in terms of the food industry has never been truly recognised and exploited.  It is a time for investment, research, development and marketing.  It is not a time for a Minister in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to be "doing time".</p>
          <p eId="para_733">Since the budget, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has repeatedly used the line of scarce resources and of focusing investment on the "productive capacity of the agri-food sector".  It is clear that this statement, in the context of disadvantage area payments, is a watershed in Fianna Fáil policy on agriculture.  Through this savage cutback, up to 15% of total income in some cases, and worse when coupled with the slashing of payments under the suckler cow scheme, Fianna Fáil is turning its back on farmers on marginal lands engaged primarily in the sheep and cattle business, which are themselves marginal enterprises.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">Beef farmers in the west with suckler cow herds are the suppliers of cattle to those on better lands and involved in the cattle finishing business.  This cutback will drive existing part-time farmers out of business and drive those struggling to remain full-time in the business to seek off-farm employment to supplement their incomes.  In today's climate, where are they to go for off-farm incomes?  What will happen in reality is that these farmers will turn to the State and the farm assist payment.  It would be far better to spend that money under the disadvantaged areas payment scheme.  This cutback will affect 35,000 farmers, many of them in the west and many of whom have been Fianna Fáil supporters since the foundation of the State.  Fianna Fáil is showing clear signs of a party too long in power, too far removed from reality and too arrogant to listen to ordinary people.</p>

          <p eId="para_735">I am disappointed with the representation of Members on the other side of the House.  I would like to know where are all the Members opposite.  Are they hiding or cowering somewhere rather than facing the music?</p>
          <p eId="para_736">This is practically the only parliamentary instrument available to the Opposition to apply pressure on the Government.  Contrary to the view of some Government backbenchers, people will note how they vote tomorrow evening.  I have no doubt about that.  I have said previously to the Minister that if he intends to close down agriculture, he should not do so all at once.  The Minister should give the primary producers, farmers, a fighting chance of survival until such time as a person with some understanding of the industry comes along.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">There are no better farmers worldwide than Irish farmers.  I am proud to count myself in that category.  It gives me no pleasure to state that the Minister, his officials and personal staff are out of touch with the needs of the industry.  Sheep farmers are maintaining a vigil outside the Minister's office for a reason, namely, the Minister needs to make a decision.  I am hopeful he will make the right decision.  The German Minister made the decision to support Germany's dairy farmers immediately following health check.  The Minister, if he has the will, can do the same for sheep farmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">There must be hope for the thousands of farmers following the health check.  These released funds must be used to soften the Government's crazy, ill-informed, poorly judged budget proposals.  It appears to me that the Minister, through these cumulative cuts, is seeking to rationalise the sector and to force small-medium producers out of business.  Those producers are my friends and my neighbours and the friends and neighbours of my colleagues on this side of the House and of those who sit behind the Minister.  Fine Gael will not stand for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">Funding for the disadvantaged areas scheme is down 20%.  These farmers, who work on the most marginal lands in the country, eke out a living in areas where nobody else would, based on their ingrained knowledge of their land and property.  What the Minister has done to these farmers is, in agricultural terms, akin to the removal of medical cards from the elderly.  I can only describe the suspension of installation aid on retirement as, to use a term previously used, eating one's own seed potatoes.  Young vibrant farmers wishing to enter the profession are being penalised.</p>

          <p eId="para_741">How much money will it save — €8 million?  The farming sector has been the last refuge of construction for months.  Every penny being paid out in grant aid was being matched by the farming sector.  The cost to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food of employing staff in this area is €75,000.  When will we see genuine reform rather than protectionism within that Department?  I am not speaking of a witch hunt of excellent staff, but of officials who seek obscure European directives in order to create work.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">The disconnect is apparent.  I am speaking not only as a Deputy or a person living in rural Ireland, but as a farmer.  There is little engagement, no understanding and no instinct as to what is the correct direction for the agricultural sector.  What we need now is a general rather than a corporal taking instruction from his staff.</p>

          <p eId="para_743">In the short time available to me, I wish to speak about young farmers, the men and women who entered into farming having taken the courageous step of sacrificing university careers on the basis that there was a future for them in the sector.  Many of these young farmers who have taken up the early retirement scheme and are hopeful the installation aid scheme will be reinstated, now feel trapped.  There is no incentivisation of farming for young people and there is an absolute logjam in terms of a conduit for farmers to enter the sector.  Many young people who are half way through or have only two months remaining of their course in relation to the installation and early retirement schemes have been cast aside.  The Minister has an opportunity to address this situation.  Even if his colleagues vote against the motion tomorrow night, he can still do something in regard to the course for the installation and early retirement schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">Other issues arise in respect of hill-farming.  I represent an area with a vast acreage of hill farmers.  Currently, the payment under the ewe maintenance scheme is €30 with an extra payment for hill farming.  The Minister can do something in this area.  These are but two specific issues which I would like the Minister to address.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">Farmers have bought into the idea of cross-compliance and believed they would receive extra money for quality stock, be it ewes or animals.  That has not happened.  The current system is not working.  While there is much talk about food security on a global scale, we must examine security at a local level.  People are going on solo runs and setting up their own farm enterprises and using them to source food locally.</p>

One need only drive up the M1 on a Monday morning to see all the Tesco lorries heading North, which cannot cope with the demand for products.  People in their purchases are following the cheaper priced products, but we have an opportunity to assist farmers to set up alternative enterprises.  There is a need to start sourcing foods locally and to start incentivising farming for the future because the psychology prevailing currently is that young farmers will not enter farming.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Creed, on tabling this motion.  He emphasised the psychology prevailing in farming among young people.  At present there is no motivation to encourage them to take up farming.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_749">All types and aspects of Irish farming seem to be in crisis.  Sheep farmers are in serious trouble.  That is the reason farmers are protesting outside the Minister's Department.  I understand this matter could be easily solved by a simple announcement from him as to when he will pay the money from Brussels that is there for these farmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">Beef prices are falling.  Most beef farmers are no longer making an economic living.  Their investment and expenditure far exceed their income.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">Milk prices are set to collapse in 2009.  The spike is gone and the trough is approaching.  Some people predict a price reduction of between of 10 cent and 20 cent a litre in 2009.  At present Kerry Co-Operative pays farmers 32 cent per litre, which is far ahead of the price per litre paid by most other co-operatives.  It is predicted by those working at the coalface that there will be a reduction in milk prices of 10 cent or 20 cent a litre.  If that happens, it will no longer be economic for farmers to engage in milk production — that is the bottom line.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">We will be tabling a motion on the fodder crisis after Christmas.  That crisis is looming.  Farmers had cattle in over the summer and now they do not have enough fodder.  In many cases they only have enough until February.  We had a fodder crisis a few years ago.  In counties like Kerry we were able to bring in beet pulp and straw and use our own maize.  This year we produced about 500 hectares of maize in County Kerry, most of which was of poor quality.  We face a major fodder crisis.  That is the reason it is important to reverse the decision on disadvantaged areas especially, which will cost a county like Kerry, according to the IFA's estimate, almost €3 million or, an average, €956 per farmer.  Therefore, it is a serious crisis.  The Minister is probably batting on his own in his Department.  He was always very much in support of agriculture.  He is probably on his own there in that respect, but he will have to exert all the pressure he can to save Irish farming.</p>

          <from>Deputy Dan Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_753">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  One of the decisions the Minister made on the disadvantaged areas scheme has had a severe impact on large areas of my constituency. The far east and far west of my constituency are disadvantaged and the farming there is marginal.  The disadvantaged areas scheme was a vital part of the income of farmers in those areas.  Farming activity in those areas has changed dramatically in recent decades.  The introduction of the disadvantaged areas scheme was hard fought and successfully campaigned for and it is not acceptable that it is being reduced by 14% or €36.6 million.  The Minister will have to revisit that decision and respond to the 40,000 farmers who will be affected by it.  These are all farmers who have low incomes and are the most vulnerable in terms of the impact of this cut on their incomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">I agree with my colleagues regarding the installation aid scheme, one of the schemes that encouraged the continuity of farming within families.  Young people taking up farming and the continuity of the farm family unit is an issue that has been raised repeatedly.  Hitting farm families by removing the early retirement scheme which enabled farmers to retire and by removing the incentive for young people to take up farming will have a negative impact.  It indicates a lack of confidence by the Minister to encourage the next generation to participate in one of our vital industries.  To direct cuts in this area is unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">The issue affecting sheep farmers was raised by my colleague, Deputy Deenihan.  I call on the Minister to re-affirm his previous commitment to introduce a sheep maintenance payment from the unused Common Agricultural Policy funds.  Sheep farmers feel they have been badly let down by the Government and have lost confidence in it.  The Minister can reverse their thinking at a cheap cost.  There is anger and frustration among sheep farmers over the Minister's foot-dragging on this issue.  He might when replying announce a sheep maintenance payment of €20 per ewe.</p>

          <from>Deputy John O’Mahony</from>
          <p eId="para_756">I am glad to put on the record my support for this motion.  Having attended many meetings since the announcement of the budget and having listened at length to the cry for help from our farming community, it is imperative that their plight be listened to and acted upon by the Minister.  To remove the support systems for our young farmers when they are needed more than ever in the history of the State is an incredible and insensitive decision.  The Minister tells us they are merely suspended and will be restored in better times.  It is now they are needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">The young farmer's installation aid would provide ready-made jobs for our young people in rural areas if they had the support of the €1,500 grant.  Not only was the scheme axed but applicants, who had almost finalised the process and fulfilled all the requirements, found themselves dramatically cut off at 5 p.m. on the evening of the budget.  We hear every day of jobs being lost throughout the country.  Farming is the one industry that has withstood downturn after downturn over the years but it needs the Minister's help now.  The average number of applications for this scheme is 800 per annum at a cost of €7 million or €8,750 per young farmer.  The rest of the cost would be met by Europe.  I suggest to the Minister that these 800 jobs would come at a much cheaper cost to the country than the millions paid to attract industrial employment.</p>

          <p eId="para_759">It must be remembered that the option of employment outside farming is non-existent now, as it was a number of years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">The axing of the early retirement scheme is also hard to understand when many older farmers wish to pass on their family farm but are now unable to do so with support.  It is another attack on older people who have worked tirelessly, all hours of the day, seven days a week for years and do not feel there is any appreciation for their dedication and commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">The cuts in the disadvantaged area payment scheme are another body blow to the smallest and weakest farmers.  In my constituency of Mayo, farmers on the maximum 45 hectare limit will lose €1,300 per year.  It affects 3,163 farmers in Mayo.  If that loss is added to the cutback in the suckler cow welfare scheme, the average farmer in Mayo will be at a loss of €2,500.  My county has 5,522 applicants for the suckler cow welfare scheme, the highest in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">The budget, instead of giving incentives to continue in or take up farming, is discouraging and shutting down farming as a career in rural Ireland.  The sheep sector was also promised support and assistance but none has been forthcoming, as we can see from the ongoing protest down the road outside the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food since 26 November.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">I join Deputy Neville in asking the Minister to live up to previous commitments he gave when he promised an EU single payment in Tullamore a few weeks ago and announced a €20 per ewe maintenance grant.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">I appeal to the Minister to think again about the effects the implementation of these savage cuts will have on farmers.  I appeal to each Deputy on the Government side when they come into this House tomorrow night to use this last opportunity to support an industry that has been the bedrock of this country since the foundation of the State.</p>

          <p eId="para_765">The Minister and the Government make much of the current international economic situation.  We have had the call for patriotic duty and the standing ovation, but if there is one truism about this budget, it is that the Taoiseach, his Minister for Finance and the Government have made a complete hash of things.  They have failed to deal with the fundamentals that would position the economy on a sounder footing.  The rush to budget action in October has been shown up as ill conceived.  One would be hard pressed to find nastier cuts than those to the young farmer's installation aid scheme and the early retirement scheme.  I remind the House, that the Government was not tardy in providing full pension cover for a colleague when the issue had apparently been overlooked.  How can a Government have the authority to then say to people we are all in this together when it acts in a such a manner?</p>
          <p eId="para_766">I understand approximately 500 applicants are caught out by the suspension of the young farmer's installation aid scheme.  I have received a number of representations on the matter.  One young Clare farmer in particular comes to mind.  The young man to whom I refer has spent the past 12 months trying to transfer his land.  Through no fault of his own he found it difficult to find land to rent in his area.  He managed to do that on the Sunday before the budget and had made an appointment to meet with his local agricultural adviser for the following Friday.  The case involved both installation aid and early retirement.  He learned on budget day that the early retirement and installation aid schemes were to be suspended by midnight that night.  There was no time for those involved in the process to conclude their business.  The case to which I refer is replicated around the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">For the first time in years agricultural colleges have increased their numbers and then the Government removed the only incentive there is to keep people on the land.  If it is good enough for a former Minister to receive retrospective attention to his pension details, then it should be good enough for everybody else.</p>

Those are honest, hardworking people that were never caught up in the madness that was the Celtic tiger yet the Government is doing a slash and burn on their futures.  The proposed changes in the disadvantaged area payment will hit 2,406 farmers in County Clare.  In targeting the disadvantaged payment the Minister is hitting the weakest section, those with the worst land, who badly need the money that he is taking out of their pockets.

          <p eId="para_770">I thank my colleague, Deputy Creed, for tabling this important motion, which was necessitated by the extraordinary cutbacks imposed on the already hard hit agricultural sector.  The Minister's actions are set to impact adversely on the viability and sustainability of rural Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">Shame on the Minister for the way he has treated farmers, especially those in the sheep sector who have been protesting outside the Department for the past week for their due entitlements that were promised by the Government.  Strangely, but perhaps it was indicative of his state of mind in October last when announcing the budget cutbacks, the Minister described them as "strategic and targeted".  If by that he meant measures aimed at a sector that his predecessor brought to its knees and targeted at the least able to sustain the attack, I suppose he was right.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">I hope the Minister had an extremely uncomfortable and embarrassing meeting with the EU Council of Ministers the week before last when rural development and investment aid for young farmers was under discussion.  Young farmers in other states will qualify for a boost of €70,000 while aspiring Irish farmers will have to make do without even the Minister's Scrooge-like version, a once-off payment of €15,000 for installation aid, as that has been axed in budget 2009.  In his wisdom the Minister proclaimed that our young farmers could do without it.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">At a time when it is imperative to attract young, well-educated and highly trained farmers into the industry, the Minister has shamefully and short-sightedly cut this important aid package.  Providing the best possible education and set up opportunities for young farmers is the key to giving agriculture a competitive edge.  I call on the Minister to reverse his cynical decision to penalise those young people who would do so much to inject new ideas and enthusiasm into a sector that is demoralised by Government mismanagement of hard-pressed taxpayers' money and hard hit by bureaucracy and red tape.  The knock-on effect of the cutback will be increased emigration from rural areas, resulting in a return to the days when parishes were decimated and could not field a football team.  Instead of looking to modernise the farming sector the Minister is dragging it backwards to the 1980s.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">I represent the constituency of Longford-Westmeath, which is part of the disadvantaged Border, midlands and west, BMW, region and I am shocked by the cutbacks to the disadvantaged areas scheme.  The loss of €1,055 as a result of the budget may be small change to the Minister but it is the difference for many in the farming sector between survival or being driven off the land.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">I call on the Minister to reverse his decision.  It is within his gift to do that and to reallocate the increased funds diverted from the single farm payments in order to restore installation aid, the farm retirement scheme and the disadvantaged areas scheme.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seymour Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_780">I welcome my colleagues in the farm organisations in the Gallery.  I thank Deputy Creed for giving us the opportunity to say a few words on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">The Minister and I were elected to the Dáil 16 years ago last week.  Let us consider what has happened in the meantime.  Ordinary family pig farms are closed.  Mushroom units across our constituency are closed.  Poultry units are under pressure from imports and poultry production and processing are under constant pressure from scrutiny that no other sector has to endure.  Those who send their product to this country do not even have to label it.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">The one thing both the Minister and I fought for was to have the complete constituency of Cavan-Monaghan declared as severely disadvantaged.  That took some of us a long time yet the Minister curtailed the benefit from disadvantaged area status that goes to those counties.  He must be proud.  Let us think of the message it is sending to Brussels that the Minister would use the first opportunity to disadvantage those disadvantaged farm families at a time when we are trying to get funding from them.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">The Minister also cut installation aid and the farm retirement scheme, the two methods that allowed farmers to transfer farms to young farmers.  I accept that in recent years those schemes may not have been as important and the numbers may have been low because there were opportunities outside farming, but that is no longer the case and more students than ever are in agricultural colleges because they thought they had a future in farming yet the Minister took that away from them.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">I listened with interest to the Minister on local and national radio trying to defend the indefensible.  One of the points he consistently made was that great grants were given for the farm waste management scheme.  When that scheme was introduced I asked his predecessor whether she had provided sufficient funding and she made a joke of it and said that money was not a problem.  Because of the money the Government has wasted in all kinds of areas we have gone from a €6 billion surplus two years ago to a deficit of almost €15 billion.  In spite of this, the Minister is trying to blame the farmers who participated in the waste management scheme, as they were forced to do, for using up the money and he is asking disadvantaged farmers to foot the bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">It is not the Government that is paying for the farm waste management scheme but farmers in disadvantaged areas.  They are being asked to make up the shortfall in the budget because the Government has squandered the money.  Shame on the Minister.  I worked with him to have the disadvantaged areas scheme apply to Cavan-Monaghan, yet he is the very person who is removing that benefit from the farmers of that region.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_792">record funding of €355 million is being provided for REPS in 2009, including a 17% increase in REPS 4 payments;</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_794">€220 million will be paid in disadvantaged area scheme payments in 2009, bringing to €2.3 billion the amount paid under this scheme to Irish farmers this decade; and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_795">the CAP Health Check represents an excellent outcome for Irish farmers that:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_796">will deliver €170 million for Irish farmers over the next five years, including €100 million in additional milk production;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_797">ensures that the key market management mechanisms, which are very important to Ireland, have been left completely unchanged, including intervention schemes for butter and skimmed milk powder;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_798">secures access to previously unused EU funds that will provide over €70 million over four years in additional money that will go directly into the pockets of Irish farmers; and</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_803">acknowledges:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_804">the contribution that the Irish agrifood and drink sector makes to the Irish economy, accounting for 9.7% of exports, worth an estimated €9.2 billion, and 8.2% of total employment and that generated an operating surplus in 2007 of €2.6 billion; and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_805">the Government's continuing commitment to, support for and development of this most important indigenous sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">It is now almost two months since the budget.  There have been some very significant developments since then and more are on the horizon that will have an impact on Irish agriculture.  These developments present both challenges and, more important, opportunities for Irish farmers and the agrifood sector.  The sector operates in a dynamic, ever-evolving environment that requires flexibility and an ability to adapt to change.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">Significantly, the Council of Agriculture Ministers recently concluded negotiations on the CAP health check, which represents a very successful outcome for Irish farmers.  Only last Friday, I was in Brussels for a wide-ranging discussion on the future of the CAP after 2013 and I emphasised my strongly held view that there will be a continuing need for an active and appropriately resourced European agricultural policy to achieve the European Union's policy objectives for the agriculture and food sector and to help our farmers and processors to adapt to the new and emerging challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">The circumstances that applied at the time of the budget demanded that the Government address the sharp deterioration in the public finances and we have chosen a direction that is not based on soft options, quick fixes or political expediency.  The choices we make will determine whether we can maintain, to the greatest possible extent, the economic progress we have achieved in the last decade.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">There were times in the post-budget debate when some people seem to have forgotten the basic fiscal fundamentals.  The economic outlook is such that we have less money to meet growing public expenditure demands.  We cannot borrow our way out of trouble or return to the days of punitive tax rates that stifled economic growth and resulted in high unemployment.  Our day-to-day expenditure next year will exceed revenue by €4.7 billion, equating to over €1,000 for every man, woman and child.  We cannot and will not return to the days of the budgetary management we experienced in the 1980s.  Given the resources available to me, I had to make choices and identify priorities for 2009.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_815">This meant having to make difficult decisions but I am satisfied that, in the circumstances, I made the right ones.  Given some of the reactions to the budget measures I announced, one would be easily excused for forgetting that my Department will be spending €3.26 billion in support of Irish agriculture, fisheries, food and forestry in 2009.  This expenditure ensures that record funding of €355 million will be provided for REPS, which represents a 7% increase in overall funding and a 17% increase in payments under REPS 4.  Less than four years ago, the yearly allocation for REPS was €209 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">Next year's level of spending will ensure that the commitment, entered into in the partnership agreement, to provide €250 million over five years for the suckler cow welfare scheme will be honoured in full.  To suggest anything other than that this commitment is being honoured is inaccurate.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">Earlier this week, I read claims that 12,000 farmers will take a hit on their suckler payment.  I do not accept this as the suckler payment is a new stream of income for farmers, the first payments only having been made in the past few weeks.  Some €33 million will have been paid before the end of this month and a further €44 million will be paid in the early months of 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">Regrettably, it is the case that I had to reduce expenditure on the disadvantaged areas scheme, but I do not accept some claims about the extent of the impact of that decision on overall farm incomes.  I remind the House that the Irish disadvantaged areas scheme is one of the best-resourced in the European Union.  Its payments comprise national and EU funding.  Two thirds of disadvantaged area payment recipients will experience no reduction in their payments.  I consciously protected the smaller-scale farmers by ensuring that no farmer with less than 34 hectares, or 84 acres, will have his payment reduced.</p>

          <p eId="para_855">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">The Government is also investing significantly in the dairy processing industry, through the dairy investment fund, to ensure it will have the capacity to process the increased yield I believe dairy farmers will be more than capable of producing.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">I had identified the maintenance of market supports as a particular priority given Ireland's seasonal pattern of production.  Despite significant opposition, I secured agreement to the retention of intervention for butter and skimmed milk powder, without losing the compulsory purchase at the intervention price of the first 30,000 tonnes of butter and 109,000 tonnes of skimmed milk powder.  Coupled with the retention of private storage aid for butter, in its current form, this was a very significant achievement.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">A further priority of mine was to secure national discretion for the operation of specific supports funded from the single payment ceiling.  I am particularly pleased that we succeeded in this aim.  I was one of the first to press for this initiative and the deal agreed means that a minimum of around €23 million in new money will be available to Irish farmers from 2010, with a much smaller amount available in 2009.  I invited the farm organisations to meet me later this month to discuss how best this new money can be used and a date for that meeting has now been fixed.  Although I think it important to get the views of the stakeholders, I do not intend this to be a lengthy process and I expect to be in a position to come to an early decision following the forthcoming meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">I have previously expressed my concern for the sheep sector in particular and have repeatedly acknowledged that this sector needs support, given its importance.  I am particularly conscious of the decline in production in recent years and of decline in demand this year.  My position in respect of the sheep sector has been consistent and remains exactly as I outlined it at a European sheep conference last September and, more recently, when I addressed the sheep farmers conference organised by the Irish Farmers Association in Tullamore.  On that occasion I said I wanted to ensure that the changes in the health check initiative will open the possibility for some useful action in the sheep sector.</p>

          <p eId="para_864">Despite claims to the contrary, I have not backed away from any commitments to sheep farmers.  The sector remains a priority and is one that needs assistance.  I have no doubt that proposals to support the sheep sector will form a central part of the discussions to which I have invited the farm organisations later this month.  I look forward to that dialogue and to constructive discussion and will give full consideration to the proposals made, including those that have been publicly articulated recently.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">Having concluded agreement on the Common Agricultural Policy health check, the Agriculture Council met only last Friday for an initial consideration of the CAP post-2013.  I restated my firm conviction that Europe needs a strong agricultural production base and outlined my concerns that any reduction in food production in the EU would be taken up elsewhere where less efficient production systems exist.  This would result in a heavier carbon footprint.  I emphasised the continuing need for an active and appropriately resourced European agricultural policy to achieve the EU's objectives for the agrifood sector and to help Irish and European farmers and processors adapt to the new and demanding emerging challenges.  I also stressed the need for effective rural development programmes which play a key role in regional development and in the protection of the environment and stated the critical importance of having equivalent standards for imports from outside the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">Improved animal health standards continue to be very important generally and, more specifically, for farmers and the livestock industry.  Consequently, I am very pleased to be in a position to say that considerable progress has been made in dealing with two important diseases that have had a significant impact here in the last decade, namely, BSE and brucellosis.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">BSE has been a particular priority of mine and also of my predecessor, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Coughlan.  We wished to have the age for BSE testing raised significantly. I have long been of the view that the current testing requirements, which are fixed at EU level, are excessive.  One of the first things I did when I became Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was to write to the EU Commissioner to press her to increase the age for BSE testing as a priority matter.  I am very pleased that the Commission has now agreed to raise the age for testing to 48 months from early next year.  The new arrangements will mean 400,000 fewer BSE tests on cattle, resulting in a significant saving, a minimum of €8m a year, for farmers and the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">Excellent progress has been made on brucellosis in recent years.  From a situation where recently we had more than 1,000 herd breakdowns in a single year, there have been no confirmed outbreaks of brucellosis in Ireland since April 2006.  This is most welcome progress and it enables me to apply to the EU for an official brucellosis-free status for Ireland early next year.  The progress made is due to a number of factors, not least the full co-operation of all stakeholders with the eradication regime.  This included comprehensive testing, depopulation and other arrangements.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_870">Securing an official brucellosis-free status for Ireland will enable me to reduce some of the control elements of the eradication programme.  This will bring consequential benefits for farmers, particularly with regard to trade. In addition, it will be possible to bring about a gradual reduction in the level of testing that will, over time, lead to reduced testing and lower costs for farmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">However, we must take a cautious approach in view of the current disease situation north of the Border.  Accordingly, I envisage a controlled reduction in the programme over a period of years, based on risk assessment, following the achievement of disease-free status for the country.  My Department is engaged in consultations with the farm organisations and other stakeholders with a view to finalising the scaling down of the programme over the next few years.  I believe that achieving official brucellosis-free status would be a landmark in the history of disease eradication in Ireland and I am grateful for the co-operation of all of the parties who have contributed to the success to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">I was particularly pleased that I was in a position last week to announce interim arrangements to facilitate progress on the proposed industry-led herd health initiative.  Among other things, this involves the establishment of a dedicated, industry-led, national co-ordinating body to be known as Animal Health Ireland and it delivers on another of the important commitments in the programme for Government.  It is envisaged that this body will operate as a partnership between industry, service providers and Government.  It will have two broad aims.  The first is to determine and, on an industry-wide basis, obtain agreement on a range of animal health interventions capable of enhancing on-farm productivity and the competitiveness of the livestock industry in international markets.  The second is to develop and co-ordinate the national infrastructure that will be needed to enable industry at all levels to take appropriate and effective action.  I look forward to the co-operation of all the stakeholders with regard to that particular initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">My Department will spend €3.26 billion next year in support of a sector which, according to the most recent figures, accounts for almost 10% of the country's exports and over 8% of employment.  In 2007, Irish agrifood and drink exports were worth an estimated €9.2 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">Budget 2009 has seen a modest reduction in expenditure and I have had to make difficult choices.  Those I made are aimed at focusing available resources on the measures that will allow us to maintain and grow the productive capacity of the agrifood sector.  The sector operates in a dynamic global environment.  To emphasise the international influences on the sector, we need only reflect on the developments since the budget, including a very favourable outcome to the recent CAP health check and the opening discussions with regard to the post-2013 situation.  I have no doubt about the need to maintain a strong agricultural production base in Europe and that will be my position and that of the Government throughout future negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">The progress made in respect of animal health this decade is now resulting in genuine benefits for farmers.  This is a tribute to the commitment of farmers to improving the health status of the Irish herd.  It recognises the disruptive and costly nature of the eradication arrangements on farmers and on my Department in terms of compensation and the substantial additional costs incurred in testing and the other economic losses that arise from the premature removal of infected cattle.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">Irish agriculture is facing challenges but is also being presented with opportunities.  I am confident of the industry's capacity to meet those challenges and to exploit the opportunities and the sector can be assured of the Government's commitment and support and that we will ensure that it meets its full potential over the next few years.</p>

          <p eId="para_878">I second the Government's amendment to the motion as set out by the Minister.  I welcome the opportunity to partake in the debate as a Deputy representing a rural constituency, along with my colleague on the Fine Gael side, Deputy Dan Neville.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">I acknowledge the considerable contribution to the economy made by the 132,000 farm families, on an ongoing basis, and also that of the many thousands of other people who derive their livelihood indirectly from the agri-sector.  Last week we spoke about small and medium enterprises and in that vein we emphasised the role of banking.  Banking has significant input into farming because farm families run businesses.  I reiterate the call I made last week to the banking sector to adopt a more flexible approach to farm enterprises.  I welcome the announcement by Bank of Ireland of a €250 million fund and the further announcement by Royal Bank of Scotland that it will allocate €1 billion to make credit available.  This credit must be extended to the farm sector.  I call again on the banks to produce a strategy statement to deal with the agricultural sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">Recently I met a number of representatives from the IFA and the ICMSA as many other Deputies must do.  I asked them how, apart from all the other issues, we can help them on a day to day basis.  A common theme that emerged concerned how farmers can realise their assets through the sale of sites.  All Deputies from different parties can bring this to fruition.  Local authorities have tended to limit the number of sites being sold and put on the open market, particularly those owned by farmers.  Dealing with this issue would allow farm families to realise their assets and would also provide the kick-start to the construction sector that is so badly needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">I refer, in particular, to the sterilisation of land which planning authorities are inflicting on many farm families.  Sustainable rural house guidelines refer to this.</p>

Certain arrangements under this section, more commonly known as sterilisation agreements, have been used on occasion by planning authorities to regulate development in rural areas.  In areas where significant levels of rural housing development have taken place on the edges of cities and towns, such areas may tend to become over-developed.</p>

          <p eId="para_902">Deputy Crawford has had his opportunity, and I did not interrupt Deputy Bannon.  The budget and Finance Bill extend a number of tax reliefs that are of specific benefit to the agri-sector, worth €65 million per annum.  I am delighted that the REP scheme will continue in order to ensure it can continue to accommodate farmers wishing to join in 2009.  The REPS  allocation for 2009 will be increased to €355 million.  In the partnership talks, the Government made a commitment to spend €250 million on the suckler welfare scheme.  This, I am assured, by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, will be fully honoured, a point which the Department reiterated in the print media recently.  It is incorrect to state that this is being lost to farmers as it is a new stream of income.</p>
          <p eId="para_903">My Cavan-Monaghan constituency colleague, the Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, is presented with most challenging times.  The public financial situation had obvious adverse implications for expenditure across all Departments and difficult decisions had to be made in the best interests of the country.  While some of these may seem unpalatable now, neither were they popular in the 1987 budget.  However, a tough budget is needed to realign Ireland's path into the future if we are to find a solution after all the international financial and banking turmoil has settled, which could take longer than many had envisaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_904">The developments post-budget 2009 present challenges and, more important, opportunities, for farmers and the agri-food sector.  The sector operates in a dynamic, fluid environment that requires a flexibility, willingness and capability to change.  The Government is also investing significantly in the dairy processing industry, through the dairy investment fund, to ensure it has the capacity and ability to process the increased production I believe dairy farmers will be more than capable of producing.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">In conclusion, the Minister, Deputy Smith, posed the question tonight as to whether anybody would have thanked us had we eschewed our duty and abandoned long-term responsibility in favour of short-term populism.</p>

Finally, if we return to the days of crazy budgetary management, what will our children think of how we performed as legislators at this time?  Should we have taken the easy option or the tough unpopular ones?

I want to tell Deputy Bannon that I am very sorry.  These have been interesting times for the agricultural sector.  The sector, like other areas, felt the chill wind of the global economic downturn.  There was some good news with the recent CAP health check, which concluded in Brussels a few weeks ago.  This represents a very good outcome for the Irish agricultural sector and will deliver €175 million over the next five years.  Milk quotas will be abolished in seven years' time.  A 2% quota increase in 2008, a 3% increase in 2009 and a 1% increase in each of the years from 2010-13 will cumulatively amount to an increase of 9% by 2014.  This is equivalent to an additional 500 million litres as compared to 2007.  Based on existing milk price values, these production rights amount to about €100 million.  I should like to compliment my friend and great colleague, the Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, on his negotiating skills in that particular deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">Agriculture has always had a major role to play in our world, and it will continue to do so.  It has a major part to play in issues such as food security, energy security and climate change.  There are still more challenges to come, but we can meet them if we work together.  Ireland has always had a dynamic agricultural sector, with deep-rooted attachment to the land.  We need to maintain this link with the land and ensure we are in a position to take advantage of any upturn in the economy.  We are living in unprecedentedly difficult economic times.  There is financial turmoil across the globe and we are facing the most severe economic depression since the period of the Wall Street crash.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">The current economic situation is extremely difficult and with massive tax shortfalls it is necessary to make significant reductions in public spending.  Very difficult choices had to be made within each Department.  As regards the disadvantaged area payments, it should be noted that more than 65,000 out of the 102,000 recipients will experience no reduction in their payments.  Participants with average sized holdings of 31 hectares will not be affected by the decision.  However, again I know the Minister wants to look at the situation as soon as possible and reinstate it.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">For the sucker welfare scheme, the commitment in the Towards 2016 partnership agreement, to provide €250 million in funding, is being honoured in full.  Regarding early retirement and installation aid, these schemes have been temporarily suspended for new entrants.  However, this situation will be reviewed, and I know the schemes are very important for the young and the elderly.  The Minister is keeping the situation under review, and hopefully the schemes will be reinstated.  We can all recall 1995, when the Proinsias De Rossa-led Democratic Left Party in government abolished the early retirement scheme and we came back into power and reinstated it.  A number of significant tax reliefs, worth €65 million annually, were extended in the budget, some of which will be of particular benefit to young farmers, notably, the young trained farmer stamp duty relief worth €53 million.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Sherlock</from>
          <p eId="para_918">I wish to begin by replying to Deputy Collins.  Not every farmer in the country wants to build houses or become a developer on his or her land-holding.  Those people are in the minority.  I remind the Deputy that the arrangements he spoke about are only guidelines and that the county development plans of each county take precedence over those guidelines.  In response to Deputy Brady, the Government in question was not a Democratic Left-led Government.  There were three parties in that particular arrangement.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">I represent a party that traditionally would not be aligned to the farming community.  However, in terms of my wholehearted supported for this motion, I can give an analysis that is unfettered and devoid of political expediency.  I do not intend to be politically expedient tonight, but to speak of the facts.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">We reside in a European Union where UK young farmers represent 5.6% of the total farming workforce and Irish young farmers represent 10.5%.  These percentages are from a report from the European Parliament issued in May 2008 and represent farmers under the age of 35.  If we are to be innovative in the manner we create jobs during the current downturn, we need to create incentives.  The only way to create incentives is to ensure that coterie of the population — the under 35s — who are interested in becoming involved in agriculture get the financial incentives to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_921">There is an economic rationale for ensuring the early retirement scheme and installation aid scheme for young farmers are maintained.  By allowing these new farmers to enter the sector, which is a productive sector and generates revenues of €8.6 billion per annum in food and drink exports about which the Minister spoke, we encourage innovation.  However, by culling the scheme, we create a disincentive.  At a time when, for example, FÁS has a budget of €1.05 billion, we have spent €48.4 billion on the indigenous sector through Enterprise Ireland and we are spending €90 million on capital expenditure for IDA Ireland, all of which is for job creation, there is a ratio of that kind of investment for every job created.  Therefore, every job created costs the economy a certain amount, a specific figure which I have not been able to ascertain.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">Therefore, by creating, allowing or facilitating the installation aid scheme and by investing in each and every one of the young farmers new to the sector, the Government is progressing the sector and creating a job, or in economic terms a multiplier effect, that ensures the rural economy will continue to be maintained.  This is a rational, objective and cold view that is devoid of any political expediency.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">These schemes are essential if we are to maintain our comparative advantage within the rural economy.  If the Government continues to remove funds from the rural economy, the rural depopulation we have witnessed, the lack of proper infrastructure and the lack of expenditure within that economy will have a further detrimental effect.  Any person who avails of a scheme such as the young farmer installation aid does not spend the money in Santa Ponsa, but invests it in his or her own farmholding, generally in a way that is innovative and will increase the yield or return to that farm.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">To return to the demographics, the bulk of farmers are within a certain age group and there is a certain wisdom that comes with that intergenerational solidarity that occurs within the sector.  However, with every new influx of blood, there comes new ideas.  We talk about issues such as carbon off-setting and the possibility of micro-energy production, but if we talk about innovative ideas, we need to ensure the incentive is there to allow young people come into the sector.  What the Minister has done by culling the scheme is to disincentivise them and that is not the way to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">I represent a rural-urban mix of a constituency.  My constituency traditionally had large agribusiness interests, but these have declined over a period of time.  There is now a real opportunity for people of my generation to come into the sector.  These people will have a farming mix that will involve energy creation and a different type of product mix that will yield benefits to the country in the long run.  Therefore, I urge the Minister to rethink the changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_926">I conclude by quoting from Macra na Feirme, which has a rational position on these issues:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_927">Macra is demanding the complete reopening of the young farmer installation aid scheme.  This scheme was agreed under the Social Partnership for 2007-2013 and is co-funded by the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">If it is a co-funded procedure devised under social partnership pillars, we must honour the agreement, just as we honour all the other pillars of the social partnership arrangement in the country.</p>

        <speech by="#MartinFerrisSF" eId="spk_431">
          <from>Deputy Martin Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_929">I thank the Labour Party for allowing me ten minutes to speak.  I fully support this motion.  I go further and say that all of the budget cutbacks in the agriculture sector should be reversed.  This would include not just the three schemes referred to, but also the suckler welfare scheme where payments are to be halved and the cuts made in Teagasc and the overall allocation for research and development.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">Within days of the budget, I was contacted by a group of 27 young farmers in Kerry who, because of the closure of the installation aid scheme, were concerned they would not be eligible for the scheme.  Some 23 of them had completed their training course in July this year.  They received their FETAC certificates just days after the budget, despite the fact they had a letter from Teagasc telling them they would have their certificates within six weeks.  The anomaly for these young people is that the delay in awarding them their certificates means their prospects are affected by the budget.  However, because of the closure of the scheme they are no longer eligible and this represents a severe and in some cases fatal blow to their hopes and prospects of beginning to farm.  I am reliably informed that 500 other young farmers in the State are in a similar predicament.  The Minister has not clarified the position in respect of these young farmers and this must be done.  They are entitled to the installation aid and should receive it.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">As I stated at the time, this represents not only a betrayal of those young farmers who entered into training courses to prepare themselves to take over the running of a farm, it also represents a cynical vote of no confidence in rural Ireland.  The stark fact is that in the absence of schemes such as installation aid, which often can be the difference between a young farmer being able to get off the ground or otherwise, many of the 23 young farmers to which I referred from my native county, as well as the 500 in other counties, will not only not proceed with their plans, but may well in the current climate also be unable to secure employment elsewhere and undoubtedly a significant proportion of them will be forced to emigrate.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">Is that the sort of message the Government wishes to send to young people in rural Ireland?  Is that all it has to offer after decades and more of economic growth?  Once matters begin to take a turn for the worse, young people in rural communities are expected to do what generations of young people in rural Ireland have done, which is to turn their back on their traditional way of life and seek work on building sites and bars in London, New York and elsewhere.  That is, if such work is available.  In present circumstances, given the downturn in the economic outlook of the traditional countries to which young people leaving rural Ireland emigrated, this opportunity no longer is open to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">The same applies to the early retirement scheme.  Together with others, I have been meeting people and getting representations from those who felt badly done by the original scheme or rather, how their situation was affected in the wake of the CAP reform and the impact it had on them.  Closing this scheme will, in the same manner as getting rid of installation aid, have both a direct impact on farmers' incomes and a negative impact on the transfer of land to younger farmers and on the future of the sector with regard to land ownership, farm innovation and consolidation.  I cannot understand how the Government would take such an irresponsible approach, given it is trying to encourage young people to stay on the land and to encourage elderly people to transfer the land to the young in order that they can continue in a traditional way of life.  I cannot understand the reason a government would take such a cynical decision and effectively wipe out both sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">It is clear from the representations I have received since the budget both from my native county and around the country that there is huge anger and disappointment with the manner in which farming and the rural economy is being treated.  This is being reflected at present in the meetings and lobbies being held around the country, including a large turnout in Ennis last Sunday, where up to 10,000 farmers and their families protested.  I was proud and honoured to attend last Sunday's meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_935">While the entire sector is affected, the impact the cuts will have on smaller farmers is particularly noticeable, as is the manner in which this is adding to an already considerable level of pessimism among small to medium farmers about the future.  Unfortunately this ties in with the feedback I have received while compiling a report for the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on the current state of and future prospects for, farming and fishing in the western counties.  While the report focuses on west Cork, Kerry, west Limerick, Clare, Galway, Roscommon, Mayo, Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal, it is of relevance to the entire country and particularly to farmers at the lower end of the income scale.  I am pleased to note that while compiling this report, I received great support from all the farming bodies and from the affected people living in rural Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">One of the most striking findings from a survey that was conducted among farmers in those counties during the summer was the level of pessimism.  Of the more than 200 farmers who took part in the survey at marts, only 23% thought their situation had improved since the introduction of the single farm payment, a further 60% believed their situation had worsened, while the remainder felt there had been no change.  That is an extremely worrying statistic and one that undermines much of the optimism that surrounded the introduction of decoupling as part of the 2003 CAP reform.  One of the reasons clearly is that the value of the single farm payment is declining by approximately 12%.  This is because it is not index-linked and, in some cases, through modulation, even though farmers on the lowest payments are exempt.  Another significant finding from the survey was that 84% believed that farmers in the west were disadvantaged in comparison with those in other parts of the country.  While some of this was attributed to the quality of land, others specifically referred to what they believed was an official neglect of the west, not simply in farming, and that the overall treatment of the rural economy was badly affecting farming and increasing the difficulties of attaining viability.</p>
          <p eId="para_937">Perhaps the most worrying aspect of the survey, however, was that only a minority of those questioned believed that they or a family member still would be involved in farming in ten years' time.  A total of 42% believed they would, 38% believed they would not and the remainder were unsure.  This suggests an even greater proportion of current farm households will be gone within the next decade than even the 23% decline by 2015 that was forecast in the Agri-Vision report.  It may, however, be a more realistic picture, given the way western farmers view their prospects and in the light of the current undermining of the sector, as represented most recently by the budget cuts.  Indeed were this survey to be conducted now, I am sure the negative responses would be far greater than they were in the summer.  This is my point.  The Government's actions regarding rural Ireland and the farming community in particular have made the position far worse than it was previously and have created far more pessimism in that sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_938">This is the reason it is crucial for the Government to take urgent measures to encourage what remains the largest single indigenous provider of livelihoods in this State, which has a major multiplier effect throughout the rest of the rural economy in stimulating activity in other areas such as construction.  However, just as investment in farming has a positive impact, so too will the withdrawal of investment and this already is apparent in the building sector in many areas.  This is particularly true given the failure to extend the waste management scheme and to permit farmers to complete planned on-farm works that would have sustained many jobs over the short term in this difficult period.</p>
          <p eId="para_939">The Government's actions have been contradicted by the commendable actions of Michelle Gildernew in the Six Counties.  The Executive there has extended the scheme for three months, where the construction of farm waste management is perceived to be credible and verifiable.  It is prepared to pay the remainder out of its own Exchequer, which is highly commendable.</p>

          <p eId="para_942">The farming sector on this island and in the Twenty-six Counties in particular, is in need of support.  It does not need to be penalised further because of the neglect of Governments present and past.  It also constitutes an attack on the most vulnerable sectors of our society.  The budget attacked the elderly, the youth and the most vulnerable sector within the farming community.  The budget cuts must be reversed in their entirety as far as the farming sector is concerned.  It is ironic that while this House passed and will support the bail-out of the banks, all the Government is doing is to penalise those who built this State and this economy, namely, the farming community and our rural communities.  This is what is taking place and that is the reason it must be reversed.</p>
          <p eId="para_943">When I spoke at Ennis last Sunday, I stated this was a human rights issue.  It is a human rights issue whereby people living on the margins on the western coast, as well as those most affected in the farming communities, are struggling to survive.</p>

I appeal to the backbenchers on the Government side of the House, to those are listening or who are meeting their constituents on a daily basis.  Throughout the rural communities on this island, Deputies were elected democratically to this House but were not elected to penalise or to cut back farm income.  They were not elected to attack the most vulnerable in our communities.  They were elected democratically to do the right thing, the just thing.  They are not doing that and I make a final appeal to the Minister to do the right thing.  Those who do not stand with the Government on that side of the House should let their voices be heard——</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary O’Rourke</from>
            <p eId="para_950">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for permission to raise this matter and the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, for coming in to deal with it.</p>
            <p eId="para_951">I wish to raise the serious position of the 1,000 to 1,200 apprentices who have been made redundant.  I do not know the exact number — perhaps the Minister of State has it in his brief but it is of that order — but the careers of these apprentices, who are awaiting their final certification, have been cut short mainly because of the economic downturn.</p>
            <p eId="para_952">This problem knows no county border.  It has occurred throughout the Twenty-six Counties.  Young men, and some young women, set out on their careers as apprentice bricklayers, carpenters, electricians etc. through which they would get final certification.  Once they had this certification  they could travel the world and get a position because our certificates are recognised and approved by the European Union and further afield.</p>
            <p eId="para_953">When we spoke here about a month ago on a similar motion on unemployment in general, I was under the impression that a scheme was just about to be put in place.  However, a month has gone by and over the past two to three weeks many parents have come to see me about their sons — sometimes about their daughters — whose careers have been cruelly cut short because the construction or electrical firm to which they were apprenticed has folded.  Through no fault of their own, the careers and training of these young apprentices have been cut short mid-stream and they are left with nothing, despite having completed up to three years' training.</p>
            <p eId="para_954">I appeal for the scheme to be altered.  The rules should be changed to allow the redundant apprentices continue their training.  The State should in some way subsidise employers to keep those young people on their books and in all instances keep the training going so that the young apprentices would be in a position to go abroad with their qualifications, if they so wish.  Many wish to go to Australia and if they had qualifications, they would get a job.  However, if they go half-baked, they will not get one.  It is important that the necessary subsidies or resources are provided to employers to retain apprentices so that they can finish their training.</p>
            <p eId="para_955">Another aspect to this matter is that the strict rules of the system must change.  Back in the early 1990s, the then Minister, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, and I brought in the new apprenticeship system which worked well in times of plenty.  However, in times of downturn, it is not working because the young guy or girl is put out of his or her training and made redundant with nowhere to turn.  I rest my case.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Jimmy Devins)</from>
            <p eId="para_956">The House will be well aware that the construction sector has continued to experience a reduction in the level of activity in 2008 compared to previous years.  In the recent past, there has been a consequential reduction in the level of employment in the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_957">The level of recruitment of apprentices by employers is also at a lower level — some 44% lower than in 2007 — and there has been an increase in the number of apprentices notified to FÁS as redundant.  The current apprenticeship population is 26,479.  Of these, 2,859 are recorded as redundant on foot of notification to FÁS.</p>
            <p eId="para_958">In response to these trends the Tánaiste and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment have been working with FÁS to put in place a number of measures in an effort to address the problems now confronting redundant apprentices, and especially those in the construction trades.</p>
            <p eId="para_959">The measures developed to date will alleviate the situation and include the following.  Through its employment services offices, FÁS is providing individual supports to redundant apprentices in their efforts to get work that will allow them to complete their apprenticeship with an approved employer.  In the absence of options for workplace experience, redundant apprentices are also now being scheduled early for their off-the-job training phase in the education sector.  This means that they do not need to do their on-the-job phase and can go directly to the next off-the-job phase.  Accordingly, there are currently 123 redundant apprentices attending phase 2 and 316 are attending phases 4 and 6.  FÁS has scheduled another 505 redundant apprentices to attend their off-the-job training phase over the next number of weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_960">Working with FÁS and other interests, the Tánaiste is in the process of finalising another initiative that should be of material benefit to apprentices in construction trades.  The key objective will be to assist such apprentices to complete their in-work training and assessment with employers so that they can move forward in their apprenticeships.  The scheme, the full details of which will be announced in the near future, will involve incentives for qualified employers to take on such apprentices over the next 12 months.  We are hopeful that in the order of 500 apprentices can be helped in this way.</p>
            <p eId="para_961">FÁS is also looking at the advantages that EU sponsored programmes that facilitate mobility for workers and apprentices can offer.  In line with the thrust of these programmes, there are possibilities for temporary placements abroad that could be of real benefit to redundant apprentices.  Separately, we will explore what other positive options might be available to assist our redundant apprentices in the short to medium term.</p>
            <p eId="para_962">FÁS is responding quickly and with flexibility to the challenge of redundant apprentices and there will be a significant announcement on this in the near future.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Upton</from>
            <p eId="para_963">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_964">Drimnagh Castle secondary school in Walkinstown is one of the most highly regarded schools in the city of Dublin.  It is also one of a small number of schools which undertook to provide the leaving certificate technology programme on a pilot basis as part of the leaving certificate programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_965">Technology was a hugely popular subject for junior certificate and five classes were taking it in that school at junior certificate level.  When it became an option for the leaving certificate, the school was pleased to be able to offer it to the students.  Some 24 students were accepted for the subject in fifth year from a total of 40 applicants.  They were literally queuing up to get on to the course but the school felt it could only provide for a class of 24 students.  Funding was approved to purchase appropriate equipment and materials to run the course adequately.  The first phase of this agreed funding was delivered to the school — so far, so good — but the school should have received the second phase at the beginning of the academic year and it is still waiting for that money to come through.  The lack of funding is making it difficult for the school to proceed with confidence with the course.</p>
            <p eId="para_966">As it stands, the school is officially only able to provide the equipment to teach at junior certificate level because of the lack of the additional funding that it requires.  It is most unfair to the students who are taking this as a leaving certificate subject.  Presumably they are depending on the subject for points in their leaving certificate and they are entitled to expect that the full service will be in place for them.  In the absence of appropriate funding, the school believes it will be more difficult to deliver the course to the standard expected and to give a fair chance to the students.</p>
            <p eId="para_967">Drimnagh Castle is one of the most highly regarded schools in Dublin.  It delivers quality teaching to its students and has an excellent academic record.  However, without the agreed funding for second phase, it will be extremely difficult to continue its popular technology programme.  That would seem to be an incredible waste of resources and effort.  The school needs to know when the second phase will be in place.  I understand that a further 15 schools are in the same situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_968">Every time we speak in this House about development, we refer to the need to promote and support science and technology.  We have put huge efforts into encouraging students to take these subjects.  We now have a situation in which students are queuing to get onto a technology course but the resources are not being put in place so that the school can guarantee the quality of teaching they have a right to expect.  I ask that the second phase of funding be delivered as agreed and without further delay.</p>

            <p eId="para_969">I thank Deputy Upton for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the position with regard to the introduction of the leaving certificate technology programme in post-primary schools.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has developed a new syllabus at leaving certificate level for technology.  Previously, this subject was only available to junior certificate level.  The subject was first introduced in a number of selected post-primary schools in September 2007 and will be examined for the first time by the State Examinations Commission in June 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_970">A technology subjects support service has been established to support schools in the implementation of the new syllabus.  The national co-ordinator is supported by a team of assistant national co-ordinators, regional development officers and associate trainers.  The introduction of this syllabus is a welcome development and will be an important element for students taking the subject to leaving certificate level.</p>
            <p eId="para_971">Fifteen additional schools were invited to introduce the leaving certificate technology syllabus in September 2008 as part of a phased implementation plan.  Drimnagh Castle secondary school was one of these 15 schools.  The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, appreciates that the school is keen to get the funding it needs to allow the full syllabus to be introduced without delay.  The implementation of a new subject in the school curriculum requires careful planning and consideration.  However, as the Deputy will appreciate, any such expansion in the curriculum can only be carried out in the context of available funding.  The Minister is pleased to confirm that the Department was recently in a position to grant aid the second phase of the introduction of leaving certificate technology to support the 15 schools which have introduced this subject.  This will allow the schools to teach this subject to students who wish to develop their skills in this very important and developing area.  Drimnagh Castle secondary school was among the schools to receive this grant aid and the Minister looks forward to the students in the school being able to pursue the syllabus to leaving certificate level.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ulick Burke</from>
            <p eId="para_976">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important issue.  Woodford Mercy College has developed a high standard in education at second level.  However, the cutbacks introduced in the budget will have a severe impact on the delivery of its educational programmes.  For the past several years, this school has had disadvantaged status but, as a consequence of the cutbacks, it will lose 3.81 teachers.  That represents a severe blow to a school with a staff of 24 teachers.  The cuts to the school's funding will total more than €20,000 per annum.  As the school's intake dipped slightly for the academic year 2007-08, it faces the loss of an additional 1.8 teachers.  In total, the school will lose 5.4 teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_977">Despite building up a strong reputation, the school experienced problems last year in retaining its home-school liaison teacher.  The Department ultimately agreed to fund this teacher but the money is now gone.  Some 30 of the school's 230 students receive individual support for special needs of one kind or another.  When the Minister for Education and Science recently addressed the Joint Committee on Education and Science, he agreed to give special attention to schools which are experiencing serious hardships as a result of the cutbacks.  The school will lose a book grant worth €5,140, a transition year grant of €3,500, an LCA grant worth €1,431, an enhanced capitation grant of €8,493, a special subjects grant worth €1,417 and a home economics grant worth €4,119, for a total of more than €20,000.  This school has developed various fundraising activities in order to maintain its quality of education but this is a step too far.  The Minister should give his attention to the serious crisis the school will face from September 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_978">Like other schools, substitute teaching will become a serious problem for this school from January.  The school's teachers have gone to tremendous efforts to develop debating and dramatic activities.  Despite coming from a small rural school, the students and teachers have excelled in these areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_979">The school is located in a CLÁR area.  I cannot express the serious consequences the loss of 5.4 teachers would bring.  The school will not be able to perform at the levels it achieved in the past nor will it be able to give a fair chance to students who want to attend third level education.  In view of this I repeat my plea to request the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, to re-examine this case because the school has lost its disadvantaged status.  There is a blip in the numbers this year and the school will suffer severely as a consequence.  No Minister or Government should allow this to take effect from January and leading to the academic year beginning in September 2009.</p>

            <from>Deputy Seán Haughey</from>
            <p eId="para_980">I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on the school referred to by the Deputy.  Notwithstanding the increase of €302 million in the education budget for 2009, which is a real achievement in the current economic climate, a number of tough and difficult decisions had to be taken.  The 2009 budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure and decisions were made in order to control expenditure and ensure sustainability in the long term.  In this respect, education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be entirely spared, and the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, acknowledges the impact of funding restrictions in a number of areas, including at school level.  However, these are the inevitable result of the challenging economic environment and the need to manage Exchequer resources prudently.</p>
            <p eId="para_981">DEIS, the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and an integrated school support programme.  DEIS brings together and builds upon a number of existing interventions in schools with concentrated levels of disadvantage.  The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the educational research centre on behalf of the Department of Education and Science and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and the inspectorate.</p>
            <p eId="para_982">Mercy College is among the schools that were judged by an independent identification process in 2005 not to have a sufficient level of disadvantage among their pupils to warrant their inclusion in DEIS.  A review mechanism was put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in DEIS but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which was of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme.</p>

          <speech by="#SeanHaughey" eId="spk_450" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Seán Haughey</from>
            <p eId="para_984">The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review.  Mercy College applied for review but was not successful.</p>
            <p eId="para_985">The main focus of social inclusion measures will be to retain resources in DEIS schools.  There is a need to target resources on those schools that are most need and this approach is in line with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General, which are set out in his report on primary disadvantage 2006, which recommended that the Department should focus its educational disadvantage measures on those schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_986">Over 70 post-primary schools that were not identified for inclusion in DEIS retained resources, both teaching posts and financial, under pre-existing schemes and programmes for addressing educational disadvantage.  When DEIS was introduced, it was intended that as a concessionary measure to these schools, they would retain a level of support for the duration of the current DEIS initiative up until the end of the 2009 and 2010 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_987">While it is appreciated that the discontinuation of these resources will impact on these schools, including Mercy College, given the current challenging economic climate, difficult decisions had to be made in order to contain public sector spending.  One of these decisions was to advance the withdrawal of such supports from non-DEIS schools to the beginning of the next school year.  Other decisions included increasing the pupil-teacher ratio across all second-level schools from 18:1 to 19:1.  In the case of fee-charging post-primary schools, there will be an additional one-point adjustment to 20:1.</p>
            <p eId="para_988">Taken in combination, the impact of the staffing schedule changes, withdrawal of historic DEIS posts and language support weighed off against increases expected in the numbers of teachers for demographics and resource teachers for special needs will mean an overall net reduction of 200 posts at second level.  This is less than 1% of the overall number of teaching posts in second level schools currently.  Measured against the overall payroll target reduction across the public sector it demonstrates the Government's desire to protect front-line staff in schools to the greatest extent possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_989">As the processing of the September 2008 enrolment returns for post-primary schools are not yet finalised, it is not possible at this time to outline to the House the impact these changes will have on the allocation of mainstream teaching posts for the 2009 and 2010 school year for the school in question.  The staffing schedule for that school year will issue to all schools as soon as possible, and at that time, a more accurate indication of the mainstream staffing levels will be available.</p>
            <p eId="para_990">The allocation processes include appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. This is particularly relevant at post-primary level where the appellate process considers in particular any specific curricular needs of the school concerned.  At post-primary there is no effective system-wide redeployment scheme at present and this can mean that schools retain teachers, although over quota.  In addition, discrete allocations are made to post-primary schools — for example, to cater for pupils with special educational needs and those with language difficulties — and these allocations can also alter the ultimate position of the school with regard to any over-quota position.</p>
            <p eId="para_991">The Department of Education and Science is aware of funding pressures on schools.  However, progress has been made in recent years that has seen the post-primary school capitation grant increased by €15 per pupil, and it now amounts to €331 per pupil.  In addition, voluntary secondary schools have benefited by the increase of €15 per pupil in 2008 in the support services grant, bringing that grant to €204 per pupil.  The cumulative increase of €30 per pupil in a voluntary secondary school brings the aggregate grant to €535 per pupil.  These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to €40,000 per school that is also provided by the Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services.</p>
            <p eId="para_992">Budget allocations for schools in the community and comprehensive school sector, along with those in the VEC sector, are increased on a <i>pro rata</i> basis with increases in the per capita grant.  All schools are eligible for recurrent per capita grants towards special classes and curricular support grants.</p>
            <p eId="para_993">The funding mechanisms in place afford schools considerable flexibility in the use of their resources to cater for the needs of their pupils.  The Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, appreciates that the abolition of a number of grants for some schools will impact on funding levels in 2009 but it is also the case that enhanced levels of funding announced in the budget for the capitation and ancillary services grants will help to alleviate the impact of this.</p>

            <from>Deputy John O’Mahony</from>
            <p eId="para_996">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter — the plight of Craggagh, Killawalla and Tooreen national schools — for discussion.  This is a representation of the small rural primary schools in my constituency that will be dramatically affected if the class sizes are increased, as stated in the recent budget.  I could mention others, such as Bonniconlon, Attymass, Lahardaun, Carn, Murrisk, Breaffy and Ballina Rehins, but I want to concentrate on Craggagh, Killawalla and Tooreen for now.</p>
            <p eId="para_997">Craggagh and Killawalla national schools provide a wonderful education in their rural community, where the children are being taught in classes of a manageable size.  They had 48 children on the rolls in September 2008, which would allow them to keep their third teacher in 2009.  The projected numbers will increase to over 50 in September 2009.  As the staffing levels for September 2009 are based on the September 2008 figures, they will lose their third teacher, although they had the required number of students for three teachers on both dates.  The problem arises because staffing levels for September 2009 are based on the figures for 2008.  Surely some flexibility can be shown in these schools because of the dramatic effects involved.  I am talking about the fact that one third of the staff will lose their jobs and, in addition, there will be four classes in each classroom.  The public may think that the pupil-teacher ratio is being increased by one, but in these schools the class size will increase in each case by ten pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_998">If a teacher is absent due to the removal of substitution at short notice, one teacher would teach more than 50 students in a classroom.  One can imagine the effect of a 12-teacher school losing four teachers or a nine-teacher school losing three teachers — it would cause mayhem.  In the cases I have cited, however, only one teacher is being lost, but people forget that represents one third of the staffing levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_999">St. Brigid's national school in Tooreen, County Mayo, will have increased numbers in 2009 as well.  The school will be unable to appoint a fourth mainstream teacher because staffing levels are based on 2008 figures.  The situation is exactly the same as the other schools, except that in this case it concerns a fourth teacher.  The net result on the ground in Tooreen is that 32 children will be in one classroom and 28 in another.  This will make it impossible to cater for the individual needs of all children in the classroom, or to implement the new curriculum effectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_1000">To give an example, I was contacted by a parent in Tooreen school whose six-year-old son has been diagnosed with special needs.  From September 2009, he will be in a class of 32 children if something is not done.  At the moment he is making good progress in the smaller class, but one can imagine how his progress will suffer with the bigger numbers.  A little flexibility would make a huge difference in Craggagh, Killawalla and Tooreen schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1001">On "Questions and Answers" last night, the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, said that no school in DEIS areas will lose a teacher.  Was he talking about DEIS schools in urban areas, because rural DEIS schools get no staffing concessions?  I would like the Minister of State to clarify that point in his reply.  Even if it were true for rural areas, which I doubt, it would not provide the flexibility for non-DEIS schools, some of which are also affected.</p>
            <p eId="para_1002">I appeal to the Minister to re-examine the special situation pertaining to small rural primary schools.  I ask him to find out how many schools and teaching positions it would affect.  I think it would only be a small number across the country.  If the Minister could examine those numbers nationwide the solution would not amount to a major investment, but it would make an enormous difference to the delivery of a quality education system in small rural schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_1003">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue as it provides me with an opportunity to outline the position to the House.  The priority this Government and previous Fianna Fáil-led Governments attach to providing for quality education is evident in the budget allocations to my Department since 1997.  This year alone, the Government allocated more than €9.3 billion.  The continued prioritisation of education over the past 11 years has reversed the historic under-investment in areas such as school facilities, services for children with special needs and those in disadvantaged areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1004">The 2009 budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  These decisions were made to control public expenditure and ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect education could not be totally spared, while it is protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure.  The various impacts at school level were included in the budget day announcements.  Even with the budget measures in place, there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1005">When the country was able to afford it, the Government reduced the basis on which primary teachers were allocated to schools, based on an average number of pupils per teacher, from 35 to 27 pupils.  The change to a new average of 28 pupils per teacher must be viewed in that context.  Significant additional support went into schools, particularly in the area of special education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1006">The Government also reduced class sizes for the most disadvantaged in our DEIS schools to an average of one teacher for every 20 pupils in junior classes and an average of one teacher for every 24 pupils in senior classes.  These will not change in 2009.  When one adds up all the teachers in the system, there is one teacher for every 16 pupils in our primary schools.</p>

            <from>Deputy Seán Haughey</from>
            <p eId="para_1008">It will be necessary in the more testing economic climate ahead for us to continue to target and prioritise our resources to maximum effect for everyone.  While teacher numbers are important, numerous influential reports have highlighted the fact that teacher quality is the single most important factor — far above anything else — in improving educational outcomes for children.  Ensuring high quality teaching and learning is a challenge.  Dealing with factors that inhibit it, represents a challenge for the Government, the Department, school management and the teacher unions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1009">The Department of Education and Science will advise individual schools in the normal way on their staffing allocation.  The preparatory work for this has commenced with the processing of enrolment data that have been received from schools.  The staffing allocation processes, including notification to schools, will commence early in the new year.  The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.</p>
            <p eId="para_1010">In addition to mainstream classroom teachers, the Department also allocates teaching resources to schools for special needs and language support.  The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels, which provides for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1011">The Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, has no difficulty in setting out for this House or for the public generally the overall changes on aggregate teacher numbers in schools for the 2009-10 school year.  The Minister will do this when the allocation processes have been completed.  Furthermore, the staffing schedule will be published and it is a transparent way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and fairly, and know where they stand.</p>
            <p eId="para_1012">At this time, the priority for the Department, within the resources available to it, is to carry out those processes in a timely manner.  Diverting resources to create staffing profiles for the individual schools requested by the Deputy, information which at this time would only be speculative, could not be justified and would impede the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1013">The Minister is confident that as the global economy improves it will be possible to build again on the significant achievements of recent years and do so in a manner consistent with overall prudent management of the economy.  As the full extent of the global crisis seeps into public consciousness, the Minister believes there will be general acceptance that taking difficult decisions now to secure future economic prosperity and secure employment is the first imperative for the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1014">Once again, I thank the Deputy for providing me with the opportunity to address the House on this matter and to outline the current position in these cases.</p>

            <p eId="para_1019">The rollout of a national smart meter programme is progressing in line with the commitment in the Government's Energy Policy Framework and in the Programme for Government.  The Smart Meter programme is a central component of the strategy to significantly enhance management of energy demand and to achieve greater energy efficiency through the use of cutting-edge technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_1020">The pilot phase, the electricity element of which is being led by ESB, will critically inform the launch of a national scheme.  This is a highly complex technological project and the trials are essential to ensure that we have the right technology and systems for the full rollout.</p>
            <p eId="para_1021">The pilot phase encompasses two strands — a technology trial, which is testing a number of advanced metering systems and their associated IT and communications infrastructure — and a customer behaviour trial, which will determine the potential of smart meters to achieve measurable change in consumer behaviour.</p>
            <p eId="para_1022">The technology trial will look at meter functionality and supporting information and communications systems.  There are many challenges involved in developing a metering system for Ireland that will reflect the dispersed nature of our population and, as a result, by extension, the electricity network.  This trial will involve the installation of 15,000 meters.  Installation of meters for the pilot phase is under way and is expected to be completed by mid 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1023">Testing the capability of advanced meters to distinguish between the import and export of electricity will also form a key part of the technology trial.  This will facilitate the development of microgeneration where consumers generate their own electricity and sell their surplus back to the grid.</p>
            <p eId="para_1024">Participants for the customer behaviour trial are being selected to ensure that the sample is representative of Ireland's electricity consumers both in terms of usage profiles and geographical spread.  Invitations to participate in the trial are being issued on a phased basis with 8000 letters of invitation issued thus far.  To date the response has been very positive with 36% of electricity customers contacted expressing an interest in participating.  The number of participants needed for the electricity customer behaviour trial is 6,000. The incorporation of gas customers into the pilot phase is being progressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1025">The pilot phase overall was launched on 15 September and will last eighteen months in total.  This will facilitate the introduction of smart metering initiatives and resulting electricity consumption behavioural changes measured.  It is important to have a trial lasting a full year so that seasonal changes in usage are captured for peak demand management purposes. The results of the pilot will inform the timing of a national roll out.</p>
            <p eId="para_1026">The pilot phase is expected to be completed at end December 2010 and the outcome should be a fully informed decision on the most suitable model of smart meter(s)/IT system(s), tariffing structure, communications system and demand stimuli, all of which works effectively and has the capability to deliver the anticipated benefits of smart metering in the Irish market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1027">The costs of the pilot to end 2008 will be approximately €6m in total.  As part of the preparation for the ‘go live' of the pilot, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is currently considering submissions from ESBN, ESBCS, SEI, BGN and industry participants on the budget for the entire pilot phase.</p>
            <p eId="para_1028">The cost of a national rollout will be quantified when the pilot phase has been completed and the preferred metering system capable of delivering the level of functionality required for smart metering in the Irish market has been selected.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1030">The regulation of ESB electricity tariffs and Bord Gáis Éireann (BGÉ) gas tariffs is the statutory responsibility of the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).</p>
            <p eId="para_1031">I also note that the CER made the decision to end tariff regulation for large electricity users in September 2006.  It concluded that there is a sufficient level of generation capacity in the upper end of the market to allow customers to receive offers of a competitively priced supply of electricity.  As a result, the vast majority of large industrial and commercial electricity customers are currently supplied by independent suppliers and companies and are free to negotiate alternative supply offers with the alternative suppliers in the marketplace.</p>
            <p eId="para_1032">In regard to those areas of the market which remain subject to price regulation, residential and small business customers supplied by the ESB, the legislation is not prescriptive in terms of the methodology to be used by the CER in reaching its decisions.  The legislation does not preclude any particular approach.  The CER is required to examine the costs underlying the regulated tariffs to ensure they are cost reflective.</p>
            <p eId="para_1033">I note yesterday's announcement by the CER of its Phase 2 decision on ESB and BGÉ tariffs for 2009, which is reflective of recent softening in international wholesale prices for gas and coal.  I also note the substantial rebate being provided by ESB to all electricity customers, which helped mitigate the need for a tariff increase.</p>
            <p eId="para_1034">The two phase approach to tariff regulation adopted by the CER this year has been prudent in terms of minimising the impact of volatile international fuel prices for energy consumers in Ireland.  Flexibility is clearly important in addressing our energy costs, which are a key challenge for the competitiveness of the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1035">I therefore welcome the CER's intention to review tariffs and tariff methodologies next year, in light of global trends in fuel prices and all other relevant factors.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1037">The Power of One electronic campaign consists of a suite of three complementary websites — PowerOfOne.ie, PowerOfOneStreet.ie and PowerOfOneAtWork.ie — each targeting a specific segment of society.  In 2008, €220,000 has been spent on developing and maintaining the websites.</p>
            <p eId="para_1038">My colleague, the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, has informed me that €450,000 has been spent on developing and maintaining the Change.ie website in 2008, which has included extensive scientific and technical design for its core element — the carbon calculator and database.</p>
            <p eId="para_1039">The websites for both Power of One and Change act as the central informational portal for each campaign.  All media activity, including TV, radio, outdoor and press are used to drive traffic to the sites.  To date, the Power of One campaign has had over 700,000 page impressions and earlier this year received an eGovernment Award in recognition of excellence illustrated in the marketing of ICT based services. Visitors to the site can:</p>
            <p eId="para_1040">Use the new energy calculator which demonstrates how much energy and money can be saved by making simple changes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1041">Take an interactive energy survey which helps to identify key areas where energy can be saved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1042">Watch all Power of One TV ads and specific energy efficiency videos that provide advice on how best to reduce energy use.</p>
            <p eId="para_1043">Download or request information packs and posters, of which 60,000 have already been distributed to consumers across the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1044">The Change website is an innovative vehicle for raising public awareness of climate change, its causes, impacts and implications for Ireland as well as to drive significant behavioural change to reduce and avoid greenhouse gas emissions in how we live, work and travel.  Since the carbon calculator was launched as part of the development of the website on 5 May 2008, almost 90,000 people have calculated their carbon count number.  Users are directed to the Power of One site where they can then find ideas, which help to reduce their carbon number.</p>
            <p eId="para_1045">The remit of the Change campaign covers a broad spectrum of transport, waste, water, energy, biodiversity and planning across the agriculture, transport, construction, tourism, business, industry and the public sector.  Officials from my Department and Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) are members of an inter-Departmental steering committee which ensures that there is no duplication of activities and that synergies between campaigns are maximised.  Significant synergies have been achieved in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1046">Both campaigns have worked closely to link the concepts of energy efficiency, carbon reduction and monetary savings, and have recently run joint mass media campaigns on TV, radio, press and online to promote energy efficient heating, appliance purchase and usage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1047">In combining the carbon reduction, energy saving and monetary saving messages, consumers are presented with holistic energy and environmental advice and guidance.  A key component of these recent media campaigns has been the use of families that have clearly demonstrated how easy it is to make simple changes that translate into significant financial and carbon emission savings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1048">My Department has today received the latest campaign survey results and the results will be published next week.  I am informed that 82% of people agree that it makes sense to combine the energy saving, monetary saving and carbon saving messages.</p>
            <p eId="para_1049">Officials from my Department, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and SEI are currently analysing the potential to further align and merge other elements of the campaigns.</p>

            <p eId="para_1051">The Single Electricity Market Committee, which is statutorily responsible for the operation of the all-island electricity market on the island of Ireland, have determined that all electricity generators must include the full opportunity cost of carbon when bidding into the gross mandatory pool of the Single Electricity Market.  This raises the wholesale cost of electricity and gives rise to the windfall profits being earned by electricity generators.</p>
            <p eId="para_1052">In deciding on the level of regulated electricity price increase effective from 1 January 2009, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) announced that they have agreed with the ESB that the latter will provide a significant rebate to electricity consumers in 2009.  This rebate will be applicable to all electricity customers irrespective of their supplier.  This rebate has a value of approximately 9.5% of the cost of electricity.  It will mitigate the need for a price increase and largely address the issue of windfall gains earned by ESB in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1053">My Department, in conjunction with the CER, will be examining options to address in the future, any windfall gains that might arise for electricity generators while they continue to receive free carbon permit allocations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1054">More generally I would point out that the emissions trading system established by the European Union, is the cornerstone of our climate change response and will be the basis of any subsequent international responses to climate change.  This system currently allows for the free allocations of 90% of carbon credits in the electricity generation area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1055">My personal view is that the allocation of carbon credits, which is the basis for trading, should be done by auction rather than free allocation.  I note that the European Commission is now proposing that post 2012 all carbon permits will be bought on the open market and producers can compete on the basis of carbon costs.  This will eliminate any windfall gains for electricity producers and promote competition between generators as to who can produce electricity using the least carbon.  In my view this is a welcome development which will be good for the environment and good for the consumer.</p>

            <p eId="para_1057">I published a consultation paper on Next Generation Broadband in July 2008.  The introduction of a regulation to require the installation of open access fibre connection in new premises, where practicable, was one of the proposed policy actions. Fibre has been deployed in a number of residential developments but they are proprietary systems. I am interested in putting open access networks in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1058">The working group referred to by the Deputy is one I have set up to examine a range of practical issues that need to be addressed before a regulation can be put into effect. The group comprises of officials from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, ComReg and my own Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1059">These issues are quite complex and span legal, financial, technical and regulatory matters. For example they include the technical specifications and standards that will be required by the industry for open access fibre, ownership, maintenance and cost implications and whether universal application is practicable. The installation of open access fibre in new premises is an innovative proposal and some of the issues have not had to be considered in Ireland before. They will take some time to work through but I can assure the Deputy that the group is addressing them as a matter of urgency.</p>

            <p eId="para_1077">Following the Government decision in May 2007 that further evidence and evaluation was required of the monetary benefits that would arise from the implementation of a national postcode, my Department recruited consultants to assist with an additional study on the costs and benefits of the postcode system, as they would relate to the public sector.  The consultants have recently submitted their report to my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1078">The report is currently being assessed by my officials with a view to progressing the project and when complete, I will make a decision on how best to take the proposal forward.  In this regard I fully accept that a postcode system can deliver economic and social benefits, assist with the future development of competition in the postal sector and assist with the efficient, effective and innovative delivery of certain public services.  It is therefore my intention to bring a further proposal to Government in relation to the introduction of postcodes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1079">The National Postcode Project Board, in presenting its report on a national postcode system in July 2006, estimated that the cost of implementing and promoting a national postcode system would require approximately €15 million of Exchequer funding.  There has been no significant revision of this figure in the new report, although the eventual cost cannot be determined until a licence holder, who will be responsible for developing, communicating and maintaining the postcode system, has been selected through a competitive process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1080">The annual maintenance costs for the postcode management licence holder have been estimated as amounting to approximately €2.5m and it is expected that those ongoing costs will be met by income generated by the eventual licence holder. The recent supplemental report on postcodes found that significant financial benefits would accrue in the public sector if the proposed national postcode is introduced.  The financial benefits identified in the public bodies consulted amounted to approximately €22m in net present value terms and the report also finds that there is likely to be a range of benefits, which public sector bodies cannot at this stage quantify but concludes that there is still a strong basis for a national postcode in Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_1082">Earlier this year I launched the Ocean Energy Initiative to ensure Ireland is well positioned in the development of ocean energy technologies.  Ireland's ocean energy resource offers significant potential to become a key contributor to the development of our renewable energy capacity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1083">The programme includes:</p>
            <p eId="para_1084">The establishment of the Ocean Energy Development Unit based in Sustainable Energy Ireland to oversee the programme and ensure coordinated delivery of all programme elements;</p>
            <p eId="para_1085">The creation of a state-of-the-art National Ocean Energy facility in University College Cork to support scale model development;</p>

            <p eId="para_1089">The ocean energy sector, which includes a variety of technological applications, is moving progressively from early stage tank and model testing to scale testing in sea environments with several prototypes already being tested in our existing Galway Bay test site.</p>
            <p eId="para_1090">A small number of wave and tidal energy-capture technologies are being tested in open-ocean environments internationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1091">This is frontier technology, which must be able to operate over long periods with a high degree of reliability in an extremely hostile and changeable environment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1094">The Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff (REFIT) support scheme operated by my Department supports the construction of new renewable energy powered plants with sufficient generating capacity, typically at or a multiple of 1 megawatt, to attract market interest from electricity suppliers interested in purchasing the power in commercial quantities.  Micro-scale plants, on the other hand, are typically of a much smaller size requiring different solutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1095">My Department is working closely with the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and other stakeholders to put in place in the short term an appropriately structured payment system for micro-generated electricity exported to the grid, which will operate separately from the REFIT mechanism.</p>
            <p eId="para_1096">In addition, Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) is implementing a Micro-generation Pilot Programme, which will conduct research and field trials, including support for between 50 and 60 installations on a pilot basis of micro-scale projects.  The field trials will address a range of issues including grid connection and technical standards to ensure the power security, safety and quality of installations.  CER/ESB Networks have amended the rules associated with connecting micro-scale plants whereby generators of less than 6kW on single phase cables and 11kW on three phase electricity supply cables can now connect to the grid without prior authorisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1097">SEI will also shortly publish a guide to connecting renewable and CHP electricity production plants to the electricity network including advice for micro-generators, which will be of assistance to those connecting micro scale plant to the network following the changes announced by CER/ESB.</p>

            <p eId="para_1101">Section 3(1)(b) of the Broadcasting Act 2007 requires RTÉ to establish and maintain a television broadcasting service and a sound broadcasting service, which services shall be made available, in so far as the RTÉ Authority considers reasonably practicable, to Irish communities outside of the island of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1102">RTÉ has reviewed the potential for providing these services over different media, including via the Internet, over radio, over satellite and on the UK Freesat service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1103">RTÉ provides a radio service to Great Britain and Northern Ireland using the long wave radio service.  In addition, RTÉ has improved its FM radio service near the border with Northern Ireland in order to improve reception of RTÉ 1 in the Belfast area.  Radio coverage is also provided over satellite and over the internet.</p>
            <p eId="para_1104">In relation to the availability of television and radio over the internet, RTÉ has indicated a commitment to continue to enhance the activities and operations of RTÉ online and to provide both television and radio programming. RTÉ has also indicated that if resources permit, it proposes to enhance the service in the course of 2009 through the introduction of an i-player type service which will allow live access to a greater range of programming than is currently available through live streaming.</p>
            <p eId="para_1105">RTÉ has also committed to rolling out an International television service on the UK Freesat network.  RTÉ had initially expected that this service would launch at the end of 2008.   In September my Department was informed by RTÉ that, due to the rapidly worsening economic conditions and falling advertising revenue, they would need to postpone the launch of the RTÉ International television service by a year. I understand this is one of a number of measures taken by RTÉ in the current economic climate.  My Department has written to RTÉ expressing disappointment at the decision while acknowledging the current economic climate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1106">RTÉ has highlighted that this decision may be reviewed if circumstances change significantly in the course of the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1109">This results from a contract with a specific supplier negotiated by the Government Supplies Agency under which 100% of electricity supplied is from renewable sources.  Under this contract 1,920,573 kilowatts of energy was supplied in the buildings mentioned for the period 1st November 2007 to 31st October 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1110">Electricity is supplied to the decentralised office in Cavan town by the ESB.  This building is not included in the electricity contract as it was not occupied by my Department at the time of contract.  111,056 kilowatts of energy was supplied by the ESB in the period mentioned representing 2% of all energy used.

            <p eId="para_1132">The Government's policy in relation to energy is set out in the White Paper, "Delivering a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland — The Energy Policy Framework 2007 — 2020".  The three pillars of Government energy policy are security of energy supply, environmental sustainability and delivery of real and effective competition in energy markets.  In relation to environmental sustainability, it is the Government's policy to reduce energy-related emissions and the carbon intensity of electricity production through various initiatives, including changes to the fuel mix, one of which is the co-firing of the existing peat-fired plants with biomass.</p>
            <p eId="para_1133">A target of 30% co-firing of the existing peat-fired power plants with biomass by 2015 has been set, with the intention of reducing the amount of peat being used in these plants by about one million tonnes per annum.  This is reflected in the projections in the Energy Policy Framework, which indicate a decrease in the amount of peat in the fuel mix up to 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_1134">The Energy Policy Framework refers to Government being supportive of biomass co-firing with peat.  This is in the context of the existing State-owned peat-fired power generating plants.  An inference that the Government would encourage new peat-fired plants should not be drawn.  The Government's clear focus is instead on the development of new renewable energy and energy-efficient measures to achieve its overall energy policy goals.</p>
            <p eId="para_1135">Under the provisions of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, as amended, the Minister has no function in relation to authorisations to construct generating stations or licences to generate electricity.

            <p eId="para_1137">The regulation of ESB electricity tariffs and Bord Gáis Éireann (BGÉ) gas tariffs is the statutory responsibility of the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) under the Electricity Regulation Act and the Gas (Interim) Regulation Act 2002.  I have no function in setting or regulating energy prices.</p>
            <p eId="para_1138">I note yesterday's announcement by the CER of its Phase 2 decision on ESB and BGÉ tariffs, which is reflective of recent easing in international prices, particularly for gas and coal.  I also note the substantial rebate being provided by ESB to all electricity customers, which helped mitigate the need for a tariff increase.</p>
            <p eId="para_1139">The two phase approach to tariff regulation adopted by the CER this year was prudent in terms of minimising the impact of volatile market prices for energy consumers in Ireland.  Flexibility is clearly important in addressing our energy costs, which are a key challenge for competitiveness.  I therefore welcome the CER's intention to review tariffs and methodologies next year in light of global trends in international fuel prices and all other relevant factors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1140">In September 2007, the CER published a consultation paper on a review of its consultation process.  Following a review of the comments received, the Commission then published  in February of this year, a number of proposals designed to address other areas identified as in need of improvement and also enhance the areas.  In June 2008, following further consultation, the Commission published its final decision on these proposals which resulted in the implementation of 15 out of its original 19 proposals.  One of the decisions made involved the holding of public forums as part of certain consultation processes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1141">In the context of Phase Two of the Commission's price review of ESB and Bord Gáis Energy Supply tariffs, the CER as part of the public consultation process held a public forum on 10 November with ESB and BGÉ, which all stakeholders and interest groups were encouraged to attend.  This was in addition to the ‘regular' full open consultation.  The CER also launched its new customer service — energycustomers.ie — in late October 2008, which is aimed at the provision of additional information to customers on the energy sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1142">The Open Forum initiative by the CER provided an important opportunity for consumers and interested groups to debate in public with CER, ESB and BGÉ on the complex issues around energy prices.  Attended by representatives of a broad range of business and consumer groups, as well as ordinary customers, the forum provided an opportunity for consumers to voice their concerns about energy costs.  Stakeholders were also invited to make written submissions directly to the CER to inform the Commission in making its second phase decision on prices.  The forum was well attended and I believe the CER has received favourable comments in relation to the event itself and its objectives.  The CER is also committed to continually looking at ways in which its consultative process can be improved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1143">The CER also has a statutory role in protecting vulnerable customers in the energy markets.  Under the European Communities (Internal Market in Electricity) Regulations 2005 the CER is tasked with ensuring that there are adequate safeguards to protect vulnerable customers.  The CER has set out guidelines for the protection of household electricity and natural gas customers, particularly the elderly, customers relying on life support equipment and those with disabilities.  The CER also regularly meets with customer representative groups to discuss their concerns.</p>
            <p eId="para_1144">In addition to this, the Commission will in 2009, look at ways of introducing greater flexibility into electricity and gas tariff structures including payment options.  The CER is also leading the ongoing smart metering project, one of the aims of which is to provide greater empowerment for customers over their energy usage and bills.</p>
            <p eId="para_1145">The Government is fully committed to protecting the most vulnerable members of society from the impact of rising energy costs through a combination of social welfare supports and investment in structural improvements to enhance the energy efficiency of the housing stock.  I am working with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to ensure a fully cohesive strategic approach in this regard across Government and Agencies.</p>

            <p eId="para_1147">The East-West Interconnector is a 500 MegaWatt High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) interconnector, which will link the electricity grids of Ireland and Britain.  This project is of vital strategic importance to Ireland and its delivery to schedule by 2012 is a key Government priority.</p>
            <p eId="para_1148">The East West Interconnector will significantly enhance security of supply and will facilitate increased competition in the single electricity market.  It will also underpin Ireland's progressive integration with the UK and European electricity market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1149">EirGrid, the State Body responsible for Transmission, has been entrusted with the development and ownership of this interconnector by the Government.  Working closely with the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and with my Department, EirGrid is progressing the project to schedule.  The Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (EirGrid) Act 2008 provides the necessary legal basis for EirGrid to construct, own and operate an interconnector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1150">I am advised that EirGrid expects the contract for design and construction of the interconnector to be completed in the coming months, when the successful bidder will be announced.  EirGrid has secured Woodland in County Meath as the connection point for the interconnector on the Irish transmission system and Deeside in Wales on the UK side.  EirGrid has undertaken a marine survey to determine the most suitable route for the undersea cable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1151">Work is also progressing on the various applications for authorisations and permissions required along the entire route of the interconnector.  On November 18th, EirGrid submitted a planning application to the Strategic Infrastructure Division of An Bord Pleanála for the project.</p>
            <p eId="para_1152">Late 2011 is the target for the completion of works and 2012 is the target for the completion of commissioning and testing and the start of commercial operations.  The project remains on track to meet these target completion dates, subject to the outcome of the planning processes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1153">Financing options for this project are being finalised by EirGrid with the objective of achieving the most cost-effective and efficient financial package.  The interconnector will, as a national strategic asset, remain in public ownership and will be owned and operated by EirGrid.</p>

          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_478">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1155">The Greener Homes Scheme, since its launch in March 2006, has provided support for home owners investing in renewable energy heating technologies.  The scheme has been modified over that period, supported by appropriate budgetary allocations year on year.  Phase III continues to support the installation of a range of technologies in existing homes.  Demand trends under the scheme continue to evolve in response to the ongoing adjustments which take account of market developments and changes to the Building Regulations.  These adjustments will be reflected in the Budget allocation for the scheme in 2009.  Sustainable Energy Ireland advises that there are approximately 76 applications for grant assistance on hand, which are currently being processed.  The allocation for the Greener Homes 2008 is €22.5m.  The allocation for 2009 remains to be definitively finalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1156">Any support scheme such as Greener Homes must evolve over time to a point where the industry is self sufficient and this overall approach has been reflected in the adjustments made to this scheme over its lifetime.</p>
            <p eId="para_1157">The stimulus that the scheme has given to the development and maturing of the industry, with 16,000 systems already installed, has focussed primarily on improving the supply chain for the products, services and fuels.  The application of product standards and installer training and quality framework has ensured that consumers are both informed and confident in their choices.</p>
            <p eId="para_1158">There are currently 940 products registered under the scheme.  All these products meet minimum quality and efficiency criteria which allows for informed choice on the part of the consumer whether attracting financial support or not.</p>
            <p eId="para_1159">Quality and training is an important aspect of supporting the development of a sustainable industry.  Training courses have been developed for residential heating technologies.  These courses are FETAC accredited and mandatory for registration under the Greener Homes Scheme since March 2008.  There are currently 1,300 installers registered under the scheme who have completed these training courses and it will continue to be a requirement for any installer wishing to register under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1160">The Greener Homes Scheme (and the REHeat scheme for the commercial sector) was also designed to enable a reliable supply chain for wood pellet fuels.  Securing a significant installed base of appliances has created a demand that has resulted in increased and more geographically diverse supply and more competitive pricing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1161">The Building Regulations 2008, which came into force on July 1st, make the inclusion of renewable energy in new homes mandatory.  It is therefore no longer appropriate to grant aid installation of renewable technologies in new homes and future budgetary allocations for the Scheme will reflect this decision.  The Building Regulations' mandatory requirement will of itself significantly stimulate demand for renewable energy products and services.  The existence in the market of 1,300 installers who have successfully completed nationally accredited training will underpin this regulatory requirement.  The installation of renewable heating systems in existing homes, which is typically more complex and more expensive, warrants continued support in the short to medium term while the market reaches maturity.</p>

            <p eId="para_1164">As regards the accuracy of the mapping for the scheme, a comprehensive mapping process has been undertaken.  This process involved:</p>

            <p eId="para_1173">I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 114 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1174">The Broadcasting (Amendment) Act, 2007 puts in place a flexible framework for the licensing of Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) into the future.  The Act provides for the establishment of a free to air DTT service to replace the existing analogue terrestrial services offered by RTÉ, TG4 and TV3.  The Act also provides for the development of commercial DTT services, which are anticipated to provide further choice to those who wish to avail of additional channels to  the Irish free to air channels.  Under the Act, RTÉ, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI) and the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) have obligations to provide for the rollout of DTT and to assist in the development of a plan for analogue switch off.</p>
            <p eId="para_1175">In order for Ireland to benefit fully from the switch to DTT, a switch-off of analogue television services is necessary.  Ireland has indicated that this switch off is likely to take place in 2012, in line with other European countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1176">The BCI is responsible for contracting commercial DTT service providers.  In this regard, a Swedish company Boxer Ltd, in partnership with Communicorp has been offered the contract and contract terms are being finalised.  It is anticipated that the launch of commercial DTT services will be coordinated with the launch of the free to air DTT service in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1177">The UK has a schedule to switch off analogue TV in different regions from 2008 to 2012 in favour of Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT).  Analogue TV services in Wales, for instance, are expected to switch off from August 2009 and this will impact on viewers in Wexford, Waterford, Wicklow and Dublin who receive UK TV channels via overspill from the UK.</p>
            <p eId="para_1178">Viewers on cable and satellite will not be affected by these changes and will continue to receive the UK terrestrial channels.</p>
            <p eId="para_1179">The anticipated 2009 launch of commercial Irish digital terrestrial services will provide a significant range of television services which will be available in the south east of the country, including to those persons who will be impacted by the switch off of analogue services in the UK.</p>

            <p eId="para_1182">Under Phase II of the MANs Programme, 58 of a total of 60 MANs covering 64 towns have been completed during 2007 and 2008.  Construction of the remaining two networks will be completed during 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1183">All completed Phase II networks are being managed on an interim basis by technical services firm Magnum Opus on behalf of my Department pending the engagement of a Management Services Entity for the Phase II MANs (MSE 2).  The engagement of an MSE 2 is currently the subject of a procurement process, which is expected to conclude in Q1 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1184">The Phase II MANs contain duct, sub duct, dark fibre and co-location facilities.  Under the interim MSE maintenance arrangement currently in place, dark fibre is made available to service providers, who in turn use their own equipment to light the fibre for their customer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1185">Currently there are three Phase II MANs being used by service providers; Killarney, Tralee and Carrigaline.  Longford will be in use within the next two weeks.

            <p eId="para_1187">The Warmer Homes Scheme is overseen by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), and is targeted at households on low incomes, such as those in receipt of fuel allowance, invalidity or disability benefit.  The Warmer Homes Scheme will install cavity wall insulation, attic insulation, a boiler lagging jacket, draught proofing measures and Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs).  Advice is also provided to householders on minimising energy use.  These measures are provided free or at a nominal cost.</p>
            <p eId="para_1188">The service is delivered principally through community based organisations. There are 20 such groups currently approved by SEI.  Applications for assistance under the Scheme should be made via the relevant community organisation, details of which can be found under the grants section of SEI's website (www.sei.ie/grants).</p>
            <p eId="para_1189">Householders in receipt of energy efficiency improvements under the Scheme can potentially reduce their energy consumption by up to 60%, depending on the number of measures implemented and their energy behaviour.  Funding of €10 million has been made available for this Scheme in 2009, which includes a contribution of €5 million from ESB and Bord Gáis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1190">The Home Energy Saving Scheme, which is also managed by SEI, will provide grant assistance to householders generally to install energy efficiency measures from next year.  I launched the Scheme on a pilot basis earlier this year, in a selected number of areas and with a budget of €5 million.  The pilot Scheme is grant aiding cavity wall insulation, wall lining insulation, external insulation, attic insulation, heating controls and low-e double glazing.  This pilot phase is informing the design of the wider roll out of the Scheme in 2009 for which provision of €20 million has been made.  The operational details of the Scheme are in the process of being finalised and I expect to be in a position to make an announcement in respect of new applications later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1191">Indicative results from the pilot phase indicate that supported upgrade actions can bring a house from an F-rating starting point on the Building Energy Rating (BER) scale to a D2 rating.  This represents an energy saving of up to €700 per year for each house, equating to reduced CO2 emissions of 3 tonnes.</p>

         the steps he has taken at national or European level to ensure that consumers here gain full benefit from the lower energy prices on world markets with particular reference to the fact that oil prices on international markets are approximately one third of those applying when prices were at their peak; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1193">The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated and there is no price control on petroleum products in Ireland.  There is free entry to the market.  Prices at the pump reflect global market price, transportation costs, Euro/Dollar fluctuations and other operating costs.  Price differences are an ongoing feature of the market economy and it is a matter for retailers to explain price differences where they occur.</p>
            <p eId="para_1194">I would advise the Deputy that the National Consumer Agency is currently undertaking a survey into the relationship between pump prices for petrol and diesel and the wholesale price of crude oil.  I understand that as part of its work, the Agency will seek to benchmark movements in prices in Ireland against those in other EU countries and that it will also seek to examine the frequency and the timeliness with which changes in the wholesale price are being passed on to consumers.  I understand that the Agency expects to finalise its report into this matter very shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1195">The regulation of ESB electricity tariffs and BGÉ gas tariffs is the statutory responsibility of the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) under the Electricity Regulation Act.  I note yesterday's announcement by the CER of its Phase 2 decision on ESB and BGÉ tariffs, which is reflective of the recent easing in international market prices for gas and coal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1196">The upward global trend in energy prices generally reinforces the imperative for Ireland to reduce its dependency on fossil fuels and to use energy wisely and efficiently.  The Government is committed to accelerated delivery of our targets for renewable energy, which in the area of electricity has recently been increased to 40% by 2020, and energy efficiency, which are essential to ensure a sustainable energy future for the economy and consumers.  My Department is working with other key Government Departments on initiatives to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy in electricity, transport and heating, and to implement major energy efficiency and demand management programmes for both domestic and business consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1197">The continued global volatility in energy prices is a cause for concern among EU Member States and I am working with my EU colleagues on strategies to enhance security of supply sustainability and competitiveness.  These include the acceleration of renewable energy and energy efficiency measures, ongoing investment in energy infrastructure, increasing the transparency of oil and gas markets, and enhanced dialogue with oil and gas producing countries.</p>

            <p eId="para_1199">The Government has not considered the issue of possible purchase of eircom infrastructure.  The issue of whether this infrastructure would be offered for sale is a matter for eircom, under the Government's telecommunications infrastructure strategy the private sector has primary responsibility for the development of such infrastructure.  There are a number of infrastructure providers of which eircom is one. Eircom is on record as saying it remains committed to developing broadband to as many parts of the country as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1200">Ireland has a vibrant broadband market with service providers offering services across a range of platforms at increasingly fast speeds.  In addition the National Broadband Scheme for which the preferred bidder was recently announced, will bring broadband to those parts of the country where a commercial service cannot be provided.  This will result in broadband being available universally throughout the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_1205">I propose to take Questions Nos. 109 and 385 to 387, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1206">In 2007, the latest year for which published dated is available, electricity from renewable energy resources contributed 9.4% of electricity consumed. The contribution by resource was 6.7% wind, 2.2% hydro and 0.5% biomass. These technologies harness indigenous energy sources thereby reducing our dependency on imports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1207">The dominant renewable energy technology is now wind-powered.  Eirgrid calculates that there are 97 wind-farms currently connected to the electricity grid with a combined installed capacity of 1002 megawatts and a further 490 projects with a combined installed capacity of 11500 megawatts in different stages of the connection application process. Any disputes about connection offers, including access to offers, are within the statutory authority of the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). The CER has recently published a decision on access to connection offers for at least 3,900 megawatts of capacity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1208">The projects awaiting connection offers are at different stages within the planning application process. Planning applications are submitted to the local Planning Authority in the first instance. There is no central register of such applications or their status. It Is not possible, therefore, to quantify the number of projects in any particular phase within the planning application process.  However every compliant project which has been submitted to the REFIT support programme, with both planning permission and a connection offer, has been offered support.</p>
            <p eId="para_1209">The Government targets are to increase the contribution by renewable energy technologies to electricity consumed to 15% at least, by 2010 and 40% by 2020. Wind-powered plants will continue to be the dominant technology to 2010 and will be a substantial contributor to the 2020 target.  It is expected that current support and research into other alternative technologies will also see technologies harnessing biomass and ocean-power play an increasing role in delivering the 2020 target.</p>

            <p eId="para_1211">The provision of telecommunications services including broadband services is, in the first instance, a matter for the private sector.  The relevant service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.</p>
            <p eId="para_1212">The broadband market is a fast moving and dynamic one; this applies to all OECD countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1213">On this basis, annual comparisons of broadband metrics between different countries cannot capture the full extent of market developments.  For example, the OECD statistics do not include mobile broadband, which now has 222,300 subscribers in Ireland and accounts for approximately 21% of all broadband delivered, making it one of the highest rates within the EU.  In addition, a number of offers available in Ireland now include broadband speeds of 20 Mbps and would not be reflected in most recent OECD figures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1214">A survey conducted by the OECD on the affordability of a broadband product in the various markets based on the "cost of broadband as a proportion of GDP per capita" instead of simply looking at the price ranks Ireland 6th, as at October 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1215">Recent surveys conducted by ComReg indicate that the majority of Irish people are content with existing broadband speeds and the value for money of their Internet service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1216">While investment in broadband infrastructure is primarily a matter for telecoms operators, Government has invested and will continue to invest in broadband infrastructure in order to address the digital divide and regional inequalities.  The broadband policy consultation paper, which I published last July, sets out a number of proposed initiatives including the utilisation of State infrastructure for broadband connectivity, establishment of a one-stop shop to facilitate this and opening up of broadband access to new buildings.  These proposals are being advanced.  In addition, the preferred bidder for the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) was recently announced.  The NBS will significantly improve broadband coverage, especially in rural areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_1221">Following on from the recent Government decision to establish an inter-departmental/agency group to look at deployment of electric vehicles in Ireland, it was agreed that my Department would oversee the group.  All relevant Government Departments, including the Department of Transport, and agencies are represented on the group.  The group will examine the best way forward to promote the use of electric vehicles in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1222">My Department has also been working directly with the Department of Transport to progress matters in the context of the Sustainable Transport and Travel Action Plan currently being finalised by my colleague, the Minister for Transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_1223">In association with the Minister for Transport, I recently announced plans for the mass deployment of electric vehicles in Ireland.  We have set a target of 10% of all vehicles in the transport fleet to be powered by electricity by 2020 which will represent up to 250,000 cars on Irish roads over the next 12 years.  We propose to aid this by introducing tax incentives for businesses to purchase electric vehicles allowing them to write off 100% of the cost of purchase against tax under the Accelerated Capital Allowance Scheme. Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) will also be funding a €1 million project to research, develop and demonstrate alternative transport technologies including electric vehicles nationally.  SEI has also published a Buyers Guide and a Cost of Ownership Calculator to aid individuals interested in purchasing electric vehicles. We will be establishing a National Task Force to examine the infrastructure options for the national roll-out of electric vehicles, including street charging.  I attended a press event in relation to the Dún Laoghaire Rathdown Council motion and as such I was aware of their intent.</p>
            <p eId="para_1224">With regard to emissions for the transport sector the latest figures, which relate to 2006, show transport accounted for 13.72 million tonnes of CO2 which equates to 19.7% of all green house gas emissions.  In 2020 transport is expected to account for 16.9 million tonnes of CO2, which equates to 20.6% of all greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

            <p eId="para_1286">While the issue of emissions levels at Moneypoint Generating Station is, in the first instance, a day-to-day management matter for the company, I have included with this reply, at Table 1, details of the annual CO2 emissions from Moneypoint Generating Station for the period 2005-2007.  These emission levels have been verified in accordance with the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme Directive and recorded by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in its CO2 emissions Registry.</p>
            <p eId="para_1287">I can advise the Deputy that emissions are directly related to fuel use, which is determined by generation output.  The historic emission trend is not an indicator of future emissions.  The future emissions profile will depend on market conditions, in particular the economics of generation from coal which is relative to gas and the price of EU (CO2) allowances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1288">I would draw the Deputy's attention to the report entitled "Assessment of the Potential for Geological Storage of Carbon Dioxide for the Island of Ireland", which was commissioned by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Geological Survey of Ireland (GSI) and Geological Survey of Northern Ireland (GSINI).  The report quantifies potential carbon storage capacity on the island which is considerably greater than the actual total annual CO2 emissions in Ireland from large single point sources such as Moneypoint Powerstation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1289">Following on the publication of the Report in September, at my request, my Department is chairing an Inter-Departmental/Inter-Agency Group representative of all stakeholders which is now examining the Report's recommendations as well as the complex range of regulatory and legal matters inherent in carbon capture and storage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1290">Negotiations are underway on the Carbon Capture and Storage Directive proposed by the EU Commission as part of the Climate Change and Renewable Energy Package.  The Directive will provide guidance for Member States on appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks to govern carbon capture and storage from all perspectives.  The EU Commission is also proposing the establishment of at least 12 demonstration plants in Europe designed to test and prove the various technological options for the sequestration of carbon.</p>
            <p eId="para_1291">Developments on carbon capture and storage in Ireland, including appropriate legal frameworks, will continue to be fully informed by EU and International developments.</p>

            <p eId="para_1301">EirGrid, as the State body responsible for the national transmission system, is working to deliver the necessary upgrading and expansion of the transmission grid in the interests of the economy and regional development.  I welcome the call by EirGrid's Chief Executive for collective engagement by all stakeholders in meeting the challenges inherent in delivering vitally needed new transmission infrastructure, which is safe, reliable, affordable and sustainable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1302">I share his view that all stakeholders working together have to find a way to balance overall public good and economic and social policy objectives with the concerns of individuals and local communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1303">The development of our high capacity grid network is needed to meet overall demand for electricity by business and consumers, to provide the critical infrastructure needed for balanced regional development and security of supply and to deliver on Ireland's renewable energy targets.  If we are to achieve significant levels of penetration of renewable energy onto the network, major development of the transmission grid is required.</p>
            <p eId="para_1304">EirGrid launched its Grid Development Strategy, Grid25, on 8th October 2008.  It sets out a roadmap for the development of the electricity transmission network for the next 17 years and aims to invest €4bn in the grid over that period, effectively doubling the grid's current capacity.  The strategy is designed to meet forecasted national electricity demand and to attract and maintain industry in the regions.  It also allows for increased interconnectivity with the European grid, thereby allowing increasing competition in the market, contributing to security of supply and providing opportunities for indigenous renewable energy generation.  Grid25's strategies and assumptions around renewable energy generation are consistent with the All-island Grid Study and provide for renewable energy penetration of up to 40% by 2025, in line with Government targets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1305">I welcome the progress that EirGrid is already making in rolling out key grid infrastructure projects such as the East West Interconnector, North South and Meath Cavan Transmission lines.  These projects are scheduled to be delivered in 2012.  These projects are critical in terms of regional and national demand and will support the increased penetration of renewable generation, particularly wind generation, in the Irish market.  The East West Interconnector will also allow surplus power to be exported to Britain in times of high wind generation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1306">There are very many challenges ahead.  I have every confidence that EirGrid, as the State-owned transmission company, will continue to work in the national interest and in conjunction with all stakeholders, to deliver a sustainable transmission system in support of economic and social needs.  I look forward to continued positive engagement from stakeholders and public representatives on this important national priority and I am confident, that EirGrid will remain on track to deliver on our ambitious but achievable renewable electricity targets.</p>

            <p eId="para_1309">I would advise the Deputy that the National Consumer Agency, which operates under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, is currently undertaking a survey into the relationship between pump prices for petrol and diesel and the wholesale price of crude oil.  I understand that as part of its work, the Agency will seek to benchmark movements in prices in Ireland against those in other EU countries and that it will also seek to examine the frequency and the timeliness in which changes in the wholesale price are being passed on to consumers.

            <p eId="para_1315">The Programme for Government target refers to a 3% reduction per year on average in greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1316">The energy sector for which I have policy responsibility will make a leading contribution towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions through a range of measures designed to improve energy efficiency and increase the penetration of renewable energy across the electricity, heat and transport sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1317">Among the significant energy efficiency initiatives introduced already this year are the extension of the accelerated capital allowance scheme, which allows companies to write off for tax purposes the full capital cost of certain classes of energy efficient equipment in the year of purchase and the Pilot Home Energy Savings Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1318">The 2009 Budget indicated that the range of tax allowance qualifying energy efficient equipment is being widened to include energy efficient data server systems and on site electricity generation equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1319">I am allocating significant resources of €20 million to the Home Energy Saving Scheme in 2009, an increase of €15 million on 2008, in order to provide grants of up to 30% of the cost of retro-fitting homes.  This scheme will increase energy efficiency and lead to CO2 savings and complements the Warmer Homes Scheme, which provides insulation and energy advice to low income households.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is introducing a new scheme to examine the potential for energy savings in local authority housing stock through the retrofitting of older heating systems with new green energies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1320">The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan, which I intend to publish before the end of the year, will set out the Government's comprehensive programme of action to be implemented across all sectors to deliver on our national and EU targets for energy efficiency, along with resulting reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1321">The Government has recently increased the target for renewable electricity to 40% by 2020.  The target is underpinned by analysis conducted in the recent All Island Grid Study, which found that a 40% penetration is technically feasible, subject to upgrading our electricity grid and ensuring the development of flexible generating plant on the electricity system.  The study concluded that achieving this higher level of renewable electricity would reduce our carbon emissions from electricity by 25% over the business-as-usual scenario, a saving of around 5 million tonnes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1322">Last week, in conjunction with my colleague, the Minister for Transport, I set out our plans for the mass deployment of electric vehicles in Ireland.  The Government has set a target of 10% of all vehicles in the transport fleet to be powered by electricity by 2020.  This will represent some 250,000 cars on Irish roads over the next 12 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1323">This sends a signal to national and international players developing new transport technologies that Ireland is ‘open for business', as a centre for electric vehicles.  This initiative has multiple benefits.  In addition to reducing fossil fuel imports and helping to tackle climate change, it will attract investment and jobs to Ireland and will stimulate our motor, electricity and green technology industries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1324">Other energy initiatives funded by my Department and designed to move us towards lower carbon emissions include the major ocean energy research and development programme and Sustainable Energy Ireland's heating sector programmes (the Greener Homes Scheme and the Reheat and Combined Heat and Power programmes).</p>

            <p eId="para_1326">In February of this year I announced a tariff of €140 per megawatt hour of power produced for offshore wind energy projects within the Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff (REFIT) support scheme.  This announcement was made well in advance of the planned development of offshore wind projects to send a strong market signal and to ensure all State aid requirements could be clarified and resolved in a timely way.</p>
            <p eId="para_1327">Under the existing State aid clearance for REFIT, all projects are required to be commenced by 2010.  The imposition of this timeline was designed to ensure that Ireland met its 2010 target for renewable energy.  My Department is now working to put in place more appropriate timelines to support progressive delivery on the 2020 target.  Under the Commission's new Block Exemption Regulation, my Department is now in a position to adjust the REFIT timelines without notification to the Commission.  The timeline for the offshore category should appropriately reflect the projections for actual delivery of connections to individual projects.  A number of offshore projects are included in the list of Gate 3 projects for connection offers recently published by the Commission for Energy Regulation.  It is expected these developers will be in a position to provide realistic projections of their commissioning plans to my Department shortly.  I intend to publish amended timelines for all REFIT categories including the offshore category in the near future, which will facilitate delivery of our renewable energy target up to 2020.</p>

            <p eId="para_1329">The publication of the Geothermal Resource Map of Ireland by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) in July 2004 highlighted the potential of deep geothermal energy.  The report recommended that support be given for a medium-depth pilot borehole, for example on the Blackrock–Rathcoole Fault in an area with many potential users.  SEI has funded a study, in conjunction with University College Dublin and Conodate, to examine the economic and technical potential of deep geothermal energy sources along the Fault.  Following on this a private company is undertaking exploratory work at Newcastle, County Dublin.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the matter in advance of the company's own announcement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1330">In relation to the work of the Geothermal Working Group, the Deputy may be aware that a public consultation process was held between June and August 2008.  Over 30 submissions were received, mainly from people and organisations closely associated with geothermal development in Ireland.  The consultation exercise has now closed and the results are being analysed.  I expect that the Working Group will report to me before the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1331">The Working Group will report on effective regulatory and other measures that could be taken to increase the contribution of geothermal energy to meeting Ireland's targets for use of alternative energy.

            <p eId="para_1352">In this context, I welcome Sustainable Energy Ireland's report on Understanding Electricity and Gas Prices in Ireland, which provides a valuable insight into the drivers of higher energy costs in our market.  In particular, the report underlines the imperative to reduce Ireland's dependence on imported fossil fuels and our exposure to volatile international market prices for these commodities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1353">I note yesterday's announcement by the Commission for Energy Regulation of its Phase 2 decision on ESB and Bord Gáis Éireann tariffs, which is reflective of recent easing in international prices, particularly for gas and coal.

            <p eId="para_1357">Under the Energy Policy Framework and the Programme for Government, we are committed to the progressive development of a regional electricity market with the UK and North West Europe underpinned by new interconnection.  The current focus is on the East West Electricity Interconnector, which is of vital strategic importance to Ireland and its delivery to schedule by 2012 is a key Government priority.</p>
            <p eId="para_1358">EirGrid, the independent transmission system operator, has recently published its Grid25 study, which provides a strategy for the development of Ireland's electricity grid for a sustainable and competitive future.  This study states that it is likely, that by 2025 at least, one further interconnector from this system to another offshore system, either Britain or France, will be in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1359">The Government maintains, as have successive Governments over many years, that nuclear power is neither sustainable nor the answer to meeting Ireland's energy needs.  The use of nuclear fission for the generation of electricity in Ireland is statutorily prohibited under Section 18(6) of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999.  Furthermore, Section 3 of the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 states that "Nothing in this Act shall be construed as enabling the authorisation of development consisting of an installation for the generation of electricity by nuclear fission".</p>
            <p eId="para_1360">These prohibitions do not include the importation of electricity generated by nuclear energy.  Legal advice received by my Department states that such a prohibition would be in breach of Article 28 of the EC Treaty, which prohibits quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect between Member States.</p>
            <p eId="para_1361">I am therefore advised that a prohibition on the importation of electricity generated with the use of nuclear energy would be highly unlikely to have a legal justification even if it were technically feasible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1362">I am further advised that it is not technically possible to guarantee that electricity imported over an interconnector is not generated from nuclear sources as it is not physically possible to prevent the flow of nuclear generated electricity onto the network.  Nor is it possible to distinguish the flow of electricity across interconnectors by reference to the original source of supply or generation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1364">Broadband services are crucial in bridging digital divide.  The provision of telecommunications services including broadband is, in the first instance, a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.</p>
            <p eId="para_1365">The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard, my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These included providing grant-aid under the now concluded Group Broadband Scheme (GBS) and ongoing investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).</p>
            <p eId="para_1366">Although broadband is now widely available in Ireland there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  These areas are being addressed by the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), which will ensure that all requests for a broadband service in the areas to be addressed by the NBS will be met.</p>
            <p eId="para_1367">On the 25 November 2008 I announced that 3, a Hutchison Whampoa company, has been selected as the preferred tenderer for the NBS following the conclusion of a comprehensive competitive procurement process.  The NBS contract is expected to be signed with 3 by mid-December.</p>
            <p eId="para_1368">NBS consumers will be provided with a reliable and price competitive broadband connection consisting of an always-on service of at least 1mbps.  The service will be upgraded to higher specifications during the 68-month contract without any increase in charge to the consumer.</p>

            <p eId="para_1370">The Live Register series gives a monthly breakdown of the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Benefit, Jobseeker's Allowance and other registrants as registered with the Department of Social and Family Affairs.

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1576">I propose to take Questions Nos. 138 and 142 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1577">Any comparison of the respective VAT rates between the UK and Ireland must take account of the fact that the fiscal positions of both countries are very different.  In this regard it should be borne in mind that Ireland already has a low tax economy by comparison with other competing economies, especially in the area of direct taxation on both business and labour, which has a direct impact on all companies and workers in the State.  This lower starting position for taxation makes it more difficult to reduce taxes further.</p>
            <p eId="para_1578">I am aware that some businesses in the retail sector have taken initiatives to respond to the sterling differential and the effect of the VAT rate in the North.  My Department does not have programmes or policies to specifically support the retail sector.  However, my development agencies are providing specialised assistance to firms to help them develop products and services that are better able to withstand purely cost-based competitive pressures.  Total Enterprise Ireland approvals to the end of November across the Border region were €9.86m to 122 companies and payments up to the end of November totalled €8.66m to 152 companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1579">Enterprise Ireland has more than 730 client companies, employing more than 21,400 people across the Border region.  Enterprise Ireland Border regional offices are involved in various support activities aimed at developing capabilities and encouraging companies that are currently only trading locally to expand their markets abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_1580">The County Enterprise Boards (CEBs) play an extremely important role in the development of indigenous enterprise in the Border region and it is my intention that an appropriate level of financial support for all CEBs will continue to be made available.  The local base of the CEBs who are responsible for the delivery of the micro-enterprise measure in the Border regions means that the projects supported are tailored to the particular needs of that regional economic environment.  In relation to non-financial support the CEBs engage in a range of activities to stimulate enterprise and to support small businesses such as mentoring and training programmes.</p>

        <b>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</b>
         if she will host a special event in Tralee, County Kerry, together with the CEO’s of Industrial Development Authority, Enterprise Ireland and FÁS to address the serious increase in the live register in County Kerry, which represents a yearly change of 67% and a monthly change of 12%, the highest in the country; and if she will make a statement on the matter. 
        [43551/08]

          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_508">
            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1582">The recent increase in the numbers on the live register is unwelcome and is an indication of the challenges that are now facing the labour market and the economy as a whole.</p>
            <p eId="para_1583">The Government is taking specific measures to address these challenges and to ensure that job losses are minimised as much as possible.  Our priority is to create the environment that will allow those who have lost their jobs to quickly return to the labour market.  The enterprise development agencies, along with FÁS, are actively engaged in facilitating job opportunities in Kerry.</p>
            <p eId="para_1584">IDA Ireland's strategy for Kerry has been to promote the county as part of an integrated region with access both to the county population as well as to the expanded population of both the Mid West and South West Regions.  At the end of 2007 there were 16 IDA Ireland supported companies in Kerry employing approximately 1,838 people.  Based on the strengths of the region IDA Ireland is particularly targeting the ICT (incl. software), International Financial Services and Globally Traded Business sectors via its network of overseas offices and project divisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1585">In Tralee, IDA Ireland is marketing Shannon Development's Kerry Technology Park.  Enterprise Ireland has provided over €2m in capital as well as other supports for the development of Incubation facilities also located in the Park.  IDA Ireland continues to market all available land and buildings in the county including its 12 acre Business and Technology Park at Tiernaboul, Killarney, Co. Kerry.</p>
            <p eId="para_1586">New indigenous companies have also been established and have created new employment in the county.  In 2007 an investment of €21 million was announced under the Community Enterprise Centre scheme which will run over three years (2007-2009).  It is expected to generate 330 new businesses and create over 1500 new jobs.  In September 2008, 70 new jobs were announced for Aetna in Castleisland.  Earlier this year it was announced that the Tralee-based company Donseed Ltd is to invest €1.2m to accelerate international growth.  This investment will enhance the company's in house R&amp;D and sales functions and create 26 new high-value positions at the company over the next two years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1587">In response to the changes in the labour market, the FÁS Training Centre in Tralee is currently finalising activity proposals for next year.  A new range of training initiatives will be rolled out, which include a number of new short courses, of approximately six weeks duration, which will be scheduled through contract arrangements at locations throughout Kerry.  These courses are aimed at providing additional skills to recently unemployed people with a view to equipping them to quickly re-enter the work force.</p>
            <p eId="para_1588">Additional places will also be offered to the unemployed who wish to participate in self-financing evening courses at a number of venues in the county.  Also, on-line training options using a number of learning supports will be available with priority access for the unemployed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1589">The Government and the State development agencies, under the aegis of my Department, are fully committed to meeting the economic and employment challenges being faced in Kerry.</p>

            <p eId="para_1626">In addition, FÁS has agreed with the Department of Social and Family Affairs that apprentices who make a claim for Jobseeker Allowance/Benefit, will be directly referred to FÁS for assistance.  Following such referrals FÁS works closely with apprentices to support them in obtaining suitable employment and to allow them to complete their apprenticeship as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1627">When an apprentice is made redundant, and has notified FÁS or the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the FÁS Services to Business and FÁS Employment Services Divisions work in collaboration to assist the apprentice in finding a new employer to allow them to complete their apprenticeship.</p>
            <p eId="para_1628">Data regarding the placement of redundant apprentices with new employers is only available on an aggregate basis for 2007/8.  During this period 757 redundant apprentices were placed with an employer.  During 2007/8 a further 133 redundant apprentices completed their apprenticeships.  Redundant apprentices are scheduled for their next off-the-job phase in accordance with the existing scheduling policy and priority is given to getting the apprentice back into employment to complete their apprenticeship with a FÁS approved employer.  FÁS continues to work hard to match these redundant apprentices to vacancies in their trade.</p>
            <p eId="para_1629">The Apprenticeship Management System has been altered as an interim measure to permit redundant apprentices to attend the next off-the-job phase of their training, within the existing scheduling policy.  439 redundant apprentices are attending one of the off-the-job phases (phases 2, 4 and 6) and 505 redundant apprentices have been scheduled to attend on of these off-the-job phases.  The detail of these figures is as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_1630">Phase 2: 123 of the 2,689 apprentices currently attending phase 2 are classified as redundant.  In addition, 68 of the 763 apprentices who are due to attend phase 2 within the next 12 weeks are classified as redundant.</p>
            <p eId="para_1631">Phases 4 and 6: 316 of the 3,832 apprentices currently attending phases 4 and 6 are classified as redundant.  In addition, 437 of the 3,720 apprentices who are due to attend phases 4 and 6 in January 2009 are classified as redundant.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_4866">I launched the report of the Services Strategy Group, "Catching the Wave:  A Services Strategy for Ireland" in September.  This report sets out new policy proposals on how we can ensure the continued development and growth of Ireland's services sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_4867">The report aims to develop a comprehensive, forward-looking assessment of how to maximise the returns to Ireland from services activities, and in so doing it identifies three strategic aims for future services policy in Ireland:</p>
            <p eId="para_4868">1. Realising the opportunities to further grow and diversify Irish services exports;</p>
            <p eId="para_4869">2. Encouraging internationalisation, where Irish service enterprises establish  operations in overseas markets;</p>
            <p eId="para_4870">3. Recognising the important role of Irish service enterprises that trade locally on the domestic market, and ensuring that these are efficient and productive.</p>
            <p eId="para_4871">The report makes a number of wide ranging recommendations, which cut across a number of Government Departments.  The Secretary-General of my Department has written to his counterparts in other Departments seeking their views on those recommendations that fall within their policy remit and how these might be implemented.  In addition, officials of my own Department are currently undertaking an examination of the recommendations within the report, relevant to the enterprise agenda,  When this process is complete, I expect to be in a position to formulate a comprehensive response to the various recommendations set out in the strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_4872">Actions are already taking place in some areas.  For example, on 19 November, I launched Enterprise Ireland's strategy for the internationalisation of Ireland's services sector, which the agency estimates could yield up to €1.14bn in new export sales for Ireland by 2010, and a doubling of exports sales in this sector to €5.25bn by 2015.  On the same day I also announced Enterprise Ireland's new "Going Global Fund" — a €3m government fund specifically aimed at locally traded companies that have successfully established businesses in Ireland and wish to explore opportunities to sell abroad.  These plans and supports will give ambitious services firms, particularly those that have not looked beyond the Irish market yet, the confidence to offer their quality services in global markets, generating wealth and prosperity for the economy back home.</p>
            <p eId="para_4873">We continue to be one of the world's leading service exporting countries and are currently ranked the 10th highest exporter of services in the world.  Over the next ten years, services will be one of the key drivers of Ireland's economic success and job creation.  We already have a strong base from which to drive this internationalisation of Irish services — the Irish services sector accounts for two-thirds of the workforce in Ireland and 60 per cent of the value.</p>
            <p eId="para_4874">Implementation of the recommendations of the Services Strategy Group — some of which are already being acted on by the Enterprise Agencies — will enable Irish service companies to exploit new and exciting opportunities, such as eLearning, business and financial services, professional and consultancy services and others.  Given a relatively solid foundation to begin with, Ireland can be an ideal location for services to develop and prosper.</p>

            <p eId="para_4885">The National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission publishes a report on the performance of the National Pensions Reserve Fund at the end of each quarter.  The report for the third quarter of this year shows that the market value of the Fund at 30 September was €18.7 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_4886">This represented a return of -17.3% for the first nine months of 2008, reducing the Fund's annualised return since inception to 2.8%.  As the Deputy will appreciate, investment returns have been extremely volatile in recent times.  For example, the Fund's return was 12.4% in 2006 and 3.3% in 2007, and the Fund's annualised return from its inception in April 2001 to end-2007 was 6.0%.</p>
            <p eId="para_4887">In relation to estimates for the end of this year and for 2009, the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission does not make near-term return projections given the Fund's long-term investment horizon, the fact it is invested mainly in real assets and the volatility of the performance of such assets over short time periods.</p>
            <p eId="para_4888">I do not propose to speculate on the value of the Fund in 2025.  In its 2007 Annual Report, the Commission states that, in seeking to meet the Fund's objective, it has adopted an investment strategy primarily focused on building up a diversified portfolio of equities and other real assets.  Such an asset allocation offers the prospect of superior long-term returns but can expose the Fund to high levels of short-term volatility.  However, one of the critical factors underlying the Commission's investment strategy is the Fund's long-term investment horizon.  With no drawdowns before 2025, it can afford to accept periods of volatility as a trade-off for achieving a long-term return that will make a meaningful contribution to Ireland's future pension costs and the sustainability of the pension system.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_4895">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that as a general rule all vehicles imported permanently into the State must register for Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) purposes within one working day of arrival.  This rule applies equally to vehicles imported by EU and non EU persons.  In practice, Revenue allows latitude of a maximum of seven days for registration.</p>
            <p eId="para_4896">However, Section 135(a) of the Finance Act 1992 permits a European or other foreign-registered vehicle which is temporarily brought into the State by a person established outside the State to be exempted from the requirement to register for VRT purposes for a period normally not exceeding 12 months from the date upon which the vehicle concerned was brought into the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_4897">There is no requirement for vehicles imported under temporary exemption provisions to be presented to the Revenue Commissioners in order to avail of the relief.  Documents relating to ownership, registration and the importation of the vehicle into the State must be kept with the vehicle when it is in use in the State.  When such vehicles fail to meet the conditions for temporary exemption, they must be permanently removed from the State or presented for registration.  Details of such vehicles are therefore not normally captured or held in the vehicle registration system.</p>
            <p eId="para_4898">Statutory Instrument No. 60 of 1993 prescribes the criteria for eligibility for the granting of temporary exemption on registration.  These provisions are in line with Article 39 of the EU Treaty, which provides for the free movement of people within the EU; and a reciprocal arrangement is also in place for our own State residents in fellow Member States.</p>
            <p eId="para_4899">The Deputy may wish to note that Revenue mobile units and An Garda Síochána continue to monitor both Irish and foreign-registered vehicles on our roads as part of their regular and ongoing enforcement activity.  For their part, Revenue mobile units challenged 16,831 vehicles up to the end of October this year.  Of these, some 12,177 satisfied Revenue officials that the registration status was in order at that particular time and no further action was taken.  2,142 vehicles were registered for VRT purposes as a direct consequence of these investigations and a further 1,286 were seized.  In addition to the VRT collected, penalties in excess of €960,000 were charged in respect of these vehicles.  Up to the end of October 2008, some 50,000 second hand vehicles were registered and the total VRT paid amounted to €170m.  There is no doubt that there is some evasion of VRT with individuals delaying registration as long as possible.  The Deputy will be aware that I have brought forward proposals in the Finance Bill to address this issue, by tightening the rules in relation to the registration of second hand vehicles and the late payment of VRT.</p>
            <p eId="para_4900">Dealers in vehicles are entitled to import second-hand vehicles.  If they are authorised to hold and deal in unregistered vehicles (TAN holders), they must register the vehicle on the sale of the vehicle to a private individual or other unauthorised person.  If they are not a TAN holder, they must register the vehicle in the normal way.  In relation to the registration of second hand vehicles by dealers who are either not TAN holders or who are abusing their authorised status, Revenue officials are constantly monitoring potential evasion of VRT and VAT.  I am advised by Revenue that new measures to cancel an authorisation to hold unregistered vehicles introduced since the 2008 Finance Act are being implemented in specific cases of abuse of the authorised dealer status.</p>
            <p eId="para_4901">I am very conscious of the area of VRT evasion and the distortion of competition.  The measures I am introducing in the Finance Bill are part of our response.  Ongoing enforcement activity by the various agencies within the sector — the Road Safety Authority, the Gardaí, local authorities and Revenue  — aim to ensure compliance with all aspects of traffic management of the national vehicle fleet.  Indeed, it should be borne in mind that the right to import a vehicle, register it and pay the appropriate taxation on time is protected and honoured by the majority of those who source their vehicles abroad.  Notwithstanding this, I believe the measures proposed in the Bill will improve the regulatory framework in this area.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_521">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_4905">I propose to take Questions Nos. 155, 157 and 163 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4906">As part of a fiscal stimulus package, the UK Government reduced their standard VAT rate from 17.5% to 15% on a temporary basis with effect from 1 December 2008 to 31 December 2009.  There are no plans to make a similar reduction in the standard VAT rate in Ireland or to reduce the rate to the UK level of 15%.</p>
            <p eId="para_4907">It must be recognised that our starting point is different from the UK's.  We already have a low taxation economy, especially in the area of direct taxation, both income and corporation taxes, which has a direct impact on all employment in the State.  This lower starting position for direct taxation makes it is more difficult to reduce taxes further.</p>
            <p eId="para_4908">Already we are borrowing 10% of all day to day spending on public services (before capital spending).  This is unsustainable and we faced difficult choices in bringing forward corrective measures.  In the recent Budget, the Government introduced a general package of revenue-raising measures to fund key public services in this regard, one measure of which was increasing the standard VAT rate by 0.5%.</p>
            <p eId="para_4909">Each 1 percentage point reduction in our standard VAT rate would cost around €450 million in a full year.  For Ireland to reduce the standard VAT rate by 2.5 percentage points would cost around €1,125 million in a full year.  For Ireland to reduce the standard VAT rate to the UK level of 15%, which would mean a reduction in the standard VAT rate of 6.5 percentage points, would cost almost €3 billion in a full year.  This is equivalent to around two and a half times the amount of revenues to be raised in a full year through the new income levy.</p>
            <p eId="para_4910">Some of the goods and services that will be affected by the increase in the standard rate are alcohol, cigarettes, cars, petrol, electrical equipment, furniture, telecommunications, cosmetics, confectionery, soft drinks and adult clothing and footwear.  The effect of the 0.5% increase in the standard rate is that goods and services that apply at this rate will increase by around0.41%.  In other words, it means an increase of 8 cent on an item costing €20, or 41 cent on an item costing €100.</p>
            <p eId="para_4911">It should be noted that around half the value of goods and services purchased in the State are not subject to the standard VAT rate and therefore are unaffected by the recent Budget changes in Ireland and the UK.  For example, all Government services, local authorities, hospitals and schools etc., are exempt from VAT.  The majority of foodstuffs, oral medicines, books and children's clothes and shoes are at the zero rate of VAT.  Furthermore, the 13.5% reduced rate of VAT applies to housing, electricity, gas, domestic fuels, restaurant services, and labour intensive services such as hairdressing and shoe repair.</p>
            <p eId="para_4912">Although the reduction in the UK standard VAT rate, will have an impact on the price differential on some goods between the North and the South, I would point out that the UK have increased excise on alcohol, cigarettes, petrol and diesel to offset the 2.5% reduction in VAT on those items.  Consequently there will be no reduction in the price of those products in Northern Ireland as a result of the reduction in the UK VAT rate to 15%.</p>
            <p eId="para_4913">As a small open economy, many of our standard rated goods are imported, and cutting the VAT rate could benefit the economies from which we import more than our own.  In other words, while, it might help the consumer, it would not be the most effective way of helping our own economy.  There are other means of stimulating the economy, outside of the VAT system.  The Government is providing a long term fiscal stimulus through capital investment of approximately 5% of GNP, which is twice the average in the EU.  This fiscal stimulus will not only support jobs in the short term but will also add to our long term productive capacity.</p>
            <p eId="para_4914">Irish taxation policy has given us a significant competitive advantage over the past 15 years.  We have ensured that we have had the lowest levels of direct taxation on income, therefore we have had marginally higher indirect taxation.  That model of taxation has worked well for our economy and will be even more important now in leading us back to the path of economic growth.  According to the latest OECD data relating to 2007, Ireland has the lowest tax wedge in the EU for single, married one-income and married two-income couples on average earnings.  A low tax wedge makes it easier for employers to employ staff.  After the Budget changes, we are still one of the lowest taxed economies in the EU.</p>

            <p eId="para_4927">I announced the introduction of the Cycle to Work Scheme in Budget 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_4928">The purpose of the scheme is to encourage more employees to cycle to and from work, to contribute to lowering carbon emissions, to help reduce traffic congestion, and to improve health and fitness levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_4929">The scheme allows an employer to provide an employee with a bicycle and cycle safety equipment as a benefit of their employment, without the employee being liable to benefit-in-kind taxation.  The scheme applies where the bicycle will be used by the employee for travelling to and from work or for travelling between workplaces.</p>
            <p eId="para_4930">The scheme can be implemented through salary sacrifice arrangements in a similar manner to the existing Travel Pass Scheme.  Under such an arrangement, the employer provides the bicycle and safety equipment to the employee who agrees to forego or sacrifice part of his or her salary every pay period in order to cover the cost of the bicycle and safety equipment.  Any salary sacrifice arrangement must be completed within a maximum period of twelve months and the arrangement will be reflected in the employee's pay over that period.</p>
            <p eId="para_4931">The bicycle and safety equipment are exempt from benefit-in-kind taxation up to a limit of €1,000.  Thus the employee will not be liable to income tax, employee PRSI, or levies on the cost of the bicycle and safety equipment.  The employer will also benefit in that employer PRSI is not payable on the cost of the bicycle and safety equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_4932">Participation in the scheme is voluntary for employers.  However, where an employer agrees to participate, he or she must make the scheme generally available, on an equal basis, to all employees requesting it.</p>
            <p eId="para_4933">There are no in-built restrictions in the scheme regarding where the bicycle and associated safety equipment can be purchased.  This is a matter for employers as they will be purchasing the bicycles and safety equipment in all instances.  The tax exempt benefit-in-kind will be limited to €1,000.  Where the cost exceeds this amount, a BIK charge will apply to the balance.  The bicycle and safety equipment may only be provided to an individual employee once in a five year period.</p>
            <p eId="para_4934">It is not envisaged, at this stage, that there will be a notification procedure for employers to indicate to the Revenue Commissioners that they are operating the scheme.  However, the purchase of bicycles and associated safety equipment by employers for employees will be subject to the normal Revenue audit procedure with the normal obligations on employers to maintain records (e.g. invoices, salary sacrifice agreements between employer and employee, such agreements to include a statement from employees that the bicycle and safety equipment are for their own use and will be used for travelling to and from work).</p>
            <p eId="para_4935">Guidelines on the operation of the scheme will be made available by the Revenue Commissioners when the Finance Bill is approved by the Oireachtas.</p>

            <p eId="para_4940">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that traders selling goods at zero rate of VAT to traders in other EU Member States have obligations in relation to verifying the VAT numbers of those traders.  This may be done through the EU Internet website to which they have free access.  Otherwise, traders leave themselves open to being held liable for the VAT on the goods if the number is invalid.  Traders also have obligations in relation to justifying the application of the zero rate, that is, that the goods have left the State and are not simply re-sold in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_4941">Checking the validity of VAT registration numbers, and indeed other tax compliance information, in cross Border transactions with their counterparts in Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs in Northern Ireland is part of the checks carried out by Revenue officers during audits and assurance checks where risk or suspicions arise.  These checks are carried out using the EU Mutual Assistance Programme.  This programme allows for exchanges of information between EU Member States in relation to VAT matters and it also allows the presence of officials from a Member State in another Member State while enquiries are being carried out.  These are VAT anti-fraud measures and Ireland plays a full role in the exchange of information with all other Member EU Sates, including the UK, with whom we have a very good working relationship.</p>
            <p eId="para_4942">The Revenue Commissioners advise that checks of the control procedures in place between the State and Northern Ireland will continue as part of the relevant work programmes in 2009 and that they will continue to liaise, as appropriate, with the competent authorities in Northern Ireland, under the EU Mutual Assistance programme.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_4987">The Government decided in July 2008 to secure payroll savings of 3% for Government Departments and public bodies, with the exception of primary and secondary level teachers and Special Needs Assistants in the education sector and staff involved in the direct delivery of essential health services.   This decision is reflected in the Estimates for 2009 through savings of €260 million that would otherwise have been included in the allocations for pay.  The Government subsequently decided that Government Departments and public bodies would have to meet the cost of the pay increase due in September 2009 from within the existing pay provisions set out in the Budget for 2009.  The savings arising from this measure will amount to an additional €234 million in 2009.   The combined effect of both these elements is equivalent to 4% of payroll for Government Departments and bodies in 2009, with the exception of the health and education areas referred to above.</p>
            <p eId="para_4988">The estimated carryover cost of pay increases (net of pensions) awarded in 2008 is €372 million.  Based on staff number projections supplied to my Department in preparation for the Budget, it is projected that the number of Civil and Public Servants (excluding Local Authority employees whose pay is not included in the Estimates) employed at the end of 2008 will be some 4,428 higher than at the end of 2007.  The corresponding projection for the end of 2009 over 2008 shows an overall reduction of 280 staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_4989">The pay and pensions allocation included in the 2009 Estimates is €20.042 billion (including €1.765 billion for pensions) in gross terms, an increase of €610 million over the figure in the 2008 Revised Estimates Volume.  There are a number of factors which explain this increase including:</p>
            <p eId="para_4990">€106 million increase for pensions (carryover cost of general increases made in 2008 and increases in the number of pensioners);</p>
            <p eId="para_4991">€224 million for the full year cost of additional teachers and Special Needs Assistants taken on in 2008;</p>
            <p eId="para_4992">€170 million in the health area (€140 million for the new consultants' contract and €30 million for Industrial Relations settlements); and</p>
            <p eId="para_4993">€110 million, which is a residual figure after factors such as the 2008 pay increases and the payroll reduction are taken into account.</p>

            <p eId="para_5019">The Health Service Executive (HSE) has responsibility for administering the health repayment scheme in conjunction with the appointed Scheme Administrator K.P.M.G. and McCann Fitzgerald.  The HSE has informed my Department that since commencement of the scheme over 35,000 applications for living and deceased patients have been received by the Health Repayment Scheme. To date over 18,900 claimants have received offers of repayment totalling over €362m and in excess of 14,900 payments have been made totalling over €317m. Further offers continue to be issued every week.</p>
            <p eId="para_5020">The HSE has advised that the Scheme is progressing as speedily as possible and every effort is being made to settle the remaining outstanding claims.  The HSE has advised that the Scheme Administrator is confident that the vast majority of claims submitted by the public will be concluded by the end of the year.  However, it should be noted that offers of repayment made towards the end of the year cannot be paid until the statutory 28 day period for appeals has elapsed and a completed acceptance form has been returned to the Scheme Administrator. Claimants who receive an offer must be given the opportunity to appeal the Scheme Administrator's decision regarding their claim and this may have an impact on the timeframe for finalisation of the Health Repayment Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5021">The Scheme Administrator continues to work closely with the HSE to ensure that the scheme is finalised as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_5025">For many years Dublin City Council, through Dublin Fire Brigade, has provided the emergency ambulance service in Dublin City on behalf of the statutory health authorities.  The relevant authority since 2005 is the Health Service Executive.  The HSE provides mainly the non-emergency patient transport in the Dublin area under the auspices of its National Ambulance Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_5026">I am committed to ensuring that ambulance services throughout the country are both safe and effective.  The arrangements in the Dublin area have been in place for many years.  There are potential benefits to be gained from a close alignment of ambulance and fire services, as occurs in Dublin.  Equally, a case can be made for applying the model that operates in the rest of the country, where ambulance services are provided separately from the fire service.</p>
            <p eId="para_5027">Safety is, of course, the primary concern.  For this reason, work is at present being undertaken by the health and local government sectors to consider the best long-term approach to the provision of emergency ambulance services in Dublin.  This includes examination of the potential for improved efficiency in the delivery of these services, to ensure that the best value for money is obtained.</p>

            <p eId="para_5031">The Department of Health and Children does not collect information on children identified with Autism and Asperger's on a national or international basis.  Information pertaining to diagnosis is specifically excluded from the National Intellectual Disability Database as the database is not designed as a medical epidemiological tool.  Accordingly the database does not record the incidence of Autism or any other disability. In 2004, the Department of Health and Children, through the Health Research Board, approved expenditure of €5 million on autism research to help improve international understanding of the genetic causes of autism.  This €5 million is the Irish contribution to a new major international research initiative called the Autism Genome Project which will receive a total investment of €12 million from a variety of international organisations over the next three years.  The other co-funders in the international consortium include Autism Speaks (US), the British Medical Research Council (CIHR), Southwest Autism Research and Resource Centre (SARRC), and the Hilibrand Foundation.  This unique combination of international, public and private partners funding a consortium of clinicians and scientists is a new and welcome departure in the field of autism research.  The Health Research Board has informed my Department that this funding was awarded as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_5032">€2.8 million: Professor Michael Gill, Department of Psychiatry, Trinity College, Dublin</p>
            <p eId="para_5033">€2.2 million: Professor Andrew Green, Director National Centre for Medical Genetics, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin (affiliated to UCD).</p>
            <p eId="para_5034">This figure represents the largest tranche of funding to be awarded by any of the four funders within the international consortium.  The Irish researchers are at the forefront in unravelling the genetic determinants of autism and related disorders.  They are using novel state of the art genetic sequencing technology to analyse DNA samples taken from autistic patients to identify candidate genetic markers for autism.  They will collaborate with their international colleagues to then link these genetic markers with clinical outcomes.  This unique international research effort will greatly improve not only our understanding of the causes of autism, but its diagnosis and treatment.</p>

            <p eId="para_5058">Regulation (EC) 1408/71 provides, inter alia, that people who are insured with or covered by the health care system of one member state may access healthcare in the public system of another member state in certain circumstances.  Article 22 (1) (c) of the Regulation governs the referral of patients for public health services to another member state.  In accordance with this article, a person eligible for health services in Ireland must be authorised by the HSE to go to another member state for treatment in the public health system there, where certain criteria are met.  When authorisation is granted, Form E112 is issued by the HSE and is confirmation that the HSE will bear the cost of the treatment.</p>
            <p eId="para_5059">It is a matter for the HSE to determine whether authorisation for treatment abroad should be granted. Therefore, the person referred to by the Deputy may wish to apply to the HSE for authorisation for treatment abroad in accordance with these entitlements. Outside of entitlements arising under EU law, financial assistance in relation to treatment abroad is at the discretion of the HSE.</p>

            <p eId="para_5064">It is important to note that the transfer of services from St. Luke's Hospital to new facilities at St. James's Hospital is not due to take place for a number of years.  In the meantime, two additional  and two replacement linear accelerators were commissioned at St. Luke's this year in order to provide much needed interim capacity pending the roll out of the National Plan for Radiation Oncology.</p>
            <p eId="para_5065">The decision to transfer services from St. Luke's was taken by the Government in the context of its consideration of the National Plan for Radiation Oncology Services.  The decision is based on expert advice and is designed to ensure that radiation oncology is integrated with all other aspects of cancer care, including surgery and medical oncology.  This is in line with best international practice.  I am convinced that this model will provide better patient centred treatment with improved quality of service and outcome for patients.  The Board of St. Luke's Hospital and its Executive Management Team are fully committed to supporting the Government's decision in relation to the development of radiation oncology.</p>
            <p eId="para_5066">No decisions have yet been taken in relation to the future use of the site and facilities at St. Luke's.  However, I am anxious to ensure that these resources are utilised in the best interest of the health services.</p>

            <p eId="para_5069">The HSE has informed my Department that since commencement of the Scheme over 35,000 applications for living and deceased patients have been received by the Health Repayment Scheme.

Every effort is being made to complete repayments as quickly as possible.  The HSE has advised that it anticipates that the remaining offers, upwards of 300, will be processed by the end of the year.  Repayment amounts offered cannot be paid until the statutory 28 day period for appeal has elapsed and a completed acceptance form has been returned to the Scheme Administrator.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_5073">I propose to take Question Nos. 206 and 207 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5074">The Health Service Executive constantly works at improving efficiency across the hospital system and closely monitors progress in this regard.  There have been considerable improvements made since 2005 in improving the delivery of services in Emergency Departments.  For example, the average daily number of patients awaiting admission at 2 pm fell from 179 in 2005 to 92 in 2007.  The figures over the first eleven months of 2008 show an increase to 107 in the numbers awaiting admission.</p>
            <p eId="para_5075">Findings from a recent second National Bed Utilisation Review indicate some improvements with regard to bed utilisation in hospitals.  However, there is still significant scope to improve the way in which beds in the acute hospital system are managed.  The Review shows a slight reduction in the numbers admitted that could potentially have been cared for elsewhere (13% down to 12%).  There has been a more significant reduction in the number of people in hospital who could potentially have been cared for in an alternative care setting (down from 39% to 34%).  There has been a significant increase reported in the number of elective surgical patients admitted on the day of surgery (up from 25% to 41%).  While there was an 8% increase in evidence of discharge planning, there has been no change in predicted dates of discharge.</p>
            <p eId="para_5076">Hospitals need to further improve their admission and discharge processes, to ensure that people are appropriately admitted and that their care is efficiently managed, both during their hospital stay and their follow up care in the community.  Steps are being taken to ensure that patients have an expected date of discharge within 24 hours of admission, that patients are discharged in a more proactive manner at weekends and that communication between the hospital system and primary care services is improved.   Implementation of a new Code of Practice on Discharge Planning has commenced.  This should help to deliver further improvements in overall bed utilisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5077">As part of the Winter Initiative, Hospital Managers have been asked to develop an action plan to reduce the average length of stay in hospital of patients, based on the findings of the Bed Utilisation Study and to increase the rate of Day Surgery in line with best international practice.  The HSE is also working to increase long-stay capacity and to free up beds in acute hospitals over the Winter period.  This is being matched by an intensive focus on improved processes and efficiency.</p>
            <p eId="para_5078">I believe that setting clear targets for improvement and measuring performance against these targets helps to drive further improvements in services.  My Department has asked the HSE to set a revised maximum waiting time target of no more than 6 hours from registration to admission or discharge in 2009 for all patients attending Emergency Departments. The HSE has also been asked to introduce a measurement system in 2009 to record the total waiting time for all such patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_5079">New contractual arrangements for medical consultants were agreed with their representative organisations (Irish Hospital Consultants Association and Irish Medical Organisation) earlier this year following more than four years of protracted negotiations. The contract addresses the operation of the hospital, rather than a single department such as the Emergency Department.  Consultants will work a 37 hour week in an extended span of the working day from 8 am to 8 pm where appropriate, Monday to Friday; and a scheduled attendance of up to five hours where required on Saturday, Sunday and Public Holidays.  The extended hours will also facilitate the discharge process, thereby improving the flow of patients through hospital departments, including the Emergency Department.  The introduction of new private practice provisions are designed to improve the position of public patients in terms of their access to the public health system.</p>

The priority of BreastCheck is to screen women who have not yet been screened and accordingly it is fully focussed at present on the completion of the first round of screening in the West and South.  I will consider extending the age limit as recommended when the national roll-out of the programme is sufficiently developed and it is assured that a quality service is being delivered.  Any woman irrespective of her age who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.</p>

            <p eId="para_5098">The development of the National Paediatric Hospital continues to be a priority project for the Government. The Health Service Executive Capital Plan 2008 — 2013 includes provision for the development of the new hospital and the associated Ambulatory and Urgent Care Centre at Tallaght.</p>
            <p eId="para_5099">The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board was established in May, 2007.  Its primary function is to plan, design, furnish and equip the hospital. The HSE is working closely with the Board in progressing the project.  The Board operates from 2/3 Parnell Square East, Dublin 1.  The appointed members of the Board are as follows:</p>

A detailed Development Brief for the new hospital is being prepared and is due for completion by the end of the 1st Quarter 2009.  The Development Brief will be converted into a detailed design, outlining the exact dimensions and specifications for the new hospital, to allow the project proceed to tender for construction.  A more accurate estimate of costs will be available at that point.</p>
            <p eId="para_5113">The legal requirements to enable the transfer of the designated site for the hospital to the HSE have been agreed and the transfer has been finalised.

            <p eId="para_5115">As the Deputy will be aware, the practice of conventional medicine and healthcare in this country is controlled and regulated.  However, the practice of other disciplines of healthcare, including psychotherapy, have not been subject to the same level of oversight.  Standards of education, professional qualifications and experience required are not as well established and the level of qualification and length of training among practitioners can vary.</p>
            <p eId="para_5116">The Health and Social Care Professionals Act was passed by the Oireachtas in 2005.  This Act provides for the establishment of a system of statutory registration for 12 health and social care professionals as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_5117">Clinical Biochemists;</p>
            <p eId="para_5118">Dieticians;</p>
            <p eId="para_5119">Medical Scientists;</p>
            <p eId="para_5120">Occupational Therapists;</p>
            <p eId="para_5121">Orthopaedists;</p>
            <p eId="para_5122">Physiotherapists;</p>
            <p eId="para_5123">Podiatrists;</p>
            <p eId="para_5124">Psychologists;</p>

            <p eId="para_5126">Social Care Workers;</p>
            <p eId="para_5127">Social Workers; and</p>
            <p eId="para_5128">Speech and Language Therapists.</p>
            <p eId="para_5129">The system of statutory registration will apply to the twelve professions regardless of whether they work in the public or private sector or are self-employed and is the first time that fitness to practice procedures will be put in place for these professionals on a statutory basis.  The structure of the system of statutory registration will comprise a registration board for each of the professions to be registered, a Health and Social Care Professionals Council with overall responsibility for the regulatory system and a committee structure to deal with disciplinary matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_5130">The first step in the implementation of the system was the establishment of the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, which was launched in March last year.  The Council has now recruited a Chief Executive Officer in May of this year and is currently putting in place a suitable organisational structure.  The Council must establish a registration board for each of the twelve professions currently covered by the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_5131">The Council has examined which professions from within the designated twelve are most suitable for early registration and decided to appoint the first two of twelve statutory Registration Boards, the Social Worker Registration Board and the Physiotherapy Registration Board, provided for under the Act, to be established by early 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_5132">The Health and Social Care Professionals Council's priority is to put in place the regulatory structures for the 12 designated professions initially. While the proposed system of statutory registration applies, in the first instance to twelve health and social care professions, the legislation provides for the inclusion of, on the basis of specific criteria, additional health and social care professions in the regulatory system over time, as appropriate.  Within this context, the Health and Social Care Professionals Council may then consider whether statutory registration is warranted and appropriate for other disciplines of healthcare practitioners.</p>

            <p eId="para_5145">Directive 2005/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on the recognition of professional qualifications applies to all EEA nationals wishing to practise a regulated profession in an EU Member State other than that in which they obtained their professional qualifications, on either a self-employed or employed basis.  Its intention is to make it easier for qualified health professionals to practise their professions in European countries other than where they have qualified, but due safeguards are provided in the assessment of the qualifications for both public health and safety and consumer protection.  In certain circumstances, non-EEA nationals who are legally resident in Ireland can benefit from the provisions of the Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_5146">In relation to professional qualifications in occupational therapy, the Directive is transposed into Irish law by Statutory Instrument No. 139 of 2008 and Statutory Instrument No. 166 of 2008.  The Minister for Health and Children is the competent authority for the assessment of these professional qualifications and the process is administered by the Health Service Executive (National Validation Office (NVO)).  The Minister and the Executive are advised in this function by the Association of Occupational Therapists.</p>
            <p eId="para_5147">Article 51 of the Directive provides for the competent authority to issue its decision on an application within four months from the date on which the complete application was received.  In the case of the person referred to by the Deputy, the completed file was received on 27 August 2008 and hence a decision is due on or before December 27 next.</p>
            <p eId="para_5148">The Deputy will understand that the assessment process is a detailed one, as prescribed in the Directive, in which, on a case-by-case basis, the qualifications of an applicant are assessed against those required to practise in Ireland.  If the activities covered by the profession in the home and the host member state are not comparable, then the qualifications cannot be recognised.  If the activities are comparable but deficits in the qualifications are identified, subsequent post-qualification professional experience of the applicant must be considered.  If deficits still remain, the host Member State must offer an applicant a compensation measure, a choice of completing an adaptation period or taking an aptitude test.</p>

            <p eId="para_5152">It has long been recognised that Hawkins House is not a viable long-term Headquarters for the Department of Health and Children. Following discussions with the Office of Public Works and consideration of various options it was agreed that my Department's HQ would relocate from Hawkins House to the premises on St. Stephen's Green currently occupied by the Office of Public Works, following OPW's vacating of that premises and their relocation to Trim under the Government's decentralisation programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5153">With regard to the future of the Hawkins House site, I am informed that the Office of Public Works considered a number of options, and that these options were subject to independent valuation. These assessments concluded that a Lease Agreement with the owner of the Apollo premises, which would allow that owner to develop the consolidated Hawkins/Apollo sites, was most beneficial to the State. The costs of the redevelopment will be borne entirely by the owner of the Apollo premises.</p>
            <p eId="para_5154">In accordance with standard practice the OPW engaged Consultant Architects to review the Stephen's Green premises and identify any work needed to meet my Department's requirements. Based on accepted accommodation norms, the initial estimate received suggests a cost of the order of €3.2 million to complete necessary works. Every effort will be made to minimise the costs arising in this context.</p>
            <p eId="para_5155">A new IT Computer Room was provided in Hawkins House in  2007 as part of a number of refurbishment  works carried out by the Office of Public Works that year.

            <p eId="para_5157">Following publication in 2005 of the report by Dr Ronnie Pollock which was commissioned by the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland, the Health Service Executive established a Working Group to undertake a detailed review of cystic fibrosis services.  The Group, which was multi-disciplinary in its composition, was asked to review the current configuration and delivery of services to persons with cystic fibrosis in Ireland.  The Group identified a range of service improvements required for persons with Cystic Fibrosis, including the need to increase the level of clinical, nursing and allied health professional staffing in Cystic Fibrosis units around the country.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to respond directly to the Deputy with regard to the recommendations made by the Working Group.</p>

            <p eId="para_5237">Applications for annual licences are generally dealt with on a first come, first served basis.  However the processing of applications is critically influenced by issues such as the complexity of the application, the presence of other services on the route, or part of the route, to which the application relates or prior applications from other bus operators. Accordingly it is not possible to establish a specific time frame within which all licence applications are assessed. However, where applications are straightforward, they are processed within a matter of weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_5238">The remit of the 1932 Act does not extend to the operation of services by Bus Eireann or Dublin Bus. However since 10 January 2001, both of these companies are required by Ministerial direction to notify my Department of any proposed new services or proposed changes to existing services at least four weeks prior to their introduction. Where proposed services by either company are deemed to be in competition with services that are the subject of a licence under the 1932 Act, they are required to obtain my consent under section 25 of the Transport Act 1958 before they can introduce such services. Therefore, it is not possible to establish a specific time frame within which all notifications are processed. Again, where applications are straightforward they are processed within a matter of weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_5257">I understand from Pobal that in funding services under the Rural Transport Programme they require community groups to take accessibility features into consideration when evaluating tenders for local services. In addition, community owned vehicles are either already accessible or are being adapted to ensure that they meet accessibility requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_5258">The Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 requires contracts for the procurement of public transport service to provide, inter alia, for accessibility standards for services. At present I am not empowered in law to make the use of accessible vehicles a requirement for obtaining a licence under the Road Transport Act 1932.</p>
            <p eId="para_5259">I intend to include such a requirement in the proposals that I am developing to modernise the 1932 Road Transport Act.</p>

            <p eId="para_5265">The Minister of State Noel Ahern T.D. along with an official of my Department met with a delegation from the Kew Park Residents Association on 18th June 2008 to discuss residents' needs for the provision of a bus service for their housing estate. The delegation explained that residents in that area currently have no direct access to a bus service to the city centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_5266">It was explained to the delegation that in August 2007 my Department informed Dublin Bus that a notification to reroute some of their services on the 25 route to serve Kew Park would require Ministerial consent in accordance with section 25 of the Transport Act 1958, due to competition with an existing licence operated by Morton's Coaches. My Department received no such application under section 25.</p>
            <p eId="para_5267">It was explained to the delegation that it is open to any operator, whether they are a private operator or a state body, to make an application to the Department for the provision of services in any area. The Department can have no influence in directing an operator to serve a particular route and the operation of services is a matter for individual companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_5268">It was also explained that Dublin Bus is exempt from the current licensing regime but, where proposed services by Dublin Bus are deemed to be in competition with services that are the subject of a licence under the 1932 Act, they are required to obtain Ministerial consent under section 25 of the Transport Act 1958 before they can introduce such services.</p>
            <p eId="para_5269">Since that meeting Morton's Coaches has ceased to operate the route licence they held for the area. However my Department has not received any further applications from either private operators or notifications from Dublin Bus for the provision of services in the Kew Park region.</p>

            <p eId="para_5333">The position in relation to granting long term residency is as follows: persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_5334">The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years, may also apply for long-term residency. This particular long-term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants.</p>
            <p eId="para_5335">Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency.</p>
            <p eId="para_5336">While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_5337">An application for long term residency from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in October 2007. I understand that applications received in January 2007 are currently being dealt with. As soon as a decision is made on the case, the person concerned will be notified.</p>

            <p eId="para_5365">There are currently 15,600 applications for naturalisation with the Citizenship Division of my Department that are still awaiting a decision. The number of applications which were made more than 18 months ago is 6,400 and of these 30% (1,900) are on hold awaiting a response from the applicant and 44% (2,800) are awaiting a response from other statutory bodies as part of the normal applications checking process.</p>
            <p eId="para_5366">Following the recent decentralisation of the Citizenship Division to Tipperary Town, substantial resources have been made available to it in order to reduce backlogs and provide a better quality service to all applicants. This has had a positive impact on processing times and the average time from application to decision for the generality of valid applications is now at 23 months. It is expected that this will progressively improve over the coming year and the Division is currently commencing further processing of applications received in mid 2007. A significant number of applications are initially found to be invalid for a variety of reasons and these are now being dealt with and returned to the applicant within a week. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average while an element of straight forward cases are now being dealt with in less than that time scale.</p>
            <p eId="para_5367">The Deputy will appreciate that there is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</p>

            <p eId="para_5378">Section 12(4) does not make provision for a review of a designation. However, the Minister may by order amend or revoke a designation order.</p>

            <p eId="para_5453">I propose to take Questions Nos. 280, 281 and 290 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5454">I understand from the Garda Authorities that records indicate that 27 handguns (to 14th November, 2008) have been stolen since 2005 — primarily during burglaries from dwelling houses. A further 1,236 other firearms were stolen during the same period, with a total of 373 recovered.  I am further advised that stolen firearms are used in the course of the commission of other criminal offences but, because not all stolen firearms or firearms used in the commission of offences are recovered, it is not possible to say precisely how many formerly licensed handguns have been used in a criminal offence in the years 2003 to 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_5455">As I have stated on a number of occasions I am concerned with the situation we now find ourselves in following the growth in the licensing of handguns over the past few years. We now have about 1,800 handguns licensed which was not as a result of a considered or deliberate public policy decision.  I would have concerns about the suitability of a large number of these firearms for legitimate target shooting purposes and I am not going to permit the growth of a ‘hand gun' culture.  It was against this background that I recently announced my proposals for reform in this area, which include a ban on issuing new licenses for handguns and a strict regime for renewal of existing licenses, with limited exceptions made in relation to Olympic sports.  These proposals will be reflected in the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which I will be publishing in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_5456">It is important to say that my proposals in relation to handguns will not impinge directly on the activities of the vast majority of licensed firearms holders.  I recognise that those firearms holders pursue their legitimate interests in a law abiding way and am anxious to have a well-regulated sector in which those interests can be successfully pursued, in cooperation with the relevant authorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_5458">I am advised that it is the policy of the Office of Public Works to provide for universal access in all new projects, including Garda stations, and as far as is practicable in all other projects.  Older buildings and/or protected structures, many of which predate the introduction of current accessibility legislation, can present issues that make such provision problematic.  I am advised by the Garda authorities that the Office of Public Works have been requested to examine the stations referred to by the Deputy with a view to providing the requisite access facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_5459">I am informed by the Garda authorities that they will consult with the National Disability Authority to ensure that its requirements are taken into account where new Garda stations are built or where Garda stations are refurbished, insofar as this is possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_5461">I am advised by the Garda authorities that all divisional and district stations have been supplied with an audio frequency induction loop system which allows a person with impaired hearing and who is equipped with an appropriate hearing aid to communicate with Garda.  In addition, the new public access call-box systems currently being installed at non-24 hour stations are equipped with a similar induction loop system.  The new public access call-box systems also have a braille script to advise visually impaired persons to press the button to communicate with gardaí.  Eircom continues to support the minitel service for contacting emergency services through the 999 or 112 system.  I am further advised that the Garda college works with the National Learning Network, which is part of the Rehab group, to raise awareness amongst student gardaí in respect of disability.  The focus in respect of sensory disability is providing guidance to students in respect of people who are visually impaired and those who suffer from deafness or hard of hearing.  The National Learning Network provide awareness training to student gardaí as well as general etiquette training when interacting with persons suffering from sensory disability.</p>

            <p eId="para_5463">The "Dial to Stop Drug Dealing" initiative is being delivered under the aegis of the National Drugs Strategy Team which reports to my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, its rollout is, therefore, a matter which falls under the remit of that Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_5464">In relation to the launch and implementation of the campaign I am informed that during 2006, the Blanchardstown local drugs task force ran a pilot "Dial to Stop Drug Dealing" campaign that was deemed to be successful by the local community, the drugs task force and the Garda Síochána.  Based on the model of that initiative, funding was secured to run a national "Dial to Stop Drug Dealing" campaign from October 2008.  This funding, totalling €450,000, consists of €300,000 which is being made available through the Dormant Assets Fund, €100,000 which is being provided directly by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and €50,000 that my Department is contributing towards the campaign costs.  The National Drugs Strategy Team with the help of a marketing and communications company, PCC Limited, is in the process of rolling out a national initiative, which involves a series of local and regional campaigns.  These campaigns will be run by a number of local and regional drugs task forces which are interested in and are in a position to participate in the project.  Each campaign is designed to encourage people to provide, anonymously if preferred, through a confidential national free phone telephone line, 1800 220 220, any information they may have on drug dealing activity in their area.  Information provided is, as appropriate, being forwarded to designated contacts in the Garda National Drugs Unit of the force, which directs it appropriately locally and regionally within the Garda system.</p>
            <p eId="para_5465">The campaign was launched nationally on 30 September 2008 by the Minister of State, Deputy Curran.  Five drug task forces — the Tallaght, Blanchardstown, Dublin north inner city and Dublin north-east local drugs task forces and the south-west regional drugs task force — are participating in phase 1 of the campaign, which is running from early October to early December.  Phase 2 of the campaign, which will be conducted between January and February 2009, will feature the participation of the southern, south-eastern, north Dublin and mid-western regional drugs task forces and the Cork city local drugs task force.  The final phase of this initiative will be run between April and May 2009 with the following task forces participating — the east coast and midlands regional drugs task forces and the Bray, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and Finglas-Cabra local drugs task forces.  I understand that an overall evaluation of the project is expected to be available next summer.  I fully endorse this initiative and urge all members of the public to support the campaign.</p>

            <p eId="para_5513">The Irish Prison Service has, in recent months, introduced a package of new security measures across all closed prisons.  The purpose of these measures is to eliminate, in so far as is possible, the smuggling of contraband, such as drugs, weapons and mobile phones into our prisons.  Not only do these measures enhance the security and safety of our prisons, but they reduce the possibility of prisoners' families and friends being pressurised into attempting to smuggle these items during visits.  All visitors to Limerick Prison must pass through recently enhanced security measures aimed at combatting the trafficking of contraband into the prison. These measures include metal detectors, x-ray scanners and a passive drug-detection dog.  A positive indication from the drug-detection dog does not necessarily mean that someone is attempting to smuggle drugs into the prison, but rather that they may have recently been in contact with an illicit substance.  In order that the safety and security of our prisons be maintained, persons who receive a positive indication are offered either a screened visit or a visit on an alternative day.  I trust the Deputy will accept that a balance must be maintained which preserves prison security at all times.</p>

            <p eId="para_5515">The Government's commitment to tackling domestic violence is reflected in the establishment in June 2007 of Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence.  Cosc's key responsibility is to ensure the delivery of a well co-ordinated "whole of Government" response to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  Its major priority is to produce a national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence which has the support of State and non-governmental organisations in the sector.  This strategy will set out the policy on addressing the forms of violence concerned as well as the preventative and responsive actions to be taken by a broad range of organisations to ensure a well co-ordinated system is in place.  Work on preparing the strategy is well advanced.  A round of regional consultations with State and non-governmental organisations is taking place, which includes a consultation in Waterford city today for organisations in the south east.</p>

            <p eId="para_5519">All attacks on members of the emergency service are reprehensible and a matter of concern to all right thinking members of society.  The law makes specific and robust provision for attacks on members of the emergency services.  The Criminal Justice Act 2006 strengthened the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 to make it an offence to assault, or to threaten to assault, or to impede medical personnel in a hospital, people assisting such personnel or a peace officer acting in the course of duty.  The definition of peace officer was expanded to include members of the fire brigade and ambulance personnel as well as a member of the Garda Síochána, a prison officer and a member of the Defence Forces under these provisions.  In addition, the penalties for the offence of assault, or threatening to assault, a peace officer were increased to a fine of €5,000 or up to 12 months' imprisonment, or both, on summary disposal and to an unlimited fine or up to seven years' imprisonment, or both, on indictment.  The Act also creates specific offences of threatening, assaulting, resisting, wilfully obstructing or impeding doctors, dentists, nurses, midwives, pharmacists, other health and social care workers and any persons assisting them in or at a hospital.  Conditions of employment of local authority employees are not within the remit of my Department, but are a matter for local authorities in accordance with the Local Government Act 2001.</p>

            <p eId="para_5533">My Department, through the Probation Service, provides funding to over 50 voluntary bodies to assist with the management of adult offenders in the community and to add value to the core work of the Probation Service.  The PACE organisation is one such facility, which provides training and accommodation services for ex-offenders.  In 2008, my Department through the Probation Service provided €1.5 million to PACE.  I can confirm that my Department has not received any application from PACE for additional funds for the development of the premises that is the subject of this question.  With regard to the number of women in custody since the opening of the Dóchas Centre in 1999, there has been a serious overcrowding problem at the centre, despite the provision of an additional 20 spaces during the final phase of its construction.  For example, on 1 December 2008 there were 110 prisoners in custody in the Dóchas Centre.  This figure exceeded the bed capacity by 29%.  In addition, there are 41 female prisoners on temporary release from the Dóchas Centre.  Social and demographic trends indicate that we will continue to experience an increasing level of women prisoners in our prison system.  In anticipation of this increase, the Government intends to include an expanded version of the Dóchas Centre in the plans to move the entire Mountjoy Prison Complex to a greenfield site in the greater Dublin area.  Further accommodation for women prisoners will also be included in the planned Munster prison.</p>
            <p eId="para_5534">The Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003 provides that the Minister may approve the temporary release of a sentenced prisoner.  This discretionary instrument assists in gradually preparing suitable offenders for release, in administering short sentences and is an incentive to well-behaved prisoners.  Temporary release arrangements operate similarly to a system of parole, which is a feature of prison systems worldwide. They are an important vehicle for reintegrating an offender into the community in a planned way.  The generally accepted view is that the risk to the community is reduced by planned reintegration of offenders compared with their return to the community on the completion of their full sentence.  Each case is examined on its own merits and the safety of the public is paramount when decisions are made.  In addition, all releases are subject to conditions which in the vast majority of cases include a requirement to report on a regular basis to the offender's local Garda station.  Of course, any offender who breaches his or her conditions may be arrested and returned to prison immediately by the Garda.</p>

Members of the Garda are, of course, aware that Irish citizens are not required to carry proof of their citizenship.  At the same time, however, it cannot be the case that any foreign national could, by simply claiming to be Irish, negate Ireland's immigration laws and in particular the requirement to carry identification.  Members of the Garda may on occasion need to carry out certain checks in order to confirm a person's identity and citizenship.

However I can say that the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission is charged with ensuring that admissible complaints made against members of the Garda Síochána are examined in a way which is both transparent and equitable and increases public confidence in the force.  The Commission is independent in the exercise of its functions and is not subject to direction by the Minister or the Garda Commissioner in relation to the manner in which complaints are investigated.  The Commission's powers include the power to refer a complaint to the Garda Commissioner for investigation. It also has the power to have the matter investigated by one of its own trained investigative staff.  If the ombudsman commission decides to refer a case to the Garda Commissioner for investigation, it can do so with or without supervision and can take over a case if it is not satisfied with the progress or even the outcome of an investigation.  The ombudsman commission therefore retains ultimate control over every investigation.</p>

A complaint may also be made directly to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission by calling in person to the Dublin office during the stated hours of public business; in writing; by fax; or by using <i>www.gardaombudsman.ie</i>.

            <p eId="para_5544">The Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting of 27 and 28 November last discussed the topic of "free movement of persons: abuses and substantive problems".  The discussions, which follow a debate at the September 2008 Council meeting on the action to be taken following the judgment of the European Court of Justice in the Metock case, focused primarily on this occasion on the potential for abuse of the Free Movement Directive by those involved in serious or persistent criminal activities.  Following the discussion, the Justice and Home Affairs Council agreed a set of conclusions.  The official English language version of the conclusions has not yet been published on the Council website.  Subject to minor changes of translation, the conclusions are as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5545">The Council recalls the discussion it held at its meeting on 25 September 2008 concerning the action to be taken following the judgment of the Court of Justice in the Metock case (C-127/08) and on the question of the residence of third-country nationals married to EU citizens in the context of tackling illegal immigration.  The Council recalls that the right of free movement within the European Union is one of the main principles on which the Union is based, for the benefit of European citizens, Member States and the competitiveness of the European economy.  That right constitutes a fundamental freedom for citizens and, for those who exercise it, entails responsibilities, including respect for the rule of law in the State where they are staying or residing.  The Council also emphasises its commitment to developing the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice, of which the fight against crime constitutes an essential aspect.  The Council considers that, in compliance with and in the interests of the right of free movement, every effort must be made to prevent and combat any misuses and abuses, as well as actions of a criminal nature, with forceful and proportionate measures with due regard to the applicable law, against citizens who break the law in a sufficiently serious manner by committing serious or repeated offences.  In this connection the Council notes the relevant provisions of Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council , in particular those set out in Chapter VI concerning restrictions on the right of entry and the right of residence of Community nationals and their family members on grounds inter alia of public policy and public security and the provisions of Article 35 concerning abuse of rights and fraud, such as marriages of convenience and the presentation of forged documents.  The Council welcomes the Commission's intention to submit between now and mid-December an assessment report on the operation of Directive 2004/38/EC and the work which the Commission is organising in close liaison with representatives of the Member States meeting in an expert group to identify problems in the implementation of the Directive and good practice at national level.  Concerned that the provisions of Directive 2004/38/EC should be fully and correctly implemented in order to improve the prevention and combating of misuses and abuses, while adhering to the principle of proportionality, the Council requests the Commission to publish guidelines for the interpretation of that Directive early in 2009 and to consider all other appropriate and necessary proposals and measures.  The Council will make a more extensive examination of the issue after the report has been submitted and in the light of the other discussions that will continue at the same time.</p>

            <p eId="para_5547">The 1983 Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons provides a mechanism whereby prisoners can be repatriated to their home state in order to serve prison sentences they have incurred abroad.  The convention is provided for in legislation in this State by virtue of the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Acts 1995 and 1997 and the process is administered by my Department.  The process requires extensive documentation to be exchanged between the relevant jurisdictions if an application is to be fully considered.  A three-way consent is also required to enable any transfer to take place — from the authorities of both jurisdictions and from the person concerned.  On receipt of those consents, assuming they are forthcoming, an application must be made to the High Court for a warrant authorising the transfer of the person concerned and their continued detention here.  As advised in previous answers, my Department has not yet received a formal application for a transfer to Ireland in respect of this person from the United Kingdom authorities.  My officials have contacted the UK authorities responsible for such repatriations regarding this matter and they have stated that they have not received an application from the person concerned either.  If she has not already done so, she should apply for a transfer via her prison governor in the United Kingdom.</p>
            <p eId="para_5548">I would also like to inform the Deputy that officials from my Department have brought this matter to the attention of their colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The Department of Foreign Affairs has indicated that the person concerned has not sought consular assistance from it.  In relation to the treatment of this individual, I am informed by the Department of Health and Children that operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services was assigned to the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004 and funding for all health services has been provided as part of its overall Vote.  The Executive, therefore, is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.  My Department has asked the Department of Health and Children to request the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</p>

         the progress made on negotiations with the Belorussian authorities to secure continuance of Irish charitable projects working to provide summer holiday opportunities for children from the Chernobyl region in Ireland, and at Christmas time; if continuance of such Irish projects will be governed by a new three year term regulation whereby visiting children from the Chernobyl region who may have stayed with Irish families for three years may not be permitted to return to Ireland again; his views on whether the introduction of such a new regulation will cause heartbreak for many children from the Chernobyl region and for many families from all parts of Ireland particularly since Irish charities and the people of Ireland have been the biggest contributors of support, including international humanitarian aid to the Belorussian community since the Chernobyl nuclear disaster of 26 April 1986; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_5550">This is an issue of great importance to me and to the host families and organisations who give so generously of their time to the children of Chernobyl.  I am determined to bring it to a successful conclusion.  Every effort is being made to ensure that the children can continue to visit Ireland for the purposes of rest and recuperation.  I spoke on this matter during an Adjournment debate on 18 November last.  In addition, I have replied to a number of questions on this important issue, most recently on 11, 12 and 19 November last.  Copies of those replies will follow this reply.  Late on 14 November, a Belorussian response to a draft agreement between Ireland and Belarus to regulate the children's visits which my Department had sent to Minsk was received through our embassy in Moscow.  The text of the revised agreement was examined closely by officials in my Department and in the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  Our response was conveyed to the Belorussian authorities on 26 November.  Following an invitation from Belarus, an Irish negotiating team will travel to Minsk on 8 December with a view to negotiating and concluding the agreement and ensuring that restrictions are either removed or, at worst, minimised.  I spoke to the Belorussian Foreign Minister on Friday last, 28 November, and expressed the hope that the negotiations could be concluded satisfactorily on 8 December.  I also laid stress on the need to allow visits by children over the Christmas holiday period, irrespective of longer term issues.  I will continue to give the matter the highest personal priority.</p>
            <p eId="para_5551">Reply to Question No. 168 of 19 November last:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5552">As the Deputy may be aware, this is an issue of great importance to me personally and I am determined to bring this matter to a successful conclusion. Every effort is being made to ensure that Belorussian children can continue to visit Ireland for the purposes of rest and recuperation. I have replied to a number of questions on this matter, most recently on 11th and 12th of November and I spoke on this matter during an adjournment debate yesterday evening.  Late on 14 November, a Belorussian response to a draft Agreement between Ireland and Belarus on the matter which my Department had sent to Minsk was received through our Embassy in Moscow. The text of the revised Agreement is being examined closely by officials in my Department and in the Office of the Minister for Children, and it is intended to forward our response to Minsk shortly with a view to the very early conclusions of negotiations.  My Department has also received positive indications at official level that visits by children from Belarus can continue while the negotiating process is ongoing. I hope that this can be confirmed with the Belorussian Government in the coming days. Close contact is being maintained with the charities dealing with Chernobyl children as the situation evolves.</p>
            <p eId="para_5553">Reply to Questions Nos. 233 and 234 of 12 November last:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5554">I propose to take Questions Nos. 233 and 234 together.  I would refer the Deputy to my reply yesterday to Question No. 410 on developments on this issue. As set out there, a second draft of a proposed Bilateral Agreement between Ireland and Belarus, to facilitate visits to Ireland by Chernobyl children, was conveyed to the Belorussian authorities on 26 October. I expect a response from the Belorussian authorities on this very shortly. Once this is received, my Department will move immediately to try to bring this matter to a satisfactory conclusion. The Deputy can be assured of my ongoing personal commitment and engagement in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_5555">Reply to Question No. 410 of 11 November last:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5556">As I mentioned in answer to questions on Wednesday 29 October, once I became aware of possible restrictions on the children's travel, I met with Adi Roche of Chernobyl Children's Project International on 8 September to review the situation, and also asked the Chargé d'Affaires of the Belorussian Embassy in London to visit Dublin later that week to open discussions on an agreement to provide a framework for visits by Chernobyl children.  Following intensive discussions at official level, a draft Agreement was forwarded to the Belorussian authorities on 6 October. On 13 October, I discussed progress at a meeting with Belorussian Foreign Minister Martynov and expressed the Government's strong hope that — even if negotiations with the Belorussian Government were not fully concluded — Christmas visits by the Chernobyl children to Ireland should be allowed to go ahead. A Belarus response to the draft agreement, requesting further information, was received by my Department on 16 October.  Separately, Ireland's Ambassador to Minsk was notified by the Belorussian authorities on 16 October that a Presidential Decree had been signed on 13 October relating to travel by Belorussian children overseas. Given its potential impact on future visits by children from Chernobyl, and following further consultations with Adi Roche and other Chernobyl NGOs, it was decided to deal with the issues arising through our proposed draft agreement. On 24 October, this approach was conveyed to the Belorussian authorities.  A reply has been promised to Ireland's Ambassador on this and is still awaited. Officials remain in constant contact with their Belorussian opposite numbers and an Irish delegation is ready to visit Minsk at short notice with the intention, depending on the Belorussian response, of quickly concluding an agreement which will allow the visits to continue. I am also remaining in very close touch with developments on an issue that is of course of considerable concern to many Irish charities and to individual families, and I am ready to intervene again personally if necessary.</p>

Promoting religious tolerance remains a key EU objective in Pakistan.  We have urged the government there to make every effort to promote effectively the rights of minorities and to improve their current conditions.  EU Council Conclusions on 28 April 2008 reaffirmed the importance of human rights in Pakistan as a central priority for the EU.  Regular human rights demarches are carried out by the EU at official level with the Pakistani authorities. The situation of minorities was among the issues raised at the last demarche, which took place in June 2007.  The EU expressed its continued concerns over abuses of the blasphemy laws, which are often used to harass members of minority communities as well as Muslims.  Issues relating to applications for asylum and citizenship are the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>

            <p eId="para_5562">I remain deeply concerned about the situation in Zimbabwe.  Over the last number of years, but especially in recent months, ordinary Zimbabweans have suffered from state violence, economic chaos and the collapse of basic social services such as health and education.  Now, as a result of drought, the disruption caused by violence, and a lack of basic inputs such as seeds and fertilisers which farmers can no longer afford, many Zimbabweans are facing a season of hunger.  The United Nations believes that the number of people who depend on food aid will reach 5 million in January 2009.  The European Commission has allocated an additional €10 million in relief assistance for people affected by the humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe, while Irish aid to the affected people for the period 2006 to 2008 (to date) amounts to approximately €25 million.  At present, there is a serious outbreak of cholera in the country.  Substantial political change is urgently needed to bring Zimbabwe back onto a path to stability, peace and economic growth.  Despite the appalling violence against Movement for Democratic Change supporters since the relatively free elections of March 2008, Morgan Tsvangirai has expressed his willingness to work with Zanu-PF in a unity government.  However, the MDC can only represent the Zimbabwean people's interests effectively in government if Zanu-PF honours its commitments under the 15 September power-sharing agreement.  The fact that Zanu-PF is not prepared to allow the MDC to take on the two Ministries — Finance and Home Affairs — which are most crucial for reform is a clear demonstration of bad faith on the part of Robert Mugabe.</p>
            <p eId="para_5563">I am frankly disappointed at the outcome of the Southern African Development Community summit in Pretoria on 9 November, when regional leaders did not press Mugabe to do what it takes to make a unity government workable.  Talks resumed in South Africa on 26 November.  I believe that some progress has been made on the constitutional changes necessary to implement the power-sharing agreement.  However, constitutional change will not be sufficient to allow a unity government to tackle Zimbabwe's problems if political will is still lacking.  The Government has engaged at EU level in the discussion of the current crisis in Zimbabwe and actively contributed to the preparation of the conclusions adopted by the General Affairs and External Relations Council in October.  After that meeting, EU Foreign Ministers stated that the EU stands ready to support a transitional government which is taking steps to restore democracy and the rule of law in Zimbabwe.  That commitment still stands.  The situation in Zimbabwe was discussed at the General Affairs and External Relations Council of 10 November, and I expect that EU Foreign Ministers will wish to comment again on the situation in December.</p>
            <p eId="para_5564">Ireland has conveyed its concerns directly to our partner countries in Africa.  We have encouraged the countries of the southern Africa region and organisations such as SADC and the African Union to continue to press the two sides to come to a workable agreement and to respect the democratic verdict of the Zimbabwean people.  Most recently, last month I instructed our ambassadors in SADC countries once again to convey our concerns to the authorities in our partner countries in southern Africa, in advance of the 9 November SADC Summit.  The Irish Ambassador to Zimbabwe, who is based in Pretoria, has had contact with Zimbabwean Ambassador there, and the Zimbabwean authorities can be in no doubt about our strong views.  My Department has also ensured that African embassies based in Dublin are aware of our position.</p>

            <p eId="para_5568">Over the past decade, the number of Irish citizens travelling and living abroad has increased dramatically.  Irish residents made almost 8 million visits overseas in 2007.  As a result, requests to my Department for consular assistance and support have increased significantly.  Every effort is made to assist families who experience difficulties.  While the vast majority of visits abroad are trouble free, some result in death or serious illness, unfortunately.  Our missions overseas provide a wide range of practical assistance when Irish citizens experience serious illness.  This includes the provision of lists of English speaking doctors and appropriate local medical facilities; communicating with medical personnel or hospital authorities; visiting hospitals and transferring funds from family and friends.  We also liaise with insurance or medical evacuation companies.  My Department, of course, strongly advises intending travellers to take out adequate travel insurance prior to departure.  Failure to take out insurance can lead to considerable financial and logistical difficulties for the traveller and his/her family should problems arise.  There is no specific fund available for the repatriation of Irish citizens to be transported home by air ambulance.  Repatriation by air ambulance is usually organised directly by the family concerned and, where the person concerned is insured, their travel insurance company.</p>

            <p eId="para_5570">The Government has consistently called for an end to the isolation of the people of Gaza, in particular through the reopening of crossing points for the movement of people and goods. Gaza has been isolated, in effect, since the Hamas takeover in June 2007, even during the ceasefire between Israeli forces and Hamas that was broadly respected from 19 June 2008 until 4 November 2008.  Since June 2007, Israel has maintained the closure of all border crossings for the movement of people, with limited exceptions.  Rafah International Crossing Point, the only border crossing via a country other than Israel, also remains closed since June 2007, with very limited openings.  Since 4 November, Israel has also effectively closed all border crossings for commercial goods, and even for humanitarian supplies.  While there have been some limited openings for humanitarian supplies since 17 November, the volume of supplies remains greatly reduced and insufficient to meet the needs of the local population.  The Government agrees with those who say that the effective isolation of Gaza constitutes collective punishment and is illegal under international humanitarian law.  The 1.5 million people in Gaza have been facing unsustainable conditions of daily life, which have been even more acute since 4 November.  Ireland will continue to work with its EU partners to ensure that concerns about these matters are conveyed to the Israeli Government at every appropriate opportunity.  At the same time, the Government unreservedly condemns the rocket attacks from Gaza on towns in southern Israel.  Our clear message is for an immediate end to all violence.</p>
            <p eId="para_5571">As regards the call in the petition "for the immediate release of 38 elected Palestinian parliamentarians held in Israeli jails", it is understood that this refers to 37 members of the Palestinian Legislative Council who are imprisoned in Israel.  A large majority — 33 parliamentarians — are members of Hamas, together with three members of Fatah and one member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. A number of the parliamentarians have been convicted by military courts in Israel of various crimes related to affiliation with, or membership of, a terrorist organisation, while others await trial and sentencing.  I understand that some of the prisoners were elected as members of the Palestinian Legislative Council after their imprisonment.  I would call for the release of all prisoners who have not been subject to due judicial process.  In relation to the European Campaign to end the Siege on Gaza, I understand that it is an umbrella body of 31 non-governmental organisations in various European countries who advocate on behalf of Palestinians living in Gaza.  One Irish NGO, the Palestinian Rights Foundation, is listed among its membership.  The director of the campaign, Dr. Arafat Shoukri, is based in London, and works as an Executive Director of the Palestinian Return Centre.</p>

            <p eId="para_5573">The Embassy in London has contacted the relevant prison in Britain (Foston Hall).  The prison authorities were, however, reluctant to release any information on the person concerned as prisoners have the right not to have information about their personal circumstances used without their express permission.  Personal information is, I should add, safeguarded under the British Data Protection Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_5574">Foston Hall is a dedicated female prison with a capacity of just under 300, of which 80 are usually on remand.  It is not a mental hospital and does not have a dedicated medical/ psychiatric facility.

            <p eId="para_5631">The four facilities referred to by the Deputy are in Killinarden and Firhouse in South Dublin and Palmerstown and Collinstown in West Dublin.  They were built as part of a programme to develop combined community/school sports facilities in drugs task force areas in Dublin and Cork.  The objective was that each facility (nine in total) would serve a dual purpose.  Firstly, they would put good sporting and recreational facilities at the disposal of the school-going population of the areas of South, West Dublin and Cork, and secondly, the facilities would be accessible for the wider communities too.  The Department of Education and Science (D/E&amp;S) provided funding in excess of €34m towards the capital cost of constructing the halls and Dormant Accounts monies was used to enable the opening of these facilities.  The Dormant Account funding will be fully expended by the end of December 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_5632">In view of the circumstances, the D/E&amp;S approached my Department with a view to securing a longer-term and more sustainable funding source.  My Department has examined the matter and, in recent days, has reached agreement with South Dublin VEC and South County Dublin County Council on the broad principles of an arrangement to secure the community use of these facilities for the longer-term.  While the details of the proposals are yet to be finalised, I am satisfied that the facilities will remain available to the community without any interruption of services and that their longer-term use will be secured.</p>

            <p eId="para_5681">I propose to take Questions Nos. 321 and 336 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5682">Family income supplement is an income support scheme for people, in low-income employment, with children.  It is designed to provide the incentive to remain in, or take up, employment rather than be fully welfare dependent.</p>
            <p eId="para_5683">The Department commissioned a research project to establish the reasons for the apparent lack of take-up of Family Income Supplement (FIS), to establish the level of public awareness of the scheme and to examine the level of non-take up of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5684">The terms of reference for the project are: to measure current levels of awareness of the Family Income Supplement; to measure perceived eligibility to apply among respondents, to establish whether they had applied in the past and to identify any perceived barriers to applying for the scheme; to gain an understanding of how the Department can effectively maximise uptake of FIS; to investigate awareness and effectiveness of the Department's advertising for the FIS, with particular emphasis on the campaign initiated in March 2006; to review the effectiveness of communications about FIS from the Department itself and through different information channels available to customers; and to examine and reconcile the findings from the ESRI in 2005 which suggested that there was a large group of potentially eligible claimants of FIS who were failing to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_5685">This project was commissioned by the Department of Social and Family Affairs with no direct involvement by the Revenue Commissioners.  However, income data provided by the Revenue Commissioners to the Department of Social and Family Affairs, as part of the normal course of events, was used to identify potential FIS recipients.  The project is at the final stage at present and is expected to be completed shortly.</p>

        <b>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
         if she will send out a new UP2 letter to persons in receipt of jobseeker’s benefit who have been affected by the recent retrospective budget 2009 changes advising them of the change in the duration of their entitlement to jobseeker benefit; the number affected by the changes; and if she will make a statement on the matter. 
        [43440/08]

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_671">
            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_5687">All jobseeker's benefit claimants are notified 3 months in advance of exhausting their benefit.  This is to allow sufficient time to undertake a means test where a person wishes to apply for jobseeker's allowance.  This arrangement will apply to those claimants affected by the changes announced in the budget.  The earliest date on which the new conditions as to duration can have an effect is mid April 2009.  Consequently, the Department will begin contacting persons affected in January.</p>
            <p eId="para_5688">The change announced in the Budget that will affect existing jobseeker's claimants is a reduction in the duration of benefit.  Jobseeker's Benefit will now be paid for 12 months (previously 15 months) where 260 or more PRSI contributions are paid.  This will apply to new claimants and those with an existing duration of less than 6 months on Jobseeker's Benefit on 15th October. Jobseeker's Benefit will be paid for up to 9 months (previously 12 months) where less than 260 contributions are paid.  This will apply to new claimants and those with an existing duration of less than 3 months on Jobseeker's Benefit on 15th October.  It is estimated that the maximum number affected will be some 48,000 and 20,000 approximately.</p>
            <p eId="para_5689">On the 17th October, the nearest date to the Budget change for which figures are available, 115,441 people had a claim for jobseeker's benefit.  39,606 were in receipt of benefit for less than 3 months.  Of this number 20,090 have less than 260 contributions recorded up to the end of the 2007 tax year, the latest year for which the department has contribution details.  75,835 were in receipt of benefit for less than 6 months and of this number 47,996 appear to have less than 260 contributions.</p>
            <p eId="para_5690">I should point out to the Deputy that some of these people will have stopped claiming jobseeker's benefit before their entitlement ceases and others will have commenced claiming.  Some will also be affected by the changes announced in Budget 2009 in relation to the length of time for which jobseeker's benefit will be paid.</p>
            <p eId="para_5691">It is envisaged that in 2009 a weekly average of 2,400 people will be affected by the reduction in duration from 312 days to 234 days and 3,860 people in a full year.  A weekly average of 6,750 people will be affected by the reduction in duration from 390 days to 312 days and 9,200 people in a full year.</p>
            <p eId="para_5692">Some claimants who have less than 260 PRSI contributions may have additional contributions paid in 2008 which would not yet be recorded in the Department.  These contributions could bring their total to 260 or more and this would extend their entitlement from 234 days (9 months) to 312 days (12 months).  Similarly, others could have insurance in another EU member state which could also bring their total contributions to 260 or more.</p>

         the number of families waiting for child benefit claims to be processed; the number of these in which the parents are foreign nationals; the average waiting time to process an application for child benefit; and the way these figures compare with November 2005, November 2006 and November 2007.

            <p eId="para_5708">There is no delay in processing the majority of Child Benefit applications. Awards for Irish-born children are processed either automatically or in a partially automated way using the child's birth details when they are registered with the General Registrar's Office. The average processing time for these claims is less than 10 days. Payments on behalf of some 70,000 children were paid this way in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_5709">Currently there are delays in processing Child Benefit claims for children born outside Ireland who have come to live in Ireland with their parents, and also claims for children who reside in another EU member state but have an entitlement to Irish Child Benefit under EU regulations (non-resident children).</p>
            <p eId="para_5710">In the case of non-Irish born children resident in Ireland, these cases are slower to process as the customer must satisfy the Habitual Residency condition test and this may entail contacting employers, the Department of Justice and other relevant bodies to confirm their status in the state. The residence of the children in Ireland must also be confirmed. This additional complexity, combined with an increase in the volume of applications received in recent years, has led to arrears of claims to be processed. This is currently being addressed. There are a total of 5,300 such claims awaiting processing.  A further 2,250 cases, where the Department is waiting on additional information to finalise the claims have been partially processed.</p>
            <p eId="para_5711">Additional staff resources have been assigned to this area and it is envisaged that the remaining claims on hand will be cleared in the early part of 2009. Average processing time for these claims at present is 8 months.  EU nationals who come to work in Ireland but whose families remain in their home country may have an entitlement to Family Benefits in Ireland under EU Regulation 1408/71. Before payment of Child Benefit is made for these non-resident children it is necessary amongst other things, to contact the authorities in the country of residence of the children to confirm details and establish what, if any, family benefits are payable in the home country as this will determine entitlement to Irish payments. This process can take a number of months to complete in normal circumstances. There are some 7,100 such claims awaiting processing, with a further 3,000 cases where the Department is waiting on additional information to finalise the claims. These claims are being processed with the assistance of additional temporary staff recruited for this purpose. It is anticipated that these claims will be cleared during the first half of 2009. At this point it is taking an average of 18 months to process these claims to completion.</p>
            <p eId="para_5712">Details of the average waiting time to process an application and the comparative figures for 2005-2007 are not available, however 15% more claims were cleared in 2008 to end October than in the same period in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_5713">The processing time for a Child Benefit claim depends on the complexity of the individual claim and the volume of such claims that have been received at that point in time. Claims for children born outside Ireland, whether living in Ireland or not, are taking significantly longer to process at present than they did prior to the substantial increase in the number of claims received since 2006.</p>

            <p eId="para_5717">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive on behalf of the Department, provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of mortgage interest.  As of 21st November 2008, there were 7,347 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement, an increase of 3,236 (80%) over those in payment at end 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_5718">Statistics are not held on the number of people who applied for or were refused mortgage interest supplement. The scheme is delivered locally by community welfare officers (CWOs), who interview claimants when they first present to enquire about their possible entitlement for mortgage interest supplement. Claim details are recorded electronically only in cases where it is established that mortgage interest supplement is payable.</p>
            <p eId="para_5719">Under existing arrangements, an appeal against a decision on entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance is made in the first instance to a designated appeals officer in the HSE. A person may, if they so wish, make a further appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office, if they are dissatisfied with the decision of the HSE appeals officer. Details of the number of mortgage interest supplement appeals to the HSE Appeals Office are currently being compiled by the HSE and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as they become available.</p>
            <p eId="para_5720">Statistics on the number of mortgage interest supplement decisions appealed to the Social Welfare Appeals Office and the outcomes are provided in the following tabular statement. This shows that 37 appeals were finalised in the first ten months of 2008 in relation to mortgage interest supplement.  Some 25 of these were disallowed. That office has advised that they do not hold details of the average duration of a mortgage interest supplement appeal. The average duration of a supplementary welfare allowance appeal in 2007 was 8 weeks while the average for all appeals determined during 2007 was 22 weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_5919">The back to education allowance is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the work force.  The scheme is designed to enable people in receipt of social welfare payments to pursue an approved full-time education course, subject to fulfilling the qualifying conditions.  The underlying objective is to raise education and skill levels among the long-term unemployed and those most distant from the labour market.</p>
            <p eId="para_5920">One of the conditions for the back to education allowance is that a person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment for a specified period immediately prior to commencing the relevant course.</p>
            <p eId="para_5921">For jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance, the specified period is 6 months (156 days) for 2nd level courses and 12 months (312 days) for 3rd level courses.  In order to support the activation of the unemployed the specified waiting period for access to the third level option was reduced to nine months for participants in the National Employment Action Plan.  There is no waiting period for an unemployed person who is awarded statutory redundancy and who has established entitlement to a social welfare payment.  In relation to illness benefit, in order to qualify for the back to education allowance, a person has to be 2 years on illness benefit immediately prior to commencing an approved course.</p>
            <p eId="para_5922">The recent changes to the duration of the payment of jobseeker's benefit and illness benefit are necessary to control expenditure on these schemes by aligning the contribution conditions for these benefits more closely to the level and duration of the benefits being provided.  The changes are designed to ensure a uniform, rationalised, approach across the short-term social insurance schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5923">The back to education scheme is subject to review on an ongoing basis to ensure that it meets its objectives. The relationship between the qualifying criteria for the BTEA and the revised conditions for receipt of illness and disability benefit will be reviewed as appropriate.</p>

            <p eId="para_5925">The back to education scheme is a second chance education opportunity designed to remove the barriers to participation in second and third level education.  It encourages and facilitates people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force.  The objective of the scheme is to enhance the employability skills of vulnerable groups who are distant from the labour market.</p>
            <p eId="para_5926">The statistics on participation in the back to education scheme are collated and validated at the end April each year in order to get an overview for the full academic year.  The full-year figure for 2006/2007 was 8,090 with 3,359 participating on the second level option and 4,731 availing of the third level option.  This increased to 8,883 for 2007/2008 with 4,242 participants on the second level option and 4,641 participating in third level courses.  This represents an increase of 9.8% in the number availing of the back to education allowance during this period.  The figure in November 2008 is 9,796.  This is the highest ever recorded and is expected to rise further in the coming months.</p>

There is no waiting period for an unemployed person who is awarded statutory redundancy and who has established entitlement to a social welfare payment.  According to the data currently available, of the 9,796 who are recorded as participating in the back to education allowance in November 2008, there are 113 who were awarded statutory redundancy and 75 who were referred earlier to the third level option as a result of their participation in the NEAP.</p>
            <p eId="para_5928">The figures for the 2008/2009 academic year will be validated and collated fully in April 2009 and more complete information will be available at that time.</p>

            <p eId="para_6127">The Occupational Injury Benefit scheme operated by the Department provides entitlement to benefit for persons suffering from certain prescribed diseases which are listed in the legislation and where that person has contracted that disease in the course of their employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_6128">Where a person has contracted one of the diseases listed in the legislation, benefits are payable if they were employed in an occupation which is specifically prescribed in relation to that disease. In addition, benefits may be payable if the claimant can show that the disease was contracted through an employment not specifically prescribed in relation to that disease.</p>
            <p eId="para_6129">Employment under a contract of service as a miner is insurable for occupational injuries benefit under the Social Welfare Acts. Miners who are unable to work due to an accident arising from their employment may be entitled to occupational injury benefit for the first 26 weeks of their claim. If their incapacity extends beyond that period they may receive illness benefit or invalidity pension, subject to meeting the qualifying conditions for these payments. Miners may also be entitled to disablement benefit under the occupational injury scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_6130">Disablement benefit is a compensation payment specifically for those who suffer a loss of physical or mental faculty as a result of an accident at work or a disease prescribed in legislation that they contracted at work. Medical assessments are undertaken in all such cases to determine the degree of disablement, which is calculated by comparison of the state of health of the applicant with the norm for a person of the same age and gender.</p>
            <p eId="para_6131">I understand that the Deputy's concerns lie with the fact that Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is not amongst the specific diseases specified in the legislation governing entitlement to Disablement Benefit under the Occupational Injury Benefit scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_6132">Following a careful examination of the matter, it has been found that it would be inappropriate to specify COPD as a prescribed illness for the purposes of determining entitlement to Occupational Injury Benefit. COPD is a common clinical condition which is not specifically linked to a particular occupation. It is not possible to establish a causal link between coal mining (or indeed, any other occupation) and the experience of COPD.</p>
            <p eId="para_6133">I should point out that the current position is that where miners develop pneumoconiosis, which is a prescribed disease, as a result of their occupation, then Occupational Injury Benefit is awarded by the Department. Persons claiming benefit in such cases are referred to a Consultant Respiratory Physician in the first instance for an examination and report. This examination consists of a clinical assessment and pulmonary function testing. The latter is a standardised test that establishes the extent of lung malfunction irrespective of the specific medical condition giving rise to that malfunction. Disablement Benefit is awarded on the basis of the consultant's objective report, including the results of the pulmonary function testing. I should mention also that if COPD is present in such a case, and it can be reasonably linked to exposure to coal dust, the disablement award will reflect this.</p>

            <p eId="para_6145">I propose to take Questions Nos. 342 and 343 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6146">In common with other areas of the public service a reduction of 3% in payroll costs will apply to the Defence Forces. The initial step towards achieving this reduction has been to stop further recruitment for the remainder of 2008.  The priority for recruitment is likely to be in areas such as cadets, medical and apprentices.</p>
            <p eId="para_6147">Recruitment in 2009 will be rescheduled. The situation will be closely monitored. This monitoring will take account of projected and actual natural wastage in establishing the appropriate level of recruitment in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_6148">The military authorities have advised that they will continue to accept application forms from those interested in general service recruitment.  The applications will be kept on a register, applicants will be issued with an acknowledgement letter advising them of the position in relation to recruitment and they will be kept informed on the status of their applications on an on-going basis.   Similarly, those who have already applied and have completed some of the recruitment selection process have been informed in writing of the current status regarding recruitment.</p>
            <p eId="para_6149">In addition to notifying each applicant individually a note to this effect has been placed on the Defence Forces internet site www.military.ie</p>
            <p eId="para_6150">The Defence Forces is maintaining all applications on its register for 2009 and therefore if recruitment proceeds candidates will not have to apply again.  However some stages in the recruitment process such as medical examination, physical fitness testing and Garda Síochána Security Clearance are time dependant.  Where there is a considerable time lapse between these stages and commencement of training, candidates would be required to undergo these stages again.  Any stage that is not time dependant, such as interviews, would not have to be repeated. These arrangements are dependent on recruitment proceeding.</p>

            <p eId="para_6191">The EU Directive on the Energy Performance of Buildings, which was transposed into Irish law in the form of the European Communities (Energy Performance of Buildings) Regulations 2006, introduced a requirement for a Building Energy Rating (BER) system.</p>
            <p eId="para_6192">I am strongly committed to meeting Ireland's national and international obligations in relation to the energy performance of buildings and good progress has been made to date in developing and implementing Ireland's BER system, which is being introduced on a phased basis, in line with the Regulations, as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_6193">BER certification for new dwellings was introduced with effect from 1 January 2007, with a transitional exemption applying to new dwellings for which planning permission was applied for on or before 31 December 2006, provided they were substantially completed by 30 June 2008;</p>

            <p eId="para_6197">While responsibility for the Regulations rests with my Department, responsibility for the operational roll-out of the BER system rests with Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) which operates under the aegis of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and which is designated as the issuing authority under the Regulations.  BER assessments are undertaken by qualified BER assessors who have completed the necessary training and have been registered by SEI to carry out the assessment of particular categories of buildings. To date, 3,759 persons have successfully completed training courses with training providers accredited by SEI in relation to BER certification of new dwellings and some 939 of these trained assessors have so far registered with SEI as BER assessors.</p>
            <p eId="para_6198">With regard to enforcement, a person who offers a building for sale or letting on or from 1 January, 2009 or any agent acting on their behalf, is required to produce a copy of the Building Energy Rating certificate to any person expressing an interest in purchasing or taking a letting in the building.  A person who contravenes these requirements commits an offence, unless the building in question is specifically exempted under Article 3 of the Regulations, and is liable, on prosecution by the Building Control Authority in whose functional area the building is situated, to be fined a sum not exceeding €5,000.</p>

Inclusion of a property on a Record of Protected Structures does not imply a prohibition on works and/or development in the future.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy Michael Finneran)</from>
            <p eId="para_6228">I propose to take Questions Nos. 359 to 361, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6229">Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence (an executive office of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform) was established by Government in June 2007, with the key responsibility to ensure the delivery of a well coordinated "whole of Government" response to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  The major priority for Cosc is to produce a National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence which has the support of Government and non-governmental organisations in the sector.  This work should inform actions needed to improve service provision, including emergency accommodation and refuge provision places.</p>
            <p eId="para_6230">Capital funding is available through my Department's Capital Assistance Scheme to approved voluntary housing bodies to provide accommodation to meet the special housing needs of groups including the elderly, the homeless, persons with disabilities and victims of domestic violence.  My Department's involvement with the scheme relates primarily to the provision of funds for individual projects.  The administration of the scheme, including the appraisal of new applications, the management of the planning and procurement stages of projects and the certification that particular projects comply with the terms of the scheme, are the responsibility of the appropriate local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_6231">Given that the accommodation provided by voluntary housing bodies for victims of domestic violence may often be in multi-purpose accommodation or may not be categorised specifically as refuges, a separate figure is not available for capital expenditure on accommodation for victims of domestic violence.</p>
            <p eId="para_6232">While my Department does not hold details in relation to all refuges for victims of domestic violence, information is available in relation to the funding provided towards the operational costs of certain refuges and transitional accommodation which are used for such purposes.  The expenditure recouped to local authorities by my Department under section 10 of the Housing Act 1988 for this purpose in 2007 and to date in 2008 is set out in the Table which follows.</p>
            <p eId="para_6233">Housing authorities have statutory responsibility for homeless accommodation and any proposals for additional accommodation for homeless persons are a matter for consideration in the first instance by the relevant housing authority.</p>

In the context of my Department's ongoing monitoring of progress on the various schemes, and against the current market background, my Department will be reviewing the overall position in regard to activity in the affordable housing sector at year-end. However, the information available from local authorities would suggest that the strong level of affordable housing delivery in 2008 and wider market considerations are combining to increase the stock of homes on hands. As an input to reviewing the end year position, my Department has requested the Affordable Homes Partnership to examine the position in selected areas, in conjunction with the relevant housing authorities, with a view to identifying actions that might assist in the sale of such units or in their deployment for other housing purposes.</p>

The Health and Safety Authority (HSA) has been designated as the central competent authority for enforcement of these regulations. The Directives requirements in relation to land use policies are reflected in the development planning provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the development consent procedures set out in the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 and 2006.</p>

An Outside Appointments Board for the Local Government Sector was established in June 2008 to consider applications from senior local authority employees, including City and County Managers, who intend to take up appointments outside the local government sector following resignation or retirement. The role of the Board is to maintain public trust in the local government service through independent assessment of post employment appointments that local authority employees propose to take up within one year of resigning or retiring from the local government service.</p>

The Ward Union hunt applied for a licence for the 2008/2009 season from 13 October, 2008 to 31 March, 2009 and the duration of the licence issued was in line with previous licences which were valid for similar periods.

            <p eId="para_6522">I propose to take Questions Nos. 389 to 391, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6523">The Government's policy with regard to the future development of the postal service is to ensure Irish customers, both business and residential, enjoy competitively priced, high quality postal services on a par with the highest quality standards in key comparator economies elsewhere in the EU.  Electronic communications services, while providing threats to the postal service in the form of electronic substitution, will also provide opportunities in the form of e-fulfilment.</p>
            <p eId="para_6524">I believe that there will continue to be a key national role for An Post in delivery of mails and parcels. However, over the coming years, competition can be expected to increase in these sectors, whether from the privately owned express sector, from the large European public operators now looking for international business or from electronic substitution. Indeed, liberalisation of the mail market in Ireland has already commenced and there are currently in excess of thirty operators with authorisations from Communications Regulation.</p>
            <p eId="para_6525">An Post has a statutory obligation to provide a universal postal service, including the provision of a delivery to the home or premises of every natural or legal person not less than five days per week. The third postal directive, which will be transposed into Irish law by 31 December 2010, maintains the universal service obligation at the current level whilst providing for the completion of the liberalisation process in the postal sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_6526">It is also Government policy that An Post remains a strong and viable company, in a position to compete in a liberalised market and provide a high quality, nationwide postal service. It is, however, the responsibility of the board and management of the company to make strategic decisions regarding its future and how it will prepare itself for future competition, particularly in advance of the full liberalisation of the postal sector.  My department and I regularly meet with An Post to receive updates on the key issues affecting the company including those as they relate to market liberalisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_6527">Following on from the recently held public consultation process on the key decisions to be made when transposing the directive, my officials have examined the submissions received in response to the consultation, including those from An Post and other postal operators,  and are drafting proposals on the legal framework which will apply in a liberalised market.  Such draft legislative proposals will be subject to a regulatory impact analysis and will include further engagement, early in 2009, with interested stakeholders on issues arising from the process. As part of the transposition process my officials will also examine the experiences of other EU countries in liberalising and developing the postal market.</p>

            <p eId="para_6530">I propose to take Questions Nos. 392 and 393 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6531">The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.</p>
            <p eId="para_6532">The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services, by competing private sector service providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_6533">The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These included providing grant-aid under the now concluded Group Broadband Scheme and ongoing investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).</p>
            <p eId="para_6534">There are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services. In this regard my Department has undertaken to implement a National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  The NBS is designed to deliver broadband to areas where the market has failed to provide services.  It will bridge the digital divide, create greater equality in terms of social and economic inclusion and remove the disadvantage caused by a lack of broadband services.  It will also facilitate competition in the broadband market in the regions leading to greater choice, quality and value for money to the consumer.</p>
            <p eId="para_6535">On the 25 November 2008 I announced that 3, a Hutchison Whampoa company, has been selected as the preferred tenderer for the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) following the conclusion of a comprehensive competitive procurement process.  The NBS contract is expected to be signed with 3 by mid-December.</p>
            <p eId="para_6536">NBS consumers will be provided with a reliable and price competitive broadband connection consisting of an always-on service of at least 1mbps.  Higher speeds will be experienced by some consumers located closer to base stations.  The service will be upgraded to higher specifications during the 68-month contract without any increase in charge to the consumer.</p>
            <p eId="para_6537">According to the latest OECD report, which includes data up to June 2008 Ireland has one of the strongest per capita broadband subscription growths being ranked 4th out of 30 countries.  We have closed the gap on the OECD average with extraordinary improvement over the past 2 years.  The OECD average increase is 2.7 subscribers per 100 inhabitants; Ireland's growth was 4.1 subscribers per 100 inhabitants. It should be noted that mobile broadband is not yet being published for international statistic comparison but is expected to be in the future.  The publication of mobile broadband statistics should improve Ireland's ranking.</p>
            <p eId="para_6538">The policy framework for future broadband development is set out in the consultation paper on Next Generation Broadband, which I published last July.  A central commitment is that Ireland will have universal access to broadband by 2010 and that by 2012 our broadband speeds will equal or exceed those in comparator EU regions.  The consultation period on the paper has now concluded and my officials are evaluating the submissions received.  I will publish the final policy paper shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_6539">I am also actively engaged with the EU Commission's review of the regulatory framework for electronic communications.  Effective regulation, and more consistency in regulatory approaches across all the Member States, will enhance the conditions necessary for investment in communications technology and allow Ireland exploit the opportunities such technology brings for the benefit of our economy and society.</p>

            <p eId="para_6541">The Digital Hub Development Agency (DHDA) continues to develop and grow the Digital Hub.  There are now 857 employees working in 101 companies located in the Digital Hub.

Approximately one in six digital media companies currently operating in Ireland is based in the Digital Hub.  The work of these companies encompasses computer gaming, animation, online bookings, Internet security, website development, mobile technologies, broadcasting, design and Internet services.  Such highly-skilled knowledge economy companies are key to maintaining and developing economic success.</p>
            <p eId="para_6542">Recently, GOA Games Services, a subsidiary of France Telecom, which already employs 200 people in the Digital Hub, announced an expansion to 400 employees in the next 12 months.

The DHDA delivers a very successful learning programme, which provides state-of-the-art digital media education to schools and the wider community in Dublin's south west inner city, with a view to improving learning, employment and leisure opportunities for local residents.  The programme is hugely successful and almost 40 digital media learning programmes have been delivered to almost 3,300 participants in local schools and community groups to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_6543">In relation to community engagement, the DHDA delivers an award-winning consultation process, the Community, Public, Private Partnership (CPPP) process.  The process is chaired by Mr. Peter Cassells, and brings together around 60 community, public sector and private sector organisations.  The process monitors delivery of the DHDA's development plan.  As a direct result of this engagement, the employment service for the local community and a local adult education centre are both now operating from the Digital Hub campus.</p>
            <p eId="para_6544">Physical development/urban regeneration at the Digital Hub is provided in three ways:</p>
            <p eId="para_6545">1. Direct development by the DHDA;</p>
            <p eId="para_6546">2. Contracts entered into with two private developers; and</p>
            <p eId="para_6547">3. Leasing of space in the locality by the DHDA.</p>
            <p eId="para_6548">In order to meet the demand for commercial property for digital media companies at the Digital Hub, the DHDA has leased office space to meet the requirements of its tenant companies.  The DHDA has now reached the point where all of its own available space has been occupied — approximately 80,000 sq.ft in State ownership by the DHDA or OPW — with a further 80,000 sq.ft occupied by Digital Hub tenants under interim lease arrangements with third parties.  A further 20,000 sq.ft is likely to be delivered during the first half of 2009 under a proposal to redevelop another State owned building.</p>
            <p eId="para_6549">Planning permission was granted earlier this year for 140,000 sq.ft of digital media offices.  The aim is to deliver a complete new city quarter, encompassing enterprise, retail, residential and community learning space by 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_6550">Because of the above successes, the Digital Hub has gained an international reputation as a model of best practice.  The project now serves as a showcase for Irish innovation, attracting delegations from over 50 different countries each year.</p>

            <p eId="para_6552">REPS 4 is a measure under the current Rural Development Programme 2007–13 and is subject to different EU Regulations from the preceding versions of REPS. Under REPS 4, all payments are to be made in just two instalments. The first payment, of 75%, can be made only when all administrative checks on all 2008 applications for REPS 4 and the Single Payment Scheme are completed.  This is why it has not yet been possible to release payments even to farmers who applied for REPS 4 some time before the closing date of 15 May.</p>
            <p eId="para_6553">The process of checking and approving applications is subject to a detailed set of procedures designed to meet national and EU audit requirements, and in line with these requirements the various stages of the process are assigned to different grades of staff.  An effect of recent industrial action in my Department's local offices was that the process was temporarily interrupted.  I am pleased to say that, with the assistance of the Labour Relations Commission, the industrial action was brought to an end and work resumed last week.  The administrative checks are now at an advanced stage and I hope that payments of the 75% instalment can start to be released soon.  The second instalment of 25% cannot be paid before the last REPS on-farm inspection has taken place.</p>
            <p eId="para_6554">While I am anxious that the REPS 4 payments should go out as soon as possible, there are of course still over 48,000 farmers in REPS 3, and just under 16,000 of those have anniversary dates on 1 November and 1 December this year. Staff in my Department's local offices are currently engaged in processing the annual payment applications for these farmers as well as the REPS 4 cases.  Where possible, payment will issue before Christmas on valid REPS 3 applications (1C's) returned before 5 December, 2008. At this time of the year the workload of local office staff is therefore exceptionally heavy, and while every effort is being made to release all payments promptly it is not possible to avoid delays entirely. I have asked senior management in my Department to prioritise the processing of payments and to give me regular updates on the situation.</p>

            <p eId="para_6621">REPS 4 is a measure under the current Rural Development Programme 2007–13 and is subject to different EU Regulations from the preceding versions of REPS. Under REPS 4, all payments are to be made in just two instalments. The first payment, of 75%, can be made only when all administrative checks on all 2008 applications for REPS 4 and the Single Payment Scheme are completed.  This is why it has not yet been possible to release payments even to farmers who applied for REPS 4 some time before the closing date of 15 May.</p>
            <p eId="para_6622">The process of checking and approving applications is subject to a detailed set of procedures designed to meet national and EU audit requirements, and in line with these requirements the various stages of the process are assigned to different grades of staff.  An effect of recent industrial action in my Department's local offices was that the process was temporarily interrupted.  I am pleased to say that, with the assistance of the Labour Relations Commission, the industrial action was brought to an end and work resumed last week.  The administrative checks are now at an advanced stage and I hope that payments of the 75% instalment can start to be released soon.  The second instalment of 25% cannot be paid before the last REPS on-farm inspection has taken place.</p>
            <p eId="para_6623">While I am anxious that the REPS 4 payments should go out as soon as possible, there are of course still over 48,000 farmers in REPS 3, and just under 16,000 of those have anniversary dates on 1 November and 1 December this year. Staff in my Department's local offices are currently engaged in processing the annual payment applications for these farmers as well as the REPS 4 cases.  Where possible, payment will issue before Christmas on valid REPS 3 applications (1Cs) returned before 5 December, 2008. At this time of the year the workload of local office staff is therefore exceptionally heavy, and while every effort is being made to release all payments promptly it is not possible to avoid delays entirely.  I have asked senior management in my Department to prioritise the processing of payments and give me regular updates on the situation.</p>

            <p eId="para_6674">An application was received on 1 April 2008 requesting the transfer of 80.63 Single Payment entitlements to the person named from another farmer by way of lease.  The entitlements in question are categorized as ‘National Reserve' entitlements.  EU Regulation provide that National Reserve entitlements may not, except in the case of gift or inheritance, be transferred for a period of five years from the date of their allocation.

            <p eId="para_6676">However the Agricultural Consultant subsequently contacted my Department late last week and confirmed that the person named did not want to withdraw his National Reserve application.

However, where the holding of an applicant is identified as potentially not meeting this minimum stocking density requirement, the applicant is invited to submit evidence of satisfactory stocking i.e. Flock Register, Horse Passports.</p>

            <p eId="para_6687">REPS 4 is a measure under the current Rural Development Programme 2007–13 and is subject to different EU Regulations from the preceding versions of REPS. Under REPS 4, all payments are to be made in just two instalments. The first payment, of 75%, can be made only when all administrative checks on all 2008 applications for REPS 4 and the Single Payment Scheme are completed.  This is why it has not yet been possible to release payments even to farmers who applied for REPS 4 some time before the closing date of 15 May.</p>
            <p eId="para_6688">The process of checking and approving applications is subject to a detailed set of procedures designed to meet national and EU audit requirements, and in line with these requirements the various stages of the process are assigned to different grades of staff.  An effect of recent industrial action in my Department's local offices was that the process was temporarily interrupted.  I am pleased to say that, with the assistance of the Labour Relations Commission, the industrial action was brought to an end and work resumed last week.  The administrative checks are now at an advanced stage and I hope that payments of the 75% instalment can start to be released soon.  The second instalment of 25% cannot be paid before the last REPS on-farm inspection has taken place.</p>
            <p eId="para_6689">While I am anxious that the REPS 4 payments should go out as soon as possible, there are of course still over 48,000 farmers in REPS 3, and just under 16,000 of those have anniversary dates on 1 November and 1 December this year.  Staff in my Department's local offices are currently engaged in processing the annual payment applications for these farmers as well as the REPS 4 cases.  Where possible, payment will issue before Christmas on valid REPS 3 applications (1Cs) returned before 5 December, 2008.  At this time of the year the workload of local office staff is therefore exceptionally heavy, and while every effort is being made to release all payments promptly it is not possible to avoid delays entirely.  I have asked senior management in my Department to prioritise the processing of payments and give me regular updates on the situation.</p>

            <p eId="para_6697">As the Inspectorate is part of the Department of Education and Science, all costs associated with its work are paid from the administrative budget of the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_6698">Whole school evaluations and subject inspections form just part of the Inspectorate's business plan in any given year. In 2007, for example, the Inspectorate carried out 303 whole school evaluations, 758 subject inspections, 23 programme evaluations, 23 evaluations of centres for education, the evaluation of 57 Irish-language summer colleges and the probation of 2,362 primary teachers (3 visits on average per teacher). The total number of inspections/evaluations carried out in 2007 was 3526.</p>
            <p eId="para_6699">In addition, inspectors were also involved in a wide range of other work such as participation in over 200 Section 29 cases (expulsion or refusal to enrol pupils by schools), the preparation of composite evaluation reports, continuing professional development, advice and support to schools and teachers and also in contributing to curriculum development and policy formulation &amp; development.</p>
            <p eId="para_6700">It is not possible at present to separate out the costs specifically associated with whole school evaluations and subject inspections from other evaluations and from other costs incurred in carrying out the wider range of duties undertaken by inspectors. Other costs associated with the work of the Inspectorate include the Departmental secretarial and support services provided to support its evaluative and other work.</p>
            <p eId="para_6701">In 2007, there were 159 inspectors at various grades and the total gross salary cost for 2007 was €13,450,363. The total travel and subsistence expenses paid, in accordance with Civil Service rates, in 2007 was €1,688,886.</p>

            <p eId="para_6733">I can inform the Deputy that NEPS, in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment. This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>

            <p eId="para_6749">Enrolment in individual state funded schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters.  The Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.  This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>
            <p eId="para_6750">It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act.  In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful.  In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 which, subject to very limited exceptions, prohibits schools from discriminating against people in relation to  a number of matters including the admission or the terms or conditions of admission of a person as a student to the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_6751">Where a board of management refuses to enrol a student in a school the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student themselves, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science.  A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality.  In most cases appeals must be dealt with in 30 days.  Where appropriate, the Secretary General may give whatever directions to the board of management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of.  Information relating to Section 29 appeals is available on the Department's website at <i>www.education.ie</i>

            <p eId="para_6782">The amount spent by my Department on the distribution of publications to schools etc. cannot be separated from the overall cost of postage including bulk postage issued from my Department. My Department's total expenditure on bulk postage, which is the general means of distributing publications, for the years in question is as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_6783">2004 — €1,313,203.75</p>
            <p eId="para_6784">2005 — €1,458,607.33</p>
            <p eId="para_6785">2006 — €1,652,104.16</p>
            <p eId="para_6786">2007 — €1,546,530.87</p>
            <p eId="para_6787">2008 — €1,553,803.54 (to end October)</p>
            <p eId="para_6788">These figures include the cost of posting a variety of materials to schools and teachers including payslips (approximately 2.1 million payslips are issued annually), publications, circulars etc.  It should also be noted that my Department agrees on occasion to circulate relevant materials produced by other organisations to schools, the postage costs given above do not exclusively relate to material emanating from the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_6789">My Department regularly reviews its postage arrangements with a view to achieving maximum value for money.  In this regard, last year my Department introduced a system of regular bulk mailings to schools in order to avail of discounted rates and to minimise postal costs.  In addition, the rollout of the Department's Online Claims System, which enables schools to submit claims electronically to the Department, has resulted in a reduction in postage costs at both Department and school level of approximately €500,000 per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_6790">In a further effort to reduce the costs of printing and distribution of publications in 2009 it is now corporate policy within my Department that all publications will be web based and will only be printed and distributed by post in exceptional circumstances.</p>

            <p eId="para_6798">The main focus of Social Inclusion measures, deployed by my Department to combat educational disadvantage, will be to target available resources in schools included in DEIS (the Action plan for Educational Disadvantage).  This approach is in line with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General which are set out in his report on Primary Disadvantage of 2006, which recommended that the Department should focus its educational disadvantage measures on those schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.  The measures and supports received by this school under the DEIS programme will not be affected by the recent Budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_6799">Specific information in relation to the detailed staffing allocations that individual schools will have for the commencement of the academic year 2009/10 cannot be determined until the allocation processes have fully concluded.  There is nothing exceptional in this.  The allocation processes include appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them  under the staffing schedules.  This is particularly relevant at post-primary level where the appellate process considers in particular any specific curricular needs of the school concerned.  At post-primary there is no effective system wide redeployment scheme at present and this can mean that schools retain teachers, though over quota, and in addition discrete allocations are made to post-primary schools for example to cater for pupils with Special Educational Needs and those with Language difficulties and these allocations can also alter the ultimate position of the school in relation to any over quota position.</p>
            <p eId="para_6800">Schools are currently returning data to the Department of Education and Science in relation to their enrolment as of 30 September. The Department has commenced processing this data although all schools have not yet made their returns.  The allocation processes including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_6815">I propose to take Questions Nos. 445, 449, 450, 452, 453, 456 to 461, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6816">The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared.  The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements.  Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_6817">My Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way in relation to their staffing and grant allocations.  The preparatory work for this has commenced with the processing of enrolment data that has been received from schools.  The staffing allocation processes including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year.  The allocation process includes appellate  mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  In addition to the mainstream classroom teachers my Department also allocates teaching resources to schools for special needs and language support.  The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_6818">I have no difficulty in setting out for this House or for the public generally the overall changes on aggregate teacher numbers or on grant levels in schools for the 2009/10 school year.  I will do this when the allocation processes have been completed.  Furthermore the staffing schedule will be published and it is a transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and fairly and know where they stand.</p>
            <p eId="para_6819">At this time the priority for my Department within the resources available to it is to carry out those processes in a timely manner.  Diverting resources in order to compile either historic information or to create staffing or funding profiles for all of the individual schools requested by the Deputy, information which at this time could only be speculative, could not be justified and would in fact impede the process.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_6827">I propose to take Questions Nos. 446 to 448, inclusive, 451, 454, 455 and 474 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6828">The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared.  The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements.  Even with the Budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_6829">My Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way in relation to their staffing and grant allocations.  The preparatory work for this has commenced with the processing of enrolment data that has been received from schools.  The staffing allocation processes including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year.  The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  In addition to the mainstream classroom teachers my Department also allocates teaching resources to schools for special needs and language support.  The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_6830">I have no difficulty in setting out for this House or for the public generally the overall changes on aggregate teacher numbers or on grant levels in schools for the 2009/10 school year.  I will do this when the allocation processes have been completed.  Furthermore the staffing schedule will be published and it is a transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and  fairly and know where they stand.  At this time the priority for my Department within the resources available to it is to carry out those processes in a timely manner.  Diverting resources in order to compile either historic information or to create staffing or funding profiles for all of the individual schools requested by the Deputies, information which at this time could only be speculative, could not be justified and would in fact impede the process.</p>

            <p eId="para_7027">The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and  to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared. The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements. Even with the budget measures in place there  will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_7028">In terms of the position in respect of any one school for September 2009 my  Department has commenced processing enrolment data that has been received from schools. The allocation processes including notification to schools will  commence early in the New Year. The allocation process includes appellate  mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them  under the staffing schedules. The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_7029">The appellate process is particularly relevant at post-primary level where any  specific curricular needs of the school concerned are considered. Also at  post-primary there is no effective system wide redeployment scheme at present  and this can mean that schools retain teachers, though over quota.</p>
            <p eId="para_7030">I have no difficulty in setting out for this House or for the public generally  the overall changes on aggregate teacher numbers in schools for the 2009/10  school year. I will do this when the allocation processes have been completed.  Furthermore the staffing schedule will be published and it is a transparent and  clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and fairly and know  where they stand.</p>
            <p eId="para_7031">At this time the priority for my Department within the resources available to  it is to carry out those processes in a timely manner. Diverting resources in  order to create staffing profiles for all of the individual schools requested  by the Deputy, information which at this time could only be speculative, could  not be justified and would in fact impede the process.</p>

            <p eId="para_7036">Since the Summer Works Scheme was introduced, over 3,000 projects, costing in excess of €300 million, have been completed.  With so many smaller projects having been completed over the past few years, the particular emphasis in 2008 has been on providing sufficient school places in developing areas, while also delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary  school accommodation throughout the country. Accordingly my Department has  focused on delivering as many large projects as possible in 2008 and funding  was not made available for a Summer Works Scheme this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_7037">However, I recognise the benefits of the scheme in addressing the needs of  schools and I have previously informed the house of my intention to have a  Summer Works Scheme in 2009. The details of the operation of the scheme in 2009  and the level of funding to be made available under the scheme in 2009 are  currently being considered. The Professional and Technical Reports provided by  schools for 2008 can be used again for future projects so that schools will not  be at the loss of expenditure on them.</p>

The school was proposing to develop a playground and all weather pitch at a cost in excess of €500,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_7040">One of the terms and conditions of the scheme is that proposed projects must be carried out within the confines of the school's vested site.

            <p eId="para_7043">The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and the Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. The Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>
            <p eId="para_7044">It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement  an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_7045">In 1993, the Department issued a circular (M 51/93) to post-primary schools,  advising of a memorandum of agreement between the Department and the  post-primary schools managerial association, that selection for the purposes of  enrolment based on academic ability should be discontinued.</p>
            <p eId="para_7046">Under section 15(2)(<i>d</i>) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally  obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that  policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents’ choice are respected.</p>
            <p eId="para_7047">Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process  where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the  Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil,  the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational  Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department. In the case of the latter, only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld can the  Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.</p>
            <p eId="para_7048">The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for  their child. The NEWB advises parents to apply to more than one school in order  to assist in securing a school placement. The Board can be contacted at  National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22  Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</p>

            <p eId="para_7056">The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. Decisions were made in order to control expenditure and to  ensure sustainability in the long term. In this respect my Department, while  protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure,  could not be entirely spared, and I acknowledge the impact of funding  restrictions in a number of areas, including at school level. However, these  are the inevitable result of the challenging economic environment and the need  to manage Exchequer resources prudently. These decisions included increasing  the pupil teacher ratio across all second-level schools from 18:1 to 19:1. In  the case of fee-charging post-primary schools, there will be an additional  one-point adjustment to 20:1.</p>
            <p eId="para_7057">As the processing of the September 2008 enrolment returns for post-primary  schools are not yet finalised, it is not possible at this time to state the impact the changes will have on the allocation of mainstream teaching posts for the 2009/10 school year for the school in question. The staffing schedule for the 2009/10 school year will issue to all schools as soon as possible, and at that time, a more accurate indication of the mainstream staffing levels will be available.</p>
            <p eId="para_7058">The allocation processes include appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. This is particularly relevant at post-primary level where the appellate process considers in particular any specific curricular needs of the school concerned.  At post-primary there is no effective system wide redeployment scheme at  present and this can mean that schools retain teachers, though over quota, and  in addition discrete allocations are made to post-primary schools for example  to cater for pupils with Special Educational Needs and those with Language  difficulties and these allocations can also alter the ultimate position of the  school in relation to any over quota position.</p>
            <p eId="para_7059">My Department is aware of funding pressures on schools. However, progress has been made in recent years that has seen the post-primary school capitation  grant increased by €15 per pupil and now amounts to €331 per pupil. In  addition, voluntary secondary schools have benefited by the increase of €15 per  pupil in 2008 in the support services grant bringing that grant to €204 per pupil.</p>
            <p eId="para_7060">The cumulative increase of €30 per pupil in a voluntary secondary school brings  the aggregate grant to €535 per pupil. These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to 40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services.</p>

            <p eId="para_7068">The amount of the grant payable to each local authority was based on the number of pupils in the relevant area and amounted to €4.52 per pupil.

The indirect impacts of this measure in individual library areas will be a matter to be determined by each local authority in the context of its overall resources and the services it provides.</p>

            <p eId="para_7092">Notwithstanding the increase of €302 million in the Education budget for 2009, in making the announcement of the Budget measures for education, I stressed that tough choices had to be made in meeting the needs of the education sector in these difficult times.  The resources available to the Department have meant that these choices have been very challenging.  The decision made to suspend the substitution cover for uncertified sick leave in primary and second level schools was a difficult one.</p>
            <p eId="para_7093">The supervision / substitution scheme will continue to operate without any changes and teachers who agree to participate will continue to receive an annual payment of €1,789 in addition to their normal salary.</p>
            <p eId="para_7094">I am aware that from January the changes regarding substitution will present particular challenges for school managers but I felt that suspending part of the improvements made in 2003 to the substitution scheme was preferable to impacting more significantly on teacher numbers.</p>
            <p eId="para_7095">As we manage through this difficult period I am asking teachers in all schools to co-operate fully with school managers in coping with this change in the interest of the students.  I am also requesting the school managerial bodies to ensure that the supervision / substitution scheme is operated with maximum effectiveness in all schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_7097">The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared.  The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements.  Even with the Budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_7098">My Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way in relation to their staffing allocations.  The staffing schedule will be published and it is a transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and fairly and know where they stand.  The preparatory work for the staffing allocations has commenced with the processing of enrolment data that has been received from schools.  The staffing allocation processes including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year.  The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_7099">I have no difficulty in setting out for this House or for the public generally the overall net impact of the budget measures on aggregate teacher numbers in schools for the 2009/10 school year.  I will do this when the allocation process has been completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_7100">At this time the priority for my Department within the resources available to it is to carry out those processes in a timely manner.  Diverting resources in order to create staffing profiles for the school referred to by the Deputy, information which at this time could only be speculative, could not be justified and would in fact impede the process.</p>

            <p eId="para_7163">The budget measures will mean that the level of language support will be  reduced from a maximum of six extra teachers per school to a maximum of two  teachers per school, as was the case before 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_7164">Nonetheless, schools that require language support will still be entitled to get it. We still envisage having over 1,400 language support teachers in our schools in September 2009 and up to about 500 other teachers in part-time  posts. By any standards this is a very significant resource and the challenge  will be to ensure that it is used to maximum effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_7165">As I announced on budget day we will also provide for some alleviation for the position of those schools where there is a significant concentration of  newcomer pupils as a proportion of the overall enrolment. This will be done on  a case by case basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_7166">The allocation process for language support teachers is an annual one and existing provision is not rolled over automatically. Schools will be applying  afresh in the spring and early summer of 2009 for the 2009/10 school year,  based on their assessment of the prospective needs of existing pupils and any  new pupils they are enrolling. The position for individual schools will become  clear at that stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_7167">Moreover, OECD research in this field (PISA 2006) shows that Ireland is the OECD country with the highest distribution of newcomers across schools meaning  that schools with higher concentrations of newcomer children are relatively  unusual. ESRI data also shows that only a small percentage of schools have high  concentrations of newcomer children.</p>
            <p eId="para_7168">I realise that standards are not simply achieved by supplying teaching resources and that the quality of the supports that the child receives and the  inclusive atmosphere cultivated in schools are important factors influencing  the quality of learning achieved by migrant children. My Department recognises  that we must monitor and review the educational experiences that are provided  to migrant students so that we can improve the quality and effectiveness of our  provision. The Department is undertaking a range of research to consider the  question of integration in schools and how best to deploy our resources to  ensure that all the children in our schools can benefit from learning in an  intercultural Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_7169">My Department is providing support and training for teachers of English as an additional language in the current school year. A dedicated team within the  Primary Professional Development Service (PPDS) is in place for the provision  of support at primary level and the first of days of training is currently  ongoing. Design and provision of the second day will take place in early 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_7170">At post primary level, the Second Level Support Service (SLSS) have identified members of their team to provide training and support for teachers of English  as an additional language. The training has been designed and will be rolled  out in early 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_7183">Individual school authorities are responsible, in the first instance, for ensuring the safety and welfare of children and others in their care including  traffic management measures. In accordance with the Safety, Health and Welfare  at Work Act 1989, it is the responsibility of school management authorities to  have a safety statement in place in their schools. Schools are obliged to  identify possible hazards, assess the risks to health and safety and to put  appropriate safeguards in place.</p>
