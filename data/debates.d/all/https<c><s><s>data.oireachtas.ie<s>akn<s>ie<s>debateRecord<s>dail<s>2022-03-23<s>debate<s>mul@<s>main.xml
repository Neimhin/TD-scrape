            <p eId="para_3">Last October, the Holy Spirit junior school in Greenhills was told it would lose a teaching post and would have to go from having four junior infant classes to three. This was because a number of parents who had planned to start their children in junior infants in September decided to keep them back a year in light of the scale of the Covid pandemic at the time and the negative impact it had already had on their children's preschool education. For the past five months, the school has managed to shuffle around teaching hours and use the Covid learning and support scheme to keep the fourth junior infants class open and keep the teacher at the school. However, the school has now reached the end of the line. Unless the scheme is extended or some other support is offered, this teacher will be out of a job, the classroom will be closed and the children will be scattered across the remaining three classes. This will have a massively disruptive impact on those children and will push their class sizes above the pupil-teacher ratio for the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, band 1 status, which the school has been assigned.</p>
            <p eId="para_4"> The school, the parents and the children are pleading for supports now to keep the class open and to keep the teacher in post for the remaining weeks of the school year. They are also pleading for the fourth junior infants class to be supported come September. As matters stand, the three junior infants classes starting September 2022 are fully subscribed and the school has a waiting list of 24 other children looking for places. In addition, the school has already proactively been welcoming in Ukrainian children - refugees from the war - and are expecting more. It makes no sense whatsoever to have a classroom empty and 24 children unable to get school places simply because the school numbers dipped during a particular period in the pandemic. The assurances they seek is that come September they will have four junior infant classes again. If the Minister can give that assurance, surely she would also agree that it would be a folly to lay off a teacher now, close a class and put four classes into three, particularly in view of all the disruption this would cause now and in terms of trying to get the teacher back come September.</p>
            <p eId="para_5"> I have been contacted by many parents, whose children either go to the school or are seeking to do so, outlining the impact this situation has on them. I will reference what Jessica wrote. She indicated that she is one of the parents who made the extremely difficult decision to delay school entry for her child due to serious concerns about the impact of Covid and restrictions on the child and their education. She went on to explain that very difficult decision. She wrote that she was not the only parent to take this difficult decision and that as a result of reduced enrolments, the school lost a teaching post. She further wrote that she was unaware of the impact her decision would have but that to penalise the school by reducing teacher numbers was short-sighted on the part of the decision makers involved. She went on to say that failure to address what is happening will cause lasting damage to the education of this cohort of children.</p>
            <p eId="para_6"> I wrote to the Minister, Deputy Foley, about this matter last October. She replied that the school's enrolment did not reach the enrolment required to maintain the post for the remainder of the year. She indicated that the school submitted an appeal to the primary staffing appeals board, which made a decision on the basis of published appeals criteria. She further indicated that the board operates independently and that its decision is final, that is, “No.” However, the issue is that the grounds for appeal at that time were outdated and did not take into account the fact that we were in a pandemic. The dip in the number of children starting junior infants last September was much higher than normal as a result of the pandemic. It was a once-off and should be treated as such. Neither the school, the parents, the students nor the teacher should be punished as a consequence. They need a commitment that the teacher will be retained now and that the class will be retained come September.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Deputy Josepha Madigan)<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T09:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_7">I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline the position regarding staffing in primary schools. I am happy to take this matter on behalf of the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_8"> The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing schedule is an allocation mechanism that uses enrolment bands to determine the number of classroom teaching posts allocated to a school.</p>
            <p eId="para_9">This is a long-standing arrangement for allocating teaching posts to our primary schools in a fair and equitable way based on the respective enrolment. Previous budgets of 2016, 2018 and 2021 improved the staffing schedule by one point on each occasion to its historical lowest level ever of one classroom teacher, on average, to 25 pupils, with lower thresholds applying to Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, urban band 1 schools. In addition, there has been a three-point reduction in the retention schedule, which has helped schools that would otherwise be at risk of losing teaching posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_10"> The staffing arrangements include a provision whereby schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds using projected enrolment. I understand that this, as the Deputy outlined, is what occurred here. Holy Spirit Junior National School was allocated a temporary teaching post on this basis, as a school that indicated it was expecting an enrolment of 263 pupils in September 2021, which was a projected increase of 25 pupils. The Deputy conceded that there were some children who were going to enrol but did not. The Department received an enrolment return of 246 pupils from this school as at 30 September 2021, which is an increase of eight in the pupil enrolment of the previous year. The enrolment required to retain the post for the remainder of the year was 263 pupils. Therefore, the school was informed, as the Deputy correctly said, that the post was to be suppressed at the end of October last. Therefore, with an enrolment of 246 pupils, which is what it has at present, and 13 mainstream teachers, the school is operating on a mainstream pupil-teacher ratio of 18.9:1. This compares favourably with the general allocation ratio of 20:1 for junior DEIS schools. It is important to point that out.</p>
            <p eId="para_11"> The staffing process includes, as the Deputy said, an appeals mechanism for schools to submit a staffing appeal under certain published criteria. The school appealed the suppression of the post to the primary staffing appeals board, which refused the appeal on the basis that the grounds of the appeal did not warrant the allocation of an additional post under the published staffing arrangements. The primary staffing appeals board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final. I know the Deputy is aware of all that.</p>
            <p eId="para_12"> It is important to say that there has to be a fair, equitable, transparent and clear type of staffing schedule. When we are talking about schools, we cannot have one rule for one school and another rule for another school. That is the issue that has happened here. The school staffing for the current school year was finalised in October following the completion of the staffing appeals process. The school is not, as the Deputy knows, due to lose a teaching post next week. I have taken into account what the Deputy said, however, about using up the class scheme etc. All types of schools have to be treated equally, irrespective of location. My understanding of this school is that because there had been a projected number of children who were due to attend the school and then did not attend, we have, at the moment, sufficient teachers. This is 13 mainstream teachers, for a pupil-teacher ratio of 18.9:1, when then normal junior DEIS school would be 20:1. The Department is therefore satisfied that it has sufficient staffing under the circumstances.</p>

            <p eId="para_15">I appreciate that the Minister of State has the response from the Department and is reading it out, but it is just the same response that we got in October 2021 basically, which is just a sticking to the rigid bureaucratic rules of “these are the numbers, etc.” It is not taking into account the reason that they fell short was because of the pandemic. The school staff then took the decision to try to use some resources available to them to try to maintain the four junior infant classes that they started off with, which was honourable. What the Department continues, it seems, to say to them is that at this stage in the school year, it will force four classes into three and it will not allow them to have four classes next year. This is despite the fact that from September 2022 the numbers are clearly there in terms of the waiting list of 24 for junior infants. I have email after email from parents who are heartbroken because they are unable to get into the school starting in September because, precisely, the fourth teacher is not being provided. The principal wrote to the Minister, Deputy Foley, and I believe the Taoiseach as well, in relation to the rule that was decided, saying that while it is understood that rules must be fair and transparent, they were going through a very unpredictable and extraordinary time and so fairness needed to be reinterpreted. That is an absolutely reasonable position. They went on to explain that the school needed 254 pupils to retain the 14th teacher at the end of September 2021. We did not reach that number in September, but due in some part to the crisis in Ukraine, we now have 252 pupils. We appeal now for the extension of the schemes so we can keep the substitute teacher until the end of June.</p>
            <p eId="para_16"> This is very simple. We have lived through extraordinary times. All sorts of rules that have been in place have been bent and broken and so on. Simple asks are being appealed for here, that the teacher is retained for the rest of the year for the fourth class and that the resources are put in place so that the fourth class can be in place in September.</p>

            <p eId="para_17">First of all, the key word in relation to this particular school is “temporary”. The extra staff member that was given was only ever on the basis that it was a temporary measure. It was never meant to be permanent. It was very strictly and categorically told to the school that it would be in a position to retain this staff member only if it actually had the projected number of children, which it then transpired it did not. The Deputy made some points, not without merit, and some of them particularly around the pandemic and taking Ukrainian children, but the difficulty is that there are 4,000 schools also looking for teaching staff at various different particular times during the year. There has to be some sort of system that is fair and equitable for all of these schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_18"> The Department is satisfied with the fact that there are 246 pupils and 18 mainstream teachers at a pupil-teacher ratio of 18:1. This is satisfactory at present. As the Deputy mentioned earlier, in September should there be a change in circumstances and an increase in enrolment, then the situation can be reviewed again. That applies across the board for all teachers and, indeed, for special needs assistants, SNAs, under my particular remit, who can apply for exceptional reviews and schools can apply for exceptional reviews. We are, at present, in a very unpredictable situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> the education sector in its entirety when we are talking about the influx of Ukrainian children coming into the education sector. The schools and the staff have already been under significant stress in relation to Covid. I want to thank those schools that have come forward to help with Ukrainians. However, this is something that can be reviewed at a later stage. It is important to stress that at the moment it has a current staffing allocation that is satisfactory to the Department.</p>

            <from>Deputy Martin Browne<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T09:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_20">It will come as no great surprise that I rise to discuss the assessment of needs and disability services for children with special needs. I do this on behalf of many families across County Tipperary who are at their wits’ end in trying to get timely access for their children. The seriousness of this situation is conveyed on a daily basis in Tipperary, with parents getting in touch with me, with parents going on local radio and with parents discussing the situation that their children are faced with on social media.</p>
            <p eId="para_21"> Take, for example, the case of a family of a young girl who has fallen foul of the system by having an initial diagnosis of autism. I have been told she will not get a full diagnosis for at least 24 months. They cannot afford to go private like many others are forced to do. They thought getting the domiciliary care allowance might give them room to do this, but after applying they were told they are not entitled to it because there was no diagnostic report available. Outlining the dysfunctional nature of the system, the Department of Social Protection said in a letter of refusal that it is not that it does not consider the child to need additional care, it is that there is no objective information to indicate the extent of the care needed. However, this is the tip of the iceberg.</p>
            <p eId="para_22"> One such parent, Linda, was on Tipp FM this week. She has a six-year-old son who has been waiting for an assessment for 37 months. This is another family failed by the system that the Minister of State has a role in overseeing. He has been left with no SNA in school and will not qualify for one until he is assessed. What about four-year-old Ollie, who has been on a waiting list for speech and language and occupational therapy and has needed assessment for nearly two years now?</p>
            <p eId="para_23">He is a year away from starting school. Early intervention is key, but he is not getting it.</p>
            <p eId="para_24"> Under the Disability Act 2005, an assessment of need must be commenced within three months of receipt of an application and completed within a further three months. The recent High Court ruling essentially found that the HSE failed to comply with the provisions of the Act. The executive tried to subvert its obligations under the Act by replacing the assessment of needs process with a standing operating procedure, SOP. The SOP essentially amounted to a screening exercise. In cases which indicate that a child requires a comprehensive assessment, they are referred to an additional waiting list for further assessment. As the Ombudsman for Children stated, this effectively created a second waiting list.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> Not only did the HSE steer away from its obligations in this regard, my colleague, Deputy Cullinane, has since found out that the last time that it submitted a report on the needs of children with disabilities, as it is required to do under section 13 of the Act, was in 2014. These reports are essential to provide a picture of what resources are needed. When confronted with this, the HSE questioned the Act until the fact that it operated under an outdated database was highlighted. Again, this was discovered by my colleague.</p>
            <p eId="para_26"> Behind every reason these children are being failed by the State lies yet another reason. I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could answer some of the questions I am posing and not reel off a load of corporate speak, as the ombudsman put it, that does not reflect the needs of the children concerned. The Minister of State knows that I am from County Tipperary. In that context, can she tell me what measures are being put in place to ensure not just the recruitment of staff but also the retention of existing staff? What specifics has she got? In terms of recruitment, what process is under way in the community healthcare organisation, CHO, 3 and CHO 5 areas? How many staff are needed and how many are being taken on? Is it true that people are applying for speech and language therapist and occupational therapist positions but are being turned away? Can she tell me the causes of differing levels of access available across the CHOs? Is the outsourcing in some areas and not in others causing this? If she needs me to repeat my questions, I will be more than happy to do so. I wish to stress that there are parents who want answers and there are children whose future is being put at risk because of a crisis that the HSE has tried to hide.</p>
            <p eId="para_27"> Finally, can the Minister of State tell me why the HSE was allowed to get away with the SOP farce? Why was the database to inform the Department about the extent of needs allowed to get outdated and why were reports allowed to go unwritten?</p>

            <p eId="para_29">Yes, there are a lot of questions. I will read the blacks later on in order that I can obtain answers to them all. The questions that the Deputy has asked are no different from those asked by parents in Tipperary, Clonmel, Galway, Dublin, Limerick or wherever. These are the questions that every parent wants to get answers for.</p>
            <p eId="para_30"> I thank the Deputy for raising these important issues for discussion in the House. I am involved in ongoing discussions with the HSE on this matter in light of the urgency involved. I am going to focus on the SOP. I hope that is okay with the Deputy. It relates to one of his main questions.</p>
            <p eId="para_31"> I met the HSE last Tuesday, 15 March, following the ruling to discuss the High Court ruling with the HSE. Let me be quite clear with the Deputy and the House. I am opposed to the HSE appealing this ruling, and I made that clear at my meeting last week. It is clear that the SOP is not fulfilling the legal obligations of the HSE and that any such appeal would waste State funds. In fairness to the HSE, its intention not to appeal was stated yesterday at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. I have always been acutely aware that there were differing views on the SOP, which is why I was keen to see the results of the review of the standard operation procedure for assessment of need for children, which was launched by me in March 2021. The review group is chaired by Mr. Robbie Ryan and comprises five nominees from Fórsa and five from the HSE. It was the intention of the chairperson to issue interim reports after three months and six months and a final report after 12 months. Unfortunately, these reports have not come before me, but I actually see the review now as being redundant because the court has made its ruling.</p>
            <p eId="para_32"> What is clear is that the old assessment of needs process was not working. That is why we had a backlog of 6,500 children when I was appointed in June 2020. We now see that the SOP cannot be used so the HSE and, indeed, this House need to ensure that we have a system that supports children and their families. All Deputies will agree that the assessment of needs process must have at its core the development of any child with a disability to reach his or her full potential.</p>
            <p eId="para_33"> I am conscious that the Deputy does not want me to engage in any corporate speak so let me try get into dealing with some of his questions. One of the questions relates to retention and recruitment. Two weeks ago, on the floor of the House, I announced during the debate on a Sinn Féin Private Members' Bill that we are recruiting assistant psychologists within the network disability teams, which would be the first time ever that we have done this. It happens in primary care and mental health, but it was not happening in the area of disability. The second thing I announced on that particular evening was that we would have more senior grade positions. Why should we have more senior grade positions? It is in order that we can have better clinical oversight and encourage more people to come in at a staff level. So more people would be seen to but we would also have more senior experience. That is one of the things we are lacking within the area of disability. As more senior clinical posts are being advertised in the areas of primary care, the care of older persons and mental health, we are losing out.</p>
            <p eId="para_34"> There is another aspect - this was also raised at yesterday's meeting of the committee - regarding the panel system. I do not believe the panel system is fit for purpose or that it is working. In fact, the panel system is eroding the number of staff available in the area of disability.</p>
            <p eId="para_35"> The Deputy sought a breakdown in respect of every CHO. It is quite clear from listening to Mr. Bernard O'Regan yesterday that not one of the 91 teams has its full complement of staff. I acknowledge that, and I am currently working on recruitment. Let us be fair, it is not that we have not put funding into it. A serious amount of funding has gone into recruitment. In excess of 365 people have been recruited. I acknowledge that this is still not enough, but that does not mean to say that we will not continue working in order to ensure that we get a solution. I do believe that these teams will work.</p>

            <p eId="para_36">There is no doubt, both in here and outside, that we have been lambasted with statements that early intervention is required. I know from parents, teachers and so on that this is not happening. I am glad to hear that the Minister of State is not happy with the SOP. What is being done about the matter? The Ombudsman had a go at the HSE and the High Court has ruled against it. Why the database was allowed to be so outdated in the first place is another thing that needs to be answered by the Minister of State or the Department, because the dysfunction of the system spreads further than the HSE's smoke-and-mirrors act, which is what the High Court called it. Yesterday, Mr. Paul Reid said that 91 children's disability network teams are now in place across the country. He pointed out that substantial additional resources have been provided to these teams since 2019.</p>
            <p eId="para_37"> For one family who contacted me, Mr. Reid's optimistic comments do not wash. Their child had been referred to occupational therapy through an early intervention pathway in September 2020. Then the teams were reconfigured and he was told that he was being transferred to the children's disability network team. However, this seems to have cost him time because when informing the family of this change, the children's disability network team also said that they could not provide them with a timeframe as to when their child will be seen. In terms of early intervention, this case has taken two or three years, which is ridiculous and something needs to be done. I appreciate that the Minister of State has fierce concern about the matter and done a lot of work on it but an awful lot more work needs to be done. I hope what she said about the SOP can be changed so that families can get more early intervention because the situation breaks their hearts and breaks the heart of the Minister of State. I have no doubt that she and the other Deputies present have listened to the stories of families who are struggling to get that kind of intervention.</p>

            <p eId="para_38">First and foremost, I acknowledge that the 91 disability teams do not have all of the staff that they require to do the job. Second, I acknowledge that there are children who have been waiting far too long on waiting lists and not getting intervention. Third, in the context of the €350 million that was allocated, and in the context of access to care waiting lists, I am ensuring that we get a fair portion of that money in order that we can provide public private therapy intervention so that every child can get a result. I see children on waiting lists as equally as acute to the individual who needs a hip operation. That is where we have to change the mindset and culture within various departments.</p>

            <p eId="para_39">I would like to inquire if there will be an increase in the level of funding to local authorities to ensure that the current level of fire service is maintained. In addition, are there plans to bring a voluntary fire service into full-time service and retain a fire service scheme in the Carlow fire service?</p>
            <p eId="para_40">Virtually every town in Ireland has a local fire brigade made up of experienced first responders who are advanced first aid officers and are tied to the town, particularly when they are on call 24 hours a day or on call for the week, as they cover the fire and rescue call-outs.</p>
            <p eId="para_41"> In Carlow fire service, six volunteer firefighters have been doing this in a voluntary capacity for almost four years for life-threatening ambulance-related callouts only. That is important because these are ambulance-related callouts only, even during the Covid-19 crisis. As firefighters they carry defibrillators, advanced airway management and trauma bags, in which are carried all of this equipment. It makes perfect sense to avail of this training, experience, knowledge and equipment in attending life-threatening medical emergencies within minutes of being alerted on their pagers, until the overstretched National Ambulance Service Ireland, NASI, arrive at the scene. These crews must be brought into the fire service properly to ensure that they are paid properly to provide what are life-saving services. </p>
            <p eId="para_42"> There are approximately 1,800 retained firefighters throughout the 220 fire stations covering the Republic of Ireland. Central government, the HSE and local government need to work together on a plan to make better use of their existing resources. A great deal can be achieved if heads work together. Life is everything and nothing else matters. One cannot put a price on a life.</p>
            <p eId="para_43"> I have raised the pressure that the National Ambulance Service Ireland is under with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, and with An Taoiseach and have also raised this issue in the House several times. I compliment our ambulance paramedics in Carlow on the work they do. They are worked very hard and I will say again that they are in a building that is not fit-for-purpose. I understand that the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, is coming shortly to Carlow to visit this facility and we all know the pressures that the ambulance paramedics are under.</p>
            <p eId="para_44"> I welcome that in some counties the fire service personnel can be used to assist in the cardiac arrest service agreed by the National Ambulance Service. This makes sense as it uses the existing resources. This allows trained fire service personnel to respond where life is at stake and when available to free up the ambulance service to focus their skills and expertise toward other medical emergencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_45"> What are the Minister of State’s plans to address sustainability of the fire service in Carlow and to address the use of these volunteers? It is important when I am speaking about volunteers to acknowledge the great work they do which we have seen over the Covid-19 pandemic. We saw the work that the ambulance paramedics and fire services did. We have such great people in Ireland who work so hard and those are just two examples of the dedication and of the work they do outside their call of duty. Many of these officers do a great deal of work outside of their remit and it is important that we acknowledge that. The only way we can do that is to ensure that we know and understand the work that they have done and look after them. I feel that is missing and that we do not appreciate their work enough. It is very important when we have such good people on the ground working within their communities, saving lives and working together, to learn that when we all work together we will grow more and will work better. There is a duty of care on the Department of Health to ensure that these workers are looked after. I thank the Minister of State and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Deputy Malcolm Noonan)<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_46">I thank my constituency colleague for raising this issue which she has consistently done in this Chamber, as have a number of other Deputies. As she has said, there have been some counties where existing resources have been utilised.</p>
            <p eId="para_47"> The provision of a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of fire station premises, is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under the Fire Services Acts, 1981 and 2003. The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage supports the fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for equipment and priority infrastructural projects. The number of front-line fire service staff has been maintained at a consistent high level throughout the economic challenges of the past number of years, even at a time when staffing numbers were, of necessity, reduced in other areas of the local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_48"> The external validation group, EVG, report 2016 was the first of a new external validation process on fire risk management in Ireland arising from implementation of Keeping Communities Safe: A Framework for Fire Safety in Ireland. It reported conclusions on the four specific areas of inquiry - area risk categorisation; fire safety and fire service operations; major emergency management; and health and safety management. The report concludes with an overview of themes and issues before making some recommendations for future directions. The EVG report concluded that the available evidence provides for confidence regarding the match of fire service capability with the assessed fire risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_49"> A capacity review to capture lessons learned, review good practice and assess resilience of the fire services during the Covid-19 pandemic was completed in 2020. Response, Resilience and Recovery: A Review of the Impact of Covid-19 on Irish Fire Services reported many strengths and the outstanding commitment and effort of front-line teams, and made recommendations which are being implemented, which the Deputy acknowledged in her contribution.</p>
            <p eId="para_50"> On policy, a review of the retained fire services delivery model is currently being undertaken. The review of the model will reflect the current circumstances with the aim of ensuring its effectiveness into the future as part of the local authority. The objective is to explore issues and their impacts, diagnose the situation and propose options towards solutions which will underpin future local authority fire service provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_51"> Finally, the fire services capital programme forms part of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage's strategy to support the fire authorities in the development and maintenance of a quality fire-fighting and rescue service. The Department recently announced a new fire services capital programme for the period 2021-2025, with a funding allocation of €61 million. This new programme will see six new fire stations built, continued support for the construction of a further 12 new fire stations, nine fire station refurbishments as well as the allocation of 35 new fire appliances or engines. </p>
            <p eId="para_52"> Again, I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. As the Deputy has said, it is essential that we use all of the existing resources that are available to us, particularly in those life-threatening emergency situations. I hope that this response gives the Deputy some indication of our commitment towards that.</p>

            <p eId="para_53">I thank the Minister of State and I am aware of his commitment and that of the senior Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien. My first concern is that it is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under the Fire Services Acts. That should be addressed and all local authorities should look at this. I ask the Minister of State for a commitment on this. It is about resources and saving lives and it is something that can be done. If this can be done in some of the local authorities, it should be rolled out across all 31 of them. The Department has a role here through local authorities to ensure that they deliver and are accountable. I ask that the Minister might do this.</p>
            <p eId="para_54"> I welcome the review of the retained fire service and the delivery model. It is good and I know of the Minister of State's commitment here again. We all need to work together. I understand the importance of funding also but we must remember that we are dealing with lives here and with firefighters who have seen horrific crashes, fires and who have dealt with accidents which must be very traumatic. It is a training and calling. On the other side we have our ambulance paramedics who are excellent. We are so blessed with what we have. If we are not using all of our resources to the best of our ability, however, that needs to be looked at.</p>
            <p eId="para_55"> I cannot finish today without mentioning our own volunteers and community first responders, of whom the Minister of State will also be aware. It is important that I mention them because the communities of Carlow and Kilkenny are brilliant. We have our community first responders in Carlow, Tullow, Hacketstown, Bagenalstown who did great work during the Covid-19 pandemic. I again emphasise that these are voluntary groups which need to be recognised. We are so lucky. We must ensure that we appreciate and look after those people who are out there day-in and day-out saving lives and doing what they can for us as a country. I thank the Minister of State again.</p>

            <p eId="para_56">To respond to the point made by the Deputy about the onset of Covid-19, the pandemic has presented challenges to the fire services in respect of the delivery of services. Our Department has monitored regular reports from the fire services in respect of the impact of the pandemic on staffing levels and the business community. In order to maximise the available capital funding programme, our Department reassesses the status of projects in the programme on an annual basis and some flexibility is normally available to advance projects that are ready and offer the best value for money, taking into account the state of readiness of projects and work generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_57">The provision of fire services and its functions, including the establishment and maintenance of fire brigade, assessment of fire cover needs and provision of fire service premises, are statutory functions of the individual fire authorities under the Fire Services Act, as was stated. Our Department continues to support fire authorities through the setting of general policy, the provision of a central training programme and the issuing of guidance on operational and other matters. I agree that all resources should be deployed and the local authority should give further consideration to the matter. The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and I will commit to offer our support to whatever the local authority deems appropriate within its functional area.</p>
            <p eId="para_58"> I agree with the Deputy wholeheartedly on the community first responders. We will be looking at a massive increase in our population in coming months with the intake of Ukrainian refugees. If that transpires as it may do, we will need to deploy all resources available to the State to try to support communities at this very critical time.</p>

          <speech by="#DuncanSmith" eId="spk_18">
            <from>Deputy Duncan Smith<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T09:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_59">I want to raise the ongoing issues people are having trying to book an appointment with the National Car Testing Service, NCTS, and engaging with the National Driver Licence Service. In many aspects these things have become intertwined. In many cases it is essential for people to pass their test to take up employment. The crisis has become compounded. We have moved beyond Covid restrictions and we need to get these services back to where they should be.</p>
            <p eId="para_60"> Constituents of ours have contacted me outlining various scenarios impacting their lives due to the backlog in the system. For one person, his NCT is not due until 2 July, but when he tried to book his test, the earliest date he can get is 3 August, five months from now. We need to bear in mind that this man is attempting to book his test four months ahead of his NCT expiry date. Another constituent, whose NCT is due in coming weeks, cannot get a test until late August. He is a young learner driver who is paying extortionate insurance costs and is preparing to take his driving test in April. Those are two reasons this young man needs his NCT as soon as possible. In recent days people in my office checked and the earliest date they could get a test was in July, but in Naas and not anywhere in Fingal or other areas of Dublin. That is three months away in another county. The earliest time for any test in Dublin was August or September.</p>
            <p eId="para_61"> The messaging on the website is confusing. The four-month extension that was granted during the Covid pandemic is said to still exist but when people enter their registration number into the NCT website, it is not spitting back the four-month extension but is spitting back the date their NCT was originally due. The whole system is mired in confusion and delay, which is causing real stress to people who are trying to get on with their lives post Covid, trying to take up employment, trying to take their car test, trying to care for people and trying to do their shopping or collect kids from school. This is this is a serious problem. Some 8,500 people are on the waiting list, whereas it was 1,000 in 2019. The time for forbearance on this issue has gone.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Rural and Community Development (Deputy Joe O'Brien)<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T09:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_62">I am replying on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, who would like to thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_63"> The operation of all roadworthiness testing in the State, including the National Car Testing Service, is the statutory responsibility of the Road Safety Authority, RSA. It is important to highlight that quarter 1 is always the busiest time of the year for the NCT service. This is because the date of the first registration of a vehicle determines the subsequent roadworthiness test due dates. Long-term trends demonstrate a strong preference among vehicle purchasers to buy at the beginning of the year, with January and February the busiest months for registrations and high demand for NCT appointments accordingly.</p>
            <p eId="para_64"> Coinciding with this typically busy period is the need to manage the continuing impact of Covid-19 on staff availability at NCT test centres. In January this year, the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, was advised of a higher rate of test cancellations than usual. In January and February 2022, there were approximately 36,000 test appointment cancellations, of which 11,400 were cancelled by the NCTS. This is broadly in line with 2021 figures, which saw approximately 28,000 cancellations, with 7,800 of these cancelled by the NCTS. These figures include very high levels of customer no-shows and late cancellations, undoubtedly as a result of Covid-19. This has led to an average lead time for an appointment of just under 21 days in this quarter to date. Before the pandemic, the average waiting time was up to 12 days.</p>
            <p eId="para_65"> However, the NCTS is working hard to ensure that all customers can book their vehicle in for testing in a timely fashion and significant progress has been made in addressing this backlog. Currently, all 49 NCT test centres in Ireland are fully operational and the NCTS has taken a number of steps to provide additional capacity at test centres in the immediate term, including offering overtime to staff and running a longer shift schedule than normal. This is in addition to ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of service delivery and recruit additional staff, including securing agreement from the RSA to develop a proposal for an alternative resourcing model to provide semi-skilled staff capacity to complete machine-led elements of the inspection process. This will be considered further in the coming months with a view to establishing a pilot scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_66"> NCT test appointment slots are released continually across all centres and many slots also become available through cancellations or rescheduling of appointments. Some customers may only find dates that are beyond the due date for their NCT, as the Deputy mentioned. If a customer requires an appointment sooner than those available online, they should contact the NCTS directly or place themselves on the priority waiting list online. The NCTS will do its best to accommodate all customers on the priority list within 28 days of application. Currently approximately 18,000 people are on the priority waiting list, with 32,500 full tests carried out each week.</p>
            <p eId="para_67"> The NCTS has also advised that customers can book a test appointment up to 90 days in advance of their test due date without affecting the validity period of the certificate issued, which allows them to ensure a suitable test date at their preferred centre and avoid incurring the risk of delays during busy times.</p>

            <from>Deputy Duncan Smith<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T09:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_68">I ask that the NCTS website be updated with clear messaging about the extension in order to remove stress and panic for people when they are booking. It is encouraging that new staff will be hired. At least there is a sense that the NCTS is looking to fix the problem. Unfortunately, I believe the NDLS used the pandemic to copperfasten changes that are disadvantageous to the public such as insisting on non-cash payments and making it more difficult for people to get driving licences. That issue needs to be revisited. We should look at the post office network for driving licence provision. We have a network of more than 800 post offices throughout the country as opposed to a couple of dozen NDLS offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_69"> In the debate on the previous Topical Issue, it was mentioned that we are about to have a big population increase with people coming from Ukraine. Many of those people will be coming in their own cars. This will be an issue for driving licences. We do not have an agreement with Ukraine on the transfer of driving licences, something which needs to be fast-tracked. We will also need to have some kind of process for the NCT.</p>
            <p eId="para_70"> There is a lot to do, but this is having a real impact on people. It is an additional stress for people on top of major crises happening in our country, in our region and throughout the world. It is these pebble-in-the-shoe issues that the Government can solve and should solve. I ask the Minister of State to bring the issue to the RSA to try to get it resolved.</p>

            <p eId="para_71">On behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, I again thank the Deputy for raising the matter. The backlog for the NCTS has undoubtedly been frustrating as the Covid-19 restrictions have eased and many people are now returning to their offices and workplaces. The Department of Transport is very aware of the challenges faced by the NCTS and the RSA as they work to manage the extremely high demand for test appointments for the National Car Testing Service. There are clear signs of progress since this issue was first notified to the Department of Transport at the beginning of the year. The proactive work to increase capacity at test centres and to manage priority waiting lists will help.</p>
            <p eId="para_72"> Demand is expected to ease as we enter quarter 2. However, it can be expected that it will take a few months for the waiting list to reduce to its normal level of less than 1,000 as more people look to get back on the road. I have noted the Deputy's point about the website and the potential challenges posed by the large number of Ukrainian citizens arriving in the State.</p>

        <heading>Ban on Sex for Rent Bill 2022: Second Stage [Private Members]<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T10:00:00+00:00"/></heading>
        <speech by="#CianOCallaghan" eId="spk_22">
          <from>Deputy Cian O'Callaghan<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T10:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_73">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_74"> I am sharing time. As the rental crisis deepens, we see growing reports of a cohort of landlords attempting to exploit the vulnerable position some tenants and renters are in by demanding sex in lieu of rent or for a reduced rent. Recently there have also been disturbing reports of individuals attempting to exploit women fleeing the war in Ukraine and looking for somewhere safe to stay with offers of sex in lieu of rent. One landlord offered accommodation in Clare without rent to a slim Ukrainian woman with an expectation of sex and demanded a photo from prospective renters before revealing the location of the property. This is despicable behaviour from predatory landlords attempting to exploit people traumatised by fleeing war. It is in sharp contrast to the thousands of Irish families opening their homes in a spirit of generosity, welcome, support and solidarity to people from Ukraine, which is the overwhelming feeling of Irish people. </p>
          <p eId="para_75"> What has been happening shows the depraved depths of the housing crisis, where a small minority of grossly exploitative landlords expect sexual favours in return for putting a roof over people's heads. It is an abhorrent practice. No one should be subjected to such demands when they are looking for somewhere safe to live and shelter. We are seeing the sharp end of the commodification of housing that has taken place. Housing and shelter have been turned into commodities to be traded and people with resources can profit and exploit the need of others for shelter. </p>
          <p eId="para_76"> This Bill would introduce a specific criminal offence for anyone who demands sex in lieu of rent or for reduced rent. It would also create a specific criminal offence to advertise sex in lieu of rent, both for an individual placing an ad and for a platform, publication or anyone facilitating such an ad or arrangement. The proposed penalties are imprisonment of up to seven years, a fine or both. For anyone involved in the placing of such an ad, a fine of up to €50,000 is proposed. </p>
          <p eId="para_77"> Is this Bill needed? The Minister for Justice has confirmed to the Dáil that there is no specific criminal offence for this. Gardaí have confirmed to the Oireachtas housing committee that the PULSE system does not record sex for rent complaints as a specific category, which is not surprising given it is not a specific criminal offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_78"> It is important to address the fact the Bill has been critiqued by some. They have pointed out this will not end the exploitative practice of sex for rent. That critique is fair but the Bill will act as a deterrent and send a strong signal that exploiting renters in this way is not acceptable. If there is any ambiguity about that, legally or otherwise, this Bill will remove it. We are not saying it is a panacea. It is not an alternative to investing in social housing, cost rental and affordable purchase homes. It is not an alternative to the high rent, market-driven housing favoured in some quarters. It is a small step in trying to address this exploitative practice. While the Bill is needed, the best way to support renters is to improve rights and security of tenure, tackle affordability and invest in cost-rental houses, of which we need thousands each year rather than hundreds. We need to stop the favourable tax treatment that encourages investment funds to dominate housing supply.</p>
          <p eId="para_79"> We do not know the full extent of the problem in Ireland. Comprehensive research has not been undertaken on it. There is some evidence that migrants, in particular, who may have less access to support networks for information and advice, have been targeted. Some ads have been placed on platforms that are mostly used by migrants. Research undertaken by Shelter, the UK housing charity, suggests that 59,000 women in the UK were propositioned for sex in lieu of rent in the year and a half from March 2020 to September 2021. That is a shocking figure. There is no equivalent research in Ireland but it indicates that this could go beyond isolated cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_80"> On the devastating impact on people seeking the most basic human need of shelter, excellent work has been done by Ann Murphy in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> in documenting, reporting and shedding light on this serious problem. She reported on a woman in Waterford city who responded to an ad for a room last October. She moved out of her rented accommodation when her landlord told her she could live there without paying rent in exchange for sex. The landlord turned up at her workplace the following day. Renters should not be subject to such terrible exploitative behaviour that makes them feel unsafe in the place they live. Women, in particular, should not be subject to attempts at gross exploitation when there looking for somewhere safe. An Italian woman who has been propositioned by three different landlords since the start of the year told the <i>Irish Examiner</i> that trying to find a room in Dublin "is like falling [into] a dangerous hell". We would be horrified if any of our young people travelling around the world, trying to settle and make a life for themselves, were being treated in this way. We would want everything done to stop it.</p>
          <p eId="para_81"> I welcome the Government's confirmation that it is supporting the Bill on Second Stage. As a smaller Opposition party, this is as far as we can bring the Bill in our Private Members' time without support from the Government to enable progression through Committee Stage and further. I understand from media reports that the Government agrees with the aims of the Bill but takes the view that more work is needed on it, especially in the way that it interacts with other sexual offences laws. I ask the Minister of State to address the timeline for dealing with the Bill. What approach do the Minister of State and the Government intend to take on this? Will the Minister of State give a clear indication on that approach? Is he seeking to progress this Bill? Does the Government intend to table its own legislation? We are happy to work with the Government and other Opposition parties who support the Bill. </p>
          <p eId="para_82"> The Bill alone is not enough. We need a clear indication from Government as to what it will do to tackle the power imbalance between tenants and landlords. The Bill will not be enough to tackle the abuses of power that take place. If we do not tackle those abuses and create a situation where tenants have some security of tenure in their home, they will never feel they are in a strong enough position to assert and stand up for their rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_83"> The growth of this practice is happening in the context of rents spiralling out of control. In our capital city, rents are higher than in any other European Union capital. At the same time that people are paying exorbitant rents, rights for renters are particularly weak. We need wider reform from the Government to improve security of tenure and rights for renters and to address the huge power imbalance. Sex for rent is the sharp edge of that imbalance and it is correct that we try to address it through legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">If we do not address that power imbalance overall, we will not be able to tackle this in the way we should. If we are serious about tackling this, we must be serious about ensuring that rights for renters are brought in line with those in other European countries. Fundamental to that is recognising that where somebody is renting it is the person's home. Our system of renters' rights at present does not recognise that. The current unofficial policy of the Government has been to allow rents to increase and to stand over a situation where renters do not have proper rights. It is important that is addressed, as well as supporting this Bill.</p>

        <speech by="#JenniferWhitmore" eId="spk_23">
          <from>Deputy Jennifer Whitmore<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T10:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_85">I thank Deputy Cian O'Callaghan for the work he has put into this issue, which has largely not been dealt with by the Government. It has been off the political agenda in this country even though there are some reports of it being dealt with in the UK. It has probably been off the agenda here because unless one has been in the footsteps of someone who faces the rental crisis that this country faces, it can be difficult to fully appreciate or understand the impact it has on an individual. There are many landlords in the Chamber but I am not sure how many of us currently rent.</p>
          <p eId="para_86"> I rented for probably 20 years of my life. I rented as a student, as a single person and as a mother. I have rented all over Ireland and I have rented overseas. I had some really good and some really bad landlords. The one consistent thing throughout that rental experience was the level of vulnerability one has as a renter. It sits on one's shoulder whereby one knows that at any point in any day one could get an email or letter saying that the landlord wants one to vacate the premises that is one's home. It is constantly with the renter and makes him or her very vulnerable. It is a constant stress. Thankfully, I have never had to rent in a housing crisis or in a situation where a country is about to take in potentially 100,000 or 200,000 people who are desperately in need of accommodation. In addition, I have never had to rent in a situation where I did not have family supports around me, where I did not understand the language of the country in which I was renting or where I was fighting for the survival of my children.</p>
          <p eId="para_87"> What we have seen due to the housing crisis, and will continue to see, is that the power dynamic between a landlord and a tenant is cavernous. It is incredible. That makes people very vulnerable. It is the Government's responsibility to step in and offer those people the protections they need from the predatory, disgusting behaviour that very few, but some, landlords wield over tenants, particularly women seeking to house themselves and their children. I welcome the fact that the Government will not oppose the Bill but, as my colleague said, it has to go further. It must bring it through the Dáil and the Seanad and implement the legislation. We cannot be in a situation five or ten years hence where scandals will emerge even though we knew what was going to happen and we did not take a stand or the Government did not put the supports and protections that are obviously needed in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_88"> The Bill does not just make it illegal for somebody to offer or request sex for rent, it also makes it illegal for a platform to house or hold that offer. There has to be a lot of questioning of the media institutions that allow that to happen. It is important they are held to account. Why they would ever allow anybody to use their platforms for that type of reprehensible, disgusting offer is beyond me. That is an important part of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_89"> The Bill is incredibly timely because there will be thousands of refugees coming to this country, mainly women and children. As Deputy Cian O'Callaghan said, there was a story in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> this week in which we already see that type of behaviour being forced on very vulnerable people, so it is important this legislation is put in place. We acknowledge this Bill is not a panacea. We are not claiming that it will resolve the situation because ultimately the greatest protection to vulnerable women and people in our society is access to housing. People will remain vulnerable until there is a roof over their heads and if they feel they have no other option but to put up with the offers that are being made, in some instances they will take those offers on board. The Bill is an important step and an important protection. We ask that the Government put it in place and ensure it is passed quickly so we can send a very clear signal to those who think this could be an option for them that we will not accept or tolerate it and that we will do everything in our power to stop it and make sure it does not happen.</p>

          <p eId="para_90">I thank Deputy Cian O'Callaghan for bringing this Bill forward. It is difficult to know what to say on this issue. It is difficult to sum up how abhorrent it is for anyone to prey on vulnerable women and to leverage shelter for sex. This issue has come to the forefront in recent weeks, primarily due to the tireless reporting by Ann Murphy in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, as well as the arrival of more than 10,000 Ukrainians who are in desperate need of accommodation in an environment where there is already a chronic housing shortage. The outpouring of goodwill from the public has been genuinely heartwarming to witness, to see thousands of people offer their home to those who have had to abandon their own home in fear of their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_91"> However, in every crisis there will be individuals who will take advantage. The <i>Irish Examiner</i> reported on a property in Clare which was on offer for free to a "slim Ukrainian woman" with the expectation of sex. The landlord in question requested that women send him a photograph and he would then let them know if they were deemed suitable. It is hard to comprehend how anyone could watch Ukrainian hospitals bombed, Mariupol being starved and bombarded and millions flee across neighbouring borders and only see an opportunity to sexually exploit vulnerable women in that context. However, it is happening both in Ireland and across Europe. It has always happened. Abusers home in on vulnerability. This type of exploitation has always been about an abuse of power as much as of the person. The people arriving in Ireland from Ukraine are in an incredibly vulnerable position. They have left everything behind them and have landed in Ireland with no support base and, in many cases, without English or very little English. They have also been absolutely traumatised.</p>
          <p eId="para_92"> The Government has announced that it will conduct Garda vetting for people offering rooms to children and vulnerable adults, but we all can agree that every person needs to be protected from this type of abuse. Not everyone is going through official accommodation channels or the Irish Red Cross. Many Ukrainian refugees are taking up housing offers through Facebook groups which have been set up to help them. Vetting will only apply to people using official channels and, of course, will only determine whether the people offering the accommodation have a criminal record. We are all too aware of the shortcomings in that regard, given the appalling conviction rates for sexual assault and rape in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_93"> Foreign nationals are often the most targeted group by sex-for-rent offers because they are seen as the most vulnerable. Chantal arrived in Ireland last October to start a new career and shared her experiences with the <i>Irish Examiner</i> and "The Pat Kenny Show". Three people asked her for sex in lieu of rent. She said she was really upset, disgusted and afraid. She is here alone, without family, and was facing this. She felt hopeless about it. This Bill will criminalise sex for rent, but the Government has to be much more proactive, as Deputy Cian O'Callaghan outlined. It must work with housing and social media sites to ensure they are identifying these posts and filtering them out, as well as banning the people responsible for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_94"> Renters in Ireland are vulnerable, and we have known that for years. With a shortage of supply and unaffordable rents, people are desperate.</p>
          <p eId="para_95"> Trying to find accommodation to rent is a minefield for a woman. Housing advertisements on <i>daft.ie</i> and Facebook groups are constantly appearing with the offer of reduced rent for women with the expectation that sex or sharing a bed with the landlord would be required. It is just absolutely unbelievable that this would be the case. I have heard from a young woman who when trying to arrange viewings was sent the address of a nearby pub because the landlord insisted on having a drink and getting to know this woman first. On another occasion the same woman attended a viewing and was told directly by the tenant subletting the apartment that it would be offered at a reduced rate for sex. When she googled his email address later on, she found he ran a website for upskirt pictures of women taken without their consent.</p>
          <p eId="para_96"> The sexual exploitation of women for housing is not a new phenomenon. Whenever there is a scarcity of resources and a desperate need to get accommodation, abusers will always take advantage. I welcome that the Government is not opposing this legislation and I know there is goodwill right across the Dáil on this. However, there is an urgency to this and I ask the Minister of State to respond to Deputy Cian O'Callaghan on the timeline for what is intended in this Bill. This could be put through the Houses quite quickly because there is goodwill.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Deputy James Browne)<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T10:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_97">On behalf of the Minister for Justice, I thank Deputy Cian O'Callaghan for bringing forward this timely Bill with very important proposals. Members are all too aware of reports in the media of offers being made to provide accommodation in exchange for sex; there are reportedly even worrying offers being targeted specifically towards vulnerable Ukrainian women. I am also aware of reports of existing tenants in vulnerable circumstances being approached in a similar way.</p>
          <p eId="para_98"> I am acutely aware of the level of distress such an advance would cause to a tenant, particularly somebody in a vulnerable position, perhaps where the tenant is no longer in a position to be able to pay rent. It is also upsetting for people generally and all of us reading such advertisements placed by people attempting to exploit others for their own self-gratification. Let me be quite clear that any behaviour from accommodation providers seeking to use their position to prey on vulnerable people is totally unacceptable. It is an appalling abuse of power by unscrupulous individuals and it will not be tolerated by this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_99"> It is important to note the laws surrounding sexual offences have been significantly strengthened in recent years, notably with the introduction of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017. Sexual offences legislation now makes it abundantly clear that consent must be freely and voluntarily given. In other words, submission when a person is forced or has no other choice is not the same as consent. Sex without consent is rape and punishable by up to a life term in prison.</p>
          <p eId="para_100"> There have been other important legislative advancements in the area in recent years, including the Domestic Violence Act 2018 and Coco's law, otherwise known as the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020, which introduced the offence of sharing intimate images without consent. That was legislation championed by Deputy Howlin and it is evidence of the Government's willingness to work with the Opposition to introduce important legislation to protect vulnerable users.</p>
          <p eId="para_101"> My Department is also working on a number of new legislative measures to strengthen further our laws in the area of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. Before Easter the Minister, Deputy McEntee, aims to publish a Bill that will include new specific criminal offences for stalking and non-fatal strangulation. The general scheme of the Government's hate crime Bill, published in April 2021, will create a new and specific hate-aggravated offences for crimes motivated by prejudice against protected characteristics, including that of gender. The Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill 2021 currently before the Houses will, among other provisions, strengthen the monitoring and notification provisions applicable to convicted sex offenders.</p>
          <p eId="para_102"> I will now turn to the Bill itself. The aim of the Bill is to create a criminal offence for acquiring or accepting sex as a condition of access to or retention of accommodation. The Bill also aims to make it an offence to arrange or facilitate such behaviour. The Government supports the objectives of the Bill in principle and will not be opposing it today.</p>
          <p eId="para_103"> My Department has considered the provisions of the Bill and sought advice from the Attorney General on its proposals. I am advised there is no difficulty with the intent of the Bill but there are, however, some concerns with the detail that would need to be addressed to ensure it is legally sound and can achieve its objectives. I will outline some of the concerns around the Bill so we can perhaps work towards addressing them.</p>
          <p eId="para_104"> In its current form the Bill is very general and for a criminal statute not sufficiently precise in terms of the definition of the terms used in it and the parameters of the offence. Offence provisions that are impermissibly vague risk being found incompatible with the Constitution and in order for the provisions in this Bill to be constitutionally sound, it would be necessary to define more clearly the precise nature of the conduct that is to be criminalised. For example, more clarity is required on what is meant by requiring sex as a condition of access to accommodation and who falls within the term of "provider" of accommodation. The terms "accommodation" and "sex" should also be defined.</p>
          <p eId="para_105"> Section 3 creates the offence of facilitating an offence under section 2 and it is particularly vague. The mental element of the offence is different for a person and a publisher but a publisher is not defined. An offence by a publisher is committed by failing to take on specified remedial action in an unspecified reasonable time after being informed that its actions have arranged or facilitated an offence under section 2. It is necessary, at a minimum, to specify remedial action and a required timeframe for action to ensure this offence can be clear and enforceable.</p>
          <p eId="para_106"> Our further concern with the proposed offences in section 3 arises with respect to existing offences. The penalty under section 2 of the Bill is imprisonment for a period of up to seven years, and this means an offence under section 2 is an arrestable offence. It is already an offence under section 7 of the Criminal Law Act 1997 to aid, abet, counsel or procure the commission of an arrestable offence, so it appears there is an overlap between an existing offence under the 1997 Act and a new offence under section 3 of this Bill. The penalty for aiding and abetting under the 1997 Act is punishable by the same penalty as the primary offence, which in this case is up to seven years of imprisonment. The Bill provides a penalty of a fine of up to €50,000 for arranging or facilitating a section 2 offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_107"> If the aim of this section is to create an offence of publishing an advert requiring sexual acts as payment or part-payment for accommodation, it would be preferable to provide expressly for that rather than having the wider construction of the offence proposed in the Bill. The Bill creates a new offence in a stand-alone capacity and does not consider how the proposed new offences would interact with existing sexual offences legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_108"> Deputies will be aware there is a comprehensive body of laws in the area of sexual and domestic violence, further strengthened in recent years, notably with the sexual offences Act of 2017 and the domestic violence Act of 2018. Consideration should be given to any implications to the proposed offences where they occur in the context of intimate relationships, particularly where parties are cohabiting and the relationship breaks down, and it is not clear what the intended scope of the offence is in the Bill in the context of personal relationships. This is particularly the case where parties are not married but living together and there is friction, as the current formulation could result in complaints of criminal behaviour being made under section 2(1).</p>
          <p eId="para_109"> Section 7A of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993, as inserted by section 25(b) of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, makes it an offence to pay, give, offer or promise to pay "money or any other form of remuneration or consideration for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity with a prostitute". This offence does not cover the circumstance where a tenant is offered accommodation in return for sex as there is no suggestion that it would occur for the purposes of prostitution, so any potential overlap between the two offences should be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_110"> The proportionality of the penalty for the offence under section 2 would itself benefit from further consideration. By way of contrast, a first offence of paying or offering to pay for sexual services for the purpose of prostitution under the 1993 Act has a maximum penalty of €500.</p>
          <p eId="para_111"> I offer the above not by way of criticism but rather to outline some challenges that we can explore and seek to resolve. My colleague, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and I fully agree that the behaviour that Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's Bill aims to target is unacceptable and exploitative. It should be a criminal offence. On that basis the Government will not oppose the Bill on Second Stage and it fully supports its principle. As I have outlined, the Bill requires further precision and careful consideration in how it interacts with other legislation in the area of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. The Minister, Deputy McEntee, is happy to engage with the Deputy to assess the best way to advance the principles of the Bill.</p>

        <speech by="#GaryGannon" eId="spk_26">
          <from>Deputy Gary Gannon<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T10:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_112">Undoubtedly, nobody in the Chamber condones the behaviour of a landlord exploiting somebody who is seeking accommodation for personal sexual benefit. Condemnation is not the same as action, however, and I thank my colleague Deputy Cian O'Callaghan for being the one to take action against this predatory behaviour, as well as journalist Ms Ann Murphy of the <i>Irish Examiner</i> for her critical work in highlighting the matter and bringing attention to it. I also acknowledge the Cabinet for accepting the Bill and I ask it to continue to support this work by fast-tracking the Bill's passage.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">I hope that there will continue to be cross-party support for ending the abhorrent and exploitative practice of sex for rent. The Minister of State has outlined some of the issues in respect of the Bill comprehensively. One of the omissions from his statement was the timeline. We accept there is urgency, so let us get urgent about it. I hope the Minister of State will in his next response outline the timeline by which we can develop legislation he feels is appropriate. </p>
          <p eId="para_114"> Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's Bill is clear in its objective that no one should be expected or required to occupy his or her landlord's bed for a roof over his or her head. Landlords who engage in such predatory behaviour will face a fine or imprisonment of up to seven years or both. The Bill also provides that those who publish, arrange or facilitate sex as a condition of accommodation will face a fine of €50,000. When introducing the Bill, Deputy Cian O'Callaghan spoke about how in times of crisis there are always those, however few, who will seek to exploit and take advantage of others who are at their most vulnerable and desperate.</p>
          <p eId="para_115"> While we should be disgusted at those who seek to exploit others at their most vulnerable and desperate, we need to be equally disgusted by a society that causes such desperation, poverty and scarcity when it comes to something as basic as housing. I strongly welcome the Cabinet's acceptance of this legislation and the action it will take against predators exploiting the scarcity of housing and shelter for our most vulnerable. Will the Cabinet also accept the conditions which create those vulnerable people who fall prey to predators? The housing and rental crisis in Ireland is deepening. Overlapping with it is the cost-of-living crisis. The number of homes available to rent nationwide reached an all-time low according to the fourth quarter rental report from Daft. Just 1,397 were available to rent on 1 February nationwide, pushing rents up even higher and overlapping with inflation, which is at its highest rate since 2018.</p>
          <p eId="para_116"> Consistently, the groups most at the margins of our society are most vulnerable to exploitation in housing. In 2021, research published by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Economic and Social Research Institute found that less than 25% of one-parent families reported home ownership compared with 70% of the total population. Over half of all homeless families were one-parent families and their children. Some 48% of migrants live in the private rental sector but just 9% of those born in Ireland live in the private rental sector. It is these groups who are most likely to experience financial hardship, deprivation and poverty in our society. They face the most profound barriers to accessing secure housing and are most likely to face such cruel and exploitative practices as the ones Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's Bill aims to confront.</p>
          <p eId="para_117"> Globally, another crisis is taking place. The war in Ukraine with Russia has global ramifications. The United Nations reports that 10 million people have been uprooted from their homes with 3.5 million of them forced to leave their country and 6.5 million internally displaced within Ukraine. In Ireland, 20,000 people have pledged their homes to Ukrainians fleeing the war. While the vast majority have done so in solidarity and altruism, again there have already been reports of some using this crisis of women fleeing the war and seeking refuge in our country for their own sexual gain. Ann Murphy in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> last week reported that a property in Clare was being offered to a Ukrainian woman for free with an expectation of sex. The landlord demanded a photo be provided from the prospective tenant before providing the exact location of the property. Nasc, the Migrant and Refugee Rights Centre, has urged Ukrainians arriving into Ireland not to consider sex-for-rent accommodation arrangements and to avoid any accommodation that is unethical or immoral. </p>
          <p eId="para_118"> There is a dearth of information when it comes to this practice, which is extremely worrying as the extent of the problem is hard to quantify. The Garda PULSE system does not record sex-for-rent complaints as a specific category. However, recent research done by UK housing and homeless charity, Shelter, found that 30,000 women in the UK were propositioned for sex-for-rent arrangements between March 2020 and January 2021. Sex for rent specifically targets women from migrant backgrounds precisely because of their additional vulnerability due to reduced levels of knowledge and lack of social and support networks. Last February the <i>Irish Examiner</i> spoke to six women who were offered accommodation by a landlord at either a reduced rate or for free with an expectation of sex. Five of the six were foreign women who had travelled to Ireland for work or study. </p>
          <p eId="para_119"> We need to be cognisant of the power imbalance at play between landlords and those looking for secure and safe housing. We need to question ourselves as legislators. Why is it taking us so long to act? Why have we allowed landlords to abuse their status for such exploitative purposes for so long without facing specific criminal penalties? The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage issued a statement last week vehemently condemning any attempts to target vulnerable persons with an offer of accommodation in return for sexual acts, including those fleeing the devastation of war in Ukraine, and calling the practice exactly what it is, abhorrent. However, the statement also mentioned the introduction of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, which has provided for a better representation of consent and explicitly states that it must be freely and voluntarily given.</p>
          <p eId="para_120"> Although we have these criminal laws that deal with sexual offences of rape and consent, we still need something like the Bill Deputy Cian O'Callaghan proposes. The legislation now makes it abundantly clear that consent must be freely and voluntarily given. In other words, submission where someone feels forced or has no other choice is not the same as consent. Sex-for-rent arrangements are by their very nature non-consensual because of the exploitation and power imbalance within them. In addition, the act of a landlord seeking a sex-for-rent arrangement, advertising or propositioning a person for sex for rent, needs to be criminalised. There should be criminal sanctions for those who facilitate or attempt to arrange this cruel practice. Currently there is no legislation in place to deal with the practice of landlords offering sex-for-rent arrangements. This is exactly what Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's Bill seeks to address, targeting the small number of landlords who carry out this grossly exploitative practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_121"> There are legitimate concerns and criticisms that the Bill will not fully address the problem, which we all believe are fair. This form of exploitation and coercion, of men using their power differentials to exploit vulnerable people, must be seen on the spectrum of men's violence against women which we have often and rightly discussed in this Chamber over the last months. This despicable form of that particular plague is even more insidious as it taps into the structural violence that comes from our housing crisis and crisis of poverty. While not even close to a panacea, the Bill is an acceptance from the State that predatory men are using the failures of the State, homeless and poverty, to prey on vulnerable women living in our country today.</p>
          <p eId="para_122"> The Bill seeks to address a very real practice within the rental sector. It is also an example of something that is endemic within our rental sector, namely, the exploitation of people in desperate situations. There is a housing crisis in our country. The lack of supply and consequential high rents coupled with poor security of tenure mean people end up being taken advantage of and exploited by manipulative individuals. Those conditions have been created and perpetuated by successive Governments.</p>
          <p eId="para_123"> There is a responsibility to act, and quickly. We are proud that the Cabinet has agreed to support the work of Deputy Cian O'Callaghan by supporting the Bill. We request a timeline for its implementation. If the Government agrees that the requirement of sex as a condition of accommodation is truly abhorrent, it should only seek to fast-track the Bill in order that the practice of sex for rent comes to an end and the minority of landlords who use this exploitative tactic face the full legal consequences.</p>

        <speech by="#EoinOBroin" eId="spk_27">
          <from>Deputy Eoin Ó Broin<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_124">I congratulate and commend Deputy Cian O’Callaghan on bringing this very important legislation before the House. Our party will enthusiastically support it. What is particularly important about the Bill is not just that it makes the seeking of sex-for-rent arrangements a criminal offence but also that it seeks to impose criminal sanctions on those who would allow the advertising of such activities. That is a really important part of the Bill. It is something that Government has often been unwilling to do, as we saw for example with the weak regulation of short-term lets and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_125"> I also commend the sterling investigative journalism of Ann Murphy from the<i> Irish Examiner</i>. She has been doggedly reporting this story since December of last year. Given how difficult it has been to find many of these adverts, because they are not necessarily on platforms most of us readily use, her work and that of her publication must be commended not only on revealing this but ensuring that the story is placed at the centre of the political agenda. Thanks to the Social Democrats, we are now dealing with legislation on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_126"> When the story broke in December I along with many other Deputies wrote to both Ministers, Deputies McEntee and Darragh O’Brien, urging them first to clarify whether there was anything in existing law that could be used to prevent this kind of activity from continuing and if not, to bring forward legislation as a matter of urgency. To the credit of the Minister, Deputy McEntee, she replied saying she had raised the matter with the Attorney General and would consider it on foot of his recommendations. I have to say I was a little bit more disappointed with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O’Brien. There is a clearly an argument, in addition to the sanctions provided for in this legislation, to make changes to the Residential Tenancies Act so that, for example, the Residential Tenancies Board could conduct its own investigations where such matters are brought to its attention. I have not heard anything from the Minister, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, to say he is looking at that. Not only do I believe there should be criminal sanctions and fines; I also believe anybody who engages in this kind of practice should not be allowed to be a landlord, full stop. The Residential Tenancies Board and its sanctions regime would be a very strong complement to what is in the current legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_127"> When the news first broke, what came to my mind initially was a feeling of what if this was my sister, mother or daughter. When these kinds of stories arise, that is the question we should all ask ourselves because when we ask that question, we realise the kind of urgent response that is required from all of us as legislators. I add my voice to all those who spoke today and condemn utterly this disgusting behaviour, particularly when it is targeting vulnerable women trying to get access to the private rental sector, be they single parents, those on low incomes or indeed Ukrainians seeking refuge from war in our country. As other speakers have indicated, condemnation is not enough. We need action. While I appreciate that these are complex legal matters and it is not possible to produce legislation overnight, I am disappointed with one aspect of today's debate, namely, that we are not debating Government legislation because that would be a much quicker way to proceed. This is no disrespect to the proposer of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_128"> I listened to the Minister of State's statement, which was very considered. However, one thing was absent from it, namely, a cast-iron commitment that the Government would bring forward its own legislation to fix the problems the Government rightly outlines. When a number of us on the Opposition benches, including myself and Deputy Cian O'Callaghan, brought forward legislation to give student renters greater protection last year, the Minister said on the floor of Dáil, sitting in the convention centre, he would take that legislation and bring forward his own amendments because it was a quicker way of addressing the issue than going through the committee. I think this is what the Minister for Justice should do. She should contact the sponsors of this Bill, convene a meeting of Opposition spokespeople on housing and justice and work with us to ensure legislation to address the issue is brought forward by Government at the earliest opportunity because that is the quickest way to resolve the matter. We have been in this Dáil and the relevant committee for over two years and have yet to get an Opposition Bill through our committee. Therefore, if it is simply left to Committee Stage, my fear is that it will just sit there and gather dust and more and more women will be affected by this appalling practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_129"> I urge the Minister of State to take these concerns back to the Minister and urge her to be proactive and work with us. She will find a very willing collaborative approach from those of us on the Opposition benches. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage also needs to address the many issues raised by other Opposition spokespersons regarding the weakness of regulation in the private rental sector but that is an issue to which we will return at a later stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_130">I thank Deputy Cian O'Callaghan for bringing forward this legislation. It does exactly what we need to see happen. This practice is used as a gateway at times by very unscrupulous people to get young vulnerable women into prostitution. I visited UCD recently and met the sexual exploitation research programme there. What researchers told me about prostitution fits into what we are talking about - vulnerable women coming from dangerous situations. They told me they interviewed 144 women who were overwhelmingly migrant women of 26 different nationalities. Nine of the 144 women were Irish while the remainder were all of other nationalities. A total of 37% were Brazilian, 32% were Romanian and many were from eastern Europe. The average age of the women was 29 but ages varied from 18 to 56. Nine were transgender - all self-identifying as women. Over 40% had insecure or absent migration statuses - in other words, they were undocumented. That is another aspect of this, which does not fit in the Ukrainian situation. A significant number of the women had poor English or English language skills. Many were without stable, safe accommodation living and sleeping in multiple locations wherever they saw buyers. Almost one fifth were of no fixed abode. If we look at that sample of 144 women in prostitution, we can see how it fits into what is being attempted here by some of the people who are initially offering a place for someone to stay. I feel it is a first step to bringing these women into the horrible and despicable trade of prostitution and that this is what is really afoot here. It is important that this legislation is used in such a way that we can find one mechanism to prevent that happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_131"> Irish people have shown huge generosity, and I have seen this in my own community, to the victims of the war in Ukraine, who are mainly women and children fleeing in terror, through finding homes for them or opening their houses to them. A tiny minority is using that as an opportunity to inflict power on these people because this is about power. The issue is that this tiny minority needs to deliver for themselves and for their own power by exploiting some other individual who is in poor and difficult circumstances in a despicable way. It is very clear that we need to move this on as quickly as possible to ensure this legislation is put in place immediately.</p>

          <p eId="para_132">I thank the Deputies who brought forward this legislation. I also thank the <i>Irish Examiner</i> and specifically Ann Murphy for her work on this because she doggedly pursued this issue, brought it to public attention and should be acknowledged for that. I am glad the Government is not opposing the Bill. It would be better if the Government supported it. I think we are all getting a bit tired of coming in here to be told the Government is not against it but is not actually doing anything about it. I welcome the fact that some work is under way but as an Teachta Ó Broin said, it would probably be better - I do not mean this disrespectfully - if we were debating Government legislation because it would be done more quickly. The general consensus here is that the best way to resolve this is the quickest way.</p>
          <p eId="para_133"> I also hope the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is watching this debate because in truth, the conditions for renters are in no small part the reason for the creation of the atmosphere in which this practice is happening. It is not the only reason but it is certainly a contributory factor. In that regard, I will read into the record a message from one of the Minister's constituents. It concerns her brother, who is looking for accommodation at the moment. He has been looking for one-bed accommodation for months and has been in and out of flats and studios. The constituent said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_134">The last straw...was a viewing which took place on St. Patrick’s Day for a one bed flat in [north County Dublin]. I accompanied my sibling to the viewing as it was local. I won't say where it was, but we were both shocked that in this day and age in March 2022, a one bed flat, with mould on the walls in the bathroom, no shower...dirty and smelly, was on the market at for 1200 euro.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">She said that her sibling was so desperate he would have taken it because that is the market at the moment but that other people were so desperate, he did not even get the chance to take it because it was gone before they got there. That is the atmosphere, that is the rental market and the vulnerability and there are people there to exploit so we need to act on this.</p>

          <p eId="para_136">There is no doubt that this situation has been partially created by our housing market. Many, and I hope, most, landlords are good and responsible but our housing market has produced such an imbalance that it has given a minority of landlords a belief that they are beyond reach, have impunity and can do what they like and that people are so desperate they will do anything for a place to stay. Unfortunately, in many instances, they are correct in thinking that people are desperate. I believe it is essential that we criminalise this practice, which is growing. I have seen it in my constituency in Cork in the past two or three years. There was an incident involving a flat in The Lough in 2020. In some instances, it can be couched in a way that is vague but sometimes it is quite explicit. It is vital that this practice be criminalised.</p>
          <p eId="para_137"> While I believe the Government bears responsibility for allowing the housing market and the rental crisis to worsen to this level, the primary person responsible is the person undertaking this practice and this is the person who should face sanction. I cannot be clear enough about my view that this behaviour is sick, perverted, twisted and disgusting. What is important is that we ensure the criminal justice system has the power to punish these people and ensure that the platforms that host these advertisements are careful about the content they put up.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">We must ensure those involved in this practice are punished appropriately because they are taking advantage of people who are very vulnerable. In Britain, there have been approximately 30,000 instances per annum of solicitations of this kind. It clearly is an issue that is growing in many places where there is an imbalance in the housing market. I am very concerned for vulnerable people coming to this country. We need to criminalise this practice.</p>

          <p eId="para_139">I add my thanks to Deputy Cian O'Callaghan and the Social Democrats for bringing forward this Bill. The fact we need to legislate in 2022 to introduce a specific criminal offence for the practice of seeking sex in lieu of rent is absolutely shocking. The housing crisis has left many people vulnerable to poverty, homelessness and living in substandard accommodation. However, that some landlords are demanding sex in lieu of rent is an all-time low. It is totally unacceptable. People who have a desperate housing need and are in a vulnerable position could be seriously exploited.</p>
          <p eId="para_140"> As a society, we must do everything possible to protect these vulnerable people. We have seen reports in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> of landlords advertising rooms openly in exchange for sexual favours. One advertisement was for a shared house in Limerick, with the landlord seeking a single lady "with a twist" and stating, "Can do reduced rent for occasional fun". The only thing with a twist is that person's twisted mind. When contacted by a prospective tenant, the landlord made it clear that sexual activity was required on a weekly basis in return for rent of €200 for the first month and €250 per month thereafter. This is absolutely abhorrent behaviour and it cannot be tolerated. Every effort must be made to make it impossible for these scumbags, which is exactly what they are, to operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_141"> Legislation is required to outlaw this behaviour. Tough sentences must be handed down to anyone convicted of such offences. As it stands, advertising platforms are displaying advertisements such as the following, as reported by the <i>Irish Examiner</i>: "Hey currently have a room to rent... not looking to rent for cash but instead a fwb [friends with benefits] situation. Strictly applies to females, no males will be considered." Any platforms hosting such sex-for-rent advertisements must face serious fines. These platforms need to be held accountable for providing a space that allows predators to operate. Situations like these must not happen again. Unfortunately, this practice is a window into the underbelly of our society, the imbalance in gender relations, particularly as they impact on vulnerable women, and the predatory behaviour of certain persons.</p>

          <p eId="para_142">I thank Deputy Cian O'Callaghan for bringing forward this Bill. The types of acts it seeks to address are repugnant in the extreme and indicate the ease with which some people are ready to take whatever advantage they can of the desperation others experience in trying to secure a home. When I read these revelations, published in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, words failed me. The fact that some people just see others as expendable, as objects to be used, is incomprehensible to me.</p>
          <p eId="para_143"> When this story first broke, Sinn Féin's housing spokesperson immediately raised it with the Ministers for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and Justice. We are now approaching the end of March and still there is no specific criminal offence for the practice of landlords offering free or reduced rent in exchange for sex. We need action and that is what this Bill proposes. The people who use others in this way have no sense of empathy for those who are in severe need of housing. It is the exploitation of people who feel they have few options when it comes to accommodation. It also is the exploitation of people who are newly arrived in this country and who may be less aware of how or where to receive advice and support on their rights. While the vulnerability of certain people in accessing the rental market needs to be addressed seriously and urgently, what we are talking about here is the willingness of some predators, who have no morals and no objection to dehumanising people for their own gains, to use the broken rental market as a vehicle to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_144"> Exploitation always targets the most vulnerable and often is accompanied by misogyny, as we see in this case and which, unfortunately, continues to raise its head. We have a duty to protect everyone in Ireland from exploitation and from those who are ready to take advantage of people they see as vulnerable. This is especially timely given how the rising cost of living is leading to increased poverty. In unprecedented times such as these, predators see the opportunity. The Government must counter this with action, including legal sanctions and provisions for An Garda Síochána to monitor and act on practices such as these, which seek to exploit others. I welcome the Bill, which calls for the creation of an offence of requiring or accepting sex as a condition of accommodation and an offence of arranging for, or facilitating, such exchange. We need action now. There is no time for delay and we cannot allow increased need to be accompanied by increased exploitation.</p>

          <p eId="para_145">I welcome the Bill and thank Deputy Cian O'Callaghan and the Social Democrats for bringing it forward. Sex for rent is a shocking concept. The fact that people who are looking to rent a property should have to give in to this awful exploitation to gain a roof over their head is so wrong as to be quite unbelievable in this day and age. I cannot for the life of me understand the mentality of those renting out a property who would somehow see this type of exploitation as normal practice. As the Bill states, this activity should be illegal and those who engage in it, advertise it and promote it should be met with the full rigours of the law. Research shows this abhorrent practice is mostly perpetrated upon women and migrant renters, that is, those who are perceived as weak by the people who see this as an acceptable practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_146"> As other speakers said, this disgusting activity can only happen within a dysfunctional rental market, which has been created by the Government and its predecessors due to the abandonment of the social and affordable housing market to the private sector. Extortionate rents will only lead to an increase in this particularly horrible arrangement, with people desperate to find accommodation. Legislation must be enacted to make this practice a stand-alone crime carrying a heavy sentence for anyone found to be engaging in it. There is no place for this kind of practice to exist in any society. The Government also must look at its housing policy to ensure renters are protected and the rental market is fit for purpose in order that these unscrupulous landlords and subletters cannot capitalise on this practice. Those found to be engaging in sex-for-rent agreements should be jailed, fined and banned from ever renting out a property in the future.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ivana Bacik<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T10:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_147">I commend Deputies Cian O'Callaghan and Whitmore and their colleagues on bringing forward this important Bill. The Labour Party offers its strong support for it. All of our thoughts at this time are with the people of Ukraine, who are enduring the horrific bombardment of the brutal Russian invasion. Other speakers have pointed out that this Bill has an application for the many people fleeing to our shores seeking refuge and who may be at risk of exploitation by unscrupulous landlords. We all are very conscious of that. I am very glad the Government is supporting the Bill but I echo the calls of colleagues for a clear timeline for its introduction into law. The Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, in particular, has expressed strong support for it, which is why the Cabinet has agreed to approve it in principle. That is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_148"> We all want to condemn the appalling practice that has been described and which the Bill aims to criminalise. Its provisions would create two offences. The first is the offence of a person accepting or requiring sex for the purpose of access to, or retention of, accommodation and related services. The second offence is that of facilitating the offence of accepting or requiring sex as a condition of accommodation, which is notably aimed at publishers. Both are indictable offences carrying significant penalties. I may comment further on these proposed offences presently.</p>
          <p eId="para_149"> Before that, I want to speak a little about the context of these proposals. We know from the experience in Britain that this practice, appallingly, is relatively widespread. UK research by Shelter found that between 30,000 and 40,000 people were targeted by current or prospective landlords over a three-month period. We do not have that level of data for this country and it would be important to know how widespread this appalling practice is here. We are absolutely indebted to Ann Murphy and the <i>Irish Examiner</i> for their report on this and for bringing it to our attention some months ago. In their investigation, they were able to identify particular advertisements containing language and other clear indications that sex was being sought in return for rent. That investigation shows us the need to address this practice specifically in legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_150"> It also illustrates one of the causes of this appalling practice, which is the power imbalance in Ireland currently whereby there is so little accommodation for those seeking to rent and landlords, therefore, are in such a position of power relative to tenants. There always is a power imbalance in this regard but notably so during a housing crisis. We are aware that this is a problem throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">We know from data how few properties are available for rental. It is one of the reasons the Labour Party brought forward a renters' rights Bill drafted by my colleague, Senator Moynihan, to seek to try to strengthen renters' rights and ensure that landlords had more responsibilities. We also need to see an increase in supply of housing and the building of housing on public land. That is crucial to address the housing crisis. We are all well aware of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_152"> I will speak about the provisions in the Bill and about existing law. The Minister of State identified some drafting issues in his speech and the need for the tightening up of language but these issues could be dealt with through collaboration with the Bill's proposers on Committee and Report Stages. Similarly, the issue of compatibility with existing criminal law could be addressed. There is a need to ensure we have a clearly streamlined series of laws on sex offences, rather than piecemeal amendments being carried out.</p>
          <p eId="para_153"> In terms of civil law penalties, a sex-for-rent arrangement, under housing law, would clearly be in breach of quiet enjoyment and exclusive possession. However, there is a gap because such covenants are only read into tenancy agreements and not into room-for-rent or room-sharing arrangements. That is clearly a gap. Of course, the remedies for breach of tenancy covenants are civil only and there is no criminal offence committed by a breach.</p>
          <p eId="para_154"> Deputy Ó Broin made a good point about the need to ensure the Residential Tenancies Board would be able to take action against unscrupulous landlords who engage in this practice. That is another matter that might be addressed through separate legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> As others have said, Part 4 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 criminalises the purchase of sexual services and brings Nordic-model laws into Ireland in keeping with a unanimous report by the then Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. The report was supported by all parties and had the widespread support of the trade union movement, NGOs, the National Women's Council, the Immigrant Council of Ireland and others.</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> A major campaign resulted in the passage of that important legislation, which has been very effective in other countries in which it has been introduced to tackle to demand for sexual services and reduce the incidence of prostitution. That law was introduced precisely to deal with this issue of exploitation and abuse of power and to recognise that women from migrant and disadvantaged backgrounds, in particular, are very much at risk of exploitation and abuse and that a law tackling demands by criminalising the purchase of sex is an effective means to deal with that exploitation.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> That law is in place but it does not cover the situation of a person who seeks sex in return for renting a property. It tackles those who are engaged in the sex trade and prostitution and exploited through prostitution. There is, therefore, a gap and the purchase of sexual services ban would not cover the practice addressed here. Other potentially applicable offences under the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 would not necessarily cover this either.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> The very progressive updated definition of consent for which we fought very hard to have included in section 48 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 provides that consent must be "freely and voluntarily" given but it does not address the situation where consent is lacking by reason of situation of exploitation of power or economic dominance. There is a gap and that is why this legislation is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> The second offence of arranging or facilitating, as the Minister of State has said, may well be covered under section 7 of the Criminal Law Act 1997. However, there is a strong case to be made for explicitly prohibiting advertising of this sort. We have some precedent for that in section 23 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> I will finish by referring to the context by which we have a need for this legislation. As the tragic murder of Ashling Murphy reminded us, unfortunately and regrettably, women are still especially vulnerable to harassment, abuse, intimidation and exploitation. The practice of sexual exploitation of women and vulnerable persons is not new.</p>
          <p eId="para_161"> We know it is compounded by class and immigration status and that women from migrant backgrounds are especially vulnerable to sexual exploitation in Ireland today, where we see large numbers of migrant women exploited through the sex trade on a daily basis. It is very important that we recognise that power imbalance and the coercive context in which practices such as that identified in this legislation are carried out.</p>
          <p eId="para_162"> I will refer to the appalling situation in Ukraine and pay tribute to international and national NGOs such as the sexual exploitation research programme, SERP, in UCD, which has identified very strong risks of women and girls being vulnerable to sexual exploitation and trafficking where they are moving in such large numbers to flee from the Russian bombardment. We know there have been instances of that at the borders of Ukraine and that there is a risk it will happen here. Indeed, there have been some suggestions that it is already happening. That is all the more reason to ensure this legislation is brought through the process speedily and that we see a clear timeframe for its adoption.</p>

          <p eId="para_163">I will share time with Deputy Bríd Smith. We will vote for this legislation, which has become known as the sex-for-rent Bill. We will not shed any tears whatsoever if landlords who advertise sex-for-rent arrangements end up either with hefty fines or even behind bars. These people are creeps who exploit their position of power over people who have less or no power and need a roof over their heads.</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> The situation is given an added urgency with the arrival of Ukrainian refugees. The<i> Irish Examiner</i> recently exposed the case of a landlord in County Clare who said that he wanted a slim Ukrainian to come to stay. The landlord did not disclose the location of the property and wanted photographs sent first. It was a sex-for-accommodation arrangement. This just shows the need for this legislation to go through the Oireachtas quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_165"> Of course, it is not a solution to the problem and does not come close to resolving it because landlords will tend not to openly advertise. They will go about their nefarious business in more sly ways where there is less proof that can be used as evidence. If this acts as something of a chilling factor or a deterrent of any kind and saves even a handful of women from going through this experience, it is positive and we will vote for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_166"> Of course, the root cause of the problem is the massive power imbalance between the power of the landlord on one hand and tenants on the other. This is even more so when the State faces the greatest housing crisis since its foundation. On the one hand is a property owner who has sufficient wealth, which might be modest, to have his or her own accommodation and spare accommodation to rent, such as a house or an apartment. On the other hand is a person who does not have a roof over his or her head and cannot afford many of the properties that are on the market given the high rate of rent. That is a recipe for sexual exploitation to take place. Some would say a significant majority of landlords would never countenance going down such a road. I accept that is the case for a clear majority of landlords. However, is there a minority who will go down that road? There is such a minority and it is perhaps greater than many might expect.</p>
          <p eId="para_167"> The key is to reduce that power imbalance. While landlordism can never be reduced to nil, it can be reduced massively as much as possible. What kind of policies are we talking about? We are talking about a massive social house-building programme, a ban on evictions and the State playing the key decisive role in terms of providing accommodation for the new arrivals from Ukraine. We will not be able to achieve those things playing by the rules of the market. We need to rip up those rules and challenge the property rights of the owners of the vacant properties, including the big vulture funds who own vacant apartment blocks, the hotel owners and so on. We will vote for the legislation but we want to raise those points because they are key. We will keep pressure on those fronts as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_168">We fully support the Bill and welcome its introduction. It is absolutely needed and I do not think any decent person in the country would shed a tear about any landlord who would advertise sex for rent or engage in that practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">As Deputy Barry said, they are creeps of the highest order and everybody in this House is morally outraged by this practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_170"> I thank the Social Democrats for bringing the Bill forward. Having said that, this is not the first time in my lifetime that I have heard of this practice. In the 1980s, my sister conducted research for the Department of Health on the health needs of homeless women. In interviewing several hundred such women, she found that there was exploitation of this nature of very vulnerable women, who usually had high needs or addictions, in homeless accommodation which, in those days, usually meant bed and breakfast accommodation. That same exploitation was taking place but this is a notch up because it is being advertised for what it is and is happening in the year 2022. When Ireland is supposed to have progressed and moved forward, these most obscene practices are bringing us back towards those dark ages. That is why we welcome the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_171"> I want to talk about the Government's support of the Bill. The Government will obviously have to support it. As I have said, everybody here is outraged by this practice and the Government has to support the Bill. However, I wish it would see the deep irony and contradictions in its position of supporting a Bill that bans sex for rent while not supporting measures that would have militated against us reaching such a point. In other words, the Government and those which preceded it brought us into this massive housing crisis, which has now gone on for nearly a decade, and, while supporting this Bill, it refuses to support a Bill that would freeze or control rents, a Bill that would deliver affordable housing and Bills that demand derelict properties be taken back into control. It has also blocked Bills that sought to enshrine a right to housing in the Constitution. It is hypocrisy because the root cause of this problem is the housing crisis and not just creepy landlords who will do anything to take advantage of vulnerable women and others. It is not just such landlords but the housing crisis perpetuated by this Government that is at the heart of the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_172"> We would like to see a bit of consistency. The Government should support the Social Democrats' Bill but it should also finally deal with housing crisis rather than perpetuating it and blocking every progressive measure aimed at dealing with the root cause of the crisis brought forward from this side of the House. Instead of such measures, we have a Government that has had multiple meetings with vulture funds, cuckoo funds, developers and bankers to ask what it can do for them, how far it can bend for them, how many laws it can change and how many regulations it can reduce to facilitate their profits and developments. That has been the approach to housing while, at the same time, the provision of public, affordable and social housing has been run down throughout this State. This Bill is a consequence of the failed housing policy of successive Governments. The Government needs to fully deal with this issue in addition to giving full support to this Bill today.</p>

          <p eId="para_173">I compliment the Social Democrats on bringing forward this very important legislation. We still have such abhorrent, reckless and demeaning practices going on in our State in 2022 and do not have legislation to punish those engaging in them. I welcome the fact that the Government is not going to oppose this legislation but we need to make sure it is brought in as quickly as possible in order to send a clear message.</p>
          <p eId="para_174"> I would like to bring into the debate the issue of what we have seen in this country since the destruction and demolition of Ukraine, that is, the great number of people who have been put out of their homes as a result and the continued generosity and goodwill shown by people in Ireland. That has to be noted in this debate. This legislation will benefit very few people but the practice of providing accommodation in exchange for sex, whatever way it is dressed up, has got to be stamped out. We have many good landlords in this country and good people who are opening up their homes to people from Ukraine. It is hard to think of this kind of attack being made on people who are vulnerable and who are desperate to get a roof over their head and to be able to sleep in a bed.</p>
          <p eId="para_175"> That brings me to my next point, which relates to victims. Last Monday night, I attended a meeting in Headford on crime prevention, the Community Alert programme and all that goes along with that. Present were some people who were victims of crime. Their houses had been robbed. They explained how they felt after their homes being raided while they were out for perhaps half an hour. The big point they made is that the victim is not taken into account in the whole process. One man said that his house is not the same anymore. We need to make sure that, alongside whatever happens with regard to crime, criminality, convicting people and putting them into jail, we have more respect and more supports for people who are the victims of what might be deemed a simple crime, that is, their house being robbed. It is very important that we have services in place to help these people and to allow them to become part of the process. They should be part of the process of solving the crime but there is also a healing process involved for these people.</p>
          <p eId="para_176"> I will be honest and say that there was also a lot of disdain shown for our bail laws at the meeting. We allow repeat offenders out on bail again and again. They often offend while they are out on bail and this is something the Government has to look at. We cannot tolerate that. The reason we cannot tolerate it is that the victim feels they are being victimised again when somebody gets away with something like this. Another issue that was raised and that I must raise in the House relates to free legal aid. Repeat offenders get free legal aid. Taxpayers' money is spent defending repeat offenders. I am not saying we should not have free legal aid, but it should be measured in such a way that makes it available to those who need it but not to everybody who commits a crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_177"> We have to arrest the sentiment that is out there at the moment and which is particularly prevalent in rural areas where crime has happened. Rural crime is basically robbing houses and farmyards. Convictions for such crimes do not seem to come up in the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_178"> To return to the legislation, I hope it comes in quickly and that it is used for what it was intended for, that is, to put people who commit crimes like this behind bars so that the victims get some sort of consolation in their minds for what was foisted upon them. The debate here today is about particular legislation which needs to be brought in as a matter of urgency but, in the wider context of crime and criminality, we are a bit soft on criminals. We have a system in which they are allowed to get away with it for as long as possible. Gardaí tell me that there are people who travel to rob and who do this in a systematic way. They know an awful lot about them but I have not seen a great number of convictions in the courts for these crimes in my area or in any other area. The legislation is there but the bail laws are not helping. We need to tackle this properly. We need to make sure that we do not tolerate crime or give people a soft option. If they commit a crime, they should pay the price. Otherwise, it is the victims who will suffer continuously.</p>

          <p eId="para_179">I welcome the Bill brought forward by the Social Democrats. Sadly, sex for rent appears to be on the doorstep of both urban and rural communities throughout Ireland although, thankfully, it is not very widespread at the moment. I was shocked to read a story of such a case in Limerick, which I thank the <i>Limerick Post</i> for exposing. This is probably the darkest side of homelessness, where people are desperate to secure housing at almost any cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> We can see the housing crisis that we have. We can see people who are in a family situation where there is violence. We can see families who want to try to move out and who are looking to escape from violence within the home and violent behaviour. We can see what we can do as a country. When Ukraine was looking for our help, we were able to get certain accommodation and the Irish people were able to welcome people from Ukraine into their houses to help them in a situation of need, and rightly so. We can also see premises around this country that have been closed up for years upon years - convents and different places that are out of use – and which are now being put into use to house families from Ukraine. Again, I agree with this. It is right.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> What I have to ask is what the Government has done for years upon years in regard to looking for places to house vulnerable people who have been put in a situation of sex for rent. That is a failure of Government policy; it is a failure of the Government. We can do it when people ask us in a Ukraine-type situation but when it comes to Irish people who have been asking for years, the Government says there is nothing it can do. We can do things. We can move mountains in this country when we are called upon and when there is a need from other countries, but when Irish people ask, the Government says, sorry, there is no funding for vulnerable families. Things can be done in this country to help people but the Government is again failing to act to protect those like the people in Ukraine and people in Ireland who are in violent situations and who are caught in a situation of sex for rent. To me, that is a failure of the Government.</p>

I am amazed that there was no way to deal with this offence before. Remarkably, the Minister for Justice has confirmed that no specific criminal offence for this practice currently exists in Ireland. It is amazing that, as matters stand, there is no way to deal with some landlord or other person who could prey on vulnerable women, and men also. It is wrong and we have to support this Bill. I thank the Social Democrats for highlighting it. We read what an examination by the <i>Irish Examiner</i> found, with advertisements offering properties in Limerick and Dublin. I only hope there is not much of it, but we have to stamp out whatever there is now. It is imperative that we all work together to ensure this Bill is put through without delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_184"> As has been stated, we do not seem to be improving housing options for many and there are many still without homes. We appreciate what the Government is doing for the Ukrainian community and we are very sad about what is happening in Ukraine. It is a terrible situation and we appreciate what the Government is doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_185"> In saying that, there are still a lot of people who have been on lists here for years and who are still ringing and ringing, and they have no options available to them. While we see that most of the Government's activities are directed towards Dublin, there needs to be more direction and assistance with housing in Kerry. For example, take people whose houses become derelict on family farms. In times gone by, people could have a demountable home so they could stay in the place they gave all their life to and finish out their days on their farm. That option is not there anymore. We are told that local government no longer has funding for those demountable homes. I have a number of applicants who are in demountable homes for many years and the homes are disintegrating around them, but we have no funding to replace them. That is a crying shame. People in rural Ireland need homes just as much as those in Dublin or anywhere else, but especially on family farms where they gave 60 or 70 years and where they want to finish out their days. Surely the Government must look at that. I ask the Minister of State to have some input into that and to deal with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_186"> Another problem was created by the Tánaiste, Deputy Leo Varadkar. When he was the Minister for Transport in 2012, he gave a direction that there was to be no more planning granted for properties coming out on national roads, even where there is current access. It is ridiculous to think that someone is denied the right of putting a roof over their heads even though they are coming out the same exit onto the national road. If they stay in their mother’s or father’s house, or whatever house was there before, there is no problem with that, but it is only the same level of activity when they build a house for themselves and stay in it. I ask the Minister of State to look at that again.</p>
          <p eId="para_187"> There are many more issues but those two specific issues that I have related to the Minister of State are hurting people at the present time in the county of Kerry which I represent.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Deputy Malcolm Noonan)<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T11:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_188">I thank Deputy Cian O'Callaghan and the Social Democrats for bringing forward the Bill. This is a practice we all abhor. It is disgusting. I listened to the Deputy’s contribution at the start of the debate and I will address some of the issues before I make my concluding remarks.</p>
          <p eId="para_189"> Deputy O'Callaghan made the specific point that while the Bill in itself is not enough to tackle this issue, it is certainly a step in the right direction. The abuse of power and the disparity of power between landlord and tenant is something we all wish to challenge. As has been stated by the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, how this Bill interacts with other sexual offences legislation is critical. We are all going to work together to try to improve this and the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, and the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, are committed to doing that too, which is critical. Our ultimate objective is to criminalise this disgraceful practice and put a stop to it, once and for all.</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> Deputy Bacik raised the issue of the experience in the UK, where 30,000 to 40,000 women were being exploited. The issue here is that we do not have data. We have a great deal of anecdotal evidence. We are very grateful to Ann Murphy of the <i>Irish Examiner</i> for shedding light on this practice. However, data is important and that is something we need to get conclusive information on.</p>
          <p eId="para_191"> Deputy Bacik also raised the issue of compatibility with existing criminal law and the other issues the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is committed to addressing, namely, looking at the role of the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, and at situations where his Department can bring in cross-cutting measures and legislation to end this practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> The Deputy went on to raise the issue of women from migrant and disadvantaged backgrounds who are more at risk from this activity and more at risk in general from sexual exploitation.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">The Deputy referred specifically to the sexual exploitation research programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_194"> A number of Deputies raised the intersection of challenges from the influx of what will be a huge number of refugees from Ukraine. All states across Europe need to be mindful of that now. There needs to be spare capacity in all our housing policies for the intake of refugees in general because after the Ukraine crisis is addressed there will be another crisis and another crisis, either through conflict or climate change. It is critical that we have built in housing capacity to be in a position to take in refugees at very short notice. That is something for another day but it is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_195"> Deputy Barry raised the issues of refugees and the lack of adequate social housing provision as the root cause of this. It is right to say that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is committed, through Housing for All and legislation, to protecting tenants' rights and to putting in place the most significant and most ambitious housing programme in the history of the State. That will take time. We see housing commencements increase month on month now, and that will help us in our long-term objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_196"> Deputy Bríd Smith raised issues dating back to the 1980s. This issue is nothing new, with vulnerable women in addiction and bed and breakfast settings. It is important to note that.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> Deputy Canney raised a number of other points about housing in general, and Deputies O'Donoghue and Danny Healy-Rae raised points about crime in general. Again, these may be issues for another day. Our core objective is the legislation before us. I thank Deputy Cian O'Callaghan again for bringing it forward in the Social Democrats' slot.</p>
          <p eId="para_198"> I join colleagues across the House in expressing my disgust at reports of accommodation being offered in exchange for sexual acts. It is reprehensible and utterly unacceptable. For that reason the Government will not oppose this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_199"> This issue was raised by the Minister for Justice and with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage after reports appeared in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> last December. The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, sought the advice of the Attorney General, who confirmed that such behaviour is not a criminal offence under the current law. However, while offering accommodation in exchange for sex may not be a criminal offence, let me make it absolutely clear that any agreement to pay for accommodation with sexual acts is invalid and not enforceable under contract law. In addition, as the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, has said, under sexual offences legislation it is absolutely clear that consent must be freely and voluntarily given. Any attempt to coerce or to force a person to engage in sex is rape and is punishable on conviction by up to life imprisonment.</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> It is also important to note that tenants are not without rights and protections. Tenants' rights are set out in the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, as amended. This point was raised by Deputies Ó Broin and Bacik. Under that Act, a tenant has, among other rights, the right to privacy, the right to receive advance notice of termination of a tenancy and the right to refer a dispute to the RTB. Additionally, in the past two years alone, my Department has introduced six rental Bills, including a number of measures to provide additional protections for tenants during the pandemic. The operation of the Residential Tenancies Acts is kept under constant review.</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> It is important to note that not all tenancies come under the remit of the RTB. This includes those availing of the rent-a-room scheme, which it seems would encompass the majority of the highlighted sex-for-rent advertisements in this State. Tenancy protections on their own may not prevent an unscrupulous landlord from seeking to exploit someone vulnerable by offering reduced rent in return for sex. That is why we are examining if this issue needs to be addressed in its own right as set out in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> Colleagues raised the issue of housing supply. While an increase in housing supply will not in itself stop unscrupulous accommodation providers from trying to prey on vulnerable people, I assure Members that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the entire Government remain committed to addressing the issues in the housing market. I have stated that in the context of Housing for All and the ambition that lies therein. As Deputies will be aware, Housing for All: A New Housing Plan for Ireland is the Government's housing plan to 2030. It is a multi-annual, multibillion euro plan that will improve Ireland's housing system and deliver more homes of all types, social and private. It sets out the Government's plan to increase the supply of housing to an average of 33,000 units per year over the next decade, including through the development of a new cost-rental sector, which is already up and running. It also commits to the delivery of more than 9,500 new build social homes on average over the next five years and more than 90,000 new social homes in the period 2022 to 2030. This year, 24,600 homes will be delivered, including 9,000 new build social homes, 4,100 affordable and cost-rental homes and 11,500 private rental and private ownership homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> It is clear from the debate today that all sides of the House are united in their disgust with and condemnation of the small number of people who would try to take advantage of others in vulnerable situations and seek to sexually exploit them. It beggars belief. I assure Deputies, however, that the Government is deeply committed to tackling domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in all its forms. The prioritisation of this hugely important work is evident in the policy and legislative developments implemented by this Government and those that are currently being progressed. Additionally, increased budget allocations have been secured this year in order to address such heinous and unacceptable behaviour. The Minister for Justice is leading work on a whole-of-government strategy to combat domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. This new plan will have a particular focus on prevention and on ensuring that victims are better supported. It will set an overall goal of zero tolerance of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. The strategy has been developed in partnership with the sector to ensure that it is targeted, comprehensive and effective in achieving all the goals set out and will be published, with an associated implementation plan, as soon as practicable.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> As has been said, the Minister for Justice is in favour of introducing new criminal offences to address this issue. Officials in my Department will continue to work with colleagues in her Department and with the Attorney General to ensure that effective measures, including criminal sanctions, can be introduced to address this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> Again, I thank Deputy Cian O'Callaghan for bringing forward this legislation. As the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, and I have stated, it is the Government's intention to work with Members to try to progress this and to end this disgraceful practice once and for all. The House is united in trying to achieve that. I commend Deputy O'Callaghan again on bringing forward the legislation.</p>

        <speech by="#HollyCairns" eId="spk_41">
          <from>Deputy Holly Cairns<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T11:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_206">I thank my colleague, Deputy Cian O'Callaghan, and his team, Pádraig, Micheál and Jack, for developing this important Bill. Sex for rent is abhorrent. It reveals the depraved depths of the housing crisis, whereby grossly exploitative landlords expect sexual favours in return for putting roofs over people's heads. Abusers see an opportunity to take advantage of women who desperately need accommodation. It takes a particularly revolting and immoral person even to consider sex for rent, not to mention actually advertising their sleaze. Thanks to the investigative work of Ann Murphy and the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, we are aware of the latest manifestation of this issue, but we also know that the problem is more widespread. As legislators, we are compelled to act.</p>
          <p eId="para_207"> This Bill is a focused response to these incidents to make requiring sex for accommodation, or facilitating sex as a condition for accommodation, crimes. This is simple legislation, its rationale is incredibly clear and it has strong political and public support. No one is naive enough to think that it will immediately stop the malpractice. It is, however, an explicit reaction that will provide the Garda and other State bodies with a means of countering this appalling trend and holding its perpetrators to account. The creation of a specific offence is a recognition of that offence and what it represents. It demonstrates society's revulsion. This Bill is a concrete action the Social Democrats can take as an Opposition party.</p>
          <p eId="para_208"> I welcome the Government's support for the Bill, but this needs to prompt reforms in the sector, addressing issues that can leave people open to exploitation and harassment. Renters have to hand over a considerable amount of personal information to landlords or agents, which leaves them vulnerable to unwanted attention and abuse. Sex for rent and forms of harassment and abuse should also be made issues on which the RTB can act. We also need stronger safeguards to ensure that individuals convicted of sexual, abusive or coercive crimes are not permitted to have residential power over others. The implications of this Bill are considerable. I urge the Ministers for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and Justice to develop a more comprehensive response to fully eliminate this disgusting issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> We must also face up to the realities that facilitate sex for rent. It is symptomatic of the housing crisis. Skyrocketing costs and shortages of housing are forcing more people into accepting substandard and miserable accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">Photos regularly circulate on social media of tiny rooms for shocking prices. Tenants in public and private accommodation have to live with mould-covered walls. There are cases of migrants being crammed into houses. Whole cohorts of renters are being exploited in the Irish housing system by landlords and companies more interested in profit than in providing proper accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_211"> Sex for rent is by far the most disgusting articulation of this exploitation but there are many other practices that also prey on vulnerabilities. Young people, disabled people, migrants, international students and people on fixed incomes are all made vulnerable by Government policy. They are left susceptible to those who want to exploit them for their own gain. Regulation in the sector is vastly inadequate for the scale of issues involved. The system is rigged in favour of big landlords and vulture funds. Prosecutions and enforcement in the area do not reflect the realities of renting in Ireland today. For example, renters should not be discriminated against because they are getting certain payments, such as housing assistance payment, but we are all aware of situations where landlords do not accept tenants on it. Of course they give another reason on paper but we all know the reality. While this is wrong, it is a minor offence compared to some of the other malpractices in the sector. If this infraction cannot be policed then what hope is there for addressing the other issues?</p>
          <p eId="para_212"> This legislation will only be effective if there are the desire and resources to see it implemented. It is a further indication that the State needs to have a far more active role in housing. The continuing opposition to the regulation of housing, freezing rents, prioritising families, tackling dereliction and building public housing is ideological. There is a serious and disastrous imbalance between the role of the market and the role of the State. This needs to be addressed. The Ban on Sex for Rent Bill deals with a specific issue. Without addressing the larger underlying factors of a housing shortage and rapidly-rising rents the conditions for these abuses will remain.</p>

          <from>Deputy Cian O'Callaghan<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T11:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_213">I thank all of the Deputies from across the House in various parties and groups for their very helpful and constructive comments on the Bill and for their support. I specifically thank Ann Murphy and the <i>Irish Examiner </i>for all of the work they have done on highlighting this. It would not have come to light and we would not be debating the Bill and trying to address this if it was not for their very important work on it. It really shows the huge importance of independent investigative journalism and how important it is to our democracy to have strong independent journalism.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> Most Deputies spoke about the wider issue of power imbalance. This has to be tackled if we are serious about this. I very much welcome that the Minister of State recognised it in his comments. It is significant because often we do not hear recognition from wider government about the problems of the power imbalance. It is important that it has been recognised. It needs to be across government. It needs to be seen, named and tackled. There was a real contrast between the Minister of State's opening comments in which he recognised this and the official comments prepared by the Department. They did not recognise it and did not name it. Included in those comments were the protections in place for tenants. It is correct there are no protections in place for tenants. There was no recognition in the official comments of how we need to go much further to create a situation where tenants have a level of protection so the power imbalance can be tackled and addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> I welcome the comments of the Minister of State on the importance of gathering data on this. It will be welcome to hear from the Government what it intends to do on this. Earlier, we heard from the Government about the difficulties with gathering data and how difficult and invasive it would be and how upsetting it could be for people. We want to hear from the Government what it wants to do because it has resources in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> It is welcome that we have been told the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is looking at the role of the Residential Tenancies Board in this. I agree very much with the earlier comments of Deputy Ó Broin on this. The RTB should have powers to investigate this specifically and it should be able to strike off any landlord found to be engaging in this practice or in placing ads. This would be an additional deterrent. No landlord who engages in this or attempts to engage in this is in any way fit to be a landlord. I want to hear from the Government what it will do about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> It is very clear we have cross-party support throughout the House for this to be dealt with urgently. This is what most people asked for. It is welcome the Minister, Deputy McEntee, will engage with us on how the Bill can be advanced. We have had helpful and constructive comments from the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, about the specifics of the legislation and specific areas the Government wants to see addressed and improved. The key issue is that the Government has access to the advice of the Attorney General and departmental resources. In terms of progressing this further the ball is very much in the court of the Government. We will work with the Government on it and help as much as we can and be constructive on it. We need action on this. There has been a very strong message from the House on this. It is worth saying the vast majority of landlords find this practice absolutely abhorrent, as does everybody else. If we do not address the wider power imbalance and the wider issues in the sector then we will not be taking enough action to deal with this. I implore the Minister of State, who has recognised the issue, that it needs wider impetus from across Government.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T12:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_218">As the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will know, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, published its quarterly report this morning. It makes for very alarming reading. The ESRI says inflation could peak at 8.5% this summer before averaging out at 6.7% for the year as a whole. This, as the Minister knows, is the highest annual rate of inflation since 1984. Inflationary pressures that were already building have escalated further due to Russia's criminal invasion of Ukraine. We are presented with a very serious situation for workers and families as households that struggle to keep their heads above water now face a prolonged cost-of-living crisis. As the Minister knows, everything is going up and even now the very basics are pushed beyond the reach of many ordinary people. Our airwaves are filled with people sharing their stories of how incredibly difficult it is just to make ends meet. People can barely afford to light and heat their homes and we now need to talk about food. The soaring cost of energy and fuel, problems with supply chains and the impact of this criminal war mean the price of groceries is going through the roof. Families now in real terms are stretched to put food on the table and money does not go far when it comes to the weekly shop. People are down the bare essentials and have very little left at the end of the week. They will be very worried and alarmed hearing the news this morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_219"> The ESRI is projecting strong economic growth and a budget surplus this year. That is the good news. The Government therefore has elbowroom within the public finances to intervene and cushion people from the sharpest impact of this crisis. We must ensure workers, families and small businesses come through this crisis in one piece. We must ensure especially that people on low and fixed incomes have enough to live on. The Government cannot stand idly by while people are pushed into poverty. Its members are not observers or commentators on people's hardship. Their job, as the Minister knows, is to respond with speed and urgency to the extraordinary difficulties households now face. However, the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has said the Government has no plan to intervene with cost-of-living supports until October's budget. He said: "I can be really clear that we are not considering any further steps." Does the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform agree with the Minister for Finance's position because October is seven months away and people are trying to stay afloat now? They cannot wait that long for Government to implement measures that will bring the cost of living down.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> Tá sé geallta ag tuairisc an ESRI go mbeidh an ráta boilscithe i mbliana mar an ceann is airde ó 1984. Ní féidir le hoibrithe agus teaghlaigh dul tríd an ngéarchéim costais mhaireachtála seo. Tá an cumas airgeadais ag an Rialtas déileáil leis seo so caithfidh sé gníomhú anois. I accept the Minister cannot do everything. There is no expectation of that on him or on the Government but they must do more. The Government has to cut the cost of energy and fuel. It will need to go further than that but it needs to start there. I asked the Tánaiste yesterday and now ask the Minister to engage with the EU Commission to remove VAT from energy bills for an initial three-month period and remove excise from home heating oil. These are two initial actions the Government can take to give workers and families the break and the breathing room they desperately need.</p>

          <from>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Michael McGrath)<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T12:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_221">I thank Deputy McDonald for raising the issue of inflation and the cost-of-living pressures we as a Government acknowledge people are facing at this time. It was highlighted further by the ESRI report the Deputy mentioned in her introductory remarks.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> People will accept this is a global phenomenon. All developed economies in the world are experiencing a high level of inflation. For our neighbours in the UK, the latest figure is 6.2%. In the US it is just under 8%. These are unprecedented times. The level of inflation we are witnessing and that people are having to deal with in their day-to-day lives is without parallel in recent modern history. That is why the Government is not standing idly by. The Government is not an observer or commentator. The Deputy is correct on that. It has already taken very significant steps in an effort to alleviate the burden people are undoubtedly facing at this time. That started with the budget back in October where we had a package of over €1 billion in income tax reductions including for people on low and middle incomes and also welfare increases both in core social welfare weekly rates but also targeted, anti-poverty measures such as the living alone allowance, the qualified child dependant allowance, changes to the working family payment and so on. However, it is because of what has happened since that we recognise we had to go further and the Government has responded outside of the normal budgetary calendar with two further significant interventions in recent weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_223"> As the Deputy knows, back in February we had the package of over €500 million. This included the energy credit of €200 for every household which will be applied to electricity accounts in the next number of weeks. There was also the fuel allowance lump sum of €125 for up to 400,000 households, along with a range of other measures, including the reduction in the drugs payment scheme threshold to €80, the front-loading of the budgetary changes in the working family payment, a 20% reduction in transport fees and improvements in the school transport scheme as well to try to help families deal with the current pressures. The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, in the last two weeks brought forward the reduction in excise on petrol and diesel in recognition of the extraordinary increases in prices people are experiencing at the forecourts in recent weeks. The Government has made a genuine and concerted effort to tackle this issue. That overall cost-of-living package is close to €2 billion at this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> In the next number of weeks, led by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, the stability programme update will be published by Government. This will reset our economic and fiscal forecasts to take account of the prevailing conditions we are experiencing. We are witnessing a perfect storm in relation to inflation. Inflation was increasing coming out of the worst effects of Covid internationally and that has now been compounded by the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. I assure the Deputy the Government is as one. The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, I and the entire Government collectively are at one in our determination to assist and support people at this time. That is why we have already taken a number of critical decisions. At this point we have no immediate further plans to introduce additional measures but as is always the case the Government will keep this issue under review.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> I acknowledge what Deputy McDonald said on VAT. I am sure she will accept we are governed by an EU VAT directive. The member states' national laws on VAT have to be consistent with that directive. The Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, are directly engaging with Commission President von der Leyen and her colleagues to see what flexibility there may be on options available to member states. We expect to hear back from the Commission in that regard shortly.</p>

          <p eId="para_226">That is an extraordinary response and a very disappointing one. When the Minister says the Government is at one on these matters I can only assume he is therefore reiterating the position of the Minister for Finance that the Government has no plans to take further measures this side of October. Whereas the State's economic and fiscal forecast needs to be reset this springtime, I tell the Minister households' economic and fiscal realities have taken a battering. It is simply unreal and not accepting of the reality of the soaring inflation crisis to suggest the Government will sit this out for the next number of weeks and months. That is not dealing with the reality. I appeal to him again to move on this. We accept the phenomenon is global. The Minister does not have to keep repeating that. Nobody is placing the origins of this crisis at the Minister's feet - far from it. However, there is an absolute immediate expectation the Government will act now and not wait until October. That is not real. Will the Minister move on the issue of VAT and of removing excise from home heating oil? Will he move on them now and give people some small breathing space?</p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T12:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_235">The past four weeks have witnessed the illegal and unprovoked war of extermination launched by Vladimir Putin's Russia against the people of Ukraine. The world, in particular Europe, has changed and nothing will be the same again and we have to give most serious consideration, both as an Oireachtas and as a people, to a broad range of issues that will flow from this terrible aggression.</p>
          <p eId="para_236"> I wish to deal with our immediate response to the humanitarian crisis that has resulted in the displacement within Ukraine and across Europe of 10 million Ukrainians so far. Although we are on the edge of Europe, we expect to welcome to our shores up to 200,000 refugees. We must be ready today and each coming day to receive properly these desperate and traumatised people, who are coming here for refuge.</p>
          <p eId="para_237"> I wish to discuss the port of Rosslare in my constituency. In a most welcome and generous gesture, Stena Line is offering free passage aboard its vessels to Ireland. On Monday, more than 180 people – Ukrainians fleeing terror and arriving in Rosslare – availed of this facility. Another Stena Line boat will arrive from Cherbourg tomorrow and a larger vessel, the <i>Stena Estrid</i>, will arrive from Cherbourg on Saturday. It is expected that many hundreds of Ukrainian refugees will arrive on these ships and the ones to follow.</p>
          <p eId="para_238"> However, although there is amazing and heart-warming goodwill from local community volunteers, local authority staff, the Garda Síochána, the Department of Social Protection and many others, there is a clear lack of co-ordination at the port – a lead agency, someone to be in charge, to co-ordinate that goodwill. We need a strong physical presence from the International Protection Accommodation Services, IPAS. There must be comprehensive Covid testing for staff and those arriving. Already, some support staff have had to isolate because of the latest Covid wave. There must be sheltered areas to deal with traumatised people away from busy port activity. We are mostly talking about women and children who are arriving in an alien and foreign country and into a busy working port.</p>
          <p eId="para_239"> There is also a need for practical assistance, including guidance on car insurance. People who have driven across Europe are arriving with cars but instantly have no insurance. There is a need for cash for fuel and personal requisites, support for medicines and prescriptions, SIM cards and power adapters – all the normal things that people need. Many people fled their homes with just the clothes they were standing in. We need to wrap supports around them.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> In the coming days, hundreds, or perhaps thousands, more refugees will be arriving at our ports. We need to recognise that those areas are becoming war refugee zones and we have to prepare accordingly. Will the Minister set out the Government's plans?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcGrath" eId="spk_55" as="#Minister_for_Public_Expenditure_and_Reform">
          <from>Deputy Michael McGrath<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T12:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_241">I thank Deputy Howlin for raising this issue and I acknowledge the manner in which he has done so. We all share his sentiments about the appalling atrocities in Ukraine that we are witnessing on our television screens, scenes that we believed belonged to a bygone era. Ireland is going to do everything it can to support the Ukrainian refugees who come to our country. We will welcome them with open arms. This is being led by the extraordinary response of the Irish people and the goodwill and generosity they have demonstrated to date in the offers of support and accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_242"> As of yesterday, 10,414 Ukrainian refugees have arrived in Ireland and almost 5,000 have sought emergency accommodation from the IPAS. The IPAS has contracted more than 2,500 hotel rooms, with additional capacity being pursued through hotels, guest houses and bed and breakfasts. Work is ongoing to work through the 20,000 offers of accommodation that we have received through the portal that was set up by the Government in partnership with the Red Cross. We will be availing of many of these offers in the days and weeks ahead. We are also considering State-owned and private properties that may be suitable for short-term accommodation, religious properties and any property under the control of our local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_243"> Deputy Howlin raised the issue of Rosslare Europort on the floor of the House yesterday during statements in advance of the European Council meeting. I recognise the efforts of the local groups on the ground that have been meeting refugees as they arrive at Rosslare Europort and assisting them in every way they can. To date, 879 of the arrivals from Ukraine have arrived via Rosslare Europort. The port has been working with various State agencies – the Garda, the Departments of Social Protection and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Wexford County Council and Civil Defence – as well as the Red Cross and local charities to provide people with the immediate support they need by way of temporary protection, accommodation, access to social welfare etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_244"> However, we acknowledge the point that the Deputy has raised about the need for a greater level of co-ordination to ensure that the process works as efficiently and seamlessly as possible. In that respect, the Department of the Taoiseach is co-ordinating a group that has been tasked with putting in place enhanced arrangements at Rosslare Europort to accommodate Ukrainian refugees arriving there. The key services to be provided are those under the responsibilities of the Departments I have named, as well as the Department of Justice. The intention is to put in place as quickly as possible a large reception centre close to the port because, as the Deputy mentioned, it is a busy working port. Insofar as we can, the model will replicate the successful model that is in operation at Dublin Airport.</p>

          <p eId="para_245">I warmly welcome that, but it needs to be in place for tomorrow, which is when the next Cherbourg boat arrives.</p>
          <p eId="para_246"> The Minister will recall that our response to Brexit was to put customs officials and agents on board ferry vessels so that, by the time truck drivers arrived here, all the paperwork had been done. Surely we need to put cross-departmental teams on board the ferries. The 18-hour crossing affords us the opportunity to undertake registrations, Covid tests and assess accommodation needs so that, when people arrive after those 18 or 20 hours, the work is done and does not need to be commenced here. Teams could be deployed at our departure ports and on board those ferries.</p>
          <p eId="para_247"> The co-ordination is welcome and I hope it can be in place tomorrow. Many disparate groups are desperately trying to do good but without co-ordination, so it needs to be in place immediately. As well as that, much of the work could be done on board the ferries. Will this matter be addressed by the Government?</p>

          <p eId="para_248">It is important to recognise that Ukrainian refugees arriving at the port are being looked after. That is thanks in no small part to the fantastic efforts of local community groups. State actors are also directly involved and are providing the essential supports to the refugees. I assure the Deputy that this specific issue is being treated with the urgency it deserves. There was a meeting as recently as this morning on seeking to co-ordinate the State's response at its points of entry, including Rosslare Europort. I assure the Deputy that this will be done as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_249"> The Deputy has raised the issue of having State personnel on board the ships. This will be considered by the group that is being led by the Department of the Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_250"> There is a whole-of-government approach to dealing with the situation and ensuring that Ukrainian refugees are given every possible assistance and support that they need.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T12:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_251">While the people of this country are showing extraordinary solidarity and generosity in terms of the terrible suffering of the Ukrainian people, they are simultaneously being crucified by the spiralling costs of living, electricity and gas prices, energy prices and so on. The latest bad news in that regard is the ESRI report that the rate of inflation will hit 8.7% this summer. People's incomes and savings and their ability to pay their bills are being wiped out. In the face of this, the Government and, I stress, other European governments and the American Government, all of which will be meeting in Europe this week, are saying that they are more or less powerless and that there is nothing they can do, even more so now because of the Ukraine war.</p>
          <p eId="para_252"> Is the Minister familiar with the concept of war profiteering? I suggest he, the Government and the EU leaders make themselves familiar with this concept. War profiteering is a disgusting practice whereby ordinary people are asked to endure incredible hardship, financial and otherwise, as a result of war but where private companies and businesses make superprofits at the expense of everybody else's misery, exploiting the crisis and the war. I suggest to the Minister that this is what we are seeing across the world. We are seeing war profiteering on an industrial scale by the producers of fuel and energy and the suppliers of fuel and energy, globally, in Europe and in this country and the bill for that is being picked up in terms of the extreme hardship, energy poverty and so on that people are suffering. </p>
          <p eId="para_253"> I will give some facts in regard to the profits of these companies. The profits of the French company, TotalEnergies, are up 300% to €16.1 billion; BP's profits have increased to €13 billion, its highest profits in eight years; Shell's profits are up to €19 billion, again the highest in eight years; Chevron Corporation's profits are up to €15 billion; ExxonMobil's profits are up to €23 billion and the profits of Aramco, the Saudi company, are up 124% to €110 billion. This is mirrored in this country with the ESB's profits up 10% to €679 million and Energia's profits up 46% to €35 million. What is the Government going to do about that? While everybody else is being told to suffer, to endure hardship, these energy companies and petrol companies are making a fortune. If the European leaders who are meeting this week in Europe can take unprecedented action to impose sanctions on Putin's bloody regime, could they not take unprecedented action to stop the war profiteering that we are seeing from energy and electricity companies and the producers of petrol and gas across Europe to control the prices such that ordinary people are suffering?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcGrath" eId="spk_59" as="#Minister_for_Public_Expenditure_and_Reform">
          <from>Deputy Michael McGrath<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T12:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_254">I thank the Deputy. It may well be the case that there are companies that are profiteering on the back of the current international climate around energy prices. Those issues are not entirely within the control of any government or of the European Union acting as a collective. The European Union leaders, when they meet at European Council tomorrow and Friday, will be examining this issue in the round, inclusive of the issue of energy prices that is having such an impact on our people, households and businesses and our economies. As the Deputy will know, we are seeing a significant increase in the wholesale prices in the markets. That is a reality that suppliers, distributors and retailers are having to face.</p>
          <p eId="para_255"> The week before last I was part of a delegation of Ministers who met a number of the key stakeholders operating in the sector in Ireland, including Fuels for Ireland, which is a representative body, and the Irish Petrol Retailers Association. We had a lengthy and good discussion with them about the challenges, how the markets are working and how the prices are feeding their way through from the wholesale level through to the level being paid by the consumer on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_256"> The Deputy mentioned the issue of the ESB. As he will know, the Government is a significant beneficiary of any profits earned by the ESB. In the past ten years, the Government has received €1.2 billion in dividends from the ESB. The ESB is on a green transition which involves major capital investment over the next number of years of the order of €2 billion per annum to be invested to assist us as a country on that journey. The ultimate insurance policy in terms of this issue is our reduced dependence on fossil fuels and our reduced dependence on us being an importer of energy. That is why the Government is excited by the potential of floating offshore wind. Over the next number of years, we will see major initiatives in that regard. We have already passed the enabling legislation, the Maritime Area Planning Act 2021. A new regulatory and licensing regime is now being put in place by the Ministers, Deputies Eamon Ryan and Darragh O'Brien. We look forward to seeing the progress of that over the period ahead. </p>
          <p eId="para_257"> What we are experiencing here as a result of, first, Covid and now, the appalling invasion of Ukraine, is an international market where the normal balance between supply and demand has been completely disrupted. This has resulted in a significant increase in prices that consumers in this country and throughout the world are facing. The Deputy will have heard me say earlier on the record that the rate of inflation in the UK today is 6.2% and in the United States, it is almost 8%. The suggestion that we as a small open trading economy can deal with this issue entirely on our own is just not realistic.</p>

          <p eId="para_258">The point I am making is that collectively, the Irish Government and the European and American governments do have the power. It is a power that was used during the Second World War, whereby profiteering was stopped and the State took control of energy and other vital supplies in order to control prices. Under the current regime, even if we do develop more renewable energy it will not reduce the prices. I will set out some facts. Europe now produces most of its electricity from renewable resources in Europe and most of our gas comes from Corrib in Ireland. Most of our electricity - over 50% - is produced here but because we have given it over to the control of private companies, they charge what they like. They are profiteering and governments in this country and in Europe choose to do nothing about that. They can impose sanctions but, apparently, they cannot control the profiteering of energy companies in this country and in Europe. I suggest they can but they refuse to do so because, it seems, for this Government and for the governments of Europe, profits come before people.</p>

          <p eId="para_259">I believe investing in renewables is the way forward. We have set the target that by 2030, 80% of our electricity generation in Ireland will come from renewables. At the moment, it is 40% plus; it varies day by day depending on the extent to which the wind blows. That is the future for Ireland. The Deputy mentioned that we get all of our gas from the Corrib. We do not.</p>

          <p eId="para_264">At the close of business last night Deputies Conway-Walsh, Calleary and Ring raised the problems in Mayo in regard to the Oweninny wind farm. The reason Deputy Ring is beside me is we are standing in solidarity with the people who have worked on that wind farm installing up to 31 turbines, three or four of which remain to be installed. There are contractors in Mayo who are owed €1.3 million and €1.4 million. Funnily enough, years ago when this country did not have a lot of money some of these contractors were deemed fit to build airports. They were good enough to carry out roadworks throughout the country. Ironically, following the appointment of the receiver, the ESB and Bord na Móna, which have responsibility for this project, have decided to bring in people from the North to finish the job. I refer to two northern companies, one of which has an association with a large corporate here, but the other has none.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">There are companies employing a lot of people in the west of Ireland. Basically, Roadbridge was a name. They had people with suits looking after the job but the work on the ground was being done by what we would call local subcontractors. At least €4 million or €5 million is owed to those subcontractors. It must be borne in mind also that as the ESB is connected to the Government, as is Bord na Móna, we are talking about taxpayers' money.</p>
          <p eId="para_266"> While we talk about the future and the wind energy future, I put it to the Minister that it is disgusting and something is not right in this situation. Those subcontractors who had put in the work, joined together with the Roadbridge workers and the contractors that were supplying everything, including materials and machines, to put in a proposal to the so-called director who was over this wind farm belonging to the ESB. Ironically enough, Deputy Ring and I have been trying to make contact for two weeks, going through the liaison and through the channels we are supposed to go through, to try to contact this person for a meeting. Whoever they think they are, or how high up they think they are, they do not think it is good enough to even come back to us to say that they will have a meeting. A proposal has been made by the group of people who are well fit to do the work. The bottom line is that it was this group that built the 27 turbines that have been built up to now. Those companies will not survive if they lose €1.3 million or €1.4 million on one job. I would like the ESB and Bord na Móna to hear clearly the point that on the bottom of the dockets for the goods and services that were supplied, it says these are owned by those companies until they are paid for. Let ESB and Bord na Móna hear this clearly.</p>
          <p eId="para_267"> Then they insult this group of people by bringing down other contractors to look at finishing the job. There is a retention fund of €4 million to €5 million left. There are solutions to this. I acknowledge the work done by Matthew Lynch in the office of the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, who liaised with us and with the Irish Plant Contractors Association in the past few weeks to help sort out the problems for workers. This is not in my constituency but all of those Deputies and I are very clear: let nobody think that they are going to come from the North and basically turn over companies in the west of Ireland who are well capable of doing the job. The Government must intervene.</p>

          <p eId="para_274">I am referring to the people who have raised it with me, if the Deputy wants me to give a straight answer.</p>
          <p eId="para_275"> I acknowledge the enormous impact the appointment of the receivers has had on the employees. Deputy Fitzmaurice has recognised the work of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the work of the Department of Social Protection, in ensuring that the employees are being looked after in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_276"> Deputy Fitzmaurice raised specifically the knock-on impact on subcontractors. I am aware the clarification was issued by the receiver to Roadbridge staff on Tuesday of last week, following engagement with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The receiver confirmed to employees that there is no statutory restriction on employees taking up additional employment during the statutory redundancy consultation period in circumstances where they are not expected to attend the workplace. Provided they do not resign from their current employment, there should be no obstacle to retaining their statutory redundancy entitlements.</p>
          <p eId="para_277"> As a Government we are examining the range of projects that Roadbridge has been involved in from a public capital works point of view, and in relation to the national development plan. There is, for example, a housing project in Moyross, Limerick. There is a road project from Coonagh to Knockalisheen and Roadbridge had been appointed as the contractors for the N5 Ballaghaderreen to Scramoge road project, where a site compound had been set up and some subcontractors had started to mobilise.</p>
          <p eId="para_278"> I understand that the Oweninny wind farm is a 50:50 joint venture between the ESB and Bord na Móna. Given that receivers have now been appointed, that is now a regulated process which must take its course under the Companies Acts. I have no doubt but that the contractors concerned will obtain their own independent advice but we would, of course, encourage engagement and discussions. We recognise that the appointment of receivers can have seriously adverse effects on contractors, many of whom are operating in an environment of rising costs and quite low margins. We want to see all of these contractors continue in business. The receivership is a statutory process that is regulated by law. The receivers are now in place and must continue with their work over the period ahead. Certainly, as a Government, we would encourage discussions and engagement between all of the relevant parties to see if a resolution could be identified.</p>

          <p eId="para_279">I thank the Minister for what he has said. I acknowledge the work by the Departments of Social Protection, and Enterprise, Trade and Employment. We are moving to phase 2 on this issue and I recognise the point about the receiver process. Is it not ironic, however, that the ESB was able to bring down two Northern contractors to look at finishing the job? The job at the moment is standing, as the Minister will understand, as when someone goes into receivership. Yet they were able to bring two different northern contractors to look at finishing this job while they had people well able to do the job right beside them. There is something amiss in what is going on with this. The receivers seem to be parked to the side. If someone was owed €1.5 million or €1.25 million, should someone from the receiver's office, from the ESB or from Bord na Móna not ring that person? It is the least they could do.</p>
          <p eId="para_280"> The Department of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, covers climate action. We need the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to get involved in resolving this issue. I am making this very clear and Deputy Ring will echo what I am saying.

          <p eId="para_285">As the Deputy is aware, both bodies are commercial State bodies under the remit of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications. The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, will be alerted to the fact that Deputy Fitzmaurice has raised this on the floor of the House today. I am sure the Minister will respond directly to the Deputy in that regard also.</p>
          <p eId="para_286"> Deputy Fitzmaurice has made clear the strength of feeling that there is on the ground about this issue. It is always incredibly difficult when a receivership process is entered into. There can be losers and there can be victims. We hear the Deputy's strong desire to ensure that the local contractors, who have been part of this important local project, are not among those victims. All that I can do is ask, on behalf of the Government, that there be engagement between all of the relevant parties involved here. Our first priority was to ensure that the employees were looked after and that their rights were vindicated, and I believe that the relevant Departments of worked together in that regard. We are also concerned, of course, about the outcome in all of this for the subcontractors concerned. I hope that their needs and their situation will be taken into account, albeit recognising that this is a statutory process now that is governed by law.</p>

          <p eId="para_287">The British Government is pushing forward with the requirement for EU citizens who are not Irish or British to apply for travel clearance if they want to travel North to South or <i>vice versa</i>. This is a disgraceful situation. It undermines the Good Friday Agreement and the common travel area. It creates significant restrictions on freedom across our island. I do not know whether the Minister believes that it is acceptable but I find it wholly unacceptable that, for example, a Polish person who lives and works in Lifford, County Donegal would need papers to travel to Strabane, or from Emyvale to Aughnacloy. The Minister knows this is the reality for many people who live in our Border region.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">It will be absolutely devastating for the tourism sector. All of us know that when visitors come, from the United States of America, for example, they travel right across the island. Should President Biden pay a visit to Ireland, we could be faced with the bizarre situation whereby he and his party are required to register for permission to travel across the island. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, has been in touch with Boris Johnson on this but the Taoiseach needs to intervene strongly with Boris Johnson to call this out. We need to mobilise diplomatically across the world to put a halt to this disgraceful action.</p>

          <p eId="para_289">The Government stands foursquare behind the common travel area and the open Border in all respects. We do not in any way support or endorse the decision that was taken in the House of Commons. We have serious concerns about the proposal for an electronic travel authorisation system. We do not believe it is either practical or fair to seek to distinguish between EU citizens from other member states and Irish citizens going across the Border. There is a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference later today and the issue will again be raised directly with the British Government. I assure the Deputy that we will be taking this up with the British Government at the highest level because we do not support this and we do not believe it is acceptable.</p>

          <p eId="para_290">Questions have been repeatedly raised in this House about the expulsion of the Russian ambassador and the large size of the Russian Embassy staff here, which numbers more than 30. Today, the Polish intelligence services have asked their foreign ministry to consider expelling 45 Russian diplomats, some of whom have allegedly been working for Moscow's secret services under the cover of diplomatic work. Last week, the Baltic nations expelled ten Russian diplomats, declaring them <i>personae non gratae</i>. Lithuania expelled four and Latvia and Estonia expelled three each. Bulgaria has expelled ten diplomats and the Slovakian ambassador told the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs this morning that his Government has also expelled staff from the Russian Embassy there. With Russia continuing to commit war crimes and atrocities, the original view was that we had to act in consort. It looks now like we will be at the end of the queue of nations taking action. Is it the Government's intention to take action against the Russian staff in the embassy here?</p>

Ideally, that should be done in a co-ordinated manner. This issue may well be discussed at the European Council meeting over the next couple of days. We have previously expressed our concern at the extent of the diplomatic presence in the Russian Embassy in Dublin.

          <p eId="para_293">We are concerned about the significant increase in the incidence of Covid in the last couple of weeks. It is a reminder to all of us that Covid is still very much around. Personally, I have not known more people with Covid at any point in the last two years than at this point in time. We all need to reflect on the current situation and ensure we do all we can individually to reduce the risk of transmission. The Government is acting in line with the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee, NIAC, when it comes to the roll-out of additional doses of the vaccine, the fourth dose in particular for those who are immunocompromised and we await NIAC advice for other cohorts.</p>

          <p eId="para_294">Yesterday, we were told, "It is a matter for the Business Committee" and that we should use our Private Members' time. Three times yesterday the question of the new national maternity hospital and the intentions of the Government were raised and these were the answers given. We were told it was a matter for the Business Committee to decide if we have a discussion on it, or that we should use our Private Members' time. Private Members' time has been used to discuss the new national maternity hospital and I disagree completely that it is just a matter for the Business Committee. We complain all the time that there are not enough women involved in politics. Here is a political issue that involves all women and girls, that is, the future of the new national maternity hospital, and we cannot get a proper debate on it or full information on what the Government intends to do. Does it intend to do the unthinkable and hand over the control of a national maternity hospital that will cost the State and the taxpayer at least €1 billion to the religious Sisters of Charity and a private company under St. Vincent's Holdings? We need answers to these questions. This is hugely important and involves half the population. It does not necessarily involve the men in suits who are negotiating it but it does involve the women and girls concerned.</p>

There are lots of opportunities in the House, including oral questions to the Minister for Health, which I understand are taking place next week. The House has already decided on the business for this week but there are many avenues open to the Deputy to continue to raise the issue The substantive point is that what the Deputy is inferring or suggesting is not Government policy and is not what is going to happen.</p>

It is one of the reasons our troops are the most poorly paid public servants in the country. The Commission on the Defence Forces reported in January and has recommended to the Government that associate membership of ICTU be provided to both PDFORRA and RACO. I am mindful that the next round of national wage talks will begin in May. Has the Government taken any decisions on this regard? If not, are we likely to get a decision before these wage talks commence in a few months?</p>

          <p eId="para_299">I ask the Minister to do something meaningful. He said the Government was doing a lot for the cost of oil. I am asking the Government to abolish the carbon tax on agricultural diesel for farm contractors, forestry contractors and farmers. Otherwise, we will not have a harvest and we will not have silage. The Minister's colleague beside him, the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, knows about this intimately. I ask that this be done for a period of five years at least. This is a wartime situation, as the Minister referred to himself, but this was coming down the tracks anyway ever before that. I also ask the Government to ring-fence over 200 million litres of agricultural diesel for the harvesting of silage, corn and all the crops it is talking about planting. We also need it for ordinary farm work and forestry work that has to be carried out because we have a shortage of timber already. Are we going to have a shortage of everything? If this is not managed properly, there will be chaos. I am asking for a period of five years. Tell the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to cop onto himself because this is a wartime situation. His little dreams and plans are not working. They are crippling farmers and contractors and we have to deal with this meaningfully.</p>

          <p eId="para_305">I have two questions for the Minister. The former Senator Feargal Quinn brought legislation to the Seanad a number of years ago on subcontractors. Has the Government any proposals to bring that Bill to the Dáil in order to protect subcontractors? Major contracts now have to be given to major companies with major turnover, so all the small contractors have been left out and cannot apply for these big jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">The Minister has seen what happens when there are big contractors like Roadbridge involved. Almost €11 million is owed to people in Mayo, including small family businesses. When these companies set up operations, we expected that they would create jobs, not take them away from County Mayo. My heart goes out to these families. They have worked for 40 years to build up their businesses and a major multinational like this came in and took their business away from them. I want to put that on the record of the Dáil and give a warning to Dublin, British and Northern Ireland companies to think about Shell to Sea. If these people are not paid they will not be operating in north Mayo or in any other part of the county.</p>

The Construction Contracts Act 2013 does not cut across the normal rules for company liquidation or receivership. Where this arises, the route for recovery is through the normal insolvency process. In respect of any public works, there is an open and competitive procurement requirement, both domestically and under EU law. It is best not to go into the specifics of the individual case.

Hopefully this will be a good year. There are many pressures on them, particularly those relating to inflation and staffing shortages. The return of the higher rate of VAT is looming in the distance. In the context of the inflationary situation we are in and the difficulties the industry faces, can we make an early decision on keeping the 9% rate of VAT beyond September? It would add fuel to the inflationary fire if we revert to the 13.5% rate in September.</p>

          <p eId="para_319">I also wish to raise the extremely serious situation with Roadbridge. What is happening will have massive consequences for jobs and the future of many subcontractors and suppliers across the country. I call on the Government to step in and provide support to subcontractors caught up in the wreckage of a major company collapse. There are particular concerns with regard to the impact on the many Mayo-based subcontractors and suppliers that are worried about their futures. I am specifically talking about engineering firms, road firms and construction quarry firms, many of which are based in the west of Ireland. Bonds and insurance policies that are in place on these projects should be used to pay subcontractors and suppliers. In order to protect the taxpayer, there is also an urgent need to ensure the delivery of publicly financed projects to benefit Mayo, including the N5 Scramoge to Ballaghaderreen road project and the Oweninny wind project. I call on the Minister to provide clarity on the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_320">As I mentioned earlier, while the Construction Contracts Act 2013 is not directly relevant in the case of liquidation or receivership, it imposes minimum payment requirements and provides the necessary tools to enforce those payments between the main contractor and the subcontractors and so on down the supply chain. We are carrying out an assessment of all of the public works contracts that Roadbridge was a party to. The Government remains committed to those road projects and to other non-road projects and will ensure that arrangements are put in place in order that they can be reinstated and completed in due course.</p>

          <p eId="para_321">I welcome the €100 emergency support payment that has been announced for licensed hauliers. It is a help and it will go some small way towards assisting hauliers. Those transporting livestock are exempt from having haulage licences. They should be included in the scheme. Since this payment was announced, a number of bus operators in Roscommon and Galway have been in touch to seek similar support. A recent survey by the Coach Tourism and Transport Council of Ireland found that 95% of all school transport bus operators have said they will not be commercially viable to make it to June without Government support. Will the Government look at including bus operators in the context of the €100 payment that has been announced?</p>

The Deputy mentioned bus operators and along with them taxi drivers and other groups across society are also being directly impacted. The measure the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, brought forward was specific to hauliers because of the vital role they play in our economy and in ensuring we can continue to trade and provide goods throughout the supply chain. I will ask the Minister to examine the issue the Deputy has raised about other groups.</p>

This is great news for special education provision in Cork in the Minister’s constituency and in my constituency, respectively.

          <p eId="para_325">On foot of the actions of the British Government at Westminster, we could be looking at an unworkable hard border for those who are not British or Irish. That could include Polish people living in my town of Dundalk who want to travel to Newry because they would have to fill out electronic travel authorisations. While this says a great deal about the nonsense about security uttered by the British Government following our response to the Ukrainian crisis, it says more about the politics of Brexit and racism and where matters in Britain stand. That is a matter for another day. We need the Irish Government and our international partners to stand firm and say that this is not acceptable. We cannot rely on the likes of Ireland’s Future, which is holding another public event in Dundalk, to prepare for a new Ireland. We need the State to stand up and we need a citizens’ assembly or a much-expanded shared island dialogue because we need action to be taken. Irish unity is the only way to go in respect of this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_332">As we know, people around Ireland have shown a huge amount of empathy and generosity when it comes to embracing and supporting the Ukrainians fleeing from Russia's war. More than 20,000 offers of accommodation have already been made through the Irish Red Cross. I understand that 4,000 of those are for own-door facilities. I have received many questions from people who are eager to help. They have already pledged rooms and are wondering what the next steps are. I have also had offers of employment from businesses and free crèche places from childcare providers. They are wondering what is the best way to channel their offers of assistance. It is important that we match up, as quickly as possible, the offers of help, support, and accommodation to the families and individuals travelling here who desperately need that support.</p>

          <p eId="para_333">I agree that the response of the Irish people has been remarkable, although it comes as no surprise to anyone in this House. Work is under way to contact those who made offers of accommodation through the portal, with an initial focus on the vacant properties where own-door accommodation can be provided. The welfare issues that arise in that circumstance are less than where someone has to share a home with somebody else. That issue is being progressed as we speak. We are open to any other offers of support or assistance, be they made directly to the Red Cross or to the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_334">We are very grateful in this House for the efforts of our front-line healthcare workers during the pandemic. They put themselves in danger and went above and beyond what was expected. The Government recently agreed to pay a €1,000 bonus to front-line workers in recognition of their extraordinary efforts. However, following recent media reports about the payment structure being considered, many part-time nurses have been in contact with me. They are worried that the proposed payment structure will see their bonus reduced to just €200. Everyone across the House recognises the need to be prudent with public money, but there is also a need to be fair and do right by people. Will the Minister engage with his colleagues and ask that a generous approach be taken, one that recognises the sacrifice made by all front-line healthcare workers, whether full-time or part-time?</p>

There was a meeting on Monday this week involving the health sector trade union group as well as the HSE and the Department of Health. A number of issues were discussed there, some of which the Deputy touched on. There will be a further meeting today. We are very anxious to bring this to finality. It was always going to be difficult when one gets into the nitty-gritty detail of the matter. The principle is very good. It is about giving recognition to people who were on the front line and went above and beyond the call of duty. Those knotty issues of detail need to be resolved and I know the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, is keen to proceed as quickly as possible. Hopefully, there will be further progress at today's meeting.</p>

There is more and more work but payments have not been forthcoming. Also, an interdepartmental group was set up one year ago to examine the feasibility of directing more Government business to the post office network. It is urgent that its report is published in order to ensure the viability of the post office network and decent incomes for postmasters. Will the Minister say when that report will be published?</p>

As the Minister can imagine, this has caused extreme concern in the large rural hinterland served by this branch office. This is an area largely not serviced by public transport. If the Department's services were to be located elsewhere, it would case a lot of hardship. Will the Minister give an undertaking that this branch office will be kept open and that the full range of Department of Social Protection services currently on offer will continue to be provided? I have written to the Minister for Social Protection on this matter. It would be greatly appreciated if assurances could be given to the local communities and the employees involved. We should not continue to keep taking the heart out of rural Ireland and its people by closing branch offices such as this.</p>

I want to know whether the bonds can be used. I also want to ask the Minister about the wider situation and what the Government is doing to measure the extent of the problem of construction inflation across the State.

Late last year, we introduced some changes and additional flexibilities to take account of the fact that many contractors are facing increased costs.

          <from>Deputy Jennifer Murnane O'Connor<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T13:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_350">I am delighted to join my colleague, Deputy Ó Cuív, in bringing forward this Bill in the House today. It is an important Bill for the thousands of householders excluded from support for the maintenance and repair of their septic tanks because they did not register their septic tanks by a prescribed date.</p>
          <p eId="para_351"> A registration and inspection scheme was introduced in 2012 for domestic wastewater treatment systems such as septic tanks. A homeowner with a septic tank or similar system must have registered its details with his or her local authority and paid a registration fee by 1 February 2013. Anyone who registered after that deadline is now discovering that he or she is not eligible for any grant if the system is found to need remedial work. One man contacted me recently and said he was facing such an enormous bill for the upgrade of his tank that he had to sell his car. This was a grown man who had to sell his car.</p>
          <p eId="para_352"> Homeowners who need to upgrade their septic tanks are no longer means tested in high-status water body areas, and there is no grace period for those who may have inadvertently missed the registration deadline to allow them to apply for the grant, means tested or otherwise. The current grant level covers between 50% to 80% and is calculated according to a person's income. That is for repairs and to do the work that needs to be done through the local authority. Local authorities inspect septic tanks roughly every year but half of those inspected fail. These figures of failed inspections come from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA. That is really worrying.</p>
          <p eId="para_353"> In addition to agriculture, poorly functioning septic tanks have been found to be the main pressure on water quality. They were considered to be the only cause of water pollution in 40 areas. This is not, therefore, only one house, one problem. It can impact the whole community. It is a disaster, if I am honest.</p>
          <p eId="para_354"> I hope the Minister will support this Bill to provide for the ongoing registration of domestic wastewater systems and eliminate the requirements to register by a prescribed date in order to enable all households to register their domestic wastewater system and find support, should they need it, for the remedial work. It is important this Bill is passed. A number of people have contacted me who did not register and do not qualify for the grant. I ask that everybody in the House supports this Bill on which I am delighted to have worked with Deputy Ó Cuív.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_361">Go gceadófar go dtabharfar isteach Bille dá ngairtear Acht chun an Bunreacht a leasú.</p>
          <p eId="para_362"> I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_363">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">I thank Ms Diana O'Dwyer and Mr. Des Hennelly in People Before Profit for their work on the Bill as well as the Bills Office. This is a Bill which, if passed, would mean we would have a referendum to enshrine neutrality in the Constitution. That is defined as Ireland being a neutral State that will not join many military alliances. It states that Ireland could only participate in armed conflict in circumstance where it is under attack or invasion and with the vote of a Dáil. It states very clearly that the Government could not join wars or get the country to join wars as part of an EU decision. If it wanted to do that, it would need another referendum.</p>
          <p eId="para_365"> There is obviously a context to this Bill, which is the significant propaganda war on neutrality being waged by members of the establishment, political parties, very senior members of the Government, various media commentators, academics and so on. I will read some quotes from the last couple of weeks. The Tánaiste said that we "need to think about greater involvement in European defence." The Taoiseach said, "Neutrality is a policy issue that can change at any time." The Minister for Foreign Affairs two days ago said that Ireland will participate in the EU rapid reaction force involving 5,000 troops, raising a question mark over the triple lock.</p>
          <p eId="para_366"> I will be clear. This attempt to completely undermine neutrality, which the Irish establishment sees as a shackle on its ability to get involved in US-led imperialist adventures, is not new. This is not as a consequence of Putin's horrendous invasion of Ukraine. The Government is simply using that.</p>
          <p eId="para_367"> Fine Gael in 2003 was very openly calling to get rid of neutrality altogether. What is happening here is a rebranding of NATO - the US-led military alliance - as some sort of peace force, as if it was the natural neutral teacher on the playground stopping the bullies. Tell that to the ordinary people of Afghanistan who had their country invaded and occupied by NATO for years. Who gave NATO or the US the right to consider themselves the world police? Tell that to the people of Iraq, more than 1 million of whom died as part of the US invasion and suffered at the hands of NATO members.</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> We are asking that this to be put to the people. Let us have a debate about it instead of the Government continuing to simply undermine and erode neutrality.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_133">
          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T13:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_369">We believe the time is right and appropriate to have a referendum to let the people of this country make a decision, which is what this Bill is doing. We want to put our traditional military neutrality, which this and successive Governments have tried to undermine, into the Constitution so it is absolutely guaranteed and secured, and to stop the very concerted push by successive Governments to align us with the NATO military alliance dominated by major imperial powers, namely, the United States, the UK, France, Germany and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_370"> They are powers that have led barbaric conflicts, most obviously in Iraq in 2003, which claimed the lives of 1 million people. In Afghanistan, tens of thousands of people were killed. The leading powers of NATO continue to arm Saudi Arabia in an EU-UK supported war in Yemen that has claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and brought 14 million people to the brink of starvation.</p>
          <p eId="para_371"> These powers dominate NATO and we should have absolutely nothing to do with them, especially in the face of Putin's brutal imperialistic war. If we are rightly horrified by an imperialist war being waged by Putin, with devastating consequences for the people of Europe and Ukraine, then, surely, we must take a lesson from that.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">We have to stand against all warmongering, all imperialism and all military alliances that are about controlling other people’s lands and resources, shoring up spheres of influence and spending billions on weapons to kill people. Surely this is the most important time to reassert our neutrality. That does not mean being indifferent. It means remembering where James Connolly and the people who helped found this State stood when they fought to establish this State against the brutality of the British Empire and the brutality of the First World War. We should uphold that tradition. This Bill seeks to ensure that we do that by inserting it into the Constitution.</p>

        <heading>European Arrest Warrant (Amendment) Bill 2022: Second Stage<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T14:20:00+00:00"/></heading>
        <speech by="#JamesBrowne" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice" eId="spk_138">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Deputy James Browne)<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T14:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_378">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_379">I am pleased to introduce the European Arrest Warrant (Amendment) Bill 2022 to the House. This Bill aims to address certain issues that have been identified by the European Commission with our existing legislation in this area in formal EU infringement proceedings. Timely enactment of the Bill will ensure that Ireland is not referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union, CJEU, and will not become liable for financial penalties. Second, this Bill also makes a number further amendments to European Arrest Warrant Act 2003 to ensure there is a continued efficient operation of European arrest warrant system within the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_380"> By way of background, any European Union country may use European arrest warrant systems to seek the return of a person who is wanted in that country in relation to a crime. The warrant may seek the return of the person to stand trial, to face sentencing after a conviction or to serve a sentence that has already been handed down by a court in that country. The original European Arrest Warrant Act 2003 transposed the European Union Council framework decision 2002/584/JHA and came into effect on 1 January 2004. It replaced the previous extradition process between EU member states with a much faster and more simplified system which has been successful and which is regarded as a vital tool in the fight against crime right across the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_381"> The 2019 report by the Irish central authority for the operation of the European arrest warrant, which was published by my Department only last year, noted that the arrest warrants received and issued during 2019 cited a wide range of offences. Among the principal offences that were cited were murder, grievous previous bodily harm, sexual offences, including the rape and sexual abuse of children, drug offences, robbery, assault, fraud and human trafficking. This shows the full scope of serious offences which can be subject to more effective criminal law enforcement as a result of the arrest warrant system. Some 109 orders for surrender were executed by the State in 2019, which involved 94 individuals. In addition, 51 individuals who were subject to the Irish-European arrest warrants were surrendered to the State in 2019.</p>
          <p eId="para_382"> I will briefly mention some of the main provisions of the Bill. Section 4 amends section 10 of the 2003 Act, which sets down the general provisions of the obligation to surrender persons on foot of an arrest warrant. The aim is to reflect as unambiguously as possible the requirement that a person will be arrested and surrendered by the State to the state that sent the arrest warrant, known as the "issuing state", where a private or criminal prosecution will be or is being brought against the person concerned. </p>
          <p eId="para_383"> Section 4 has been drawn up in parallel with section 26A of the Bill, which provides for the repeal of section 21A of the 2003 Act. The latter provision currently requires the High Court to refuse a surrender request where a decision has not been made to charge the person with, and try him or her for, an offence. The Commission's view is that the current section 21A represents an additional mandatory ground for non-execution of a warrant that is not provided in EU law. On legal advice, it is proposed to accept this approach and thus delete section 21A.</p>
          <p eId="para_384"> I am advised that the State will still be able to rely on section 10 of the 2003 Act to provide a similar safeguard, as the language used has a clear legal basis in article 1 of the framework decision, which provides that a European arrest warrant is issued with "a view to the arrest and surrender ... of a requested person, for the purposes of conducting a criminal prosecution or executing a custodial sentence or detention order".</p>
          <p eId="para_385"> Section 7(a) amends section 14(5) of the 2003 Act by providing that there is certainty with regard to the full release of individuals who are on bail where an arrest warrant is not produced in court on the required date. Section 7(b) provides that any such release does not prejudice any potential re-arrest and surrender and provides that a standard notice is to be added to the Schengen information system to reflect the fact that the release has taken place. The Schengen information system is the European Union-wide system for security and border management, which is administered in Ireland by An Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_386"> Section 8 inserts a new section 14A into the 2003 Act, providing for the temporary transfer of the person who is the subject of an arrest warrant to the issuing state under conditions agreed by the High Court and a judicial authority in the issuing state. Subsections (4) to (6), inclusive, provide for an alternative to the temporary transfer where the person who is subject to an arrest warrant can be heard by a court in the State on the basis of a request made by the issuing state. Deputies may wish to note that my Department is currently in contact with the European Commission to confirm the exact nature of the legal changes required for this section. It is likely to be the subject of an amendment on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_387"> The purpose of sections 9 and 10 is to align the timelines in the 2003 Act for the making of the High Court decision on the arrest warrant and the surrender of the requested person with the relevant provisions within the EU framework decision. The effect of the changes is that there will be a need for more expeditious processing of arrest warrant cases in this jurisdiction based on the requirements of the EU framework decision. A consequential amendment is made in section 11, providing that failure to adhere to the revised timelines for processing an arrest warrant for any reason does not constitute a ground to refuse to surrender a person and does not preclude the continued detention of the person under 2003 Act. This reflects the case of European Court of Justice, which requires that the deciding court must always retain the capacity to process arrest warrant cases to finality. Section 15 relates to the operation of the rule of specialty in section 22 of the 2003 Act. This rule is codified in international extradition treaties. It states that an extradited person should not be proceeded against, sentenced, detained or re-extradited in a requesting state for any offence committed before surrender, other than the offence for which extradition was granted. At present, section 22 provides that this rule may be waived by the High Court where certain criteria are met. Section 15 provides that the High Court shall waive rule of specialty where the criteria are met. This section also provides a time limit for the High Court's decision in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_388"> Section 16 amends section 23 of the 2003 Act, which provides for the surrender of an individual by the issuing state to another member state in certain circumstances. Section 16 introduces an obligation and a timeline for the High Court in giving its consent to a request for surrender from the issuing state to another member state where certain requirements are met, such as where the person consents to the surrender. At present, the High Court has the discretion to give such a consent and there is no time limit for its decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_389"> Section 21 amends section 39 of the 2003 Act, which deals with the prohibition on surrender on foot of an arrest warrant, due to the person being immune from prosecution or punishment due to any amnesty or pardon. The amendment consolidates the existing provision into one paragraph, dealing with all forms of legal amnesty or pardon. In addition, the amendment clarifies that the State must have jurisdiction to prosecute the offence concerned if a person is not to be surrendered due to amnesty or pardon.</p>
          <p eId="para_390"> Section 22 amends section 41 of the 2003 Act, which deals with the concept of double jeopardy. Section 41 of the 2003 Act currently provides that a person cannot be surrendered for the purposes of being proceeded against in an issuing state where final judgment has already been given in the state, another member state or a third country for the same offence. Section 22 amends this to state that any sentence of imprisonment or detention already imposed in the state, a member or third country must have been served or no longer applied to the person for this provision to apply, as required by the EU framework decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_391"> Section 24 amends section 45 in 2003 Act changing from mandatory to discretionary the power of the High Court to refuse to order the surrender of the person where he or she did not appear to the proceedings giving rise to the arrest warrant. This section also provides that the High Court shall arrange for the issuing state to be informed of any request from a person for a copy of the judgment, which was the basis for the arrest warrant. </p>
          <p eId="para_392"> Section 25 amends section 46 of the 2003 Act, which currently prohibits surrender of a person who has immunity from prosecution as a result of holding any office or other position under the law of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">This is qualified to state that the prohibition on surrender applies while the person holds that office. Provision is also made for the High Court to request the waiver of such privilege in certain circumstances and for consequential changes to the time limits for arrest warrants.</p>
          <p eId="para_394"> Section 26 will provide for repeals, including the proposed repeal of section 37(1)(<i>b</i>) of the 2003 Act. At present, that section provides that a person shall not be surrendered if doing so would be incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, would contravene any provision of the Constitution or would be otherwise discriminatory or against human rights. It is proposed to repeal section 37(1)(<i>b</i>), deleting the reference to a contravention of the Constitution, as this is not provided for in the framework decision. I am advised this is required by the EU framework decision and that, given the remaining references, it will still ensure there is no overall change in the level of human rights protection provided by the section.</p>
          <p eId="para_395"> I look forward to the debate on the Bill, which will underpin a more efficient system for the European arrest warrant in Ireland, a system that is central to the fight against crime. I am pleased to commend it to the House and I look forward to working constructively with Deputies as it is progressed.</p>

        <speech by="#MartinKenny" eId="spk_139">
          <from>Deputy Martin Kenny<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T14:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_396">I am sharing time with Deputies Ó Laoghaire and Ó Murchú.</p>
          <p eId="para_397"> We welcome this legislation. Its introduction is timely, given it will transpose into Irish law an EU directive that has been around for some time. The EU in 2020 initiated infringement proceedings regarding the delay and it is unfortunate that we again find ourselves in this position. Another item of legislation from the EU has been around for a long time and it is only when the European Commission presses hard and takes infringement proceedings against the Government that it moves forward, and that is regrettable.</p>
          <p eId="para_398"> Nevertheless, we all recognise we live in a very interdependent world, and certainly an interdependent European Union, in which we have to try to work together. The free movement across borders, in particular, means there has to be a system in place whereby people who have acted criminally in any jurisdiction can be held to account. That is important. The Minister of State referred to the serious types of offences many of these people are involved in, relating to human trafficking, rape and sexual abuse, violence and even murder. All those crimes are very serious and we have to ensure they are dealt with appropriately in the states in which they have occurred.</p>
          <p eId="para_399"> Ireland is now the last country in the EU that works under the common law system. Since Britain left the European Union, we are the only ones who have that type of adversarial system, whereas all the other countries work under another type of system. That causes difficulties and problems and we need to acknowledge that and consider it when we examine these types of legislation. I have come across many incidents, some of which members of An Garda Síochána have spoken to me about, where persons have been the subject of European arrest warrants and the arrest warrants have sat on the shelf for years before anyone knew they existed. Sometimes it is only when a person falls foul of the law here that it is discovered a European arrest warrant has issued and has been sitting on the shelf for a long time. There are issues relating to the efficiency within this State in regard to ensuring those warrants are served properly and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_400"> The Minister of State mentioned that under section 8, a person subject to an arrest warrant can be heard by a court in this State on the basis a request has been made by the issuing state. There was an example a number of years ago of a person who was subject to a European arrest warrant from Poland. The offence was a minor one and the person had been sentenced to less than six months in prison. The person had moved here and lived here a long time, had married and settled, had a family, a job and a life and was getting on with it and all of a sudden this came up against them. It was something from their past that had no relation to the life they were then living. Even the judge in the court at the time expressed his regret that he had no option but to send the person back to Poland to serve this minor sentence for a minor offence in the country they had come from. We will table amendments such that either a person in those circumstances could serve the sentence here or there could be some alternative method of dealing with such people where it is clearly a minor offence that has happened in the distant past, and where the person has clearly moved away from any criminal behaviour since then and has been a good and exemplary citizen in this State. There needs to be a way of examining that and recognising the circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_401"> Another issue that has been mentioned relates to the timelines for processing arrest warrants. We have to understand this can be a difficult issue. The system that exists in many European countries is such that the court not only decides the fate of the person but also acts as the investigator of the crime, which is entirely different from the process we have here. I might be going off on a tangent, but I sometimes think an element of that could be useful in this jurisdiction. There have been various tribunals and incidents where, in respect of the investigative processes used by An Garda Síochána, there were difficulties with the outcomes and where we now have problems with that. I often wonder whether there should be some kind of a judicial overview of that or some person independent of An Garda Síochána, who could ensure everything had been done correctly and followed through on. Certainly in regard to serious cases, that idea has merit and is something we should think about. While there would be an additional cost at the outset to put that type of system in place, and having some kind of judicial overview would cost the State more money initially, it would no doubt relieve the current situation whereby there are so many miscarriages of justice and so many other problems that come back to bite us in the long run because the State ends up paying compensation to people who have been badly treated by the State in that context. There are issues we need to consider in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_402"> We spoke earlier about the people coming from Ukraine, and a motion was tabled by the Social Democrats in respect of requests by some very unscrupulous individuals to seek sex in exchange for providing accommodation. The issue of human trafficking and the horrible instances thereof constitute an international organised criminal enterprise and we need to have a firm way of dealing with it. I mentioned earlier the people in University College Dublin who are carrying out research on the issue. They have told me that many of the women who are involved in this so-called sex trade move around to different countries. They might spend two or three weeks in Ireland, one week in Paris, another week in Amsterdam, a further week in Rome or some other city in Europe, and then they will be allowed to return to their home country, which is usually in eastern Europe, to spend a couple of weeks' holiday with their family and to bring back money with them, before they go back onto the same route once again. That demonstrated to me that very serious international crime gangs are involved in that type of activity. We need to find an effective way of dealing with that. I am not sure whether Ireland has the strongest legislation for dealing with that; perhaps other jurisdictions do. If certain jurisdictions have better legislation or better means of dealing with it, we need to work co-operatively with them to ensure we can bring that type of activity to an end.</p>
          <p eId="para_403"> European arrest warrants are just one element of all this. While we want the legislation to be progressed speedily and we want to ensure it will be done properly, with no loopholes or other ways in which people can get around it, we also need to have a system that is fair. Some jurisdictions can have quite unusual results following criminal investigations, whereby people may receive serious sentences for what we would consider to be minor offences, and we need to be conscious of that in a judicial context.</p>
          <p eId="para_404"> In general, this legislation, while long overdue, is welcome. I encourage the Minister of State to progress it as quickly as possible. We will consider some amendments and he indicated that some may be tabled by the Government too. That is all part of the process we need to go through to ensure we will develop strong and effective legislation to deal with international criminal gangs and to ensure it will deliver for the public and the greater good.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DonnchadhOLaoghaire" eId="spk_140">
          <from>Deputy Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T14:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_405">This is a Bill that my party is in agreement with. The European arrest warrant is an important structure in terms of co-operation across jurisdictions in the EU. It is vitally important that there is strong co-operation to ensure that criminals are not able to use borders to escape justice and to frustrate justice and the forces of law. As Deputy Martin Kenny outlined, there are a number of areas that we might try to address.</p>
          <p eId="para_406"> In general terms, and while it does not specifically fall under the European arrest warrant, I note that the European arrest warrant creates an exception to the fulfilment of the arrest warrant where that prosecution is being taken on the basis of the person's gender, sexual identity, race, political opinion or other factors. While the Russian Federation operates outside the EU - it is not a member state - in principle that exception exists to protect people against political prosecutions. It is important that we as a society protect Russian people who have bravely spoken out against Putin and his completely inhumane actions in Ukraine. I am thinking, in particular, of the brave Russian news broadcaster who spoke out against the war two weeks ago. We will, I am sure, see this scenario arising in the context of Russian protesters in the coming weeks. We are conscious of the need to protect those coming from Ukraine and from the conflict but we should also be conscious of providing refuge to those Russians who are facing persecution because of their opposition to the Russian Government. That is an appropriate ground for asylum as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_407"> The other point I will make regarding that general area is that it is vitally important that, regardless of their ethnicity, gender or gender orientation, all coming from Ukraine fleeing conflict are received safely. Unfortunately, there have been reports of mistreatment of people at the Ukrainian-Polish border because of their race. That is something that needs to be addressed. It is vitally important the State ensures that everyone who arrives here is protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_408"> The European arrest warrant process is grounded on the assumption that all EU member states have a minimum standard in terms of the rule of law. It is grounded on the basis that we expect a minimum standard from jurisdictions. That is a reasonable expectation. The outcome that the European arrest warrant sees is an admirable and appropriate one but the <i>quid pro quo</i> is that we ensure that every jurisdiction does indeed have adequate respect for the rule of law and adequate independence in terms of its judiciary etc. Unfortunately, there are issues, the Minister of State will be aware of them, and some concerns have been raised regarding the application of the rule of law by some member states, in particular Poland. While the European arrest warrant needs to continue to operate and we need to be in a position to co-operate with other jurisdictions, it is vitally important that the Irish Government continues to raise those concerns with those jurisdictions that have undermined the rule of law. If we are to continue with the extradition and with the surrendering under the European arrest warrant, we have to be entitled to assume that there will be a fair trial. It is vitally important that where a member state is breaking from that basic norm, it is challenged in relation to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_409"> There are also areas where there is a need for greater co-operation across Europe. The Hague Convention is one example. The convention exists but I have come across instances where it can be challenging. This particular Hague Convention is in respect of family law and ensuring that there is co-operation across jurisdictions where there is family breakdown and there are disputes in that regard. I have come across instances where one parent or the other has departed either from Ireland or from another member state and gone to another country without making the other person aware and the dispute that ensues in relation to that. There are processes to resolve this but it can be challenging to ensure co-operation from the corresponding court in another jurisdiction. That is something in which there is room for improvement.</p>
          <p eId="para_410"> It is also vitally important that we have substantial co-operation in relation to the area of sex trafficking and sexual offences. I want to raise again a point that has been raised in the past that there is not a unified sex offenders register across the EU. There is some sharing of information but there is not a unified sex offenders register. That would be something that merits serious consideration. If we are to have co-operation on this basis in terms of arrest and so on, it is also important that member states trust one another in terms of the information that should rightly be provided about people who may be a risk as they travel to ensure that the authorities, in Ireland or in any other country, are in a position to monitor those people. It is vitally important that we have co-operation in those areas as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_411"> European co-operation on issues of justice is vitally important. It is something that my party very much supports but there certainly are areas that require tightening up and additional co-operation, as well as the safeguards to ensure that minimum standard that needs to exist across every jurisdiction.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T14:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_412">I will add my voice to those of my colleagues who have spoken in support of the European arrest warrant and the necessity for it. We have all said on many occasions here previously we need whatever tools are necessary for dealing with the wide level of international criminality at this point in time.</p>
          <p eId="para_413"> The Minister of State and I have spoken about drug gangs many times. Obviously, at this point in time the Minister of State is thinking about human traffickers and many others way beyond that. In dealing with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we are also dealing with what is a criminal state with a number of criminal subcontractors or oligarchs who sometimes put their business-criminal resources at the benefit of the Kremlin. There will be interesting research in the next while as to what exactly happened in the Brexit vote and from where some of the funny money, for want of a better term, came. That is why it is difficult at present, particularly coming from where I do, to listen to the outworkings of what could be this Nationality and Borders Bill in the UK and how we could be looking at a British Government imposing an unworkable hard border for non-Irish and non-British people on the island of Ireland. This is utterly unacceptable and needs to be dealt with. Not only do we need to ensure, together with our international partners, that this is fought tooth and nail but we need to look at whether there are any legal mechanisms. Not only is it abhorrent, it is ridiculous. It would not be the first time that a British Government instigated an action that was in breach of international law.</p>
          <p eId="para_414"> Deputy Kenny brought up some issues and when one is talking about a European arrest warrant, it needs to be enacted within this State in a timely fashion. It does not make sense that the forces of law and order would lie on something for a particular period. I accept there may be difficulties from time to time in apprehending someone - people understand that - but justice has to be swift. We need that to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_415"> Also, in some of these scenarios, one is talking about a four-month custodial sentence. That is not necessarily what one would consider a serious crime. It depends. As Deputy Ó Laoghaire stated, we do not necessarily have an equality of law and order throughout even the European Union. We all have spoken here many times previously on the rule of law issues, particularly in Poland and Hungary. While we are in a different place now and those countries are involved in dealing with a significant humanitarian catastrophe, the fact is that if we are talking about the future of the European Union and about a Union that wants to open itself up and that Ukraine and others are looking to join, it must be a European Union that is about justice, rights and equality. Therefore, the law, European arrest warrants and everything else must fit within that framework. It is absolutely necessary. That is the sort of Europe that we want and which is completely anathema to what we are seeing coming from Russia at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">There is a significant piece of work to be done regarding due diligence on some of the subfactors within this legislation. That must be done as soon as possible. Beyond that, it is a necessary piece of work. We are constantly trying to catch up with two things, namely, transposing EU directives and laws and from a legalistic or cyberworld point of view in terms of where international criminality is at and ensuring that we have all the tools that are necessary to address it. Within that framework, we must also look at the weaknesses that exist in social media, especially in the likes of Facebook. We have all heard what Frances Haugen has said about algorithms that pick up on Punch and Judy and on what are far greater evils that exist in society. People are able to use it and weaponise it. Connected networks are also something that we will have to get a handle on to deal with all the ills and woes that exist across the world at this point.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_142">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T14:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_417">I have been long enough in this House to remember the tortuous and cumbersome extradition procedure that used to exist prior to the enactment on foot of an EU framework directive of the European arrest warrant legislation. The Minister of State is far too young to remember any of that, but I remember debates in this House and major battles in the courts before criminals could be extradited from here. It was a most welcome innovation, which began to match the pan-European law enforcement capacity with the growing pan-European and transglobal nature of crime. Some colleagues have already referred to that in terms of drugs and other areas of criminality. Like all EU directives, the EU Commission maintains a proper watching brief on the precise nature of each member state's transposition process and subsequent enforcement. The Minister of State has told us that the Commission had issues with our transposition and had commenced infringement proceedings against us. I have said in regard to several other matters, in particular in the justice area, that Ireland is often very slow in bringing legislation to transpose directives in a timely fashion into this House. It is often when a long-standing deadline is approaching or in cases where legal proceedings have been commenced in the European Court of Justice that legislation is presented here and we are presented with a deadline, as if somehow we have to act with a degree of alacrity when we should have been given proper time.</p>
          <p eId="para_418"> We begin the debate with that in mind. The ministerial and departmental advice in the briefing note we got is that the Oireachtas should act with expedition to avoid financial penalties being imposed on the State. I might suggest that the Department moves with greater haste to avoid putting the National Parliament into that position in the first place. I have said that about other issues. Respect is needed for the Parliament. We need adequate time and preparation. Pre-legislative scrutiny was completed during the course of last year, yet the Bill has been brought to the House on the basis that we will do it quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_419"> In truth, as the Minister outlined in some technical detail, most of the changes that are to be brought about are procedural and technical in nature. They do not make easy reading either, because we are reading across existing legislation and amending legislation in that regard is often confusing. I am all in favour of consolidating legislation so that any practitioner or citizen would be able to read the law in a single volume rather than have to read it across various amending Acts.</p>
          <p eId="para_420"> As the Minister of State has set out, the issues, which include the confirmation of time limits for the making of decisions and for the surrender of persons on foot of arrest warrants, all seem very reasonable and proper. The Bill provides for close co-operation and communication with the issuing state and with Eurojust, where that is appropriate and necessary, seems straightforward.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> The measure on introducing clarification of the circumstances in which an arrest warrant may be refused by the High Court is a matter of implementing practice. Providing for the consent from a third country before approving the surrender of a person who has been extradited here from that country is again proper procedure that is in accordance with the spirit and detail of the directive.</p>
          <p eId="para_422"> Another measure relates to procedural rules for the requested person, where the arrest warrant relates to a conviction imposed on the requesting state in the absence of the requested person. Again, these are codifying procedural rules that have arisen. These are matters that clearly need to be codified in our law to accord with the generality of the procedures applied across member states of the European Union and of the requirements of the directive itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_423"> One issue struck me, and I would welcome clarity from the Minister of State regarding it. He referred to the rule of specialty in regard to section 15. The explanatory memorandum states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_424">This rule is codified in international extradition treaties and states that an extradited person shall not be proceeded against, sentenced, detained or re-extradited in the requesting state for any offence committed before surrender other than the offence for which extradition was granted.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">On the face of it, that seems most reasonable. One applies for a particular offence, and it can only proceed if the extradition is granted for that offence. How does it work if, for example, somebody was charged and extradited for a brutal rape and, subsequent to the extradition, the victim died and the issue then became murder? Could the warrant be subsequently amended to deal with that more serious issue, or could the person only be tried for the offence specified on the extradition warrant, that is, aggravated rape and assault? That is not clear to me and the Minister of State might provide clarity to the House in regard to it when he makes his Second Stage summation.</p>
          <p eId="para_426"> It is essential that we ensure we have robust mechanisms in place in every EU state so that those who commit serious crimes can be pursued across state boundaries. Too often, we have seen major criminal gangs operate in a multiplicity of states. The godfather, or now occasionally the godmother, of a criminal gang lives in one state and operates in a multiplicity of other states across the European Union. We must have the same freedom of movement to deal with the situation from a law enforcement perspective as the criminals have in operating from various jurisdictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_427"> The idea of a common European extradition warrant is something that needs constantly to be updated to keep track of developments. The development of this legislation is extremely important. One of the issues that arose from our co-ordinated attempts over the past 20 years and more to deal with criminal gangs, in particular in the multinational drugs area, was the development of the proceeds of crime legislation and the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau. In a previous debate, the Minister for Justice described that as perhaps the most important individual criminal justice initiative to impact on crime gangs in this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">We have amended the proceeds of crime legislation on a number of occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_429"> As colleagues have instanced, in recent weeks we have witnessed the unfolding horror of Russian aggression in Ukraine. It is unlike anything we have seen in our lifetimes and something that we thought we had confined to the horrors of the Second World War to see, in various cities across Ukraine but most focused upon Mariupol, the absolute annihilation of a city with no regard at all for the fate of its inhabitants who are experiencing unimaginable horrors as we speak. I mention this because I sought, as the Minister of State knows, to broaden the scope of our proceeds of crime legislation by bringing before the House the Proceeds of Crime (Gross Humans Rights Abuses) Bill, which has passed Second Stage and has been referred to the justice committee. I reference it now because it is important that we are seen to be acting in a very clear and decisive manner regarding those who are self-evidently engaged in gross human rights abuses and that we can, with the same determination and I hope with the same effect, act against them should any of them have assets in this State. I am not saying they have but if they do, we should be able to act against them and seize those assets in the same way we seized the assets, very effectively, of those involved in serious crime, including drug crimes, over the past 20-odd years.</p>
          <p eId="para_430"> I remember many of the same pushbacks to that legislation. It was said that it was unconstitutional or that we could not seize criminal assets without a criminal conviction because of constitutional protections and all that, but it has worked effectively. It would be a very strong signal. I do not mind if people who are self-evidently tied to gross human rights abuses want to go to an Irish court to get their property back and make their case. Let them defend themselves and their actions in the Irish courts. That is why I ask the Minister of State, and I know he has been very positive about it, to support that legislation and its quick passage through the Houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_431"> I look at what is happening in other jurisdictions. People have bespoke legislation to deal with the situation now and are fast-tracking it. In Britain, an entire day was spent amending its existing Magnitsky legislation to deal with this. We can do more. If the platform of legislation that I have presented needs to be supplemented, amended or reinforced, I will happily support that 100%, but we need to give a very strong signal of where we stand. On that matter, and I hope the Minister of State will take careful note of what I am about to say because it is something that needs to be brought to the attention of his colleagues, a communication has come my way regarding the operation of sanctions on named Russian persons that we are legally obliged to enforce. I will read the communication that I have. It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_432">It is clear sanctioned individuals are hiding money through family members and that the sanctions are being sidestepped. As the individuals in question, that is, the family members, are not sanctioned they could legally challenge withholding payments. Guidance on this matter from Government is urgently required.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">I ask the Minister of State to take note of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_434"> Where there is money in our financial services system that is not in the name of the sanctioned individuals who are named in the orders that are being made throughout the European Union, but their relatives, that allows them to simply sidestep the sanctions in that way. I am saying, in a broad spectrum way, that we need to have much more focus and attention on the significant sums of money that are churning through our financial systems to ensure that we are not in any way aiding and abetting the hiding of the tainted, filthy money of those who are in any way connected with the gross human rights abuses that are unfolding in front of our eyes in Ukraine right now. I ask the Minister of State to take note of that and pass it on to his colleagues, including the Minister for Finance or his Department, and to come back to me or the House regarding what exactly is being done in respect of the friends or family members - and family members were instanced in the communication I received - of named sanctioned individuals who might have resources in this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_435"> As already stated, the Bill is quite technical. It deals with strengthening, updating and simplifying in many ways the procedures we have that surround the application of extradition right now. I will end as I began by stating that it has come a long way from when we had a tortuous and difficult extradition system in this country with repeated court challenges and constant delays so that, in many instances, it proved impossible to extradite out of this jurisdiction people accused of very serious crimes. Having a pan-EU directive, transposed into a common interpretation across all member states, has been an enormous advantage and boon. On behalf of the Labour Party, I am very happy to support this legislation, which addresses issues that have been raised in the application of the European arrest warrant process in our own systems but, more important, the requirements of the Commission as set out in the infringement proceedings over recent days. I certainly hope to give fair wind to its early passage and enactment.</p>

        <speech by="#NealeRichmond" eId="spk_143">
          <from>Deputy Neale Richmond<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_436">I apologise for briefly nipping out to vote at the finance committee and for being somewhat breathless as a result. I thank Deputy Howlin for taking up as much time as possible but also for talking about a number of key issues that I will briefly refer to regarding this very important amending legislation. Its importance does not just relate to the European arrest warrant but to the amendments being tabled, seeing it passed speedily by the Houses and transposed into Irish law as quickly as possible because nothing is good if it stands still.</p>
          <p eId="para_437"> There is always an important responsibility on governments and legislators to improve, modernise and reform legislation. If we consider the importance of the European arrest warrant, it has been used nearly 400 times since its inception to bring organised gang members back to Ireland for trial and, in due course, incarceration, and for taking very violent criminals off the streets, not necessarily in Ireland but from their boltholes and places of luxury in exile. We have also seen it, very importantly, not just prevent acts of terror but allow an element of justice for serious acts of terror when we look at the arrests that have been made following the terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels, the anniversary of which is this week.</p>
          <p eId="para_438"> A number of colleagues have referred to a couple of areas that are not necessarily directly covered by this legislation but lead us to discuss and think about them. Deputies Ó Murchú and Ó Laoghaire spoke eloquently about the rule of law in other EU member states, namely, Hungary and Poland, and the importance of this Oireachtas and, equally, this Government in tracking that, ensuring that the European arrest warrant will not be abused by Governments in those jurisdictions and that we will not send people back to legal systems that will not protect their rights as well as everything else. It is also crucial that we think quite clearly about the impact of Brexit on the European arrest warrant and the co-ordination of security in this jurisdiction. While it is extremely welcome that the British Government has moved the terror threat in Northern Ireland from severe to substantial for the first time since 2010, it cannot allow for an air of complacency.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">Increased co-operation between the Irish and British Governments is important not only to tackle dissent and ongoing terrorism but also to deal with all aspects of criminality, from organised crime to petty crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_440"> I welcome the meeting in the past fortnight between the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, and the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice, Naomi Long. I hope and expect that after the Assembly elections in May there will be another Northern Ireland Minister of Justice with whom we can have a working relationship because crime knows no borders. We know that in a European context and that it is crucial in the context of this island. That is why it is so important that we do not allow that relationship to weaken after Brexit. There have been arrests in England in recent months of violent and vicious criminals who have been active in this jurisdiction. Ensuring co-operation between An Garda Síochána and British police forces and the PSNI and other state agencies is important but we must also make sure that changes are made in legislation to reflect the profound changes that Brexit presents.</p>
          <p eId="para_441"> On a wider level, it is important that the existing arrest warrant is strengthened. In six to 12 months we will need to re-examine not only how we are transposing the arrest warrant into Irish legislation but also, from a European perspective, whether it is still fit for purpose in the context of dealing with the greatest number of displaced persons on the Continent since the Second World War. With 10 million people in Ukraine no longer having homes and as the war continues to be vicious, that number will only increase. Sadly, there will be those in the EU who will try to profiteer from their misery, whether by means of human trafficking, organised crime or scams and may prey on innocents, whether it is those fleeing war or the people who receive them or are trying to provide support. We have already seen it. No doubt people have had bogus collectors for Ukraine and refugees call to their doors. The number of these that operate across borders is gobsmacking. That is why we must ensure that the culprits at the centre of such activities can be brought to justice in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_442"> While I support the speedy passage of this legislation, I call on the Minister of State or his colleagues to tell the next Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting that there must be a plan. Yesterday, when we debated the forthcoming European Council, I made a point about this matter. There is a lot of short-term planning taking place at the moment. That is understandable as a reaction to a crisis and the fact that refugees must be housed immediately and humanitarian aid and support to the Government in Ukraine are needed, with other EU states providing military and lethal support too. However, we must realise that the impacts of this conflict will be with us for some time. That is why there is a responsibility on the Oireachtas, the Government and, in particular, the EU to take that into account in the context of every aspect of how we operate in this State and beyond.</p>
          <p eId="para_443"> The European arrest warrant has been a success. Deputy Howlin eloquently laid out what things were like before it was put in place, with difficulties in getting extradition orders and in delivering justice for victims. Even today, opportunistic criminals hide in exile in places such as Dubai, South America or further afield, on the run from justice and the consequences of their actions. That is why the EU has a role in working bilaterally with other like-minded jurisdictions to ensure the most modern and efficient processes are in place and that we close these safe havens for criminals. They have been there since the beginning of time. However, as the world gets smaller, there can be no place where someone can hide in defiance and leave behind a legacy of misery and destruction the likes of which most of us cannot fathom.</p>

        <speech by="#ChrisAndrews" eId="spk_144">
          <from>Deputy Chris Andrews<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T15:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_444">I welcome the Bill. It is important that laws relating to European arrest warrants are brought up to date with the European Council's framework decision of 2002. That is long overdue. As a result of the delay in doing it, infringement proceedings were initiated in 2020 by the European Commission against Ireland. What is proposed with regard to the European arrest warrant will update the current extradition system between member states. There is a clear objective here, namely, to permit the free movement of judicial decisions in criminal matters across the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_445"> While I welcome the Bill, there are, however, aspects that need to be clarified. Where will the Court of Appeal stand in the context of European arrest warrants if the Bill is enacted? I am also concerned that certain parts of the Bill are excessive, such as the provision relating to the extradition of someone to serve out a sentence of just four months. There is no option within the Bill for minor sentences to be served within the Irish prison system. Will the Minister of State clarify the position in this regard? Sinn Féin will support the Bill, but we will table amendments to correct flaws and strengthen different aspects of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_446"> While we are on the subject, it is important to note the abuses carried out by some states. Countries such as Great Britain have used requests for extradition to suppress civil liberties. Most notably, Julian Assange remains in a maximum-security prison despite not being charged with a crime in Britain. The charges he faces in the United States are politically motivated. This view is shared by every major press freedom organisation. The charges he faces are also a serious attack on journalism. It gives the green light to imprison journalists for simply doing their job. The abuses and suppression of civil liberties that Julian Assange endures at the hands of the British Government should not be tolerated by the international community. The fact that it is tolerated on the grounds of an extradition case is an absolute disgrace. The Government is like disinterested passersby when it should be shouting stop. Using the extradition process as a tool for political attack cannot be tolerated.</p>

        <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_145">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T15:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_447">The Social Democrats will support the Bill, which is largely technical in nature. It amends aspects of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003 to ensure compliance with the 2002 framework decision on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between the member states. As others have noted, every few weeks we come to the House and talk about our need to do better on transposing European directives and framework decisions. I have lost count of how many times I have stood here and debated legislation which was drafted either to avoid infringement proceedings or financial penalties. The Government often tells us that we are good Europeans but in this regard we are very poor. Is there a wall planner of timelines outlining things that will hit a critical point of things if we do not deal with them and avoid that scenario? I have asked in the past how this is managed.</p>
          <p eId="para_448"> The Department of Justice is a conveyor belt of legislation. A great deal of legislation goes through there. We all accept that. However, we will have to deal with the legislation one way or another. I do not understand the notion that delaying it is beneficial. There are very high administrative costs as well as legal costs and back and forth with the EU which must add to the difficulties and to the timeline. If the Department requires additional staff for drafting to deal with these things, I do not understand why that does not happen. The Government will pay for it one way or another. Infringement proceedings were launched against us in 2020 for failure to comply with a number of outstanding issues in the 2002 framework decisions, in particular those relating to mandatory time limits.</p>
          <p eId="para_449"> The European arrest warrant system has been operational since 2004 and has been a vital instrument in combating cross-border crime in the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">It ensures the open borders and freedom of movement we enjoy as members of the EU cannot be exploited by those looking to evade justice. The system allows for a simplified cross-border judicial procedure used in prosecuting or executing custodial sentences or detention orders, with warrants issued by one member state being valid in every member state. One of the most beneficial aspects of this arrangement is the strict time limits it imposes. We must remember that also benefits the accused and ensures he or she is not kept in custody for lengthy periods while awaiting a decision. The country where the person is arrested must make the final decision on the execution of the warrant within 60 days after the arrest if the person does not consent to surrender. If that person does consent then the decision must be made within ten days. This is in stark contrast with the lengthy extradition procedures that used to exist between member states prior to the framework decision. I remember some of those cases that were played out, especially between Ireland and the UK. We have been absolutely failing to comply with the mandatory time limits and it is welcome we are going to remedy that now.</p>
          <p eId="para_451"> It is also a welcome feature of this legislation that there are provisions to refuse a request to transfer a sentenced prisoner where there is a belief he or she may face discrimination on grounds of sex, race, religion, ethnic origin, nationality, language, political opinions or sexual orientation. We can never be complacent about our responsibilities to protect individuals from discrimination within the EU. The EU has long had quite a poor record when it comes to sanctioning member states for breaches of treaty and human rights. The actions of certain countries over the past few years, like Hungary and Poland for example, have raised particular human rights concerns. Women’s rights, freedom of expression, judicial independence and the rights of the LGBT community have been under attack in these jurisdictions for some time now. Last year, Hungary passed a law outlawing the distribution of content that is deemed to portray or promote LGBT people to minors. This follows legislation enacted in 2020 which made it impossible for trans or intersex people in Hungary to change their gender legally. It is welcome to see the EU begin a substantive action against Poland and Hungary with daily fines and withholding payments due to violations.</p>
          <p eId="para_452"> We are now in a particularly difficult time with the likes of Poland, for example, which has a monumental task in relation to the intake of Ukrainian refugees. On the plus side, there is some remarkably good work being done on that and on the other hand, there are some very worrying signs at the border regarding the treatment of ethnic minorities or people of colour. We need to use all the tools at our disposal to protect human rights and the rule of law within the EU. Any rogue member state should of course face sanction. Europe is really that beacon and that requires us to protect that by making sure that there is compliance within the member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_453"> I turn to the issue Deputy Howlin referred to, namely, his proceeds of crime legislation. I spent about a year going backwards and forwards with the people in the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers, OPLA, essentially trying to construct a Magnitsky Act. Bill Browder was good enough to come over and meet some people here who wanted to collaborate on that. I have copious amounts of legal advice that they were able to give me and we commenced some drafting, which I had to pause because it became very clear a genuine Magnitsky Act would be required to come from Government because it would require a money message. A Magnitsky Act that would survive any challenge would require fair procedures. There is no doubt that would be a requirement for an investment if we were to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_454"> I am aware the European Union has adopted a Magnitsky Act but I do not see how that can actually function as Europe is not a jurisdiction. It is the individual jurisdictions that would be required to identify and prosecute things like, for example, major human rights abuses or major corruption. That is unfolding as we talk about it. We are looking at the money that is washing through our financial services sector. Some of that is in shell companies and with some of it is very difficult to get at the ownership. I have no doubt there are people avoiding sanctions that are justifiable and that should be applied because they are not the direct person who has been sanctioned but who may well be friends or relations.</p>
          <p eId="para_455"> In 2009, Sergei Magnitsky, who was a tax accountant, revealed huge tax avoidance or tax scandal and Mr. Browder wrote about this in his book <i>Red Notice</i>. Reading it reveals a whole other world we did not know existed. After that, the US put in place a Magnitsky Act and that has been followed by Canada and a whole lot of jurisdictions across the European Union. Collectively, there are quite a lot of us who have done work on this and would be enthusiastic about sharing the work we have done to see if we can take this over the line. However, it will fall to Government because I do not see how it can be done by an Opposition party such that it can travel the entire distance of having the legislation passed and enacted. It is legislation that there is a desire to see passed, certainly on the Opposition benches.</p>
          <p eId="para_456"> It must be done at the individual country level. That is where it can be most beneficial, rather than using the wider European Magnitsky Act that went through the European Parliament. I hope there will be scope to do something on that on a cross-party basis possibly, because as I said there is much useful information which several of us have and which we would be more than willing to share. I am sure the likes of Mr. Browder would be more than happy to come back over and share exactly what is needed. It is not about trying to have legislation that allows people it is not intended to target fall into its categories. It is instead about the very high level of corruption and the very high level of human rights abuses. It should be possible for us to do that as a united Parliament.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Deputy James Browne)<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T15:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_458">I thank Deputies for their very considered and measured contributions on what is technical but very important legislation amending the European arrest warrant. The main purpose of the Bill is to address a number of issues identified by the EU Commission with our existing legislation in this area informing EU infringement proceedings. That is why we must enact this Bill in a timely way. The Bill also takes the opportunity to make a number of technical amendments that are necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> I hear what Deputies are saying on the delays with implementing a number of EU directives. Deputy Catherine Murphy pointed out the issues seem to arise in here on a regular basis. That is partly because when I was appointed a Minister of State at the Department I recognised there was a significant backlog of legislation. Working with officials in the Department, we have now cleared almost all of the backlog.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">We now have this Bill, which needs to be passed, and the Criminal Justice (Mutual Recognition of Custodial Sentences) Bill is on Report Stage. In conjunction with the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, a number of amendments will be made to the latter. Two other matters relating to firearms will not need legislation but will need regulations. At that point, we should have all of the backlog cleared. This Dáil has already cleared the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) (Amendment) Act 2021, the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) (Amendment) Act 2021, the Counterfeiting Act 2021, the Criminal Justice (Smuggling of Persons) Act 2021 and the Criminal Justice (Mutual Recognition of Decisions on Supervision Measures) Act 2020. With Opposition parties, which have been proactive and helpful, we have cleared the large backlog. I will keep a close eye on the situation so that we do not lapse again only to have to pass legislation quickly so as to avoid infringements and penalties.</p>
          <p eId="para_461"> Deputy Howlin referred to the rule of specialty, particularly as it related to section 15. It is allowable to have parallel European arrest warrants. Where someone is being detained in Ireland under a European arrest warrant, a separate warrant can issue if the charge based in the issuing state has changed. My understanding is that, even where the person has been extradited, a European arrest warrant can be issued if the charge changes, but I will seek clarification. That was the point the Deputy raised, namely, what would happen where the charge became a different or more serious charge post extradition. My understanding is that another arrest warrant can be issued even when the person is in custody in the receiving or issuing state.</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> Deputy Howlin referred to his Magnitsky Bill. Deputy Catherine Murphy also referred to it. The Minister, Deputy McEntee, is working with Deputy Howlin on the matter. The Bill's principles are important. I will leave it to the Minister to address the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_463"> Deputy Andrews asked about the Court of Appeal. European arrest warrants can be appealed to that court.</p>
          <p eId="para_464"> Regarding minor sentences, the minimum level of charges is provided for in EU law. Therefore, there is no discretion in Ireland over what minimum sentences are covered under the European arrest warrant. I have dealt with a number of European arrest warrants while practising. Some of the charges and sentences in other countries were surprising. Nonetheless, this matter is covered by the directive and we are bound by that.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> Extraditions to the USA have nothing to do with this Bill or European arrest warrants, so I will not comment on that matter further.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> Deputy Howlin raised the issue of sanctions on named persons. Strictly speaking, that is a matter for the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Finance, but I will raise it with the latter. This Dáil passed the fifth anti-money laundering directive to tighten up laws around money laundering and terrorist financing.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> Deputy Martin Kenny raised a number of important issues around delays. The infringement notice was received in October 2020, pre-legislative scrutiny was undertaken in September 2021 and we are moving forward with the legislation as quickly as possible. Only three member states have not been found to be in infringement where European arrest warrants are concerned. This is technical legislation and every state has its own laws. Some, like Ireland, have constitutions. As the Deputy pointed out, the only other EU country with an element of common law is Cyprus. All of this has caused technical difficulties. Many states are having problems in ensuring that European arrest warrants are applied uniformly across the EU. We will be keeping a close eye on the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_468"> I thank the Deputies for their contributions on this Bill.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Anne Rabbitte)<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T15:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_471">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> I am standing in for the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, who is unwell and unable to attend in person. He is disappointed not to be present for this critical and historic legislation, which will introduce for the first time a regulatory framework for assisted human reproduction, AHR.</p>
          <p eId="para_473"> AHR is a complex, innovative and fast-moving area of medicine and this legislation will support thousands of people who wish to have children to do so safely through AHR. It will clarify the legal position of children born in Ireland as a result of AHR and will provide an ethical framework for research on new reproductive technologies. Ireland is very much an outlier internationally. The State is not funding advanced AHR treatment and we do not have a specific regulatory framework in place in respect of this area of healthcare. This means that individuals are availing of complex and sometimes risky procedures in what is effectively a legal vacuum. The new rules, regulations and provisions under this legislation will help bring guidance, clarity and peace of mind. First and foremost, the legislation will support prospective parents undergoing AHR treatment at what is usually an incredibly stressful time. That stress can be financial, psychological, physical or a combination of all three.</p>
          <p eId="para_474"> Importantly, these legislative measures will support the health and well-being of all children born as a result of AHR treatment. The Bill fills a legal vacuum in respect of domestic surrogacy. Significantly, children born through surrogacy will, under this legislation, have the right to access information on their gestational and genetic origins. The commencement of this legislation will also support the advancement of our plan to provide advanced AHR treatments, including IVF, in our public health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> The Bill will build on the excellent work that is being done by the Minister, the Department of Health and the HSE in the area of women's healthcare. As Deputies will appreciate, this legislation will mean a great deal to many and I look forward to working with Members of both Houses on progressing it as swiftly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> The Bill itself has been long in gestation. I acknowledge the ground-breaking work undertaken by the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction. More recently, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health's pre-legislative scrutiny process and last year's report of the special rapporteur on children have been of great assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">They have helped to inform the underlying principles and policies of the Bill. We have had very welcome and constructive input from various civic groups, including but not limited to, the National Fertility Support and Information Group, LGBT Ireland, Irish Families Through Surrogacy and Equality for Children. I thank all of them for their work in this area. </p>
          <p eId="para_478"> The Bill comprises 11 Parts, 161 sections and seven Schedules. This underpins the complexity involved, but also demonstrates the substantial considerations and work done to develop a policy and legislation for the first time in this field. A more detailed section-by-section analysis of the Bill can be found in the accompanying explanatory memorandum, but I will now briefly outline some of the important features of each Part. </p>
          <p eId="para_479"> Part 1 covers standard provisions, including definitions, regulations, expenses and commencement. Part 2 primarily sets out certain general criteria which need to be fulfilled prior to the provision of AHR treatment, including in respect of minimum age limits, the safety of any child born as a result of such treatment, the provision of appropriate information and counselling and the obtaining of all required consent prior to the commencement of treatment. As recommended by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health pre-legislative scrutiny report, upper age limits for women undergoing AHR treatment will now be set in secondary legislation in line with the principles and policies set out in section 11(2) of the Bill. There is also a general requirement that prior to the provision of AHR treatment a reasonable expectation must exist that at least one intending parent will live until any child born as a result of such treatment reaches adulthood. </p>
          <p eId="para_480"> Part 3 covers a broader range of matters relating to gamete and embryo donation than the issues of parentage and non-anonymous donations addressed in the Child and Family Relationships Act 2015. Provisions in this Part outline the conditions and restrictions relating to an individual or couple donating gametes and embryos for use in the AHR treatment by others. It also covers its use in research. It outlines specific requirements relating to people wishing to access AHR treatment involving donated material. For instance, there are specific requirements relating to the prohibition of the donation of embryos other than supernumerary embryos, which are embryos created and stored for the use as part of a person's own AHR treatment and which remain unused following the completion of that treatment, and the prohibition of commercial gamete and embryo donation whether for the purpose of providing AHR treatment to others or for use in research.</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> Part 4 allows for a person under the age of 18 who is due to undergo medical treatment which is likely to cause a significant impairment to his or her fertility to be provided with AHR to facilitate the subsequent storage of his or her gametes. Also, in this Part, there is provision for the Minister to make regulation to specify a maximum period for the storage of the gametes and embryos, but in the meantime a period of ten years is applicable. This can be extended with the express permission of the assisted human reproduction regulatory authority, which will be established. I would like to acknowledge that the last two provisions outlined were raised by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health as part of its pre-legislative scrutiny process. </p>
          <p eId="para_482"> Part 5 outlines the circumstances under which an AHR treatment provider will be permitted to offer posthumous assisted human reproduction. This is an application of the AHR technology to achieve a pregnancy using the gametes of a deceased person or an embryo created using the gametes of a deceased person. The 2017 general scheme set out that a deceased person would be only considered a parent of a child born through the use of his or her gametes or embryos where the child is born within 36 months of a parent's death. This provision was inserted to facilitate the orderly administration of a deceased's estate. Importantly, and as advised by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health, this has been removed. Instead, there is an emphasis on those contemplating posthumous AHR obtaining detailed relevant legal advice prior to consenting to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_483"> Part 6 sets out the strict conditions under which pre-implantation genetic diagnosis and genetic screening, as well as human leukocyte antigen, HLA, matching, would be permitted. Broadly speaking, these are screening procedures that can be undertaken in circumstances where there is a significant risk of a child being born with serious genetic disease, life-limiting condition or chromosomal abnormality. In this regard, provision is also being made for the establishment of a register of genetic diseases which will be maintained and regularly updated.</p>
          <p eId="para_484"> Part 7 sets out the circumstances under which surrogacy may be permitted in Ireland, including that the surrogacy agreement is gestational only, namely, the surrogate's egg is not used; any child born will have a genetic link to at least one intending parent; the surrogate mother and at least one intending parent must have been habitually resident in the State for not less than two years; the relevant embryo transfer is to be undertaken in the State; the child needs to be born in Ireland; the surrogacy arrangements are non-commercial; and the agreement must be approved by the regulatory body in advance of the provision of the relevant AHR treatment. It provides that the woman who is going to act as a surrogate mother must be 25 years old or older, has previously given birth to a child and must not act as a surrogate mother under a surrogacy agreement more than twice. </p>
          <p eId="para_485"> Currently, under Irish law, the surrogate is considered to be the mother. This Part provides for a mechanism through which the parental rights and responsibilities will be transferred from the surrogate to the intending parent or parents through the granting of a parental order application to the Circuit Court. Also, provision is made to establish a national surrogacy register that will hold information on all parties involved in the surrogacy agreement, namely, the surrogate, the donor and the intending parents, to allow children born from surrogacy agreements to access information in relation to their genetic and gestational origins. In line with a recommendation from the special rapporteur on child protection, the Bill removes the exception in the 2017 general scheme that allowed a donor or intending parent to object to the information held on the national surrogacy register being given to such a child. Again, on foot of a proposal by the special rapporteur, the age at which relevant children can access information on the national surrogacy register and the national donor-conceived person register has been reduced from 18 years to 16 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_486"> Part 8 provides for the establishment of the assisted human reproduction regulatory authority, outlines its powers and lists its functions, which include the licensing of AHR treatment providers and research facilities; promoting, monitoring and enforcing compliance with the legislation; collecting and publishing information in respect of AHR procedures and gamete and embryo donations carried out in the State; preparing and approving codes of practice for the guidance of licence holders; establishing and maintaining the national surrogacy register; and taking on the function of maintaining the national donor-conceived person register.</p>
          <p eId="para_487"> Part 9 includes detailed provisions in respect of the functions of the regulatory authority related to licensing. Part 10 contains further details in respect of the functions of the regulatory authority related to enforcement of compliance with the provisions of the Bill such as the appointment of authorised officers and their powers; the process for dealing with relevant complaints; and the issuing by the regulatory authority of the codes of practice to guide licence holders. Part 11 provides for consequential amendments to other legislation on the Statue Book, namely, the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, the Civil Registration Act 2004, the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 and the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_488"> I wish to mention two of the Schedules which deal with the regulation of embryo and stem cell research. Schedule 2 lists specific types of such research which are prohibited under the Bill, while Schedule 4 sets out criteria that the regulatory authority shall have regard to in determining a licence application to undertake research involving embryos and stem cells. The focus of AHR legislation has always been on the regulation of a wide range of practices undertaken in this jurisdiction exclusively, and particularly those undertaken by the private fertility clinics operating in this country. Therefore, the published Bill does not include provisions to regulate surrogacy arrangements undertaken in other jurisdictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">The Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, is committed to having regard, alongside our colleagues the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy Roderic O'Gorman, to work on a newly established special Oireachtas joint committee on international surrogacy, as this Bill progresses through the Houses of the Oireachtas. I strongly believe that this legislation will support and benefit all of those using assisted human reproduction, AHR, treatment, as well as the children born as a result of it. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#DavidCullinane" eId="spk_150">
          <from>Deputy David Cullinane<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_490">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte. This is very important legislation for the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly. I wish him well and I am sure he would have wanted to be here to move this legislation today. I acknowledge the work he has done in this area, and the fact that he is bringing forward the Bill. I wish him a speedy recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_491"> I welcome the introduction of the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022, and the opportunity it provides to us to speak on this and related issues. It has been a long time coming. It has been too long for some families and it is important that we get it working as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_492"> Sinn Féin will be supporting the Bill at this Stage, as it provides for a much-needed regulatory framework for assisted human reproduction treatments and related research, which we have sought for a number of years. Importantly, it provides for domestic altruistic surrogacy arrangements, which will help many families in the State avail of surrogacy where they require it, without needing to travel abroad or engage in complex, non-standardised agreements, which may or may not protect the rights of the child and the rights of parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_493"> The Bill does not at this stage deal with the difficult question of international surrogacy arrangements. This is an area we need to give serious consideration to, and we must get it right. As the Minister of State said, a special committee of the Oireachtas is to be established. I also understand and appreciate there are very complex moral and ethical issues that arise from international surrogacy that need to be dealt with in a more sensitive way. It is also a service that many people have used, for their own benefit and for the benefit of the children they now have. There are very real issues that need to be addressed. It must be a rights-based approach that protects those involved and does not lend itself to permitting exploitation of any kind, but which fundamentally recognises the situation that some families have, unfortunately, found themselves in. Hopefully, the Bill will provide an effective alternative by providing this framework for domestic altruistic surrogacy arrangements. There are, however, many families who exist in the here and now, and others who may come into being between now and the commencement of each of these sections, to whom this Bill may not apply once enacted. It will take some time for the regulatory authority to be up and running, and we must be conscious of the needs and experiences of families in the meantime.</p>
          <p eId="para_494"> Sinn Féin will work constructively with the Government, with the Ministers in government, and with other parties through the special committee, which will be established. I hope we can come to an all-party agreement on how to deal with the difficult legal and ethical problems the issue poses, with a solution that protects the rights of children, parents and surrogates. It is essential that we do not ignore the use of international surrogacy and the likelihood of this continuing between now and the availability of domestic surrogacy arrangements, and that we regulate it appropriately thereafter.</p>
          <p eId="para_495"> For me, the biggest potential omission from the Bill is the rights of parents and children who, in the here and now, are having issues with securing full parental rights. I have met with many of them over the past months. Many of them I am sure will welcome the Bill but they have their own concerns which, unfortunately, will not be addressed in the context of this Bill. The Government must ensure all of the rights that will, hopefully, be enjoyed by future parents through surrogacy are available to those parents and children who need certainty now. As it currently stands, for an intending mother of a child born through surrogacy, there is no route to legal parentage other than adoption, even if she has provided the egg from which the child was conceived and is the child’s genetic mother. There are many cases affected by this issue and I have spoken with families who are looking to the Government and the Minister for Health to solve the problem. Perhaps the issue will be addressed in the context of the special committee to be established. I certainly hope so. I would have hoped, however, that in some way it would have been addressed in the Bill. It is unfortunate that it is not addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_496"> A case I remember in particular is that of Antoinette and her husband Barry from County Offaly, whose children Eanna and Doireann were born in Kyiv. Antoinette and Barry’s story was told last summer in the newspapers and I heard them speak on radio of their experience. The law, as it stands, means that when those children arrived in the State, Antoinette was not legally the mother, despite the fact she is recognised as the mother in Ukraine. This is because the law in Ireland only recognises the person giving birth as the mother. The Bill, in section 62, provides for the recognition of parentage only in the context of permitted surrogacies subsequent to the Act. That will not help the many mothers and parents in a similar situation, and it is not clear if it is the Government's intention to provide a pathway for all of those left in a legal limbo due to the current system. It means that mothers of children born through surrogacy between now and the commencement of domestic surrogacy arrangements, which could take years to be enacted and to work, will not be entitled to maternity leave, yet the father will be entitled to paternity leave. It will mean that they cannot travel alone with the children, cannot take medical decisions for the children, and are not seen as the parent. If something was to happen to the father, in these instances, there could be very serious difficulties for families stuck in this situation. We must ensure full rights for both parents, and I hope the Government will be able to move on this, and perhaps clarify whether or not these issues will be dealt with comprehensively when the special committee is established.</p>
          <p eId="para_497"> I hope the Minister of State will agree that we must ensure the rights of these parents, and that the Government must provide for the retrospective or retroactive recognition of their rights where it can. I am sure we will get legal opinion and legal advice on all of these matters in due course, and obviously we must take on board that legal opinion. It is heartbreaking to listen to the stories of families who are in this situation and in this legal limbo. We need to regularise the situation and make sure the rights of the mother in these circumstances are upheld, are protected and are in place. Unfortunately, that is not the case at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_498"> One of the most important aspects of the Bill is the establishment of an assisted human reproduction regulatory authority. I thank the Minister for Health for taking this approach. I believe it is the right approach. This authority will regulate and provide information on the range of AHR treatments and services open to patients across the health sector. Importantly, its principal function is to ensure the health and well-being of children born as a result of AHR treatments, persons undergoing treatment, and intending parents. It must be a holistic approach, and the fact that an authority is to be established signals that intent. It is welcome that there will be such an authority to safeguard their rights, and which can provide information to prospective patients. This must be established as quickly as possible, with its board and CEO appointed as soon as possible, allowing for the appointments process to take its course. Staffing and resourcing this authority is a key concern, and I would welcome any additional information the Minister of State can provide on the resources it will need, and on when the Minister or the Minister of State can expect those resources to be put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_499"> In the final part of my contribution I will focus on public provision of services. We need to make sure opportunities for assisted human reproduction treatment are available to everybody, and not just to those who can afford it. As the Minister of State will be aware, families who need access to fertility treatments, IVF, and other services to aid them having children, must access this privately. It costs a lot of money. It can cost from €10,000 to €20,000 or €30,000. Sometimes, families must get two or three rounds of treatment before there is a success. Many cannot afford to do it. It is heartbreaking for them when they spend all of that money, it does not work out, and they do not have the money to try again. This is wrong. While there is a huge cost to this, we must look at expanding this out as a public service. While the Bill and the regulatory authority will bring some cohesion to the sector, and ensure higher quality services and more certainty, many families will simply not be able to afford the cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">Once this Bill is enacted, I ask the Minister of State and the Government to make it a priority to develop the public services available to families who cannot meet the cost of going private.</p>
          <p eId="para_501"> While the Minister of State is in the Chamber, I would like to meet her about children's disability services and the recent High Court judgment about assessment of needs. I am sure she will agree it was a very important judgment. We want to make sure children get the services they need, as I am sure the Minister of State does as well. I would welcome an opportunity to meet on that issue.</p>

          <from>Deputy Patricia Ryan<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_502">I also welcome this Bill. As my colleague Deputy Cullinane has said, it will ensure AHR practices and related areas of research are conducted in a more consistent way and with the oversight of a new watchdog, the AHR regulatory authority. Under the legislation, this new regulatory authority will be responsible for regulating treatments such as IVF and licensing and regulating domestic altruistic surrogacy, pre-implantation genetic diagnoses and other embryo screening procedures, as well as posthumous assisted human reproduction. Regarding research involving embryos and stem cells, the legislation sets out which practices are prohibited and which are allowed, and how they should be regulated.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> According to experts, the UK's legislation combined with the Netherlands' financial legislation section is the most effective hybrid model of best practice for this area in Ireland. It has been five years since the drafting of this legislation began and more than 15 years since the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction called for new laws to govern practices in this area of great ethical complexity. It is clear that this legislation is long overdue. The role of the new regulatory authority will be essential to embedding safe and appropriate clinical AHR practices in this country. The new authority will also maintain a new national surrogacy register and the existing national donor-conceived person register.</p>
          <p eId="para_504"> We need strong protections to ensure adequate oversight of this fast-moving area of medicine. We must ensure adequate protection for the thousands of people who wish to have children safely through AHR and must clarify the legal position of children born from AHR. We must also ensure research around new reproductive technologies is carried out within a prescribed ethical context.</p>
          <p eId="para_505"> It is disappointing that the legislation does not contain provisions in respect of international surrogacy. I understand a special joint committee is being set up to examine all aspects of this complicated issue and I hope its recommendations will be addressed swiftly.</p>
          <p eId="para_506"> It is over five years since the current Tánaiste announced the Government would introduce publicly-funded fertility treatment. It is almost three years since the Government announced funding for IVF and fertility treatment and publicly committed to funding a model of care for infertility as part of the public health system. There are thousands of people who need support in order to access consultations and diagnostics for both men and women experiencing fertility difficulties. We need an urgent roll-out of the public model of care for infertility. Those who need IVF can expect to pay between €4,000 and €4,500 for one course of treatment. The costs can escalate, depending on what treatment is necessary, as Deputy Cullinane has said.</p>
          <p eId="para_507"> Ireland and Lithuania remain the only EU countries not to offer state funding for assisted reproduction, even though the World Health Organization recognises infertility as a medical condition. This Bill is a step in the right direction but there is a long road ahead. The Government is lagging behind private companies, which often get a bad rap in this House. I commend Vodafone, which recently announced that it would extend its fully-paid 26 weeks of maternity leave to those who become parents via surrogacy. It also offers 16 weeks of paid leave for non-primary caregivers, whether they become a parent through birth, adoption or surrogacy. On top of that, it announced ten days' paid leave for employees who experience pregnancy loss before 24 weeks, whether it happens to the employee, their partner or their surrogate. It also offers flexible and hybrid working options and ten days' paid leave each year for those undergoing treatment, with two days for their partners. Meanwhile, Bills on similar policies at governmental level continue to stutter their way through the legislative process. Let us not forget the constitutional crisis caused when the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, decided to take the standard six months of maternity leave. She was the first Cabinet Minister to do so in Irish history. It is time to catch up.</p>

          <p eId="para_508">In November, Sinn Féin and other parties stood in solidarity with families and parents as they presented letters to all three Government parties outlining their concerns at the lack of progress in delivering appropriate assisted human reproduction legislation. I join my colleagues in welcoming that this legislation has progressed. Sinn Féin supports this Bill in principle. We welcome a regulatory framework for assisted human reproduction, which will standardise access to and rights around IVF, surrogacy and related research.</p>
          <p eId="para_509"> However, there are two major omissions from the Bill, namely, international surrogacy arrangements and retrospective recognition of parentage. I am aware that the issue of international surrogacy arrangements will be dealt with by a special committee, which has now been established. I wish that committee all the best in its endeavours as it sets about that task. This special committee is being set up to examine all aspects of this very complicated issue with a view to issuing recommendations within three months, including on international surrogacy arrangements. Failure to address international surrogacy means this legislation will not be fit for purpose for Irish parents who have either used the services of a surrogate in another jurisdiction or are considering it. It is incumbent on the special committee to issue strong recommendations to support parents who are in this position. I am calling on the Minister of State and the Government to give the strongest message possible to parents who have used the services of a surrogate in another jurisdiction that their concerns will be listened to, and acted on, within the three-month timeframe set out. The Government has been found wanting on this issue in the past and is playing serious catch-up in the ever-changing and evolving family creation environment in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_510"> We have all heard from mothers who, two and three years down the line, are not considered their child’s legal guardian while fathers, just because of the biological nature of their relationship with the child, are immediately deemed to be the child’s legal guardian in the eyes of the law. This needs to change and it needs to change immediately. The Government has to listen to families about their concerns and experiences and must deliver the changes that are needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_511"> On the retrospective recognition of parentage, it is not clear from the Bill that the parental and guardianship rights for children born through surrogacy will apply to families that already exist. We must ensure that these children and each of their parents, where there is more than one, have full rights. This is particularly important in the event of the death of the parent with guardianship rights, where the other parent may not have completed the legal process of also becoming a parent or guardian of the child. Would-be parents of surrogate children can spend years battling in court for basic parenting rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">Currently, the mother or second parent is not entitled to those rights and has to settle for guardianship, which expires when their surrogate child reaches 18. This legal limbo means, for example, that until the mother of a surrogate child is granted guardianship rights, she cannot give consent for her child to go on a school trip, open a bank account, or even apply for their first passport. Once that child reaches the age of 18, he or she would also have no legal standing when it comes to making important health decisions about the parents. If the mother or second parent dies, the child would have the same legal status to their parent’s estate as a complete stranger. These are the things I am hoping this legislation will resolve. On this issue, Irish Families Through Surrogacy has said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_513">Our children are Irish citizens and deserve to be afforded the same provisions as every child in Ireland and have a legal relationship with both parents. At the moment, Irish children are being left in legal limbo as they can often wait years to be granted parental rights to one parent before guardianship proceedings can even take place for their second parent. </p>
          <p eId="para_514"> The Bill is also very important from the perspective of non-surrogacy assisted human reproduction, such as IVF. As has been said already, the Minister of State needs to ensure that IVF services will be made reasonably available through the public health system. Currently, the only option for parents who require IVF is to go private, which means only a certain demographic of people are able to access it. That must be ruled out.</p>
          <p eId="para_515"> A regulatory framework that upholds the rights of children born through surrogacy is paramount.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">We need to ensure it prevents children born from surrogacy being left in legal limbo or being stateless.</p>

          <from>Deputy Duncan Smith<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T16:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_517">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte. As was articulated by Deputy Cullinane, I want to note that the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, has done an awful lot of work to bring this complex Bill to the House so I am sure he is sorry to be missing out on this debate. It is not lost on us that he has done an awful lot of work to get this long overdue Bill before us.</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> It is a long and complex Bill but it is not one that resolves everything. It is a foundational Bill that we hope will provide regulatory certainty around this area. The arrival of this Bill on Second Stage today will provide an air of relief, not that we have reached the finish line as we are far from it but because it is an important moment now that this AHR Bill has finally reached the Dáil. There is a desire from the Government and the Opposition to move the Bill through as expeditiously as possible, while also being as careful as possible. It will require and be subject to a number of amendments and suggested amendments because we are not dealing with an area that is simple or straightforward. The sheer length of the Bill is testament to that and we welcome this move towards finally regulating AHR in Ireland. The word "laggards" is used an awful lot in other areas and we certainly have been behind our European sisters and brothers in regulating this area. There are people all over this country who have been waiting for this Bill for many years. For many it has come too late and we need to recognise that but there are those who hope that we will be able to move it forward and that, in line with the model of care for infertility, which the Government is pushing and funding and which will need to be scaled up dramatically, we are on the cusp of a proper, publicly funded and well-regulated model of fertility care in this country. That is somewhere that the vast majority want and need us to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_519"> The establishment of the assisted human reproduction regulatory authority, AHRRA, is welcome and it is the foundational element of this Bill. It is the right approach to take. The AHRRA will have to adjudicate, decide and provide certainty on a lot of complex issues. One area the Bill deals with is posthumous AHR, which is complex and which has ethical and moral questions. People are suffering from the lack of regulation on this. Anyone going through assisted reproduction has been doing so without the regulation that this Bill will provide through private clinics, many of which operate different standard operating procedures. The clinical care has been good, it has been paid for and it is expensive. However, there are different models of operating procedures in different clinics.</p>
          <p eId="para_520"> People go for AHR for many different reasons. Some go because they have life-limiting conditions and because they are looking to start a family before their health deteriorates. There are others who are otherwise in perfect health who need assistance with fertility. If a tragedy befalls these people and one of the prospective parents unexpectedly and tragically passes, then all that is left in any physical form might be this gamete, this embryo which is now in a clinic. The clinics have different operating procedures and for people going to a clinic in good health with no life-limiting condition, their headspace is not about what will happen if they or their partner loses their life. It is about creating life so when a tragedy occurs and one prospective parent is left, he or she is subject to the small print of the many forms he or she will have signed and the vagaries and rules of that particular clinic. This Bill and the AHRRA will need to make provision for the people who are dealing with that situation now.</p>
          <p eId="para_521"> There is also a provision in the Bill that a surviving partner will be unable to access posthumous AHR for a year. I am sure that provision is in place because of grief and having to deal with same but we are often dealing with people whose clocks are running down. Time is very important to these people so there needs to be a provision to deal with that because a year is really important at a certain stage in life. There are no easy answers to this and we may not be able to capture this in legislation. It might be possible to capture this in the practices of the AHRRA and it is something I would like to see discussed further.</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> There is no doubt that the Bill is a huge and positive step in the right direction. Delivering this framework and regulating for assisted reproductive care is beyond a necessity at this stage. There are many different elements to this issue and we want to work towards a public model of assisted reproductive care. There are workers' rights issues and the Labour Party brought forward a Bill on this in the Seanad on the back of the great work of our Lord Mayor of Dublin, Councillor Alison Gilliland and the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, in terms of leave for people who are going through fertility treatment. That is another important and practical part of this debate that needs to be discussed. We have talked about the costs of this Bill and that issue will have to be met with a proper model of public care. We will need strong workers’ rights on leave to ensure that people are able to take the time they need to get their treatment and deal with the consequences of same, be they positive or negative. There is a Bill in place that has all-party support and that should be progressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_523"> This Bill will also help to tackle what has been quite a stigmatised area over the years, as people have felt that if they have had to go through assisted reproductive care, they have somehow failed. They have sometimes had to go through that journey in silence without the support or knowledge of their close friends or family. It is totally untrue to suggest that these people have failed. In recent years we have seen people come out to share their fertility journeys, whatever those journeys may be. They should be applauded and while an awful lot of their work has been soft in the sense that it has not been direct engagement in pre-legislative scrutiny, for example, it has created the environment in which this Bill has finally been brought to the Houses of the Oireachtas. I want to acknowledge those individuals around the country who go on social media and tell their social networks that if they have a question about the process they can ask them. People in my life have put their hands up and invited me to ask them about their fertility journeys and offered to answer any questions I might have. That is not an easy thing to do and the people who do it have played an important role in getting us here. They are not part of any particular group but they need to be acknowledged.</p>
          <p eId="para_524"> The Bill speaks to domestic and altruistic surrogacy, which is long overdue. International surrogacy has been put into the remit of the time-limited all-party committee. That is good if it works and if it is progressed but it is not good if it is seen as something that is being kicked down the road. I do not think that is the case and that is not the sense I am getting; there is a desire and energy to deal with this. Ukraine is another example of why we need to deal with this.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">To see that progress and to deal with the difficult issues, it is to be hoped that a way through them will be found because the reality on the ground is this is happening. Judgments can be made and we need a rights-based approach to this but at the end of the day, if I get a call from my childcare provider that my child needs Calpol, because he is running a slight temperature, I can give that permission but there are parents in this country who cannot do so because they had their child through international surrogacy. These are the practical problems encountered. Who loses out in that situation? It is the child.</p>
          <p eId="para_526"> It has been more than 15 years since the publication of the report by the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction in 2005, which called for new laws, and five years since the general scheme was published in 2017. I have mentioned that we are way behind internationally in regulating this space, unlike other EU countries, and that is why this Bill is welcome. There are cost barriers to IVF and assisted reproductive therapies at present. This is where we need to get to in this country. While this is a foundational regulatory Bill, the real proof of its success will be if we have an egalitarian and properly democratic public system that is not just open to those who have the means and the many thousands of euro that are required. Many people do not necessarily have that money on tap. They have to get loans that have to be paid back with interest. That is where we need to be. In the UK, the NHS funds IVF treatment. As we have seen in recent years that it has become harder to access for couples, it is important that the model of care we roll out is robust and future-proofed.</p>
          <p eId="para_527"> Part 6 of the Bill covers the complex ethical area of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis and sex selection. This is an area of concern for many people and it must be closely regulated. It is important to differentiate between pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, most commonly associated with cases in which there is a known family history of a genetic mutation such as cystic fibrosis or Huntington's disease, and the broader case of pre-implantation genetic screening that often presents other ethical issues due to age or parental concern in which embryos are checked for sporadic mutations or chromosomal abnormalities. We can remark how important this area is for so many families and how it is a chance to address the great burden many families face where there is a known history or genetic risk of devastating inherited diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, Huntington's disease, haemophilia, or fragile X syndrome, to ensure their children do not carry the condition where pre-implantation genetic diagnosis is deemed acceptable and applicable.</p>
          <p eId="para_528"> Critical to the regulation of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, PGD, however, is ensuring there is a publicly funded option for IVF, as I discussed, and funding for necessary screening. I ask the Minister of State to confirm that the HSE will fund pre-implantation genetic screening for embryos where it is deemed ethically applicable, and that there would be a system in place to support families. Will the Minister also confirm what approach will be taken for families who decide to pursue the screening of their embryos where there is not a known family history or specific genetic disease, for example, if they decide to screen for chromosomal abnormalities or sporadic genetic mutations where the age barrier may not apply? Again, they are important, difficult questions that we need to nail down.</p>
          <p eId="para_529"> Human leukocyte antigen, HLA, typing of embryos is provided for in the Bill in order that the child's HLA matches that of a sick sibling, often for stem cell donations or treatment of specific genetic diseases or leukaemia, and are often called saviour siblings. This would avoid the rejection of the stem cells by the sick child's immune system. This is, again, a very sensitive issue in which there are concerns about the possible exploitation of the child, but the Bill does provide clear criteria. As this is a constantly evolving area of medical practice, it should be kept under constant review. I urge the Minister of State to consider specifying in the Bill that the board of the AHRRA establishes an ethics committee, as recommended in the pre-legislative scrutiny, and that the resources are put in place for the funding of genetic services, including geneticists and genetic counsellors, and the provision of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis where it is deemed to be necessary by the board. I will finish on that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_530"> The international commercial surrogacy issue will go before the special Oireachtas committee and that has to go in tandem, inasmuch as possible, or at least follow on as quickly and expeditiously. There are other related issues, as I mentioned, such as the Organisation of Working Time (Reproductive Health Related Leave) Bill. However, the model of infertility care needs to be properly funded and properly rolled out. If this Bill works and we have a regulatory framework that is trusted and is up to the international standards that we strive for, and that we have a public model of infertility care that would be open to all coming behind it, we will finally be able to catch up and provide the healthcare that we need and have a responsibility to provide for the people in this country who are looking to create life, to nurture life, to love life, and to provide life. I look forward to what the Minister of State will say in summing up this Stage, as well as to seeing this Bill progress through the subsequent Stages.</p>

          <from>Deputy Emer Higgins<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T16:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_531">I am delighted to have the opportunity to debate this Bill today. It has been a long time coming for an awful lot of families. I will begin by acknowledging the service that Ukrainian surrogates have provided for many Irish families. An estimated 400 Ukrainian women have given birth to Irish surrogate children, with 46 Irish surrogate babies born in Ukraine in the past year alone. At least four Irish surrogate babies have been born in a hospital in Kyiv since the outbreak of the war, and we know a number of other babies are due to be born for Irish parents in the coming months through surrogacy in Ukraine. It is an especially terrifying time for those Irish families and their Ukrainian surrogates and their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> The tragedy of the situation in Ukraine emphasises why this legislation we are debating today is so crucially important. We do not have laws around commercial surrogacy. Ireland is one of the only European countries without any form of specific regulation around assisted human reproduction. The lack of legal footing leaves parents and surrogates in limbo especially in situations such as the current war in Ukraine. Offers have been made to many Ukrainian surrogates to come to Ireland but Irish Families Through Surrogacy has reported surrogate mothers being afraid to accept offers to come to Ireland in case their name ends up on the birth certificate after the baby is born here, in case they become legally responsible for that child, which is obviously an unacceptable situation for both parents and the surrogates.</p>
          <p eId="para_533"> As I said, this legislation has been a long time in coming and I give huge credit to the parents, families and organisations such as Irish Families Through Surrogacy, which have kept this matter on the political agenda. They have campaigned tirelessly. They have stood outside this building, and I have stood with them, and they have shared their private stories ever so publicly. I acknowledge all the work my Fine Gael colleague, Senator Seery Kearney, has done in this space for her leadership and advocacy for parents through surrogacy. The irony is that many men, women and couples whom I have met have already completed their families. They have gone through the struggle of infertility, of IVF and of surrogacy, yet here they are fighting to be legally recognised as their children's rightful parents. They are also fighting to improve the process for future parents who will embark on these journeys, and I believe that is really quite selfless.</p>
          <p eId="para_534"> I welcome that the Bill will put Irish surrogacy on a legal footing and will make the dream of starting a family more achievable for many people. Sending people abroad for a service that we do not offer in Ireland sends a twisted message that is somehow wrong, however, it is anything but. We should be celebrating the advances in science and medicine, and the advances in society that allow us to create families in all kinds of ways. The fact that we are now legislating for assisted human reproduction is exciting and is something I am very proud we are doing in the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> I am a proud member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on International Surrogacy and we had our first meeting today. I look forward to the work ahead of us in considering and making recommendations on the measures to address issues arising from international surrogacy. It is important that this committee has been formed and that it has been given such a wide-reaching and important agenda, yet such a specific timeframe to do our work. I know that all members are extremely dedicated to improving the experience of international surrogacy for all parents, children and surrogates concerned. With that said, we are asking the Minister of State to consider holding off on bringing this legislation to Committee Stage until the Joint Committee on International Surrogacy has concluded its work in order that it can be incorporated into the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">We will be writing formally to the Minister of State to request this.</p>
          <p eId="para_537"> I appreciate that there are considered challenges with making this legislation work retrospectively, but I feel we must address the guardianship issue for parents who have already availed of instructional surrogacy. It is such a long difficult road for these families. When they are out the other side of it and have their babies, they enter into a whole new arena of identity complications. There are biological parents who have no legal rights over their child, cannot legally advocate or sign for them in medical situations and cannot even sign school permission slips. There are fears about what will happen if the relationship between a mother and the biological father of a child born through surrogacy breaks down. In this situation, there is, sadly, potential for a mother's lack of parental status to be weaponised against her and her child. While I hugely welcome that we are finally moving to establish surrogacy laws of our own, it is so important that we do not leave the parents and children who have already gone through international surrogacy in the dark. We cannot and I do not believe we want to forget about them.</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> As I said, apart from that is a more challenging situation for which to legislate. I accept that but it can, of course, be overcome. I know the Minister of State and all Government parties are committed to finding a solution to this. The report that was published last March by the special rapporteur on child protection, Professor Conor O'Mahony, contains excellent work on how we can develop a pathway to legislate for international surrogacy. I am really looking forward to working more on this at the joint committee and to presenting our recommendations to the Minister of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> It is important to acknowledge the role this Bill will play in terms of access to IVF. Regulating treatments like IVF is something we should have done a really long time ago. Many couples throughout this country struggle to conceive. Many people feel that their families are incomplete without a baby and for so many of them, IVF will make their dreams come true. Regulating that and allowing better access - I believe the plan is eventually to allow for more public access to IVF - is so important for so many couples who otherwise may not have the option of having a baby.</p>
          <p eId="para_540"> I thank the Minister of State for all the work she is doing in this area. I know she is doing much work along with officials from the Department of Health. I wish her well on this journey. I also give our support do what she is trying to do and achieve in this Bill. I ask her not to forget the surrogates to whom I refer.</p>

          <from>Deputy Louise O'Reilly<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T16:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_541">Sinn Féin will be supporting this Bill in principle. We welcome the regulatory framework for assisted human reproduction, which will standardise access to and rights around IVF surrogacy and related research. This is a piece of legislation on which people have been waiting a very long time. The Minister of State and I can agree on this. People who have been in this Chamber much longer than us have been having these debates for a long time. It is very welcome, therefore, that we have reached this point.</p>
          <p eId="para_542"> Notwithstanding that, the Bill is not perfect and amendments will need to be made. I hope the Minister of State will be open to amendments and to listening to people. There are those for whom the struggle to start a family or complete their family is very real. Just because it might not be in her personal experience or mine, we should really listen to and be led by them. They are the ones really who are at the coalface in the context of this matter. It is estimated that one in six couples in Ireland is affected by infertility. It is a condition that can cause considerable social, emotional and psychological distress. When one meets with the families, which I know the Minister of State has, that is very real and evident. It is something people do not really understand because, for many, it is a simple thing and they do not think about it. Maybe not thinking about it is the reason it happens in the first place. It is not a struggle everybody faces but the fact is that one in six couples do. We do not talk about it very much. We talk about it more now than when I was younger but we do not talk about it enough because there is still something of a stigma attached. The message can and should go out from this Chamber that we are willing and open to have that conversation.</p>
          <p eId="para_543"> Alongside that, access to IVF treatment it is not currently available publicly and the private costs are absolutely extortionate. People get themselves into the most awful crippling debt just to be able to start or complete their family. It is really important that any decent health system would provide for compassionate services for women who experience infertility, including assisted human reproduction and IVF. Those services should include full cycles of IVF for qualifying couples as well as access to a full range of treatment options and counselling. The counselling and mental health aspect is absolutely essential; it is important to acknowledge that. There is a clear recognition of the need to adapt to modern requirements and modern methods and approaches to family creation.</p>
          <p eId="para_544"> There is a fear that the Bill will not go far enough, which is why I absolutely welcome the Minister of State's willingness to engage. Stakeholders told me they believe this Bill does not address the issues, such as a lack of route to legal parentage other than adoption for an intending mother of a child born through surrogacy. We must ensure that there are full rights for both parents. However that is done, we will work with the Minister of State to make sure it happens.</p>

          <p eId="para_545">I would like to send good wishes to the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, for a speedy recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_546"> The Social Democrats support this legislation. I hope there will be an open approach on Committee Stage and on Report Stage in terms of taking on board proposals and suggestions from the Opposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_547"> For far too long, assisted human reproduction practices in this country have remained unregulated. That has been very problematic. Responsibility for the provision of services has, in effect, been outsourced to the private sector. It has been 17 years - a long time - since the publication of the report of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction, which, among other things, recommended that a child born through surrogacy should be presumed to be that of what are termed the commissioning parents. In the intervening years, there has been no legislative response at all, making Ireland the only EU state with no specific legislation governing the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_548"> This abdication of responsibility has forced many heterosexual couples, LGBTQ+ couples and single people into the commercial fertility sector. It has also meant that many couples and single people can no longer aspire to parenthood. A public model of fertility care is really long overdue but the roll-out of this has been dogged by a delay after delay. This lack of urgency has meant that Ireland remains what many people have referred to as a laggard in this regard and reinforces the perception that such treatments are reserved only for those who are better off.</p>
          <p eId="para_549"> From a legislative perspective too, though, I will make the point that it is highly unsatisfactory that there has been such a long gap between the heads of the Bill being produced, pre-legislative scrutiny taking place and then the draft Bill being published. It is really unsatisfactory. It goes back so many years that very few people who will be dealing with the Bill now in this Dáil would have been involved in the pre-legislative scrutiny. That is completely unsatisfactory and goes completely against the whole intention of the greater scrutiny and pre-legislative scrutiny process itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_550"> From the outset, we all recognise the most glaring omission from this legislation, which is the issue of international surrogacy. Section 50 states that "a surrogacy agreement is a permitted surrogacy only where the surrogacy is a domestic surrogacy", thereby failing to recognise international commercial surrogacy arrangements. I fully appreciate that the new all-party committee has been established to look at the whole issue of international surrogacy and make recommendations. The reality is that many parents and children have been left in a legal limbo. Understandably, when there was the option to participate in international surrogacy, many people availed of it but they have been left now in a legal limbo. In many ways, that is unforgivable and has raised some of the most fundamental issues and questions for those families concerned, both for the parents and also for the children. I certainly urge the new committee, while wishing it well and hoping it will complete its work in the timeline outlined, to acknowledge it is really important that as well as making recommendations on policy with regard to international surrogacy going forward, there is a real urgency about addressing that legal limbo in which so many existing parents find themselves along with their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">Those legal gaps need to be addressed as a matter of urgency. Section 50 states that "a surrogacy agreement is a permitted surrogacy only where the surrogacy is a domestic surrogacy". As I said, that fails to recognise the whole question of international commercial surrogacy arrangements. I completely accept the legal and ethical difficulties associated with this matter. It is regrettable that we are debating this legislation in the absence of provisions relating to international surrogacy. Like other speakers, I would ask the Minister of State to give a commitment. While this is urgent and while we need to see this Bill passed as quickly as possible, it just will not work for us to take Committee Stage in the absence of the report from the all-party committee that has been established. I would like confirmation that we will await the report from that committee and that we will take its recommendations on board. That is important. It will obviously be a further delay. Again, people will have to remind themselves of all the issues involved. It is by no means the ideal way to progress legislation. However, I would like a commitment that as soon as the all-party committee has completed its work that we will then proceed to schedule the Committee Stage debate relating to this legislation. As stated previously, the gaps in the legislation have been well flagged. They could not have taken the Government by surprise. The special committee was needed to consider this issue and to make recommendations. This should, of course, have been done long before the Bill began its passage through the legislative process, and not concurrently with it. Notwithstanding this peculiar situation, I would like to make some points in respect of international surrogacy. I am in favour of the altruistic model provided for in the Bill, but that does not mean that we can ignore the reality of commercial surrogacy in other jurisdictions. Even if we provide for domestic surrogacy, it is widely accepted that some people will continue to seek services outside Ireland. Whether we agree or disagree with practices in other jurisdictions, we must protect the rights of children who are born in this way and we must protect the rights of parents. The whole area of children's rights is a major element in this. It continues to be a major consideration. In 2020, the Government requested that the special rapporteur on child protection, Professor Conor O’Mahony, would examine the implications of donor-assisted human reproduction and surrogacy for children. This report, which was submitted in December 2020, recommended immediate and comprehensive surrogacy legislation to deal with both domestic and international surrogacy. Notwithstanding this recommendation to provide for both instances, Professor O’Mahony raised a caveat by stating that domestic arrangements should be incentivised. I support that. He also recommended that international surrogacy should involve a genetic link between the child and at least one intending parent to act as a safeguard against the sale and trafficking of children. That is sadly a reality in a number of different countries. There are indications that the trafficking of children is even on the increase. As a result, we always have to bear in mind that there is huge potential for the sale and trafficking of children, which must be avoided at all costs. These recommendations were made on the basis of two principles: first an acceptance of the reality of surrogacy as an international phenomenon and, second, the best interests of the child. In respect of the first principle, he pointed to Ireland’s legal obligations to comply with the minimum requirements of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and with the European Convention on Human Rights. For example, Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights requires states parties to provide a pathway to legal recognition of parent-child relationships arising from international surrogacy in all cases that involve a genetic link between the child and the parents. This is an obligation that we have yet to honour. With regard to the second principle, which is the best interests of the child, he points to certain inalienable rights. These include a child's right to family life, identity and non-discrimination. These rights must underpin this debate. We may want to prohibit commercial surrogacy, and we should certainly do that domestically. However, it would be remiss of us to ignore the availability of international surrogacy. The best interests of the child should be our primary consideration, as should the special joint Oireachtas committee. I have no doubt that it will be. Other concerns have been raised regarding the proposed provisions relating to domestic surrogacy. Section 62 only provides for the regulation of gestational surrogacy where the surrogate mother is genetically related to the child. It does not provide for traditional surrogacy where the surrogate's egg would be fertilised. While I appreciate the fears that traditional surrogacy could be more unstable than non-genetic arrangements, it seems to be the case that international evidence does not support these concerns. In the UK, for example, more than 50% of surrogates carry using their own eggs. In New Zealand, the figure is 60%. Research has shown that these arrangements are not any more unstable than non-genetic arrangements. Crucially, though, the omission of this approach from the legislation would exclude single people and couples who cannot produce sperm or eggs from surrogacy. These are important questions that need to be addressed. I hope that the Minister will address these issues on Committee Stage, because many people find it difficult to understand why that particular form of surrogacy has been omitted. The exclusion of traditional surrogacy is somewhat perplexing in light of the provisions in sections 63 and 64. My understanding is that traditional surrogacy arrangements are not provided for in the proposed regime. That is my understanding of it. I would like clarification on the matter. The reason for that is to ensure that surrogates have no genetic connection to the child. However, the Bill states that at birth, gestational surrogates will be the legal mothers and that the intended parents will need to apply to the court to seek a parental order. The assumption is, therefore, that the woman who carried the baby will be the legal mother. Then action must be taken on the part of the intended parents, who have to apply to the court to seek a parental order. The surrogate mother must consent to this transfer. This can only be waived if she is either deceased or cannot be located. This process would be completely understandable in the case of traditional surrogacy where the surrogate is the genetic mother, but it is less so in respect of gestational surrogacy. As the lecturer in child and family law, Dr. Brian Tobin, recently wrote in the <i>Irish Examiner, </i>one would be forgiven for thinking that this regime had been designed to make domestic surrogacy as perilous an undertaking as possible for Irish intended parents. While the international evidence indicates that the vast majority of surrogate mothers do not see themselves as the mothers of the children they have gestated, I am not certain that this provides sufficient reassurance to intended parents. This restrictive approach and the degree of risk certainly raises questions about this entire approach. It could result in disincentivising intended parents from availing of surrogacy in Ireland and, in turn, incentivise the very thing the special rapporteur on child protection warned against, which is international surrogacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_552"> Part 8 deals with the establishment and role of the assisted human reproduction regulatory authority. One of its most important functions will be the approval of surrogacy arrangement applications. This is a vital and much-needed role, primarily to ensure the proposed surrogate is suitable and not subject to any form of exploitation. A point made in some submissions on the general scheme of the Bill is that the surrogate is the most vulnerable party in any arrangement, bearing the negative emotional, physical and lifestyle risks of pregnancy. Therefore, her health and well-being needs to be central to any decision. Separately, given the pace of change and development in assisted human reproduction practices, it will be crucial that this authority be adequately resourced and staffed, not only to ensure the appropriate ethical and scientific oversight of proposed research and services but also in order that it will have teeth to intervene in disputes and handle complaints. Finally in respect of the regulatory authority, I urge the Minister to ensure that patient voices be represented strongly. Integrating the lived experience of people who have undergone fertility treatment into the regulatory process will be important, not least in the early days of the authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_553"> Aside from the provisions of the Bill, I raise one further issue with the Ministers of State. As I have previously said, the introduction of these services needs to be accelerated and I hope this legislation will be enacted speedily. It has been almost five years since the previous Cabinet approved the draft legislation. It took a further two years for the current Minister's predecessor, Deputy Harris, to publish details of the model of care for fertility, yet little progress has been made for many people. This is despite an assurance from the then Minister that publicly funded IVF services would be available in 2021. Not even the first phase of the three-stage model-of-care plan has been completed. While it is certainly welcome that four of the six regional fertility hubs are now operational, these hubs do not provide IVF, sperm donation or surrogacy services. They deal only with tests, diagnostic surgery and some non-invasive forms of assisted reproductive technology, thereby excluding single women, female couples and male couples. For those who can avail of fertility services in these hubs, the HSE's target maximum wait time is six months. In view of the current staffing situation and waiting lists throughout the health service, it is difficult to see how this target can be met. Furthermore, many female patients simply do not have time to wait because time is of the essence, as we know, particularly if they want to avail of less invasive or complex fertility services.</p>
          <p eId="para_554"> We all accept that a number of complex medical, ethical and legal considerations are associated with the provision of assisted human reproduction services. This issue raises difficult questions, but many people have suffered significant emotional and financial turmoil while successive Governments have grappled with the issue. Some have been forced to find services elsewhere, suffering losses abroad, while others have accumulated substantial debts. This cannot be forgotten, and I urge the Minister to expand supports for those who have fallen between the cracks. Given the costs and the emotional toll associated with assisted human reproduction, simply covering the costs of medicines falls far short of what is needed. We cannot continue to ignore and export our problems. Ireland has changed and our systems must respond. Women are spending longer in education and pursuing careers in far greater numbers. Same-sex marriages have been legal since 2015. The Gender Recognition Act was passed in that same year. These are just some examples of the changes that have occurred while our system has lagged behind. It is time it caught up with the realities of modern life. While an improvement in bringing forward this legislation is heralded, it does not address the entirety of the issues concerned. I hope the Minister will have an open mind when it comes to enhancing the legislation, not only in terms of incorporating the recommendations of the cross-party committee but also by having an open mind in listening to the proposals from the Opposition and taking on board amendments.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jennifer Murnane O'Connor<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T16:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_555">I welcome any legislation that seeks to provide a framework for regulating surrogacy and addressing the gaps in the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015. It is good that the Bill will provide, for the first time in Ireland, regulation of this wide-ranging and technology-centred area of healthcare. Nevertheless, it is sad that the time spent waiting for this legislation to pass has no doubt seen many couples pass the age when they could have had a child via AHR. Almost none of the recommendations of the Government's special rapporteur on child protection have been included in the Bill, such as those relating to the pre-birth transfer of the parentage of a child born through AHR treatment or the ability of those under the age of 16 to access their birth information even through their parents, although it is good that those over the age of 16 will have that ability. Furthermore, there is nothing in the regulations regarding international surrogacy arrangements. It is a big issue that the legal recognition of children already born through AHR treatment is tied into the delicate issue of international surrogacy. They are very separate issues, with one much less complicated than the other, but we seem to be treating them the same and that is a big concern for me.</p>
          <p eId="para_556"> The current legislation governing the legal relationship that children born through AHR treatment can establish with their intended parent includes the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 and the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017. Some children born through AHR treatment procedures can establish legal parent-child relationships with their intended parents. Children born in Ireland using IUI, IVF or reciprocal IVF who were conceived in an Irish fertility clinic can be recognised as the legal child of their intended parents. The same cannot be said, however, for those born through surrogacy. I was happy to attend the inaugural meeting of the first Oireachtas Joint Committee on International Surrogacy today. There are so many issues we can talk about and, I hope, sort out in our important discussions as a surrogacy committee. The committee membership is really good and it is important we address all the issues that need to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_557"> We have all seen the pictures emerging from Ukraine of babies who were born through surrogacy being cared for in shelters in the war-torn country because their legal citizenship is in question. Several couples who have had a child born through surrogacy in Ukraine had to be assisted by the Department of Foreign Affairs at the outset of the war because of the complications in the country. I have met families with experience of surrogacy who have told me of being forced to sit in a car while they waited for their child to receive treatment alone in the hospital, alone because they were not viewed as the legal guardian of their child who had been born through surrogacy. That does not serve the best interests of the child and the law here lets down such children. This is a big issue that has been raised me when I have met groups and it has to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_558"> I regret that we have sidestepped this issue with this legislation, although I welcome the opportunity to tease out the issue in committee and I commit to working on the issue on behalf of the groups I represent. I welcome the changes that have been made to this legislation since the general scheme was published in 2017. It is welcome also that, for the purposes of the Bill, an adult is deemed to be anyone over the age of 16 and, therefore, as I mentioned earlier, surrogate and donor-assisted children will be able to access birth information. That issue of access is something I have spoken about in the context of many other types of legislation. I welcome also the removal of mandatory counselling for donors, but this was removed in order to enable donations from abroad. It gives me pause that we have not addressed international surrogacy in a similar way. We have removed only the language causing confusion about those who wish to seek legal advice about international surrogacy. This issue and others I have been reading about are ones for the committee to consider.</p>
          <p eId="para_559"> It is vital we develop a model of care for infertility to ensure the provision of safe, effective and accessible services through the public health system.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">Fertility treatment is currently not available to public patients in Ireland although the tax relief for medical expenses scheme can be availed of. An attempt at IVF costs up to €5,000. Usually, there are many attempts. I have been speaking to parents who have come to me and they just cannot afford it. It is not one attempt. This is something that we need to address urgently.</p>
          <p eId="para_561"> In addition, there is the heartbreaking issue of a cancer diagnosis coupled with a man or woman seeking to have cancer treatment but also preserve his or her fertility. The issue becomes a larger one. Funding for the fertility preservation services for those with a diagnosis of cancer is currently €259,000. This has been in place since 2003 without increase, despite a growing demand for the service. If there is a real possibility of State funding for fertility treatment, which is important so that there is an equal chance for all families to try fertility solutions that suit their circumstances despite the odds, the provision of fertility preservation needs to be seen as part of these services.</p>
          <p eId="para_562"> For a female, up to the age of approximately 45, one of the first issues that will be thought about in the event of a diagnoses of cancer is future fertility, particularly for those who do not already have children. More and more women and men are surviving cancer and having their own biological child should not be denied to them if there is any way we can help. That needs to be another commitment from the committee. We need to make sure that we give everybody that chance. We must not continue to ignore the needs of society. Families cannot afford it.</p>
          <p eId="para_563"> This legislation could be so good but there are significant concerns. The biggest concern is money. Money is a major issue here.</p>
          <p eId="para_564"> Children born through fertility treatment or preservation are children who are wanted and loved long before they are born and will grow up to contribute to society.</p>
          <p eId="para_565"> To see this Bill progress, the Government's plan to introduce the provision of advanced assisted human reproduction, AHR, treatment, including IVF, in the public health system, specifically through the final phase of the roll-out of the model of care for infertility is really good news for me. I raised this issue when I was a Senator and have been passionate about it ever since.</p>
          <p eId="para_566"> Timing is crucial. We need to do what we can and get it done as quick as we can with everybody working together to make sure nobody is left behind.</p>

          <p eId="para_567">I welcome the fact this Bill has been published and that progress has now been made on setting standards around accessing rights when it comes to IVF, surrogacy and the complex matters connected to them. This is a positive development and is welcome for many families. We must ensure it is subject to careful examination as it makes its way through the Oireachtas in order that we do full justice for many families out there.</p>
          <p eId="para_568"> An important point to note here is that while the Bill does not deal with international surrogacy arrangements, this will be examined by the recently established Special Joint Committee on International Surrogacy. The work the committee will undertake is of vital importance to many families and I trust that when the committee issues its recommendations, those recommendations will be listened to and the witness accounts the committee hears will be acted on. We must not see a repeat of what we have seen with the recommendations of other committees in which lip-service is paid but preconceived ideas are followed through instead.</p>
          <p eId="para_569"> Sinn Féin has always stressed the need for a regulatory framework which upholds the rights of children born through surrogacy. This is a move in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_570"> While this Bill will assist so many families, we need clarity that the parental and guardianship rights of children born through surrogacy will apply to families which already exist. We cannot allow any more inconsistencies or shortcomings in the areas of rights to continue into the future. As I said, certainty from the Minister is needed in the area of retrospective parentage. Any such shortcomings can have consequences down the line, both foreseen and unforeseen.</p>
          <p eId="para_571"> This Bill is also important from the perspective of non-surrogacy AHR, such as IVF. Ireland is the only state in the EU that does not offer publicly-funded IVF treatment. As a result, the high costs couples are faced with are a matter of great concern and can mean the difference as to whether they can plan to have a family of their own or not.</p>
          <p eId="para_572"> In 2017, the cost of a single IVF cycle in Ireland was between €4,100 and €5,900 and the cost of an intracytoplasmic sperm injection, ICSI, treatment was between €5,200 and €6,400. The Minister knows precisely the cost facing parents who find themselves facing this challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_573"> In publishing the Bill, the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, said, "The commencement of the AHR legislation will also allow us to progress the ... plan to introduce the provision of advanced AHR treatment, including IVF, in the public health system, specifically through the final phase of the roll-out of the Model of Care for Infertility." We, therefore, need certainty that the Government will fully implement the model of care for infertility and a timeline through which we can ensure patients always receive care at the appropriate level of clinical intervention. This assurance needs to be provided for those who require and are eligible for advanced treatment, such as IVF, and are able to access the same through the public health service.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paul Murphy<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T17:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_574">I wish to share time with Deputy Barry.</p>
          <p eId="para_575"> I welcome the Bill and the establishment of the authority as a late and small step towards tackling the reality of Ireland as being in the Wild West when it comes to fertility care. The problem is that the Bill does not do anything in terms of the public provision of fertility care, in particular IVF, and, therefore, does not really address the key issue that Ireland is, according to a report launched by a Fine Gael MEP no less, Ms Frances Fitzgerald, the fourth worst in all of Europe in terms of the provision of fertility care and the only country in the European Union which does not provide any public funding for the provision of IVF.</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> This is not a new issue. This is not a new procedure. IVF was included in the list of universal healthcare entitlements to be introduced under Sláintecare. According to the 2017 Sláintecare report, a universal health system means one that is "accessible to all on the basis of need, free at the point of delivery (or at the lowest possible cost)." Therefore, this should clearly apply to IVF as a universal healthcare entitlement. Nothing has been done to progress this despite Sláintecare nominally being a policy that everybody across politics supposedly agrees to.</p>
          <p eId="para_577"> Since 2016, when the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, first promised public funding for IVF, we have heard repeated promises from successive health Ministers to publicly-fund IVF but nothing has happened over the past five years and no timeframe for public funding of IVF has yet been provided by the Department of Health. What does that mean for people? The impact is immense on many people. One is not talking about a small group of people here. One-in-six couples experiences fertility issues. On a yearly basis, it looks like 11,000 IVF cycles are carried out, which would probably translate to approximately 5,000 or 6,000 couples on a yearly basis. That is those who can afford it in the context of the current unaffordable and astronomically-high prices for that fertility treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_578"> For many people, this is something personal. It is in their relationship. They are struggling to have a child and they do not necessarily want to speak out publicly about it. They do not want to speak to reporters about it or whatever, and also, for some, there can be a certain residual stigma. It is a situation where people should not have to speak out but, unfortunately, in this situation where the Government ignores this issue and refuses to provide the funding as part of the provision of a proper publicly-funded national health service, people have had no choice but to speak out about their experiences to make this real. A number of people, for example, spoke to the noteworthy investigation at the end of last year. I commend them on speaking out about their personal experience to make this real and to explain what having a cost of tens of thousands of euro, the debt, the stress on their relationship, etc., means for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_579"> I want to add my experience and the experience of my partner to that list of experiences. We have been going through IVF for more than a year. Even putting the money aside, it is a significant stress on people. Above all, it is a significant stress on my partner. She is the one who has to get all the hormone injections. She is the one who has to go through the disappointment when it does not work at the end of a cycle and then there is a discussion about whether to go again and continue with the cycle of raised expectations and lowered expectations.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">There is disruption in terms of work, due to the time that has to be taken to go to the clinic again and again and the disruption to life on a daily basis. Throughout different parts of the cycle, my partner has to be stuck with a syringe by me twice a day. It is a huge burden on her, in particular, but on couples as a whole, in general.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> Then we come to the issue of money. It is hard enough for people to have to go through that in order to be able to give themselves the best chance of having a child, but then there is the associated cost. I have heard many people talk about the level of costs and, to be honest, they have not looked into it enough because they are talking about the average costs being €4,000, €5,000 or €6,000. That is the average cost on the price list to have IVF, but what people do not realise is that they have to do a whole bunch of other stuff that is also on the price list in order for the IVF to work. Already, we are talking about significantly more money. We have already spent probably €12,000 and we could end up spending more money and it may or may not work at the end of it. We must remember that for many people who want to have kids, they simply cannot afford to do it. Therefore, by not having public provision of IVF, the Government is saying to them there is unequal access to them having the best chance they can of having a child. It is morally wrong that it is determined by how much wealth someone has. Other people get into significant amounts of debt, which adds extra stress to their lives and relationships. It is simply not acceptable to continue with the current situation. What we need is free public provision of fertility healthcare as part of a national health service, up to and including IVF.</p>
          <p eId="para_582"> When the Government has spoken about it, it has talked about having public provision through the public system rather than being outsourced to private clinics. However, for example, the clinical director of Merrion Fertility Clinic, Professor Mary Wingfield, said there is no infrastructure or trained staff to provide the complex treatment of IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection, ICSI, in our public facilities. In her opinion, "it would most likely need to be outsourced to private clinics." That continues with the problem. I accept we will have a regulatory authority, but the problem of having for-profit medicine, especially in such an area where people are encouraged to pay for all sorts of stuff that is not medically proven to add anything, is an horrendous situation. By the public simply paying for this outsourcing, there are significant extra costs from the point of view of ordinary people because of the impact of profit. If we take the current under-resourced health system and say it is going to provide IVF, we are going to run into trouble because then we will have two-tier access, which is bad in all sorts of medical circumstances where time is of the essence, which is the case here. We will have a situation where, in theory, people could sign up for IVF, but they will be on a list for two or three years or for however long. As people who are going through it know, the chances of having a child successfully at a certain point, just drop precipitously in a year or two, makes a very big difference. Again, unless we provide for it properly and employ the proper staff and bring the knowledge in-house into the public system, then we are going to perpetuate a two-tier system.</p>
          <p eId="para_583"> This is linked to the question of the separation of church and State. It is not an accident that Ireland is the only country in the EU without public provision, considering the church dominance of our hospitals. The Catholic church remains completely opposed to IVF, yet the Government continues to want to effectively hand over ownership of the new national maternity hospital to the church. There needs to be separation of church and State and the building of a properly funded national health service, free from any church influence whatsoever. We must ensure that sufficient resources are put in so that everyone can have equal access. We are all born differently. That can create problems for certain couples, which means it is more difficult for them to have children than others, but with the benefits of modern medicine, we can go a significant way to helping people overcome those difficulties. We add an extra burden when we say people must have a lot of money or be able and willing to go into debt in order to do it. That is wrong. The Government can and should address it but, unfortunately, it looks like significant campaigning will be necessary to put pressure on the Government to do so.</p>

          <p eId="para_584">I am speaking to bring a socialist feminist analysis to this debate. Socialist feminism opposes cynical attempts to commercialise and make private profit out of the heartbreaking fertility issues prospective parents face. It opposes all attempts to profit from the systemic sexist and homophobic inequality rife in capitalist society. This includes recognising that infertility is a common and significant health concern that should be addressed via the public health service. Socialist feminism means standing for a totally secular state-of-the-art comprehensive public health service, free at the point of delivery, that actively seeks to eliminate the well documented, systemic medical misogyny.</p>
          <p eId="para_585"> Socialist feminism rejects patriarchal and backward views of the family that propagate rigid gender roles. It recognises that all sorts of diverse carers can make excellent parents, including same-sex couples, those who play a parent role who do not have a genetic connection to the child, single parents and gender non-conforming parents and actively seeks to bring men into caring roles equally. Socialist feminism seeks to make care something that is central to society, not something that is denigrated, undervalued, underpaid and also commercialised, as it is in capitalist society.</p>
          <p eId="para_586"> On the question of IVF, the current situation is a disaster for the vast majority of prospective parents who have to individually navigate an unregulated private system often with prohibitive costs involved. People get plunged into significant debt. Despite promises in 2019, there is still no access to IVF through the HSE. Meanwhile, successive Governments have essentially facilitated profiteers at the top of private industries. A number of companies that own private fertility clinics in Ireland reported profits in the millions, according to <i>thejournal.ie</i> in December. Access to IVF and other treatments as part of the national health service is the norm across Europe. In Scotland, for example, in the national health service, patients are offered up to three free cycles of IVF. This should be immediately brought in here without any further delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_587"> We must go further than just regulation of private operators. We must have access to free-at-the-point-of-use treatments for infertility. The funding for treatment that the Government has long promised and long delayed cannot just be a funnelling of funds into the private industry. There needs to be training up of staff and massive investment in the public health system so that these essential services can be delivered there. The public health system is already under-resourced. There are currently more than 30,000 adults waiting to see a gynaecologist, 6,000 of them are waiting for more than a year. Ireland is way behind most countries. It is a laggard in these respects. The legacy of the Catholic church and its continued influence in the healthcare system is a key factor. There needs to be cast-iron guarantees that access to IVF and other treatments that are not approved by the Catholic church will be available in all hospitals. This means the removal of any vestige of church influence on hospital boards and a rethink of the Government's decisions and current approach to the new national maternity hospital, which incredibly threatens to put reproductive healthcare back into the orbit of a religious order.</p>
          <p eId="para_588"> Given the sorry history of the State on matters of child welfare and women's health, I will be tabling amendments for democratic oversight of the assisted human reproduction regulatory authority. At a minimum, there will have to be representation on this board from children's rights advocates, workers in healthcare, human rights advocates and those with a record in campaigning for the rights of women.</p>
          <p eId="para_589"> I welcome the opposition to commercial surrogacy in the Bill. It is a global industry rife with ruthless profiteering and the exploitation of poverty and desperation in underdeveloped parts of the world. There are many cases of women caught in poverty who sign up to be surrogates often in order to have enough money to feed their children. Meagre pay, withholding of pay if the pregnancy ends tragically early, examples of companies that do not allow the surrogate mother even to touch the baby after it is born, which is incredibly cruel to the baby and surrogate mother, are all widely reported. Callously linking that to people who often have heart-breaking health complications and desperately want to love and care for a child, in order to turn a profit, truly makes this a grotesque industry that profits from and perpetuates gender inequality. In 2020, this global industry was worth more than $4 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_590"> I support those aspects of the Bill that will give rights to children born through surrogacy. They should have the right to access information and to have contact with their surrogate mothers. The Bill seeks to protect surrogate mothers and allows some important rights for them that I support. It is important, however, to recognise that even with altruistic surrogacy undue pressure can sometimes be exerted on someone to agree to undertake it. Even if that person enters into it freely, the reality that every single pregnancy is a risk to health and, potentially, a risk to life can have major consequences. For example, the risk of preeclampsia, which is potentially life-threatening for the pregnant person and the baby, is greater for surrogates. The assisted human reproduction Act will be important and any new regime must be regularly and democratically reviewed and checked.</p>
          <p eId="para_591"> In a capitalist society, pregnancy not only risks a person's health but impacts on his or her income, pension entitlements, job progression and so on. We need to have a new society that protects pregnant people and ensures that the structural injustices built into the system are challenged. Across the board, there must be access to public childcare, full maternity benefits, full pension rights, two years parental leave, a shorter working week - with no loss of pay - to facilitate care and free healthcare. These types of changes are needed for everyone. Furthermore, any altruistic surrogates should not have to depend on expenses being paid by the intending parents. No person having a child should have to be out of pocket in the short term or in the long run.</p>
          <p eId="para_592"> Capitalism's booming surrogacy industry and the exploitation rife within it is emblematic of how the profit system turns even brilliant medical advancements into an opportunity for private profit, in this instance, in a way that is inextricable from capitalism's systemic gender inequality. A struggle for a socialist society is a struggle to put care at the centre of society and not relegate it to the bottom rung as the for-profit motive consistently does.</p>

          <from>Deputy Neale Richmond<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T17:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_593">Over the past couple of weeks, Deputy Paul Murphy and I have probably spent a lot of time disagreeing with each other. If Deputy Murphy and I are frank, we have spent the past 20 years disagreeing with each other on many issues but there is not a single word he said just now that I cannot agree with 100%. We have to start off from this point. This legislation is so important to so many people outside this House and in it, from all parties and none, that it behoves all of us to add a genuine level of discussion of, and reflection on, what this legislation is seeking to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_594"> While we welcome the legislation in its current form and we will not stop it going past this Stage, it is woefully inadequate and long overdue. Even in its current form, this legislation still leaves us completely out of the European orbit and completely out of step with similar jurisdictions near us. We need to reflect deeply over the coming weeks during the debate in this House, at the committee on surrogacy and in the Seanad on what we are trying to achieve with this vitally important Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_595"> The first area I will address is the costs and supports needed to have a properly funded system of IVF. We do not have any system in this State worth calling appropriate for IVF. We have a private system that very few can afford and genuinely play a part in. Far more people are more willing to take the boat or plane - a dark reference to another part of our chapter in another area of reproductive rights - to Great Britain to seek this service. We have to be honest with ourselves; we are failing the population. When I say "we" I pretty much mean all of us on this side of the House in particular. We have to ensure that we stop talking about a proper, effective, publicly funded system of IVF and just put it in place. It will require a major sacrifice, but it also requires a level of humanity that should not bring any question to the need for that sacrifice.</p>
          <p eId="para_596"> I mentioned costs but another area is that of the follow-up supports for those going through IVF, which includes the prospective mother and her partner but also the wider society, what happens after the child is born and the ongoing medical requirements that are needed. IVF is not necessarily a one-time go. It might take multiple chances before it is successful and it might require multiple chances for a second or third child, if that is the parents' wish. We have to look at it in that context. This is about allowing people to have the same level of equality of opportunity that so many of us simply take for granted.</p>
          <p eId="para_597"> The second area that this Bill simply does not address at all relates to international surrogacy. I welcome the establishment of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on International Surrogacy. It is a good thing but I will be honest that when I brought the news of the setting up of that committee to my constituents and family members of mine who had been campaigning on this issue, they were bereft. They asked why they again had to wait and why they had to wait so much longer before this is a reality. Why is it a fact that by sheer stroke of luck and so much else I do not have to go through any administration? My children are my own, no one questions it, there is no legal process and I do not have to wait three or four years before my daughter can legally be called such. Why is that different from so many other people in my life who are still not legally recognised as the parents of their children? It is utterly wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_598"> I do not know the reason for the delay. I do not know whether it is an administrative delay from a certain Department, a political misunderstanding, political reluctance or, in fact, something more sinister but it is simply unacceptable. We need to see the committee that has been set up allowed to do its work comprehensively and swiftly to ensure that the next time we come at this Bill, be it on Report Stage or Committee Stage, it includes a genuine aspect relating to international surrogacy that provides those parents, Mums and Dads, Mums and Mums, Dads and Dads, and Mums or Dads the exact same rights that by sheer fluke of genetic luck I am granted and do not have to think about. These are rights that so many of us take for granted and ones for which we have to stand up for others.</p>
          <p eId="para_599"> Many of us have had meetings with various representative groups, many of us have sat on Zoom calls and many of us have gone out to the gates of Leinster House, but we cannot in any true sense of ourselves go back to those people and say that we have done a little of what they asked for. We have to do absolutely what they have asked for, which is quite straightforward. They have given us examples from other jurisdictions and sound legal advice. They have got assurances, certainly from Fine Gael, and I know other political parties and political representatives have given them the same assurances. We have that duty of care and that ultimate and most precious responsibility to go back to those people and say there is nothing any longer standing in the way of them being recognised as the parents of their children. We have to bring our archaic and utterly cold system, when it comes to surrogacy, up to date and to a level not just of modernity but genuine compassion.</p>
          <p eId="para_600"> It would be remiss of me not to mention the ongoing war in Ukraine in this context. I must credit the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Justice, which have worked with many families to give them the opportunity to work with their surrogates in Ukraine and to bring their children - they are their children despite what forms might state at present - home to Ireland from Ukraine. There are still a number of people in an extremely worrying situation who are trying to get their surrogates out of Ukraine to safety, not just to have their children but to avoid the violent and oppressive war that Vladimir Putin is waging. On a more practical level, since Ukraine has been the release valve for many of the inadequacies of our State's approach to surrogacy over the past decade or so, many people will now not have the opportunity that others have had over the past couple of years to go to Ukraine to get a surrogate.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">We saw this before with changes in international adoption rules over a decade ago in relation to Vietnam, Thailand and Russia. The fact that the opportunity to go to Ukraine and engage a surrogate and have your own child is being removed from so many people or is being put in peril for those already in the process needs to be addressed by the Government in a realistic and compassionate way and should also motivate us to ensure this legislation and the parallel work of the committee is expedited and that we do not use this as a platform to debate other ethical or non-relevant issues. We have to do everything in our power to stand up for the promises made in the last few weeks and to address the failings over decades which were endured by so many of our brothers and sisters.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ReadaCronin" eId="spk_162">
          <from>Deputy Réada Cronin<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T17:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_602">I am glad to speak on this matter which is of such sensitivity and importance. There is a special onus on the State, given its history on the treatment of women and their babies. We must learn from our history and get things right for the children in order that their rights as citizens are guaranteed. Those of us who have children know what a blessing they are. I hope my children will not mind my saying that they are the loves of my life. However, many of us know the agony and heartbreak of couples who are trying to have babies through IVF. Many of us will have experienced infertility in our extended families. I have seen the weight and the hold of the process physically, mentally, emotionally and financially. That is why, with the opportunity presented in this Bill, as legislators we have the duty to support them. We should do so immediately by making IVF affordable on the public health system and not confined to the private system. We should make every effort to assist people who are trying to start a family and rear the next generation. I want to take the opportunity to wish Deputy Paul Murphy and his partner every good wish in their desire to start a family.</p>
          <p eId="para_603"> Sinn Féin welcomes the Bill in principle. For the first time there is a specific regulatory framework for all assisted reproduction treatments and associated research. However, there are two omissions. The first concerns international surrogacy arrangements. There is much in the news around Ukraine now and that matter is being dealt with by a special committee. This is vital when there is so much uncertainty about babies born, their legal parentage and citizenship, all against the backdrop of Putin's war. They cannot and must not be left in legal limbo or stateless. It would be a grave wrong to these children who have barely spent a few weeks in the world. We also have a duty of care to the women who are carrying these much-wanted children. Second, there is the retrospective recognition of parentage. We also have a duty to ensure that the child and each of their parents, where there is more than one, have full rights. This is particularly important in the event of the death of a parent with guardianship rights where the other parent may not have completed the legal process of becoming a parent-guardian of the child. We must make every effort to protect and solidify the family arrangement and give the people involved the security and peace of mind that they need.</p>
          <p eId="para_604"> I started by saying that we have a particular onus on us here because of our history on the treatment of women and their children. I am concerned about profiteering around surrogacy and the protection of the women carrying the children. We must tread carefully. Thinking of what happened with the mother and babies and the debates that we had around abortion, we cannot make mistakes again. We must be very careful.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PeadarToibin" eId="spk_163">
          <from>Deputy Peadar Tóibín<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T17:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_605">I also thank Deputy Paul Murphy for adding his personal story to the debate. I wish him and his partner the best of luck in their endeavours. The issues at the heart of this Bill are incredibly important and significant. They range from the families which desperately seek to have a child but cannot to the rights of the child to have a family and know their mother and father to the rights that affect the mother who carries to term. There are many examples, unfortunately, of the dark exploitation of surrogate mothers in poor countries around the world. We must be cognisant of that. It is very important that as we develop this Bill that we do so in a balance of all those rights. There will be many different opinions around where the balance lies and there is potentially significant human cost if the equilibrium of rights is not protected. This is an extremely complex moral area. Some would say that it is a minefield.</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> Many families around the country have been broken-hearted in their efforts over years to have a child. The challenges faced by those families cannot be over-estimated in any way. We, as a country, need to make sure that couples seeking to have a child are given every support possible to have their son and daughter. We also have to make sure that the rights of the child are protected. I believe that the child is probably the most important consideration in this whole discussion. Wherever the balance lies with the competing rights, we need to ensure that the full rights of the child are protected. In relation to what the previous speaker said, we have a long and difficult history in relation to children struggling to find who their biological parents are. I am not comparing assisted human reproduction to what happened in the mother and baby homes or to the shocking history of illegal adoption in the State; they are different in their intent and delivery. However we cannot have a situation where children do not have access to the information about their biological parents or the mother who carried them. We need to ensure that the information is accessible to them in a practical way in order that they can trace their biological parent. We owe it to future generations that we get this right. It would be incredible if we discuss this Bill and the future regime in parallel with discussing the rights of children who have been adopted or who have been born in mother and baby homes and that we do not learn from the mistakes of those years in this respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> International surrogacy can take place by many ways: an intended mother's egg and the intended father's sperm; the intended mother's egg and donor sperm; the surrogate mother's egg and the intended father's sperm; the surrogate mother's egg and the donor's sperm; the donor egg and the intended-father sperm and the donor egg and sperm or the donor embryo. These are all significantly different levels of surrogacy and complexity and all have different effects on children. Motherhood exists in all these situations but in some, it exists in multiple forms. There can be a birth mother, a biological mother and an intended mother all at the same time for a child. The idea that motherhood is split three ways for a child is potentially a significant difficulty and challenge to a child in their future. There are also different types of surrogacy: there is altruistic surrogacy where the surrogate mother wants to help the couple to try to have their child without getting financial reward and there is also commercial surrogacy, where the surrogate mother who carries the baby does so in exchange for payment. These types of surrogacy arrangements are unregulated in this State. Like many people, I am very concerned with the dangers presented by commercial surrogacy. It can lead to significant exploitation of women in poor countries. Many countries have banned commercial surrogacy due to the threat of exploitation. In India, for example, in one year in one province, €2.3 billion was raised through commercial surrogacy leading to moves to ban the practice there. For-profit surrogacy is banned in Canada, Denmark, New Zealand, Britain and most of Australia. Bulgaria, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Spain prohibit all forms of surrogacy. So actually, the legalisation or regulation of the provision of surrogacy would not mean that Ireland was joining the rest of the world on this but rather that it is leaving it. There are only three countries in Europe where commercial surrogacy is legal, namely, Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. There are serious ethical concerns around the surrogacy agencies in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. There are many examples where safeguards around the sale and trafficking of children have not been put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">Any law that discusses surrogacy must ensure that is not allowed in any fashion and is completely prohibited. Ellen Coyne has reported for the <i>Irish Independent</i> on some of these shocking situations. She reported on a woman who was pregnant with a surrogate baby but was not able to flee the war in Ukraine as the contracts signed would not be applicable if that mother left Ukraine. She reported in 2012 that a Californian lawyer was given a prison sentence for her role in what was described as a baby-selling ring involving Ukrainian surrogates. Ellen Coyne has also reported on the BioTexCom surrogacy company that stated on its website that the cheapest surrogacy in Europe is in Ukraine because it is the poorest European country. The same company also advertised a Black Friday sale surrounded by pictures of children. I find it very difficult to raise those shocking situations in the Dáil, especially because it is such a sensitive sector and because there are so many families who want the best for their children and would not tolerate that type of situation but who still want to access a service that provides surrogacy to them. However, it is really important. We have a responsibility to ensure profiteering and exploitation are rooted out completely. It must not be tolerated. To have a conversation and not recognise the existence of it in this sector would be absolutely wrong as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> This Bill governs surrogacy that occurs in Ireland, not-for-profit surrogacy and surrogacy where there is a genetic link between one of the intending parents and the child but it has nothing to say about the continuing practice of international commercial surrogacy. That is a problem and a difficulty. I am on the committee that met for the first time today to discuss international surrogacy. I am learning a lot about it and would say much, if not most of the country has a lot to learn about this whole area and all the difficulties and complexities that exist in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_610"> I am also concerned about the increasing practice there is to screen out people with disabilities via prenatal diagnostics. We live in a very harsh world at the moment. We celebrated World Down Syndrome Day this week yet in countries such as Iceland and Denmark no children are born with Down Syndrome anymore due to non-invasive pregnancy testing that leads to the screening out of children in most cases, and they are aborted before they make it to term. In the last week, the parties in the North of Ireland voted for abortion for children with Down Syndrome right up to birth - an incredible situation. This Bill will allow for prenatal diagnostics, I understand, of embryos of children with disabilities. As we know from science, an embryo is a living individual human being and this Bill will allow for the regulation of those embryos being discarded and destroyed.</p>
          <p eId="para_611"> For many people living with the complexities involved in assisted human reproduction it is important we have an honest, frank and open debate here. We must ensure that at the heart of this conversation and this Bill we recognise the real need of many couples to have a child and the real difficulties and challenges that process holds for them. However, we must also ensure the rights of the child are central to this. Those must be the pre-eminent rights in this whole process. We cannot make the mistakes of previous generations in this country with respect to identity, access to biological information and access to information about mothers and fathers and mothers who carry the child. That information must be available to children. I also believe very strongly that if we create a situation where commercial surrogacy is allowed in this State, that will allow for situations of profiteering, exploitation and for the difficulties I have mentioned to exist in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_612"> I hope the Minister will be able to take amendments. We have very regularly seen Bills go through this House where there has been a very strict adherence to the letter of the original drafted Bill and no amendments allowed through. On a Bill of this importance, the Government has a responsibility to listen to the collective wisdom, if you can call it that, of the elected representatives here.</p>
          <p eId="para_613"> Is Bille uafásach tábhachtach é seo agus tá go leor cearta ag baint leis. Tá cearta na máthar agus an athar atá ag iarraidh páiste ach nach bhfuil in ann páiste a bheith acu iad féin i gceist.

          <p eId="para_614">Aontaím leis na cainteoirí a labhair níos luaithe. Bhíos ag éisteacht leis an díospóireacht thuas staighre. Is rud coimpléascach é seo. Ag an am céanna, tá sé an-tábhachtach agus aontaím leis an mbéim atá na cainteoirí eile tar éis a chur ar an tábhacht sin. Is annamh an rud é le feiscint go bhfuil beagnach gach duine ag aontú faoi na prionsabail sa Bhille seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_615"> I welcome that this legislation is finally making its way through the Houses. It is much-needed and long awaited. For the first time, all forms of assisted human reproduction will be regulated, including IVF, embryo screening and surrogacy. It has been five years since legislation began to be drafted and more than 15 years since the commission on assisted human reproduction called for new laws in this area. I agree with the comments made by the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, when putting the legislation before Cabinet that it will finally "ensure assisted human reproduction ... practices and [other] related areas ... are conducted in a ... consistent and standardised way and [very importantly] with necessary oversight".</p>
          <p eId="para_616"> The new legislation will provide for a new assisted human reproduction regulatory authority that will be responsible for regulating treatments, licensing and regulating surrogacy, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, embryo screening procedures and posthumous assisted human reproduction, which is where pregnancy is achieved using the gametes of a deceased person. This new regulatory authority will be crucial in providing appropriate clinical care and ensuring appropriate clinical practices in the State for the first time. Most importantly, children born as a result of assisted human reproduction will be at the centre of the process. This legislation will assist thousands of people who wish to have children through AHR and will finally provide legal clarity for families at the centre of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_617"> The area of real concern I see is that by the Department of Health's own admission, the new legislation focuses entirely on this jurisdiction and does not necessarily address international surrogacy. In this respect, I welcome the establishment of a special Oireachtas committee to examine further issues like these as this legislation continues to progress through the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">I understand that the committee will make its recommendations within three months.</p>
          <p eId="para_619"> My other main concern with the legislation is that I am not sure that it makes domestic surrogacy as attractive as commercial surrogacy in other jurisdictions. What is provided for in the Bill is definitely not more attractive than going abroad for surrogacy purposes. While I respect the motivations and intent behind the Bill to make services more accessible for prospective parents, I am not sure that it goes far enough in providing them the necessary legal protections. I would appreciate it if, in his closing comments, the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, made some remarks about the difficulties faced by parents and their new babies when they return to Ireland. Will he clarify whether returning mothers will be entitled to, for example, maternity leave?</p>
          <p eId="para_620"> I broadly welcome the Bill and this debate. In recent years, I have been contacted by many parents who have faced the heavy financial burden of undertaking AHR, the mental consequences and stresses the process can cause, and the legal limbo that many have found themselves in for a long time. I welcome this conversation because it is finally an attempt to do the right thing in what is a complex area.</p>

          <p eId="para_621">It goes without saying that this legislation is welcome. It is a move in the right direction and long overdue. Assisted human reproduction is an area that badly needs a regulatory authority. That one will now be put in place is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_622"> For many years, I have been in contact with a number of people who have experienced fertility issues. They have gone through considerable anguish and problems and incurred great expense. In some cases, it was all for nothing at the end of it. It is a difficult and torturous process. Anything that can be done to ensure better outcomes and journeys for these individuals is something that all of us should try to achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_623"> Surrogacy is a key issue that needs to be addressed. I welcome the new committee, which I understand met for the first time today. It has a large volume of valuable work to do to try to unlock a difficult and complex area. I understand that this Bill will deal with non-commercial surrogacy in Ireland but will not recognise anything beyond that. For many families in this country that now have children who were born to surrogates in other countries, particularly Ukraine, achieving recognition and trying to find a way through the crossword puzzle that has been put in front of them is poses a difficult situation. If we try to find a way to accommodate their right to parentage, it poses another problem because how can we have one child with that right now but another who is born in similar circumstances in the future without it?</p>
          <p eId="para_624"> In fairness to the parents in such situations and who are lobbying to see a change that should rightfully happen, they recognise that there is no simple or easy fix. This is a difficult area for us to work through. If possible, the Dáil should do this necessary work as co-operatively as possible. We all need to work together and try to use every possible means to devise solutions that will fix this problem for the mothers and fathers of young people who, having been born to surrogates abroad, are now growing up in our schools and will one day be our country's future. We also need to find a way of dealing with this issue for others in similar circumstances who will work through non-commercial surrogacies in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_625"> Clearly, this issue will not be sorted out quickly. Instead, it will develop and evolve as we move forward. This Bill and the related moves are welcome, but we have a long way to go.</p>

          <p eId="para_626">I welcome any Bill that brings regulation to practices in Ireland for its citizens. I understand that the number of treatment cycles in 2020 was 9,878 and that no particular treatment procedures have been in place. As such, I welcome the clarity that the Bill will bring. I also understand that the Government is planning to put in place a model of care for infertility treatment. The Bill probably does not go far enough, though, in that it does not cover international surrogacies. A special Oireachtas joint committee has been set up and had its first meeting today.</p>
          <p eId="para_627"> I commend the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his team on their work in bringing home from Ukraine children born by surrogacy and their mothers. Speaking as a father of four and as a grandfather, there is no joy in life like seeing a newborn, healthy baby in the world. Those teenagers who were born by surrogacy in Ukraine or who were adopted from there – I know a fabulous 18-year-old girl who was adopted from there when she was three – are feeling for what they see happening in Ukraine.</p>
          <p eId="para_628"> I have friends and know others who have gone through years of trying to have families – fertility treatments, IVF etc. – and have had beautiful babies. I was recently at the christening of a young boy conceived through IVF. After that six-year journey, it was fantastic to see that family unit.</p>
          <p eId="para_629"> I welcome any legislation that protects children who will be born through surrogacy or IVF in this country, but I hope that we can go further and protect children who have already been, or will be, born through surrogacy and who come to this country from abroad, for example, Ukraine. I thank the people who have created such joy by allowing loving mothers, fathers and partners who, for whatever reason, could not have children themselves to become family units.</p>
          <p eId="para_630"> I also thank those who provide foster care for many children. They have protected young children in difficult circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_631"> I welcome the Bill and any protection that is provided to children.</p>
        </speech>

          <from>Deputy Danny Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T17:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_632">I welcome the Bill. Many parents of babies born through surrogacy have contacted me about anomalies that occurred when they brought their babies home. Many couples are unfortunate, in that they cannot have children of their own. For one reason or another, they have been deprived of this. They then do the next best thing, which is surrogacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_633"> Some years ago, a lady I was very close with lost her life trying to have the baby that she and her husband so dearly wished for. They went through many IVF treatments. This lady was young. She jeopardised her own health and lost her life. She went through so many intense treatments that the family believe they played a part in her death.</p>
          <p eId="para_634"> I have been contacted by a number of couples who are having problems becoming legal parents. Usually, the man can become a legal parent but the mother or second parent cannot even become a guardian until after the child is two years old. There are laws in Ireland governing surrogacy. As a result, biological fathers of children born through surrogacy have more rights than the child's intended mother or second parent. The following issue was brought to our attention by spokespersons for the Irish Families Through Surrogacy advocacy group. Once a child reaches 18 years of age, these women have no standing as a guardian and up to two years of age they cannot make any decisions regarding the health of their beloved babies. This can only be done by the father. This is a slap in the face to these mothers who care for their children and want to help them in every way possible. That needs to be rectified. As we do not have availability of surrogacy in Ireland, these women have to travel abroad and this is resulting in that discrepancy. I welcome the Bill if it is going address these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_635"> There is another issue in that when the child reaches the age of 18, if the mother wants to transfer her assets or whatever to that child, because she is non-related, the tax exemption is only €16,000. If she was legally deemed to be the child's mother the tax exemption would be €335,000. We all know the value of a house today. If that mother wanted to leave a house to a son or daughter, it is wrong that the difference in tax would be payable to the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_636"> Surrogacy is not a choice; it is a last resort. It can be couples only opportunity to build a family due to debilitating infertility and medical conditions after a long difficult journey. Many parents who undergo surrogacy are married couples where one or both contribute genetic material to have the maximum possible biological input to their child. The number of emergency travel certificates issued by the Irish Consulate in the Ukraine for children born as a result of surrogacy arrangements have been illustrated in many tables, but they do not include the number of children born in the USA and Canada who also need emergency travel certificates. The figures indicate an upward trend in international surrogacy and the need for international surrogacy to be acknowledged and provided for in legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_637"> As I said, I support the Bill. I thank the Government for bringing it forward. Much of the time in this House, we are critical of Government, but this is legislation we asked for following this issue having been brought to our intention. We are glad that Government has responded. I hope that the Bill goes through without any major difficulty.</p>

          <from>Deputy Denise Mitchell<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T18:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_638">I welcome this Bill, which has been a long time coming. I commend those who have campaigned to put this issue on the table. I am sure the Bill will be welcomed by families and potential parents who have been waiting a long time for proper regulation in the area of assisted human reproduction. Many have had to travel abroad to access surrogacy having not been able to conceive themselves. The fact that this option will now be available domestically is a significant development for those in need of assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> The HSE estimates that one in six couples experience infertility. This gives us an idea of the number of people who may seek assisted human reproduction services in the future. We all know that treatments can be very costly. A single IVF treatment costs between €4,000 and €6,000. In order to have a successful pregnancy, it could cost tens of thousands of euro. Sinn Féin wants the Minister for Health to make IVF available through the public health system. We want to see these options made available to as many people as possible. Cost cannot be a barrier.</p>
          <p eId="para_640"> One of the concerns with the Bill is that families who have already availed of surrogacy abroad will not have the same rights as those who have children by means of surrogacy after the legislation passes. We cannot create a two-tier approach to parental rights. This will need to be addressed and clarified on Committee Stage. As it stands, the Bill gives rise too much uncertainty. We need to make sure we get this right. Previous Governments have been found wanting on the issue of assisted human reproduction. This Bill is a step forward. I welcome the establishment of the authority to oversee assisted human reproduction and advise people on it. I hope the authority can to get work as soon as possible. </p>
          <p eId="para_641"> My colleague, Deputy Cullinane, will seek to amend this Bill on Committee Stage, as I am sure will many other Deputies. Sinn Féin is committed to working constructively with the Minister to address the concerns raised by stakeholders.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Connolly<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T18:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_642">Fáiltím roimh an deis a bheith páirteach sa díospóireacht seo. Tá sé thar a bheith casta. Tá sé deacair na téarmaí, agus níos mó ná sin, na hábhair a thuiscint. Tá gá le bheith i d'fhealsamh i ndáiríre.</p>
          <p eId="para_643"> I welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate. It is quite difficult to get one's head around all of the medical concepts, what is possible and what is not possible. In addition to being a Deputy, one would want to be a philosopher, a doctor and many other things besides. I welcome that I have adequate speaking time in regard to this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_644"> I have before me a report done by the members of the commission that was set up by the current Taoiseach when Minister for Health in March 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">Some 22 years ago in 2000 he set up a commission, which then took five years to deliberate. It is interesting what it said. I will come back to its 40 recommendations. The chairman of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction said in the report:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_646">In being asked to advise on the social, ethical and legal factors, the Commission did not attempt to act as the arbiter of public morals. The members were conscious of the strongly held and diverse feelings in the public at large. A broad interdisciplinary approach was taken that allowed recommendations to evolve as a result of informed open debate. It was evident that there exists a broad spectrum of cultural and ethical positions. [...]</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_647">The report is intended to reflect the richness and variety of the debates that took place both in the Commission itself and in the work groups. [This was back in 2005] If I may presume to attribute an overall philosophical position to the Commission I think it could be encapsulated in the form of a question: should science do everything that science can do? There was widespread recognition of the benefits of advances in this specialised area of medical science but this was tempered by a note of caution, that society as a whole and not only scientists, must take responsibility for the management of major scientific change, especially in areas that are concerned with the dignity of human life.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">I am coming back to fully supporting the Bill as it relates to assisted human reproduction, but there are many other aspects to this area that really need a broad discussion. I will move from the 2005 review to Schedule 2 of this Bill, which sets out what is prohibited. This shows us where the science is at the moment and what is possible, in that we actually have to prohibit "the creation of a human-animal hybrid embryo" and many other things that are prohibited. Scientific knowledge has gone so far that many, many things are possible that are inconceivable to me, morally or in justice, but they are possible. It is not just scientists that are participating or making decisions. It is the Dáil and concerned groups too.</p>
          <p eId="para_649"> I am also very concerned that the broad discussion that took place between 2000 and 2005 was utterly ignored until today. That commission made 40 recommendations, one of which was very far-reaching. I do not agree with the particular recommendation myself, and it was not taken on board in relation to this Bill. It is that a presumption would be made in relation to the intended parents, that from birth on, the presumption would be that the intended parents are the parents, and that a child born through surrogacy should be presumed to be that of the commissioning parents from birth on. There was a dissenting view on that at the time, which I happen to agree with. My point is that the complexity of what is involved here was fully discussed. Unfortunately, it was ignored. When we fast forward to five years ago, the heads of the Bill were produced and were discussed with only four meetings of the committee with Deputy Harty, who had done a great job. There was only four meetings in relation to such complex matters. The committee produced a report. Some of the recommendations were taken on board in relation to this Bill and some were not. Then we had the report of the special rapporteur in 2020, when he too laid out the state of play.</p>
          <p eId="para_650"> I must thank the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, which produced two papers, under pressure. Again, I do not know what influence we might have but the Oireachtas Library and Research Service is under constant pressure to inform Members and educate us. The Bill was only produced last week or the week before, coincidentally, in the same week that the rapporteur produced another report, which was on illegal adoptions and the importance of identity. It is ironic that the rapporteur has emphasised the importance of the right to know one's origins and legal identity in a week where legislation is published highlighting the vacuum around the right to knowledge for children born through assisted human reproduction, and the utter fragmentation, in theory, of that identity depending on how the assisted human reproduction is done. I will come back to that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_651"> As was pointed out by other speakers, in 2020 Professor Conor O'Mahony, the special rapporteur on child protection produced A Review of Children's Rights and Best Interests in the Context of Donor-Assisted Human Reproduction and Surrogacy in Irish Law, in which he said that "Surrogacy is entirely unregulated in Irish law." This was 20 years after then Minister for Health, Deputy Micheál Martin, commissioned the report. So, 20 years later, surrogacy remained "entirely unregulated". Professor O'Mahony goes on: "Children are born and raised in families in which one parent is treated as legal stranger to the child." I had to read this a few times. At the committee the professor said:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_652">Surrogacy is entirely unregulated in Irish law. The result is that children are born and raised in families in which one parent is treated as a legal stranger to the child. This fails to recognise adequately the children's right to family life and their right to identity in some cases of donor-assisted human reproduction and entirely ignores those rights in the case of surrogacy. [This is what I am zoning in on] This is contrary to both the best interests of children and the principle of non-discrimination. </p>
          <p eId="para_653">Professor O'Mahony also pointed out at the committee that the Supreme Court has highlighted this issue. In his review Professor O'Mahony said: "The impact of this position on children born following surrogacy arrangements has been repeatedly highlighted, including by the Supreme Court, which has called on the Oireachtas to fill this legislative vacuum."</p>
          <p eId="para_654"> We are beginning to fill the legislative vacuum with this Bill, and it is a good start. It is important however to give the context on that. Up to now, successive Governments have been pushed and pushed, from the original commission to the Children and Family Relationships Act in 2015, which had some protection for children born through donated sperm or eggs. However, with that Act we had the crazy position where the relevant sections 3 and 4 never came into operation, I understand, until 2020. This was five years after the Act was passed. When those sections did come into operation there is nothing before me to show that the Act, or the operation of that Act, had been reviewed. Separately, the cross-party committee has said that this legislation currently before us is so important that when it becomes law it should be reviewed after one year. The Government has pointed out that this is not necessary because Standing Orders allows for a review. If that is the position, where is the review of the 2015 Act? Do we have it? It has not been referred to anywhere in what I have read. I think that this is very important. When the two sections of that Act came into operation in 2020 there was an obligation to register, but I have no access to information on that anywhere. It also distinguishes between children born through assisted human reproduction, prior to that legislation becoming operational, and post operational. We have a complete mess with regard to rights and identity, and this is just one tiny aspect of this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_655"> On top of that we have completely ignored international surrogacy. I have my own opinion on international surrogacy. I will place on the record that I believe assisted human reproduction should be publicly provided on a not-for-profit basis. This is absolutely essential and should have been done. I have no time for going down the direction of profit-led development in this area, which is particularly sensitive on so many levels. Of course, this also has not happened but I understand that the Government will look at that aspect sometime in the future. When one reads around this, however, one cannot escape the conclusion that in all of this development - outside of couples and regardless of their standing in needing help, which I fully and absolutely support - there are other aspects. We can see from what has been prohibited, that some aspects are being pushed by a certain for-profit approach in relation to health. This should be completely taken out of the area of assisted human reproduction. It should be gone.</p>
          <p eId="para_656"> The legal vacuum is bad enough, but we also have an information vacuum. We are utterly reliant on the clinics to tell us what procedures have been carried out and whether they have been successful. We know from the Oireachtas Library and Research Service's paper that the number of treatment cycles has increased and the trend is in an upward direction. We can get those figures but they are not from a central database. We are utterly reliant on the companies that are making a profit for the information and we do not know the outcomes of these procedures. As well as the legislation lacuna, there is an information lacuna with regard to outcomes, such as the number of pregnancies, successful pregnancies, live births and so on. None of that information is there, despite the fact that we have been on notice about this for a very long time.</p>
          <p eId="para_657"> Some regulation was provided by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, which was designated as the competent authority and has some oversight. However, it has no role in relation to ethics, research or looking at where we are going and in what direction. In all the reports before me, different things were asked of the Government. In a sense, the Government has tried to do its best with the legislation it has produced but this requires further discussion. We have to look at the international component and decide what we are going to do about international surrogacy. Difficult as that is, we need a full discussion on it. At what stage will that happen?</p>
          <p eId="para_658"> Various committees said not to make counselling mandatory. As I understand it, however, the Bill makes both counselling and legal advice mandatory. That will increase the cost. I have an open mind as to whether counselling should be mandatory. There was so much to take in here. I do my best to take things in and form an educated opinion as best I can but I wonder what the justification is on the Government's side for making counselling mandatory. My background tells me that something being mandatory is not a good way to start a process. It also increases the cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_659"> There are many other ethical issues around sex selection and pre-implantation genetic diagnoses. I agree with the restrictions that have been placed on these areas. They will only be allowed in very restricted circumstances. The pre-legislative scrutiny of the heads of the Bill took place so long ago, and the report of the commission was so long ago, that not only are we talking about fragmented identities but a fragmented discussion as well. Now we are waiting for the international element to be discussed by the committee. Overall, it is extremely difficult to deal with this subject in any coherent way.</p>
          <p eId="para_660"> It is quite clear that Ireland is an outlier in this area, having no legislation in respect of it. However, it is not entirely clear where all the other countries stand, based on the research. Some allow for certain procedures while others do not, and so on. Regulation is absolutely essential and that regulation must be kept under constant review.</p>
          <p eId="para_661"> It is unacceptable, morally and on every other level, that assisted human reproduction is available to rich people or those who have access to money but out of the question for people on a lower income. That is immoral on every level and should not be allowed to continue. It is urgent that we get a public model as quickly as we can. We are doing everything like a jigsaw. We are forming policy in a vacuum without information before us. It has been 22 years since we set up a commission. I am making my comments against that background. I welcome the legislation, and it is important that we begin to legislate.</p>
          <p eId="para_662"> It is ironic - although ironic might not capture it - that on the one hand, we have the rapporteur's report telling us about the damage caused to children and adults when the State stands by and allows their identity to be taken from them and then, on the other hand, we allow an <i>ad hoc</i> approach to assisted human reproduction in such a way that children born by means of it do not have access to their identity or where they came from. This Bill seeks to rectify that but I would like that to be teased out.</p>
          <p eId="para_663"> There is also an issue whereby cases from prior to the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 becoming operational in 2020 are operating under a different system to the ones that arose after that. All I see is a fragmentation of the most basic human right, that is, for children to know who their biological parents are and what their genetic background is. If we are making that point in one report from the special rapporteur, the same logic applies to this. While I embrace medical science, the changes being made and what it can provide us, it must be regulated in a manner that is for the public good and the common good.</p>
          <p eId="para_664"> I wonder if the same scientific effort could go into making our society more equal in terms of pollution and toxins, which lead to infertility, or other things relating to health generally. What about basic housing? This is separate from assisted human reproduction but I am talking about the application of science for the common good. If such effort was put into other areas, what difference would it make to our society? How many thousands in this country do not have such a basic thing as a house? They have no security. Yet, science can go down a road which is absolutely essential for assisted human reproduction but also makes possible many other things that are now rightly prohibited by this Bill. I will go back to the basic question asked in the 2005 commission report: "should science do everything that science can do?" Should these things be left to scientists? I believe they should not. If not, where is the forum for looking at all these complex issues that we as a society must deal with?</p>

        <speech by="#AlanFarrell" eId="spk_170">
          <from>Deputy Alan Farrell<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T18:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_665">I am pleased to finally see this Bill being brought into Dáil Éireann, having been discussed and awaited for some years now. The Bill and its introduction to the legislative framework is something Fine Gael has been committed to across successive Governments. Today represents progress for thousands of families in Ireland and the tens of thousands of couples who will in future require support when starting their own families. There exist significant gaps in the current legislation that have left many families in legal limbo. While this Bill is not perfect by any means, I believe that if the Department and the Minister approach this issue and this Bill with the sensitivity, understanding and openness this subject matter demands, we can make significant progress for so many families in Ireland and provide the clarity and certainty all people require with regard to their family.</p>
          <p eId="para_666"> Ireland has long been a European outlier with regard to legislation in this area, as highlighted by my colleague Frances Fitzgerald in a recent report. The lack of legislation has created an unnecessarily complex and vague situation for couples attempting to access supports for IVF or ICSI for surrogates and, ultimately, for the children themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_667"> Some one in six Irish heterosexual couples will struggle to conceive during their relationship. This represents a significant number of people in our country. There is no public funding for these couples and the lack of legislation deprives them of the support and information they need to make the best decisions for themselves and their families. The procedures involved in AHR treatments can be risky and costly, and they can be emotionally and physically demanding for all of those involved. There is, therefore, a need for the Government and this House to act in order to provide the regulatory framework that is vital for the provision of treatment in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_668"> In 2017, the cost of an IVF cycle in Ireland was between €4,000 and €6,000 and the cost of an ICSI treatment was between €5,000 and €6,500. This is a significant burden on the individuals involved and, as most will know, there are no guarantees that a single cycle will be successful. Further rounds may be necessary to allow couples to fulfil their dream of growing their family, something that many people have to date dreamt of but been unable to access. As has been stated, the cost of these services should not dictate a parent or an intending parent’s ambition to welcome a child to their families. This Bill will be a stepping stone to address these issue and I urge the Minister of State and the Department to investigate the avenues in which the State can provide funding assistance in the event that people cannot pay the costs of treatment themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_669"> The number of treatment cycles per annum in Ireland grew from 7,500 in 2009 to just over 11,000 in 2018. I note there has been a slight drop in the number of treatments provided since then but I understand that is down to the Covid-19 pandemic. The lack of legislation in the area of AHR in this country has allowed for a vacuum in services and, crucially, information. The development of the AHRRA under this Bill will be a transformative moment for AHR services in Ireland and for the families that will seek these services in the future. As has been said by other Members, research should be conducted by the Department with regard to access to services provided for under this Bill, and how they can be implemented in a regionally balanced way. The AHRRA will provide many services in this area. Notably, it will be in the position to collect data with regard to treatments and outcomes, which heretofore have been unaddressed and only available through private facilities. This has led to an inability to understand the needs and services that should be provided within our health system. This will allow further research to be carried out and to indicate where our funding should be placed in order to provide parents and children the best possible service in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_670"> The AHRRA will also play a vital role in the provision and regulation of surrogacy in Ireland. The authority will provide for the introduction of a national surrogacy register as well as a register of donors. This, again, is a transformative step the Bill will provide for. The mechanism will allow couples in Ireland the opportunity to engage in surrogacy domestically and not be forced to travel abroad to find the opportunity to grow their family. Travelling abroad for surrogacy can present intending parents and parents of surrogate children with complex legal issues both at home and abroad. As has been mentioned so far in this debate, the Bill leaves some questions with regard to international surrogacy and parentage and so I welcome the development of a special Oireachtas committee to deliver a body of work on international surrogacy. I understand this committee will report back in a number of months. This is a welcome step that I hope will deliver some important recommendations on an issue that is of utmost seriousness and emotion. However, the timing of this process is questionable. The Bill has been published in advance of the committee’s hearings and thus will not, it seems, benefit from this process. I ask the Minister of State to come back to the House in his closing remarks and address this issue, one which a majority of Members have mentioned during the course of this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_671"> The issue of parentage in the context of international surrogacy is a key question in this debate. The Minister of State will recall the AHR Coalition, which came before the Fine Gael parliamentary party in recent weeks at the request of Senator Seery Kearney. We heard directly from families across the spectrum of surrogacy about the significant gaps that are present. There are families in Ireland where one parent is not recognised as having parentage rights over their children. This means there are parents in Ireland that lack the legal ability to make simple parental decisions on behalf of their children. The unpredictability of life leaves us with the potential for serious and heart-wrenching scenarios where a parent with legal parentage passes away suddenly and his or her partner does not have the legal equality to parent the child and make decisions on behalf of the child. The resolution to such issues can sometimes take years. This is something that should be addressed and I hope this will form the basis for some of the work to be carried out by the Oireachtas committee on international surrogacy and by the Department. I acknowledge there are serious and sensitive ethical issues regarding the nature of surrogacy and these concerns have been recognised within the Bill, providing for surrogacy for altruistic purposes only and that any surrogacy agreement in Ireland would be certified by the regulatory authority. Importantly, this Bill and the Government recognise the need to avoid coercion into or commercialisation of surrogacy in Ireland. While introducing legislation of this nature we must ensure vulnerable women are not forced into a scenario of carrying a child against their wishes.</p>
          <p eId="para_672"> I would like to highlight the need for continued support for women who carry a surrogate child. This should not only be limited to the early stages of surrogacy or the term of the pregnancy but it should also be provided in the post-natal period in which the woman may require additional support. This should be a priority for the services provided in this context. I also wish to note that the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health has completed work on this issue and has made a number of recommendations to the Minister with regard to this Bill. They include some important contributions with regard to international surrogacy and parentage, as I have already discussed, but also with regard to the welfare of the child and the removal of mandatory counselling for anyone seeking to be a recipient of AHR. I hope the Department will, throughout the process of this Bill and in the time subsequent to the passage of this Bill, continue to engage with stakeholders, families and those involved in the sector. I hope it will allow the roll-out of an inclusive, encompassing and progressive service that will make profound impacts on the lives of so many. It has the potential to be a truly life-changing Bill, filling a gap that has been identified for over two decades.</p>
          <p eId="para_673"> I often speak in this House of how our country and society have changed in recent years and decades. We have seen dramatic changes in women’s rights and LGBT rights in Ireland, led by the public and pursued by the Government. This Bill is the latest where successive Governments have sought to build on that progress and deliver real change that reflects more understanding and an equal country. The AHR Bill will allow for more access for families, couples and individuals that seek to achieve one of the most profound and important life events one can have, the welcoming of the birth of a child. Fine Gael has committed to providing legislation in this area and I am pleased to see the Bill before the House today. This Bill will change lives for the better, I look forward to the work of the special Oireachtas committee. I hope the Department will consider the issues of international surrogacy and parentage I have raised, as well as increasing access to services such as IVF.</p>
          <p eId="para_674"> We must recognise that the country and our lifestyles have changed. We know women are having children later in life than in previous decades. With progress in social equality, we see more same-sex couples living happily in our society and the provision of AHR services and supports will allow loving couples of all different backgrounds to welcome a new family member into their homes. I look forward to the progress contained within this Bill but I urge the Minister of State to ensure the views and recommendations of the special Oireachtas committee be included by the Minister on Committee Stage of this Bill. I would be immensely disappointed if we were to separate international surrogacy from the steps the Government is taking today through this Bill. I ask the Minister of State and the Government to reflect on that.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jim O'Callaghan<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T18:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_675">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill and I commend the Minister of State and the Department on bringing it forward. This Bill is long overdue; it has been called for and required for more than two decades. We need to appreciate it is complex and complicated legislation. Notwithstanding the delay, I can understand why the Minister of State and the Department have had to put such time into preparing this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">When one reads through it, one can see that it deals with areas of such enormous complexity, ethical issues of significant concern. It is important we get the balance right when the legislation is enacted. The Bill will benefit from being considered by everyone in this House. All parties in the House will have an opportunity to review it. I know that it is a complicated Bill but I believe the Department of Health will benefit from getting the views of the Members of this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_677"> It was in July 1978 that the first child conceived through IVF was born. It was an extraordinary scientific achievement. It transformed the world in many ways. In particular, it transformed the lives of many people who could not have children. Due to the scientific changes, they were subsequently able to have children. It was a remarkable achievement. In the past 40 years in Ireland and, indeed, throughout the world many couples have been assisted in reproducing children as a result of assisted human reproduction processes. It is surprising that in Ireland to date we have never had it regulated by law. We have never had it licensed by law. Notwithstanding that, it is obviously the case that many couples in Ireland, in the past 20 to 30 years, have availed of the services of providers of services of assisted human reproduction. Even though those services seem to have been provided without too much controversy or public criticism, it is absolutely essential that this issue is regulated by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_678"> When we look at some of the issues in respect of assisted human reproduction and IVF, in particular, we can see the problems that have arisen in the past as a result of the absence of legislation. For instance, in 2009, the Supreme Court considered a case that arose as a result of a couple who decided to go down the avenue of IVF. They had a number of embryos produced, some of which were implanted in the woman and others were frozen. Subsequently, the couple separated and split up. It was a traumatic case that arose as a result of the fact that, after the separation, the woman in the relationship wanted the frozen embryos to be implanted and born, whereas the man did not want that to happen. That was an extremely difficult issue to resolve. It would have been resolved if there was legislation in place stating what should be done in such circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_679"> Ultimately, the matter went to the Supreme Court and it was resolved in a manner that was not, in my opinion, satisfactory because of the absence of legislation. The couple should not have been put through the trauma and uncertainty of not knowing what would occur. For instance, under the legislation being introduced, we know the issue that arose in that case would not apply because the procedure would be available, under section 23, for one of the parents to apply for a revocation of permission that he or she previously granted. We know how that traumatic situation would be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_680"> It is also important to note that the persons who are providing these services in Ireland as present also want to be regulated. It is important they are regulated. That is why I welcome the fact that under the Bill there will be a new statutory body, the assisted human reproduction regulatory authority. I do not think it will be a statutory body that will need to be staffed by vast numbers of people, but it will be a statutory body that will perform an extremely important function. I am sure there are people around the world who want to come to Ireland, or may already be in Ireland, and are not providing the level of service that is required of assisted human reproduction. I welcome the fact that under section 116, the Minister can declare whether persons are or are not fit to be involved in this business.</p>
          <p eId="para_681"> Many Members of the House have spoken about ethical issues that have arisen. Obviously, ethical issues arise when it comes to what is to happen to embryos. On the issue of assisted human reproduction, in the case of IVF, generally embryos are implanted in the mother in the hope that the baby is subsequently born. However, in many instances, a number of embryos are produced and they are not all implanted. It is extremely important that those embryos are not used for research unbeknownst to the parents or used for research that we in this House would regard as unethical or inappropriate. I welcome the fact that Schedule 2 to the Bill sets out the types of behaviour that this House regards as unacceptable. Experimentation on embryos is something we do not want to see in Ireland, and I believe Schedule 2 has been very well drafted to ensure that does not occur. I also welcome the fact that in Schedule 2, the provision is available to the Minister for Health to enact by regulation other types of practices that may happen in the future in regard to experimentation on embryos.</p>
          <p eId="para_682"> On the issue of research, referred to as embryo stem cell, ESC, research, that is dealt with in Part 3 of the Bill. It appears to be the case, and perhaps the Minister could deal with this not in the reply but on Committee Stage, that under section 30 of the Bill, research is permitted on an embryo when the intending parents' consent to that research happening. Obviously, the research must be ethical. It cannot be beyond what is provided for in Schedule 2. It cannot engage in any of those types of activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_683"> Part 4 deals with the storage of gametes and embryos. There is also an interesting provision contained in section 38. In the tragic situation where a girl of 16 years of age has to undergo treatment for cancer, there is a provision contained within section 38 that would allow for eggs from that child to be stored until after the treatment in the hope that they will be of use to her in her life.</p>
          <p eId="para_684"> The one issue that many Members have spoken about is the issue dealt with in Part 7, which is domestic surrogacy. We need to be realistic about the extent of domestic surrogacy that will happen in Ireland. I suspect it will be extremely small, unlike the whole area of assisted human reproduction and IVF, a service many people avail of. In respect of domestic surrogacy, there will be very few people who, in practical terms, will avail of it. We saw in the case of MR <i>v</i>. an tArd-Chláraitheoir a number of years ago a very good example of the type of domestic surrogacy that may arise. It is referred to as compassionate surrogacy. It was a situation in which a woman was incapable of carrying a child to fruition, however, her sister was prepared to assist her. The embryo that was created by the woman and her husband was implanted in her sister and the child was born. There was a controversy about it, legally, because the woman who gave birth to the child was regarded as the mother. That is not the type of surrogacy that is common in Ireland at present. We need to be realistic as to the type of surrogacy that happens in Ireland. In general, it involves people from Ireland who are desperate to have children going abroad to countries where surrogacy is legal and having a child there. One of the parents usually provides one of the gametes and the other parent will apply for a step-parent adoption in that country. On return to Ireland, an application is brought before the Adoption Authority of Ireland for the recognition of a foreign adoption. That is how it happens in Ireland and we should not fool ourselves into thinking it happens any other way.</p>
          <p eId="para_685"> What we do not want to happen is to have two avenues of surrogacy in Ireland: one piece of legislation that deals with domestic surrogacy and another that deals with international surrogacy. We need a mechanism whereby we have a statutory authority, perhaps the one that will be established under the Bill, that will deal with all types of surrogacy. On the issue of surrogacy, we need to recognise that it happens. No matter what legislation we enact, it will continue to happen. As referred to by Deputy Connolly, a very important issue that may not be given enough recognition is the right to identity of the child subsequently born.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulDonnelly" eId="spk_172">
          <from>Deputy Paul Donnelly<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T18:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_686">I cautiously welcome the Bill as it is essential to regulate the provision of any treatment or procedure for the purposes of surrogacy and IVF in the State. It is incredulous for this most important medical procedure not to be regulated given that is has been flagged for so many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_687"> I am sure we all know couples who, through no fault of their own, cannot have a child without the assistance of AHR treatment. The health and well-being of the mother and baby must always be to the fore and it cannot be allowed to become a for-profit procedure. While the not-for-profit section of the Bill would ensure that domestic surrogacy would not be abused for profit, there are concerns, as have been alluded to throughout the debate, about international surrogacy which is not addressed in the Bill. I understand an Oireachtas committee will look at that. It is an extremely important issue because one cannot separate domestic and international surrogacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">The Bill, of course, does not address the issue of access to surrogacy. It will still mean it will be out of reach for so many people who cannot afford the types of expenses that are allowed for in this Bill if we only look at the expenses for surrogacy alone. In respect of IVF, the chance for couples and individuals is even more out of reach.</p>
          <p eId="para_689"> I listened to Deputy Paul Murphy's contribution this afternoon. It was really important to hear what he said in relation to his personal experiences of the emotional and physical toll it takes on the woman and the financial costs incurred by couples. On many occasions it can cost tens of thousands of euro because, obviously, it is difficult and does not normally work first time around for most couples and individuals.</p>
          <p eId="para_690"> It is, therefore, important that this would be available in the public healthcare system, as has been discussed today. There are concerns regarding the recognition of parentage. It is not clear in the Bill that the parental and guardianship rights in respect of children born through surrogacy will apply to existing families. We must also ensure the child and each of his or her parents has full rights. I welcome the commitment given earlier by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, to look at this further down the line on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_691"> With regard to people born as a result of AHR treatment, we need to make sure there are provisions that provide the rights of a person to access information concerning his or her origins. We have seen far too many times in our recent past the upset caused to people who cannot access their own birth history. This should not happen again. We also need to ensure that anybody who is not fully compliant with the AHR procedures should be held to account. We should be assured they will never be allowed to practice again if they break any of the rules or regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_692"> I would like to talk about counselling and the mandatory counselling section. Like many others, I have concerns about mandatory counselling. As somebody who has provided counselling, the concept of counselling is that somebody has an issue and comes to you to work through it. I am always unsure and concerned when we put in a provision, particularly a law, that states a person is mandated to go and access counselling. That absolutely needs to be looked at.</p>
          <p eId="para_693"> I have gone through the legislation and it is very detailed. It is a start. Having listened to the contributions made today, however, many issues still need to be addressed. My party and I are absolutely up for ensuring this legislation is fit for purpose and that we deal with the issues that have been ongoing, as has been said, for more than 20 years.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RuairiOmurchu" eId="spk_173">
          <from>Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T18:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_694">It has been said by many others at this point that there is an absolute and necessary need for a regulatory framework with regard to assisted human reproduction and the wider issues of surrogacy and IVF. It also been said by many, including my colleague, Deputy Paul Donnelly, that there are significant questions with which we need to deal. A significant amount of due diligence will be required on Committee Stage. Deputy Jim O'Callaghan spoke about the difficulty or, I suppose, the reality with regard to international surrogacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_695"> We accept that a committee has been established that will deal with this at some point but there is a logic to a single piece of legislation to cover it. Many stated that there is obviously a difficulty in that there is no element of retrospection regarding those people who have already been born through this process and ensuring their identity rights are dealt with. We know the huge difficulties for people perhaps not being able get their entitlements, the difficulties in terms of where the law stands if the father was to die or if there was marital break-up and all the rest. I get that from a human perspective, it is an incredibly complicated situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_696"> For people who go for IVF or surrogacy, there is a real want and need to have their own children but there are difficulties. It is hugely difficult, not only from a financial point of view. A huge number of people cannot even look at this because they do not have the resources, which is obviously an unfairness and inequality that cannot stand. We need to make sure there is public provision. We are talking about IVF cycles and figures are being thrown around of somewhere between €4,000 and €6,000. That would obviously put a huge amount of people out of the bracket of being to avail of this and that is not okay in any way, shape or form.</p>
          <p eId="para_697"> On the whole idea of international surrogacy, the initial period of the Ukrainian crisis threw up this particular issue with regard to Irish families that went out there. That once again points out the scenario that this is a reality we need to deal with and for which we need to legislate. As per normal, we have been pretty slow to deal with it. There is no point in being too downbeat in the sense that we are finally arriving at a starting point. It is only a starting point, however. Like I said, we have to do a significant amount of work to ensure we cover all the bases.</p>
          <p eId="para_698"> I will add my voice to many others before who said that if we are looking at IVF, there must be provision within the public health system. It is absolutely unfair that this is only a resource that can be availed of by those who have the means to do so. That is not to take away from the huge emotional difficulties that face anybody in these particular situations. I accept the difficulties in dealing with retrospective laws and so forth but it is not beyond the possibility of Government and this House to deliver solutions. We know what the problems are. We know a significant amount of work will have to be done on Committee Stage. It is only right that we ensure we have a just system that works for all the people, both those who have been through IVF and surrogacy and those who will go through this system. It also means we must deal with domestic and international surrogacy in the same legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_699"> This is, therefore, a good start, or it is a reasonable start. One can be quite uncomfortable with some of it and particularly the for-profit scenario. I can see why people who have the resources do it but it is not available to everybody and that is the piece we must close off, if we are really talking about having a just and equitable society.</p>

          <p eId="para_701">On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, I thank all the Members for their valuable contributions today. As the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, said at the outset, the Minister really would have liked to have been here today to introduce this very important, if not historic, legislation. From listening to everyone, I can hear there is broad support for this long-awaited Bill. I assure all speakers that I will inform the Minister of the numerous constructive observations on the Bill. In addition, the relevant officials from the Department have been taking notes of all queries, comments and issues raised today as they look forward to the passage of the Bill to Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_702"> Much reference was made to the issue of international surrogacy by essentially all the speakers. I reiterate that it was the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, who proposed to the Government the establishment of the special Oireachtas committee, alongside the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, and Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman. Much good work has been done on which I want to compliment them.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">The Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, has committed to having regard of the work of the cross-party committee as this Bill progresses through the Houses. Many Members also outlined the financial burden, the agony, the excitement, the heartbreak and the joy of IVF. I wish Deputy Paul Murphy and his partner all the best in that significant journey in the coming weeks and months. There were also many broad discussions on the aspects of the Bill. Again, many Members have welcomed the new committee and the difficult deliberations that will happen. It met today. Many issues need to be addressed and clarified on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_704"> In conclusion, I would like to state my agreement with the desire of the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, to progress this legislation as quickly as possible, as well as with his belief that it will improve the outcomes for and provide certainty to all parties involved in the undertaking of various types of AHR treatment or research. The legislation is important to many people, given that 5,000 or 6,000 couples are going through the personal debt, the stress, the joy and the disappointment of it. This legislation is long overdue.</p>
          <p eId="para_705"> Again, I want to express my appreciation for a useful debate from all who contributed this evening. I hope that Members across the House can continue to work closely with us in order to potentially improve the Bill and advance it swiftly. </p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Ossian Smyth)<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T19:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_708">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_709"> As Deputies will be aware, the International Monetary Fund, IMF, is an institution that promotes international monetary co-operation and provides policy advice, technical assistance and loans to help countries build and maintain or restore their economies. The global financial crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic have demonstrated that the fund's financing needs can increase rapidly, which can test the IMF's ability to fulfil its role at the centre of the global financial safety net using shareholding known as "quota" resources alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_710"> The purpose of this legislation is twofold. In the first instance, the Bill seeks the approval of the Oireachtas to adhere to the IMF’s new arrangements to borrow, NAB, a decision under which economically strong member countries provide loans to the fund to supplement its resources. The Bill will also facilitate grant contributions by the State to both existing IMF trust funds and to any new ones that may be established. Trust funds provide financial and technical assistance to IMF members to help address important structural issues. They also provide debt relief and concessional financing to vulnerable, low-income countries. </p>
          <p eId="para_711"> In short, the objective of this legislation is to enhance Ireland’s support for the IMF in carrying out its critical global mandate. Having been the recipient of crucial IMF assistance in the recent past at a time of grave economic difficulty, I believe that there is a real and compelling obligation on Ireland to support the fund in providing resources to other countries in need. By participating in the NAB and by providing for future contributions to trust funds, Ireland will play its part as one of the world's most prosperous economies in bolstering the fund. This legislation presents a strong signal of Ireland’s commitment to the IMF by ensuring that it continues to have sufficient resources to adequately support its membership. </p>
          <p eId="para_712"> In more general terms, the Bill attests to Ireland’s strong and enduring support for multilateralism. The IMF’s new arrangements to borrow, which we are considering today, is a temporary arrangement which acts as a second line of defence for the fund. Under the NAB, a number of the strongest economies with sufficient financial capacity agree to make available resources to the IMF in the form of credit arrangements up to specified amounts. These loans can be activated in specific circumstances where the fund needs to supplement its quota resources for lending purposes. </p>
          <p eId="para_713"> The NAB has its origins in the mid-1990s Mexican financial crisis when there was a concern that the IMF may require substantially more resources to respond to future financial crises. As a result, the G7 called on financially strong countries to develop financing arrangements to bolster the resources available to the fund. This led to the creation of new arrangements to borrow, which first became effective in November 1998. In total, 25 member countries joined the NAB at its inception, committing additional resources to the IMF totalling approximately $48 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_714"> The first real test of the NAB came with the global financial crisis in April 2009. In the face of a sharp increase in the demand for IMF financing, the G20 leaders agreed to triple the total resources available to the fund to $750 billion. This decision effectively expanded the NAB from $48 billion to almost $600 billion. The IMF relied heavily on NAB participants to support its response to the financial crisis, which was clearly demonstrated by the fact that the fund drew on these arrangements on ten occasions between April 2011 and February 2016. Despite the challenges that the fund has faced at times, including during the considerable financing demands created by the Covid-19 crisis, the NAB has not been activated since 2016. Ireland’s participation in the NAB was initially signalled in 2009 to 2010, following a decision by the European Council and Economic and Financial Affairs Council, ECOFIN, ministers to endorse the G20’s agreement to triple the IMF’s resources. This was based on our economic performance at that time. Accordingly, two Government decisions were secured in January 2010: the first was to approve a bilateral loan facility to the IMF of €1.3 billion and the second was to approve Ireland participation in the NAB. </p>
          <p eId="para_715"> The provision for the bilateral loan agreement was included in the Finance Act 2010. Preparations to legislate for Ireland’s adherence to the NAB were also initiated. However, following Ireland’s entry into an IMF programme in December 2010, the bilateral loan agreement with the IMF lapsed without taking effect. The legislation to provide for Ireland’s participation in the NAB was not pursued. Consequently, while Ireland confirmed its intention to participate in the NAB in 2010, we never formally adhered to the NAB decision, the technical term for sanctioning participation. As a result, we have been classified as an inactive or a prospective participant in the NAB since that time. </p>
          <p eId="para_716"> Despite the considerable demand for IMF assistance during the Covid-19 pandemic, the funds resources remained resilient and recourse to the NAB credit arrangements was not deemed necessary. Since the outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020, the IMF has provided critical support to its membership, including emergency financial assistance totalling over €170 billion to 93 countries. </p>
          <p eId="para_717"> The NAB is vital in assuring that supplementary resources are available to the fund for extended periods. This is essential in order to preserve the IMF’s credibility and effectiveness in promoting economic stability and global growth. There is a general expectation by the IMF and its members that countries with strong economies make their resources available in a collective effort to help those which are experiencing economic difficulties, whether that be through the NAB, through bilateral lending or through supporting IMF trust funds. Most of the world's major economies do their part in strengthening the IMF's resources through the NAB, including China, India, Japan, the UK and the USA, as well as 15 EU member states. Since Ireland completed repayment of its IMF loans in 2017, there has been an expectation on the part of the fund and the EU member states that Ireland would actively re-engage with the NAB.</p>
          <p eId="para_718"> On the substance of the Bill, the legislation provides for Ireland's adherence to and participation in the IMF's NAB decision. In order to formalise our participation, Ireland must adhere by depositing an instrument of adherence with the IMF. This confirms that, in accordance with its law, the State has taken all the necessary steps to enable it to carry out the terms and conditions of the NAB decision. Given the NAB decision constitutes an international agreement, the approval of the Oireachtas is necessary to allow the State to formally adhere to the decision. This Bill provides for Ireland’s adherence to the 2020 NAB decision, the text of which has been appended to the Bill as a Schedule. Under this agreement, Ireland will make available to the fund a credit arrangement of an amount, denominated in special drawing rights, SDRs, up to the equivalent of approximately €2.37 billion, which will provided by the Central Bank of Ireland. Given the role of the Central Bank in facilitating Ireland's participation in the NAB decision, sections 1 to 4, inclusive, fall within the competence of the European Central Bank. As a consequence, the Minister for Finance referred this legislation to the ECB in late December 2021. I am happy to confirm that in January, the ECB issued a formal opinion advising that the provisions relating to the NAB decision fall within the exemption from the EU treaty's prohibition on monetary finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_719"> As for how the NAB operates, the managing director of the IMF may make a proposal to establish what is referred to as an activation period, during which the fund may call on NAB participants to provide resources. Once a call has been made, NAB participants have a finite period to transfer these resources to the fund. Any proposal to establish an activation period requires a vote in favour by an 85% majority of total credit arrangements and participants and the approval of the IMF executive board. Furthermore, any subsequent call on an NAB credit arrangement will take account of each participant's economic circumstances and its capacity to make the resources available during the relevant period.</p>
          <p eId="para_720"> The current 2020 NAB decision took effect on 1 January 2021 and is due to lapse on 31 December 2025. The NAB is subject to periodic renewal and, since the original NAB decision was adopted in January 1997, it has been renewed on eight occasions. Under the terms of the NAB decision, an agreement on whether to renew or modify the NAB must be reached not later than 12 months before the end of December 2025. As such, we can anticipate these negotiations are likely to start in earnest in 2024. In the course of these negotiations and all future renewals, the terms and conditions of the NAB decision may be altered. This includes the size of the credit arrangement to be provided by Ireland, which may increase, decrease or remain unchanged. In order to facilitate Ireland's participation in future NAB decisions, Members will note section 2 includes a mechanism for Ireland to provide the necessary consent.</p>
          <p eId="para_721"> The other principal objective of the legislation relates to providing for grant contributions to IMF trust funds. A clear distinction should be drawn between the role played by the NAB and that played by trust funds, as well as the nature of Ireland's contributions to both. By contrast with the NAB, trust funds in the IMF and other international institutions do not use the institution's own resources to provide financial assistance. Instead, they usually rely exclusively on direct contributions from one or more donors, earmarked for a specific use, which are pooled to provide assistance to countries in need, often on concessional terms. The limited number of trust funds established by the IMF use donor resources to provide technical assistance and capacity development, as well as concessional lending and debt relief. A number of these, such as the poverty reduction and growth trust, PRGT, to which Ireland contributes, played a vital role in the IMF's response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The catastrophe containment and relief trust, CCRT, a trust fund to which Ireland is not currently empowered to contribute, was also utilised extensively during the crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_722"> As for Ireland’s support for these initiatives, previous Bretton Woods legislation has provided for payments from the Central Fund to IMF trust funds. Of specific interest to us in the context of this Bill is the provision in the Bretton Woods Agreements (Amendment) Act 1999, which facilitated grant contributions to an aggregate limit of IR£20 million to the IMF enhanced structural adjustment facility trust, subsequently renamed the PRGT. Following a significant contribution to the PRGT in 2017, this limit, which equates to just over €25 million, has almost been reached. As it stands, Ireland has no legislative basis for making further payments to the PRGT or any other IMF trust fund. This has put us in a difficult position in respect of meeting our obligations as an economically strong member of the IMF, at a time when the fund is seeking assistance from countries such as Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_723"> Due to the strong demands placed on fund resources earlier in the pandemic, the IMF managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, sought to replenish both the PRGT and the CCRT to ensure they would be adequately funded for future needs. In July 2021, she wrote to the Minister for Finance, in his capacity as Ireland's governor of the IMF, requesting that Ireland consider providing a grant contribution to the PRGT, as we have done previously. Similar fundraising requests were received from the managing director for the CCRT in March 2020 and May 2021. In each response, the Minister advised the managing director a legislative amendment would be required before Ireland could consider any contributions to either trust fund. The Bill provides this legislative basis. By providing for future grant contributions to the PRGT and the CCRT up to a maximum aggregate sum of €50 million each, the legislation will also allow us to respond swiftly to future crises, to play our part as an active and supportive member of the international community and to contribute towards Ireland’s target of reaching the official development assistance, ODA, target of 0.7% of GNI by 2030.</p>
          <p eId="para_724"> The Bill also contemplates grant contributions to other IMF trust funds, whether established or yet to be established. The rationale for this provision is to ensure Ireland can react appropriately in supporting targeted fund responses to future crises. Any proposed contributions to such trust funds will be subject to the approval of a ministerial order by both Houses in the first instance, followed by a resolution by Dáil Éireann to approve the payment. Ireland's participation in the NAB will be in the form of a credit arrangement provided by the Central Bank, which the fund will repay with interest after a maximum of ten years. By contrast, contributions to trust funds are in the form of grant aid, with no expectation of repayment, and are therefore generally considered to be eligible as ODA.</p>

          <p eId="para_729"> These are important amendments. If the Minister of State has a note, reading it into the record would be good. These are consequent to amendments that both I and Deputy Cian O'Callaghan had around building control-related matters where the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, undertook to bring forward his own amendments. Therefore, it would be remiss for the Minister of State not to make any comment before we approve them. They are not contentious but it is important to have it recorded in the Dáil record.</p>

          <p eId="para_732">One of the great weaknesses of the earlier draft of the Bill was there was no mention of the Building Control Acts at all. It was genuinely surprising that in such important legislation, the origins of which arose from the non-existence of building control legislation in the 1970s and early 1980s and breaches of subsequent building control legislation, that there was no mention of those Acts. It is a small technical point but it is welcome that this is in the Bill. It could be materially relevant to certain categories of complaint that may be taken against certain categories of construction industry professionals at a later stage. I welcome the fact that the Government has introduced these amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_741">I move amendment No. 5:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_742">In page 10, to delete lines 12 to 26 and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_743">"(4) The Minister shall appoint the National Building Control Office as the registration body under <i>subsection (2)</i>.".</p>
          <p eId="para_744">This is probably one of the more important amendments that a number of us are tabling today. I know the Minister of State will not accept it but I will take the opportunity to at least explain to him why he should accept it so that it also is a matter that is on the Dáil record.</p>
          <p eId="para_745"> As the Minister of State will be aware, the purpose of this register is to have a statutory register of competence for construction industry professionals. The history of such a register is long. It was first proposed by the Law Reform Commission in 1977, a time when there was a significant concern among many people at poor quality building works. Unfortunately, the Government, not only of that day but for many decades afterwards, chose not to advance the idea of a statutory register. It was the death of Fiachra Daly, one of the owners of a property in Priory Hall, that provoked the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Mr. Phil Hogan, to take seriously the need to reform our building control system, and one of the measures was to revive the Law Reform Commission's proposal of 1977 to have a statutory register. The Law Reform Commission, in its wisdom, argued that register should be fully independent, importantly, of industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_746"> The relevant section of the Bill that my amendment relates to creates a situation where one, and only one, organisation can be the home of this register, that is, the Construction Industry Federation, CIF. It is not named in the Bill, which is particularly unusual, but all of the eligibility criteria, abstract and arbitrary as they are, point to that organisation and that organisation only. Of course, we know, because CIF currently manages the non-statutory register, that it will be the home.</p>
          <p eId="para_747"> This is in direct contravention of the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission. It is also in direct contravention of common sense. Given the fact that a small, but significant, number of construction industry professionals, as individuals and in companies, over a long period of time flagrantly breached building control regulations causing significant hardship, heartache, financial loss and, in the case of Ms Stephanie Meehan and her children, the loss of her partner and their father, Fiachra Daly, it is incredible that the Government would allow this register to be located in the Construction Industry Federation.</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> I have no problem with CIF. I engage with it all the time. It is an organisation that has an important role to play in the construction industry but it is a lobby organisation. Its job is to lobby for industry. Its job is to try to influence Government policy in the best interests of its members. It provides other functions but lobbying is its primary one. The idea that we will place a statutory register of competence of construction industry professionals in the same building with the same central telephone number and the same individuals, that the register is a place where individuals who may have complaints to make against the competence of those construction industry professionals make complaints and the staff who, as for other sections of the Bill, will investigate those complaints are all people from the Construction Industry Federation, and the board itself has a disproportionate number of members of the Construction Industry Federation beggars believe.</p>
          <p eId="para_749"> This amendment would place the responsibility for this register with the National Building Control Office, NBCO. That office was established also by the then Minister, Mr. Hogan, following the Priory Hall building control reforms, although only introduced much more recently. It is fully independent. It is made up of some of the country's leading building control professionals and experts. Ms Mairéad Phelan is the head of that body, and formerly was the head of building control in Fingal County Council. It has been tasked with the important job of helping cleaning up our building control system and I can think of no better organisation to place it into.</p>
          <p eId="para_750"> The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan's counterpart, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, could not provide a single compelling reason this register should be in the hands of the Construction Industry Federation. There are some Chinese walls set up in the legislation in terms of the board. The legislation states the board must be independent etc., but if we are not only to clean up the building industry but to make it clear to the public that has happened, for public perception alone one would not locate this important statutory register within the Construction Industry Federation.</p>
          <p eId="para_751"> As I stated on Committee Stage, I suspect the only reason the Construction Industry Federation abandoned its long-standing opposition to this register - the CIF opposed it in the 1970s, in the 1980s and in the 1990s - and the only reason, I believe, it no longer opposes the register is because it is getting to hold and to manage it, and as we will see when we get to some other subsequent amendments of some importance, certainly, to some of us in opposition, the purpose, function and scope of the register, particularly in terms of dealing with building defects or suspected building defects is incredibly weak.</p>
          <p eId="para_752"> This is an amendment, as the Minister of State can probably hear from the tone of my voice, I feel strongly about. Like other Members who will speak, I have many years of experience of working directly with families - homeowners, private renters and social renters - who are today living in defective buildings and who, had a proper fully-independent statutory register been in place back then, would not be. That is why I want this legislation, which my party is supporting, to be the strongest, most robust and most effective protection against rogue builders and building contractors as possible and locating this register in the Construction Industry Federation is not the right thing to do. Therefore, I certainly will be pressing the amendment to ensure it is located in a fully independent body. I believe the National Building Control Office is the right place for it to be located.</p>

        <speech by="#CianOCallaghan" eId="spk_189">
          <from>Deputy Cian O'Callaghan<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T19:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_753">I cannot understand why the Government would oppose us on this amendment and why the Government would not want the strongest, most robust and most independent regulator in terms of building works. That is what this amendment seeks to do. By opposing this amendment, it means not only will the public not have confidence in the building register but we will not get a strong, robust and independent regulator, which is badly needed. Having to explain why that is badly needed, it seems patently obvious that everyone here would understand that.</p>
          <p eId="para_754"> I refer to the public cost to the taxpayer. The cost of pyrite remediation is at €150 million. The cost of fire safety defects and building defects in schools is at €160 million. The cost of fixing faulty wastewater systems will reach €300 million. The cost of fire safety defects, mainly from Celtic tiger-era apartments, could run to over €1 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">An estimated 90,000 apartments are affected. We know the cost of the mica remediation scheme will be in excess of €2 billion. That is just the financial cost to taxpayers, which is significant, but the human cost has been even greater. As Deputy Ó Broin said, we have seen the loss of life in terms of the death of Fiachra Daly and the significant impact that had on his loved ones - his family, partner, children, wider family and community. Building defects are a major stress for each individual and family who deal with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_756"> For most regular people, a home is the largest financial investment they will make in their life, but it is also where people invest so much emotionally. A home provides people with safety and security and meets their basic needs, but it is also where they spend key moments in their life. It is where their children are brought back to when they are born. It is where they celebrate their birthdays. It is often where people die and everything around that happens. It is a huge emotional investment for individuals and families. When the home people have invested so much in begins to fall apart and crumble or they learn it is not safe due to fire safety defects or whatever else, it causes major shock and stress and people deal with it in lots of different ways. Because it is so stressful, the first thing some people do is go into denial. They do not know what to do. It is not something they ever expected or anticipated.</p>
          <p eId="para_757"> For these reasons, it is important that we get this right by having an independent, robust regulator of building works and building providers. However, the Bill is constructed in such a way that we will not have that. The regulator will be run by the industry and the lobby group for the industry. That is unforgivable. It is no comment on the lobby group, which is an effective one, but its members are not the right people to run this body, as it means it cannot be fully independent. What is more, we have the right body to do this in the National Building Control Office. We need a national building control authority like the Food Safety Authority. It needs to be strong and to be placed on a statutory footing. That is the least we must do. The NBCO is the right place to locate this office. I cannot for the life of me understand why that approach is not being taken. If this country did not have the recent history I outlined, it still would not be justified, but given everything that has happened, how on earth can the Government attempt to justify this?</p>

          <from>Deputy Ged Nash<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T19:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_758">I will speak to amendment No. 6 in due course, but I will first speak to amendment No. 5 briefly because it directly relates to the general issue that is informing this debate. As Deputies Cian O'Callaghan and Ó Broin articulated, it should be obvious to everyone - it is obvious to everyone except the Department and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke - that the pre-eminent lobby group for the construction industry should not be where the registration body and responsibility for registration is housed. That should evidently be the case but, bizarrely, the Government has decided to house this extremely important registration body that will essentially regulate the standards and performance of the building industry in the very same organisation that lobbies quite effectively, as Deputy Cian O'Callaghan said, for that industry. It simply does not make sense. It is the equivalent of the banks regulating themselves. We know where poor regulation has got this country, and the impact of poor regulation on the many thousands of people who live in defective apartments that are awaiting the outcome of a process. We know the impact on people in Donegal who have been living in homes affected by mica and the distress that is causing. It is extraordinary, and it is unpalatable to me and to most right-thinking members of the public, that the Construction Industry Federation would be the body responsible for registration in this regard. It simply does not make sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_759"> I wish to speak to amendment No. 6. While Deputy Ó Broin is correct that the CIF is not explicitly referenced in the legislation, which is unusual in itself, all of the indicators point to the fact that it will operate the register. The reason I drafted the amendment in the way I have is that it directly references and relates to the Construction Industry Federation, because under the provisions of the Trade Union Acts 1871 to 1990, it is considered to be a trade union of employers and it has a negotiating licence. By accept the amendment, the Minister would be effectively excluding the Construction Industry Federation from the responsibility that this legislation will bestow on it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Malcolm Noonan<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T19:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_760">Before I refer to the note, I will address some of the points raised by the Deputies. It is the case that the Government wants a robust regulator. Deputy Cian O'Callaghan has pointed out some of the failings of the past, which there is no doubt have been substantial and have caused considerable hurt to people as well as financial cost to the Exchequer. It is for that reason that the legislation is being introduced. We want to have a well regulated industry in Ireland that is functional and able to meet the requirements under Housing for All, but also to ensure that we have a system in place that supports the industry as well. We all want the same thing here.</p>
          <p eId="para_761"> We also want a body that has expertise in construction and to set the precise standards that a builder should possess to be able to carry out work efficiently and to the very high standards that are now required both in construction and in terms of energy. There have been significant changes since some of the incidents the Deputy referenced.</p>
          <p eId="para_762"> I give assurances that the statutory body to be appointed will be independent. That is something that has perhaps sparked the two Opposition amendments. Deputy Cian O'Callaghan made a point about cleaning up the building industry. We all want to achieve what has been said about the robustness and independence of the body. The role of the NBCO is compliance with building regulations and not the competence of builders. That is something that needs to be pointed out as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_763"> I will specifically address amendment No. 5, tabled by Deputies Cian O'Callaghan, Ó Broin and Gould, and amendment No. 6, tabled by Deputies Ó Ríordáin and Nash. Section 8 provides that the Government may make an order appointing a body to perform the functions of the registration body. It sets out that the body can be a public body or otherwise, and it provides that the body must be capable of performing the functions conferred.</p>
          <p eId="para_764"> Amendment No. 5 seeks to provide that the National Building Control Office will be appointed as the registration body. Amendment No. 6 seeks to disqualify a trade union from being appointed as the registration body, as outlined by Deputy Nash. I must oppose both of these amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_765"> The Attorney General's office has advised that the Bill should not name the body which is to be appointed as the registration body in the Bill. Where a body appointed is not performing the functions required, another entity may be appointed "to perform the functions of the registration body" under the Bill without any amendment being required to the primary legislation. It is envisaged that the Construction Industry Federation will be appointed as the registration body. The CIF is registered as a trade union. It is preferable that a body with experience and expertise in the construction industry performs this function, similar to how the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, RIAI, and the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, operate statutory registers for architects and surveyors.</p>
          <p eId="para_766"> There are a number of safeguards in place to ensure and maintain the independence of the registration body. The registration body will have delegated responsibility for the day-to-day maintenance of the register within the confines of the specific and limited parameters set out in the Bill. The board of the registration body will be completely independent of the body.</p>
          <p eId="para_767"> The independence of the registration body will be maintained through the following measures. All powers of the registration body will be prescribed in legislation. All competency requirements for registration will be recommended by the board and prescribed by the Minister. The board will make decisions in relation to all sanctions including removal from the register. Removal from the register must be confirmed by the High Court. All prosecutions under the Act will be taken by the board or the Director of Public Prosecutions. All members of the appeals committee will be independent from the board and the registration body. The Bill allows the functions of the registration body to be transferred if the body is not performing its functions satisfactorily. In that regard, there is a robust mechanism there to ensure the independence of the body and the effective implementation of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">In that regard, I will oppose amendments Nos. 5 and 6.</p>

          <p eId="para_769">I thank the Minister of State for his response. Part of the difficulty is that regulations have not improved that much since the incidents many of us talked about. In fact, in many instances the problem was not the regulations but their lack of enforcement. What has changed is in respect of building processes? There is a new system of certification, which is an improvement on the system that was there before, although it is not to the satisfaction of many of us on this side of the House, but in respect of construction materials there has been no change to the enforcement regime whatsoever. While it would be more difficult for a Priory Hall, a Beacon South Quarter, a Belmayne or a Brú Na Sionna to happen today, it would not be impossible. I will explain why in a moment. For example, there is nothing in any aspect of building control regulation enforcement that would today prevent more defective blocks from emerging, such as we have in counties Donegal, Mayo, Sligo, Tipperary and Clare.</p>
          <p eId="para_770"> The central problem, however, is the bad reputation of a small but significant section of the construction industry, which we all know about, and the fact there are contemporary examples of that which have been discussed at some length in the committee on housing, such as Larkfield House in my constituency in Clondalkin, a building of 48 apartments recently built and tenanted with no compliance with planning or building control. There has not been a single certificate of commencement, of completion, of fire safety, of disability, all of which are criminal offences under the Building Control Acts. Despite the fact that building is fully tenanted, the State is paying two thirds of the rent through the housing assistance payment, HAP, and enforcement proceedings against the development in that instance are operating at a snail's pace. We have a big problem to clean up and locating a register such as this in the primary lobby organisation for that industry makes no sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_771"> I will conclude by saying again that nothing the Minister of State said has justified why this register should be in the Construction Industry Federation. If the only part of his comment was that the registration authority should be competent at building, there are many other organisations, such as the National Building Control Office that should be. I have yet to hear an argument why. That is why I will press the amendment.</p>

        <speech by="#CianOCallaghan" eId="spk_193">
          <from>Deputy Cian O'Callaghan<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T19:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_772">I have to agree with that. There is nothing in the Minister of State's response that is in any way convincing on this. The one rationale given was that there is advice that we cannot name the entity in the legislation. Therefore, the Minister of State could accept amendment No. 6, which would prohibit the CIF and does not actually name the entity. He has told the Dáil and, frankly, I find this absolutely absurd, that the entity will be independent and it will be the Construction Industry Federation. Could you imagine a situation where there was a major problem in this country in respect of ethics around political parties, donations and fundraising to which the solution would be that political parties would regulate themselves on this, but there would be some legislation outlining how they would have an independent board and there would be parameters around that and so forth? That would not be acceptable to anyone.</p>
          <p eId="para_773"> This is utterly absurd after what we have gone through as a country on this. The proposal is that the people who will be in charge of regulating the industry will be in the industry itself. This is not any industry that just happens to have a few problems. The problems here have run incredibly deep. Yes, it is not everybody in the industry. Some of the biggest critics of the lack of regulation are themselves builders who are very annoyed at the shoddy standards that have been tolerated over the years. Councillor Deirdre Ní Fhloinn has pointed out there has never even been a conviction under the Building Control Acts, despite everything that has happened so far. We know that so far very few actions have been taken in terms of the voluntary register. We need a strong, robust, independent regulator. The notion that the industry lobby group would be independent and is the best place to do that is utterly absurd.</p>

          <p eId="para_774">It would be helpful to read into the record the kinds of bodies that are excluded from becoming the registration body under this Bill. It is stated on page 11, In this section— “excluded body” means any of the following: ... a political party, or a body that promotes a political party or candidate; ... a body that promotes a political cause; ... [or] a chamber of commerce." It could be argued that the Construction Industry Federation is a political body. It registers with the Standards in Public Office Commission to lobby and it makes returns to that registration body on<i> lobbying.ie</i> regarding the lobbying it does. It does that very effectively and within the framework of the law, as it should. The Construction Industry Federation is, by any standards, a very effective representative body. I have worked very closely with it over the years during my spell in government when I was responsible for health and safety, for example. I have worked with the CIF on those issues, in partnership with trade union organisations, and I have worked with it to advance, for example, sectoral employment orders to make sure there is a basic flow of decency for construction workers in this country in respect of pay, terms and conditions, pensions and so on. In layperson's terms, it is an organisation that, partly at the very least, advances political causes. It might be described as a chamber of commerce of some kind.</p>
          <p eId="para_775"> The Minister of State stated, and he is right, that there are a range of checks and balances in the legislation regarding the independence - I use that term advisedly - of any registration body but, in layperson's terms, the CIF is to all intents and purposes primarily a representative body that lobbies in the best interests of the organisations it represents. If the conflicts of interest are not apparent this evening and are not apparent to Ministers in the Department, then I am concerned.</p>

          <p eId="para_776">I have given assurances regarding the Attorney General's advice around not naming the body appointed. The mechanism exists, where the body appointed is not performing its functions, for another entity to be appointed. That is part of the checks and balances that exist in addition to the seven points I raised relating to the independence of the registration body. I again give those assurances to Members. I know that is probably not acceptable but I again point it out.</p>

It relates to a proposal whereby, in the appointment of the chairperson of the board or members of the board under a later amendment or members of the appeals committee under a further amendment, there would be an explicit mention of the use of the Public Appointments Service, PAS. I am happy to withdraw my amendment at this stage if the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, is in a position to indicate whether the Department is still considering the possibility of tabling amendments in the Seanad.</p>

          <p eId="para_1018">I will not push this to a full vote, but I wish to make a point. The PAS exists for a reason. My understanding is that the Government is meant to be operating a protocol whereby the service is always used, but we know that it has not been used in a number of high-profile cases recently. If someone was being appointed as the chair of the board of this important body, I would have thought that he or she would want the protection of being appointed through the PAS process, as that would satisfy the requirement for independence that the Minister of State mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019"> It is disappointing that the Government is not considering this amendment, although I welcome the comments about the later amendments. I will not prolong debate on this matter, so I will press the amendment.</p>

There was a great deal of unanimity on this issue on the Opposition side and, while this Bill might not have been the right legislative location for the amendments, it gave us the opportunity to raise the matter. Is the briefing note being prepared and can it be provided to the committee? On the basis of the Minister of State's answer, I might be happy to withdraw two of the amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_1039"> The three amendments suggested by the Deputies are not appropriate to this section of the Bill. The Bill provides for a register of providers of building works. The competence criteria for registration in each division of the register is determined by the board, approved by the Minister and will be published on the website. Section 29 of the Bill provides that the Minister shall prescribe the required qualifications, experience, or a combination of both, that shall be required to be registered in a division and these shall be set out in secondary legislation for each division of registration.</p>

          <p eId="para_1040">The Minister of State was not privy to the lengthy discussion on related amendments on Committee Stage. From my reading of it, there is nothing currently in the legislation that would ensure that somebody who had been found to be in breach of building regulations could for that reason be struck off the register. That is one of the fundamental weaknesses of it. In addition to the criteria outlined by the Minister of State, insisting that to be on the register somebody would have to have a track record of adhering to the requirements of building regulations, would strengthen the Bill. I appreciate the Minister is not going to accept amendment No. 10, but I will press it nonetheless.</p>

          <p eId="para_1051">The concern in terms of this amendment relates to the original discussion we had about the independence of the body. If I understand this section of the Bill, it means that the people who carry out the inspections will be people who were previously employed by the Construction Industry Federation. Therefore, they will be seconded to the register for the purposes of doing this work. How then can we ensure their independence, even if there is a statutory legal requirement? Would it not be better if those staff were independent completely, as in employed for that purpose by the registration authority rather than, if I understand the section properly, shifted as staff members of CIF to being staff members of the registration board?</p>

          <p eId="para_1055">I move amendment No. 14:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1056">In page 20, to delete lines 18 to 23 and substitute the following: </p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1057">"(3) The chairperson of the Board shall be appointed through the Public Appointments Service and shall have knowledge and experience of construction, building control, building standards, planning and related legislation; and other areas that the Minister may specify by way of regulations.". </p>
          <p eId="para_1058">Again, I do not want to repeat a debate we had on Committee Stage. While the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, did not accept earlier amendments, he did indicate that there may be some reconsideration from the Government's point of view of the configuration of the board or membership of the board. Can the Minister of State give us an update on whether that work has progressed, if there still is work ongoing within the Department in that regard and if the Government is likely to bring forth an amendment on this general area during the passage of the Bill through the Seanad, albeit not on the specific issues we mentioned here? The real concern for many of us, which goes back to the issue of independence, is that the independence is somewhat undermined in my view, first, by the Minister not requiring the involvement of the Public Appointments Service and, second, by the very heavy dependence on staff from Government Departments and the Construction Industry Federation. Why not, as set out in amendment No. 17, have a process combined of the Public Appointments Service nominations with nominations from a variety of bodies to ensure the full range of knowledge, skills and experience is obtained from, for example, the range of agencies such as the Irish Planning Institute, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Society of Chartered Surveyors of Ireland and Construction Defences Alliance representing householders who are impacted by negligent or shoddy building work, etc?</p>
          <p eId="para_1059"> I know the Minister of State does not propose to accept this group of amendments, but he might update us on whether work is under way on reconfiguring what is currently in the Bill.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ged Nash<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T20:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1060">I will speak directly to amendment No. 18. One element of the amendment relates to the requirement as I see it and as, I think, do other Opposition spokespersons and parties as well, that representation from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions should be explicitly provided for in the legislation. That is not unusual. One would imagine, if the prevalent primary employer body that represents the construction industry is to be housing and accommodating the registration body, that in the interests of balance there should be, at the very least, some kind of explicit reference and requirement to have representation from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on the body. I would have thought that this requirement is obvious for a number of different reasons, including that ICTU is the largest civil society organisation on the island of Ireland and it represents a very considerable number of construction workers who have considerable expertise in this area and could bring their own skill-sets, expertise and professionalism to bear on this. They are also homeowners and active citizens who are concerned about housing standards, housing more generally, planning and our built environment and the environment more generally. </p>
          <p eId="para_1061"> I ask the Minister of State to consider that and to respond to the points made by Deputy Ó Broin because we were given some indication during our brief contributions on Committee Stage that the Minister and the Department would look at some adjustments to the various provisions relating to this section. I would appreciate an update on that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CianOCallaghan" eId="spk_221">
          <from>Deputy Cian O'Callaghan<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T20:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1062">I will speak specifically to amendment No. 19, but I am supportive of the other amendments in this group. My amendment seeks representation on the board from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, but also from other specific groups such as the Construction Defects Alliance. That we would not have representation from homeowners and people who have been at the coalface of dealing with building defects and have suffered in that regard is indefensible. They should be represented on this board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063"> There is another point I want to make. Earlier in this discussion we were given assurances by the Minister of State that we should not worry that the independent regulator is to be housed in and run by the Construction Industry Federation because there are mechanisms in place to ensure the independence of the regulator and that includes the independence of the board. My amendment No. 19 seeks the deletion of lines 31 to 35 on page 20. Line 31, page 20, states: "5 persons who are nominated for such appointment by the registration body— " The registration body, as the Minister of State has told us, is to be the Construction Industry Federation. In regard to the great assurance that we have been given that this board will be independent, ensuring that the regulator is independent, when one reads the legislation one finds that half of the board will be appointed by the Construction Industry Federation. Not only will the Construction Industry Federation be running the board that is meant to be regulating builders, it will appoint half the members of that board who are meant to guarantee the independence. You could not make this up. It is utterly absurd after everything that has happened in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064"> I am calling on the Minister of State to accept our amendments in order to address this absurdity whereby the industry would be regulating itself. </p>

          <p eId="para_1065">I will specifically refer to these amendments, which I will oppose. On Committee Stage, the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, indicated that he would bring forward amendments to the Seanad to provide that the chair and certain other members of the board would be recruited through the Public Appointments Service, and that the following would also nominate members: the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Ministers for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and Enterprise, Trade and Employment; and the registration body. In light of this, we will review section 22 and table amendments, as we have outlined, when the Bill is before Seanad Éireann.</p>

        <speech by="#EoinOBroin" eId="spk_223">

          <p eId="para_1066">In his discussions with officials I ask that the Minister of State to go two steps further. The first is that in addition to some of the new nominating bodies he has mentioned, we seek to also have the following included: National Building Control Office - it makes no sense for that office not to be on the board; the Construction Defects Alliance; the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland; and the Irish Planning Institute. If these nominees were there instead of those from the registration body, which is the CIF, two things would be achieved. The issue of independence that Deputy O'Callaghan has quite rightly recognised would be dealt with and there would also be a better range of skills. I am not in any way opposed to somebody from the CIF having a place on the board. That would be reasonable and the federation has a contribution to make. That is provided for in my amendment. Allowing the CIF to have five members on the board and not having anybody from the other organisations that we have mentioned makes no sense. The Government has gone halfway towards what is required here, and I urge the Minister of State to have that discussion with the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, the Minister and their officials to see if we could go the full way so the board is fully independent, is seen to be independent, and has the requisite requirement of skills and organisations, which the combination of our amendments seeks to achieve.</p>

        <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_224">
          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2022-03-23T20:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1067">I support this group of amendments. I am not on that committee so I was not part of that discussion, but fair points have been made. It really is quite extraordinary that the CIF would be the body to house the register of building providers. This is an attempt or effort at regulation of an industry that has failed so badly in many respects, including the health and safety of workers, bogus self-employment, desperate defects such as fire safety, mica, pyrite and you name it, all of which has cost the State an absolute fortune. It has cost the lives of building workers, it has caused misery for homeowners and it has resulted in buildings that are fire hazards for those who live in them. One could just go through the list. It is extraordinary that the body in control of that industry, that allowed this sort of stuff to happen, and that represents builders and developers, is going to house the register. It seems to me absolutely amazing that they would have the right to appoint five members to the board. I take the Minister of State's point that consideration is being given to amending this when the Bill is before the Seanad to give greater representation to others, but I am not sure why this cannot be done here in response to the amendments that have been tabled by Deputies Ó Broin, Nash, and O'Callaghan.</p>
          <p eId="para_1068"> It is completely unacceptable but it also appears to run afoul of another provision of the Bill that states the body chosen by the Minister to house the register - or whatever phrase is used in the Bill - cannot be "a body that promotes a political cause". The CIF promotes political causes. It is constantly promoting political causes. It is lobbying for the industry all of the time. It lobbied against Covid restrictions, for example, at particular points in time. It is constantly lobbying in the interests of its members in what is self-evidently a political form of lobbying. Deputy Barry quips behind me that it is the "industrial wing of Fianna Fáil". Whether that is true or not, it is certainly a credible point.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069"> In all seriousness, if we are to exclude bodies that campaign for political causes then that would exclude the Construction Industry Federation, to my mind. It absolutely excludes them. There is a contradiction in the legislation from that point of view. Any serious definition of bodies that promote particular political causes would absolutely include the CIF, which is one of the most active bodies in campaigning and lobbying for its particular members to affect politics and affect public policy. I just wanted to add this point, if had not already been made. The Government must seriously rethink this. Those who control the industry should not be the ones charged with regulating it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1070">To come back to the points raised by the Deputies Nash and O'Callaghan, again, it is intended that the Department of Housing. Local Government and Heritage nominee may be on the political control side of things. Similarly with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, there would be a consumer representative. I give the commitment that when the Bill is before the Seanad we will give further consideration to those in reviewing section 22. That may be the best place to try to further tease out those representative groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071"> Separately, I wish to address the points raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett. The points had been raised earlier in the context of other amendments. It is not specific that the body is named in the Bill. The mechanism is there. I outlined earlier to Members the independence of the body and the robustness of that to ensure that it is an independent structure. I have given those assurances to the Members in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_1238">I move amendment No. 24:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1239">In page 36, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:</p>

          <p eId="para_1241">This amendment is on registration and it seeks to require that any builder would have to provide evidence that he or she is eligible for latent defects insurance. At the committee it was correctly pointed out that latent defects insurance is required for each job and that in order to register, a builder would not necessarily be in possession of such insurance, which is a fair point. That is why this amendment seeks to enforce a requirement for eligibility for latent defects insurance. If someone is a rogue builder, he or she will have defects and deficiencies in a number of different projects and will not be eligible for latent defects insurance, in which case he or she should not be able to register to be a builder. I am interested to hear the response to this as the amendment has taken on board the comments that were made by the Minister of State on Committee Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_1242">We will be opposing this amendment. The amendment seeks to require an applicant for registration to provide evidence that he or she is eligible for latent defects insurance. Latent defects insurance is taken out on a project-by-project basis and is it is not practical that the registration should be conditioned on the possession of or eligibility for such insurance. While a builder of residential or non-residential buildings should possess such insurance, other categories or providers of building works such as bricklayers and plasterers do not require it. It is worth noting that while latent defects insurance is not a mandatory requirement, lending institutions and consumers are likely to demand it. I recognise that this is an important consumer product, particularly in the residential market, and I will review how this product is further promoted and encouraged so that consumers are aware of it. This would have the effect of encouraging the take-up of latent defects insurance.</p>

          <p eId="para_1256">I move amendment No. 30:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1257">In page 45, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1258">“(i) failure to comply with building control regulations.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1259">This is among the most important set of amendments that my colleagues and I have tabled.</p>
          <p eId="para_1260">We are creating a register, which is a good thing. That register is a register of competence. There will be a set of criteria against which somebody can become a member of that register. If at some stage a complaint is made against a person for failure to comply with the terms of the register, one of the sanctions is that he or she can be struck off. That is all very good. These amendments seek to ensure that, in addition to non-compliance with the competency requirements of the register, if a contractor, company or individual is proven to have failed to comply with building control regulations or planning permission, a third party could make a complaint. If that complaint is found against the contractor, he or she could be, among other things, struck off.</p>
          <p eId="para_1261"> When we had a lengthy discussion about this on Committee Stage, we were told that this amendment was not necessary and that the building control regulations and the building control authorities were responsible and, therefore, that is where this matter should be dealt with. The difficulty is that, first, there has never been a successful prosecution for breach of building control regulations and, second, even if there were a successful prosecution, it would not prevent the party who had breached building control regulations from remaining on the register and continuing to practise. For example, under this regime, the developer who built Priory Hall would still be able to register, as long as he complied with the other conditions set out in the Bill, and would be able to practise. Even if that individual were to be found to be in breach of building control regulations by a building control authority in the future - these are very serious breaches, such as building work that is not fire safety compliant or not structurally sound, which could cost enormous sums of money for homeowners to remediate, and that is even before we talk about the emotional and psychological stress - these people would be able to continue to trade. It is incredible that we are going to give up the opportunity, in setting up of a register such as this, to send a clear signal to industry that if individuals have a history of breaching building control regulations, they should be struck off the register and never allowed to practise again.</p>
          <p eId="para_1262"> When I interviewed Stephanie Meehan, one of the homeowners in Priory Hall whose partner, Fiachra Daly, took his own life because of the pressure of Priory Hall, one of the things she said about the developer who built that development was that he should never be allowed on a building site again. She is correct, but there is nothing in the law that would allow us to achieve that. These amendments, or a version that could be crafted by the Department's officials and brought forward on Committee Stage in the Seanad, would ensure that, in addition to the other elements of this Bill, somebody negatively affected by breaches of building control regulations could take a complaint to the register and, if successful, could have a rogue builder or contractor struck off. That seems eminently sensible to me. I cannot for the life of me understand why the Government would give up this opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1263"> I know the Minister of State will not accept these amendments, unless he has had a wonderful change of heart, which I would celebrate enormously, but I am still urging the Department to reconsider this crucial matter between now and Committee Stage in the Seanad because if we do not do it here, it will not get done. In ten, 20 or 30 years' time, there will be another group of people in this Chamber asking why in God's name did their predecessors not take this chance and why did they allow the possibility of rogue builders, who have a proven track record of breaching building control regulations, remaining on a register and continuing to practice. For these reasons, I urge the Minister of State to consider the substance of the amendment, if not the text itself.</p>

          <p eId="para_1264">Section 44 outlines the grounds for complaint under the Act regarding a registered member to the registration body. We must oppose amendments Nos. 30 and 31 to section 44, which seek to provide that failure to comply with building regulations and planning permission would be grounds for complaint. They are outside the scope of the Bill. This register is a register of competence of providers of building works. Therefore, non-compliance with building regulations is not grounds for a complaint.</p>
          <p eId="para_1265"> Failure to comply with building regulations is a matter for the building control authorities and this falls under the Building Control Act 1990. Failure to comply with planning permission is a matter for planning authorities and this falls under the Planning and Development Act 2000. Complaints with regard to these are matters for the relevant authorities, as we have outlined previously. While these cannot be grounds for a complaint under the Bill, a conviction could be used as evidence for a complaint along with further evidence. I hope that clarifies the matter. I take on board the points made about the appalling previous practices but, again, these amendments are outside the scope of the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_1266">The developer of Priory Hall has never been convicted, but we all know that he was responsible for one of the worst examples of building control breaches, so much so that the gross cost to the State is €70 million and the net cost to the State for that one development alone is €20 million. However, on the basis of what the Minister of State said, that individual can return to the State - he is currently practising in the building trade in Belfast - and register and if he can provide proof that he adheres to the other criteria, we will allow him to build again. This is one of those rare moments where the Government actually has a chance to accept an argument of the Opposition and make a significant change. I accept that I am seeking to significantly widen the scope of the register, but if we do not do it, there will be no mechanism to prevent rogue builders from being registered and continuing to practise in the future. It is one of those moments where the Minister of State and his colleagues will look back and think they did the wrong thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1267"> I am not going to continue the debate because we had a very detailed debate on Committee Stage. We will return to this on Committee Stage in the Seanad. If we do not pass this amendment, or a similar amendment, we are saying it will be perpetually permissible in this State for builders, such as the builder who built Priory Hall, and there are many more like him, to continue to trade and build because there is nothing in the law to prevent them from being struck off. That is incredible. In the context of other registers, for example, if I were an architect who trades as an architect but is not properly qualified, I could be struck off the register and never practise again. That is a relatively minor infringement in comparison with the types of building contractors we are talking about.</p>
          <p eId="para_1268"> I urge the Minister of State to reflect on the issue, talk to his colleagues and consider something like this between now and Committee Stage in the Seanad. Otherwise, it will be a moment we live to regret for a very long time.</p>

          <p eId="para_1269">Again, I reiterate that these amendments are outside the scope of the Bill. When the Bill comes before the Seanad, there will be further discussion on this matter. The Building Control Act and the Planning and Development Act provide the mechanisms around compliance in relation to planning permission and building regulations. I make those particular points, but there will also be further discussion on this matter in the Seanad shortly.</p>
