          <p eId="para_9">I welcome Mr. Fred Barry, CEO of the National Roads Authority, NRA, to discuss the development of road links along the Border region. Mr. Barry is accompanied by Mr. Michael Nolan, head of regional and programme management with the NRA. We look forward to exploring how infrastructure development can be progressed to the benefit of citizens and the economy both North and South of the Border.</p>
          <p eId="para_10"> Before I call Mr. Barry to make his presentation, I advise witnesses that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at this committee. However, if they are directed by it to cease making remarks on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their remarks. They are directed that only cognisant evidence on the subject matter of this meeting is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> We look forward to a good morning's work. In addition to members of the committee, we have been joined by a number of Members from counties Leitrim and Sligo with an interest in connectivity. While we appreciate that Mr. Barry's remit is in the southern jurisdiction, we are looking at the long-term vision and the potential for connectivity. I do not doubt that members will have many questions and observations to make.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_2">
          <from> Mr. Fred Barry<recordedTime time="2013-10-24T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_12">I am grateful for the opportunity to address the committee on the development of national roads in the Border region and links to Northern Ireland. Members will, no doubt, be acutely aware that the economic downturn in this part of the island has necessarily resulted in the cancellation or curtailment of many plans and projects that were to be funded from the public purse. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the national roads improvement programme, which has seen the NRA's funding reduced by 83% from peak levels, and halved between 2012 and 2013 alone. In real terms, the authority has had to deal with a reduction from a peak of more than €1.5 billion to approximately €280 million this year. It is a case of having to cut our cloth to measure and, consequently, our scope for undertaking major improvement works on our national road network, which comprises more than 5,500 km of carriageway, is now extremely limited. Unfortunately, this will continue to be the case for the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> During the period from December 1999, when the British-Irish Agreement came into force, to 2010 the authority's national roads programme was largely focused, in line with Government policy, on the development of motorway links between Dublin and the major cities on the island, namely, Cork, Waterford, Limerick, Galway and Belfast. The M1 motorway from Dublin to the Border was the first of these major interurban motorways to be completed in its entirety. Coupled with the improvements implemented by Transport Northern Ireland from the Border to Belfast, the construction of this high quality corridor linking the two principal cities on the island has brought significant time savings, reduced transport costs and enhanced safety for road users. An important element of the Dublin to Belfast project was the construction of the A1-M1 Newry to Dundalk dual carriageway scheme, which was jointly managed and was a model of co-operation between the authority, Transport Northern Ireland and the local authorities involved. I am pleased to say that, through our experience of working together on the A1-M1 project and through our contacts on other road schemes of mutual interest, the NRA and Transport Northern Ireland have established a close and positive working relationship.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> The authority's major interurban programme in the period to 2010 has not been undertaken at the exclusion of other routes. We were able to complete a number of major schemes which have provided significant time saving and safety benefits for users of other road corridors, including the main cross-Border routes. Examples of these include the N2-A5 road, which saw the construction of bypasses to Carrickmacross, Monaghan and Castleblaney, as well as the motorway link from the M50 to the north of Ashbourne. The M3 Dublin-Ballyshannon route saw the completion of 60 km of new motorway from Clonee to the north of Kells, while the N4 Dublin-Sligo route, which connects to Enniskillen via the N16 and Donegal via the N15, also benefited from several major improvement schemes. Motorists can now enjoy the benefits of dual carriageway standards from Mullingar to Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> As I noted in my opening remarks, given the fiscal constraints under which we currently operate there is limited scope for the authority to develop and implement the many national road improvement works required not only in Border regions but throughout the country. We are nevertheless progressing planning work on a number of important schemes so that we are in a position to commence construction as soon as funding allows. One such scheme is the section of the N4 between Castlebaldwin and Collooney and we expect the scheme proposal to go to An Bord Pleanála for approval shortly. The N14 Letterkenny-Lifford and the N15 Lifford-Stranorlar projects have been brought through the preliminary design stage but unfortunately we will not be in a position to bring the schemes concerned to compulsory purchase order stage until funding permits. Meanwhile, the bypasses at Belturbet, County Cavan, on the N3 have been partially open to traffic since August and the entire scheme is scheduled for completion early next year. In regard to the N14-A5 link, members will no doubt be aware of the position regarding the development of the A5 in Northern Ireland. In the event that the project proceeds, we will be engaging with our colleagues in Northern Ireland in the context of the State investment for the project.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> I welcome members' questions and further exploration of the issues I have discussed or any other issues that they care to raise.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanSmith" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Smith<recordedTime time="2013-10-24T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_17">I welcome Mr. Barry and his colleague, Mr. Nolan. The landscape of our national routes has changed dramatically over the past decade. The establishment of the National Roads Authority was pivotal to the co-ordination of the work undertaken. Many people in our area of public life refer to every statutory and semi-State agency as a quango but the NRA is not a quango. It has been extremely important to the development of necessary infrastructure. I am not being parochial if I dwell on two or three issues because I represent two of the Southern Ulster counties. The first issue is the N2 from Clontibret to the Border at Aughnacloy, where it links with the A5.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">A 400 m wide corridor has been identified for this in County Monaghan. The next stage is preliminary design stage one, which would reduce the width of the corridor and give some certainty to landowners in that region. It is a cause of concern to people, particularly farmers who may see their holdings bisected. My understanding, based on information from Monaghan County Council, is that it would cost €1.5 million to advance the project to the next stage. We fully appreciate what Mr. Barry said about the funding challenges but we must put in place the plans, proposals and advanced preparatory work as much as possible. The Monaghan county manager, Mr. David Fallon, and the then mayor made a very strong presentation here along with their counterparts from North of the Border on the critical role this development can play in development of the north east and the north west of our country and the Chairman's own county.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> Some preliminary design work on the Cavan-Dundalk route is nearing completion, particularly the section from Cootehill to Shercock, Carrickmacross and Dundalk. The designers have rightly and prudently segmented the route into short stand-alone projects, which will cost approximately €2 million each. Thankfully, there is a fair bit of commerce and economic activity along that route. It is important for products going to Greenore Port and Dundalk. I am anxious that this project be advanced through planning. I appreciate the funding pressures, but Cavan, Monaghan and Louth County Councils have sought funding for the further advancement of the planning process through strategic regional and local road grants or through the specific road improvement grant schemes. It gives the opportunity to do segments of the route.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> The N54 Cavan-Clones-Monaghan Town route is of particular concern to the people of Monaghan. There is a huge amount of traffic on that road and much traffic between the two general hospitals in Cavan and Monaghan. We talk about developing east-west. The route connecting Belfast, Monaghan, Cavan, Athlone and Galway encompasses different sections of the M1, A3, N12, N54 and N55. If further development and preparatory work can be done on that route, it would be using major sections of our road that are already upgraded or new routes. Those routes are extremely important for the economic and social development of that Border region. This would enhance the east-west economic development we want to see.</p>

          <p eId="para_21">I welcome Mr. Barry and the NRA. I compliment the NRA on what it has done. The first motorway out of Dublin was to Galway. The road to Galway is excellent, but problems arise when one gets to Galway, where there are serious issues. Where are we with the Galway outer city bypass? My other question is a north-south Galway issue, the Gort to Tuam road, which is part of the Atlantic corridor. This road is very badly needed and is a priority for the NRA. Is the funding in place or are we going by some other route? It is a PPP. If the Minister is coming down to turn the sod, the NRA will also be there. I hope that road will benefit Galway. As I now represent Roscommon, I also hope it will benefit Roscommon.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_5">
          <from> Mr. Fred Barry<recordedTime time="2013-10-24T10:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_22">We have a number of corridors around the country, including the one to which Deputy Smith referred, where we would like to take the planning process further and reduce the corridor width. We are very aware, from representations from Deputies, officials and the public, that very wide corridors are disruptive and can sometimes be there for a very long time. We are mindful of that. We have very little discretionary money next year. While our budgets might sound significant, the moneys are already committed. We have unpaid bills for old projects that are open. We have commitments against PPP schemes which must be paid. Next year we are unlikely to begin any new planning activities and very unlikely to start any new schemes on the ground other than PPP schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> We are aware of the value of segmenting projects and doing them in smaller sections. Many Deputies will have seen that last year and this year we have had very few big projects but many smaller ones. Given that the funding will not be there for the big schemes for a few years, we have identified the worst bottlenecks, bends and realignments. We have done a series of projects, some only half a kilometre or two kilometres long, to make the very best use of the money available to us. We have more of those schemes in the planning process but we do not have the money to start building them next year. We will get to them as soon as we can. The money spend on those smaller schemes or on subsections of schemes is probably giving the best value to the public for moneys that might be spent on improvement. Despite our agreement with Deputy Smith on the routes he mentioned, the funding for this coming year will not allow us to do much with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> It is well known that the European Court took a decision that led to the quashing of approval for the Galway outer bypass. Galway County Council is preparing a new application. It has started work on it, and some of the habitat mapping has happened over the summer. It will take the council until the end of next year or early 2015 to get a new application into An Bord Pleanála. Getting approval will be a long drawn-out process. An Bord Pleanála will have to send its comments and recommendations to the European Commission, so that will take a few years to get through the process with no guarantee of success. Nonetheless, we all recognise that Galway city is the last of the cities that has not yet been bypassed. The congestion there from one side of the town to the other is ridiculous at any time. We will do what we can to address it, but I cannot see it getting through An Bord Pleanála and the European Commission in fewer than several years. It will not be quick.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_7">
          <from> Mr. Fred Barry<recordedTime time="2013-10-24T10:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_26">We must allow until early 2015 for it to go to An Bord Pleanála, which typically takes one and a half to two years to deal with a major road scheme application, although that may speed up as it has worked through its backlog of applications. Public hearings will take place during that time and there will probably be continuing objections to the scheme. If An Bord Pleanála is generally well-disposed to the scheme and accepts the arguments made, it will send its views to the European Commission. I do not know how long the European Commission will take, but given how bureaucracies work it is unlikely it will take less than a year. I do not have a timeline. We are in new space. We have not been through this before where a local authority application has gone to An Bord Pleanála and then to the EU Commission for its opinion and it has come back. This will be a first, but it is unlikely to take fewer than several years.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">I have no better opinion than anybody else in the room as to how many that will be. The position on the road from Gort to Tuam is better. The State funding is in place. Earlier this year we were given a commitment of funding to pay the State's bills on it through construction and development. A funding plan, involving private sector lenders together with the European Investment Bank, has been arranged and approved. The lenders are lined up and the negotiations are going on at the moment. Unless something comes along to derail progress, I expect that to be signed early in the new year and work on the ground to commence in the spring. In all of these things there is no certainty until the deal is signed, but it is looking very promising at the moment.</p>

          <p eId="para_36">Since we cannot discuss the A5 because the other organisation is not represented here, we should discuss the N5 and N4. I believe there is progress on the N5 from Tarmonbarry to Frenchpark. I am delighted that work on the Ballaghadereen bypass is ongoing and it should be open early next year. We have a motorway from Dublin to Galway and from Dublin to Belfast. In between we have the N4 to Sligo, which people from Donegal and Northern Ireland are using, coming through Sligo. What are the proposals for the road from Mullingar to Sligo?</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> The N16 from Sligo to Enniskillen is a terrible road and certainly needs serious upgrading if we are really interested in the access from Sligo to Belfast. Much has been done from Ballygawley to Belfast, but much more needs to be done on it, because it is the forgotten part of that region and needs upgrading.</p>

          <p eId="para_38">I come at this issue from a slightly different perspective - a very Northern perspective. What are the stand-by, provisional or <i>ad hoc </i>arrangements around the A5? What progress, if any, can we make? If we can make progress, when might we make it, despite financial restrictions? My understanding was that when this was delayed, it was to be delayed for a couple of years. I know two years can sometimes become four. On the Northern side, we are very keen to ensure that everything is done to facilitate the overall development and to ensure there are no excuses for not moving on the A5. I welcome Mr. Barry's suggestion that a number of small schemes have gone ahead. What is the connecting road - the N2 or N3?</p>

          <p eId="para_40">Are there further projects from the extreme end of that from Aughnacloy? Approximately 15 or 20 miles need to be developed.</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> I would also like to hear good news on the road beyond Strabane into Donegal. I will leave it to Mr. Pat Doherty to pursue that, as he is more familiar with it that I am. The bits at each end of what in Northern Ireland is the A5 are equally important as otherwise the A5 becomes less viable. I will be very blunt. I am very keen to ensure no excuses are left open for people not to work on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> What preparatory work, if any, is taking place around the Narrow Water Bridge? There are concerns in the North that some of the excuses that were used to delay, stall and question might disrupt the connectivity around Omeath and that the bridge might be built but it would be a bridge to nowhere. What plans are in place to create or widen roads? We heard of significant local objections because people felt they would be overrun on narrow roadways.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> I am usually upstaged - today is no different - by Deputy Feighan, who basically stole my thunder. I am concerned about the Belfast to Galway route via Enniskillen and Sligo, which is very important for that part of the country. We have got as far as Ballygawley and need to get to Enniskillen on the Northern side - we will get there sooner rather than later. While the route from Enniskillen to Sligo is very scenic, it needs to be taken slowly. While it may not be on the top of it, that route needs to go on the list somewhere. In raising those points, I fully accept there is a financial difficulty and I would be factoring that in. Are we talking about five, ten, 20 or 30 years down the road, or in our lifetime?</p>

          <p eId="para_45">I was asked about meetings with our counterparts in Northern Ireland. We meet irregularly rather than regularly, but fairly frequently.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">We do not have an automatic arrangement with our Northern Ireland colleagues to meet three or four times a year but we meet one another regularly enough. We have common issues to discuss. We are working with the same suppliers, using the same materials. The European Union is issuing new directives and technical standards and we have much in common in our reactions and dealing with them. </p>
          <p eId="para_47"> We review where we are on our development programmes, both in terms of the work for which we have funding and what we will be building in the near future and on co-ordination of cross-Border routes. Everybody present is very aware that many routes cross over the Border and need to be developed on both sides in a consistent manner. These are just some of the topics we talk about and sometimes there will be very specific issues such as the specific agenda items dealing with the A5 scheme and our role in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_48"> A number of questions were raised on the cross-Border links in County Donegal, including the N14 Letterkenny to Strabane and the N15 Stranorlar to Strabanee routes. We have done the preliminary design work on the routes but the work is not going any further for the same reasons I gave earlier. The traffic is heavy. The return on investment is very strong. Even taken in isolation these schemes have strong economic returns well in excess of the cost of the routes. The fact that they will link into the A5 adds to the benefits they provide. We are keen to do the work, however, these routes are in the same limbo as most of the other routes. We have approval from An Bord Pleanála for the work on our side of the river crossing, with the design for the new bridge approved and the linkage arrangements are ready to go with the A5 at Strabane. We will tie in with the construction of the A5, when that construction programme is put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_49"> I was also asked about the N4 and the N5. We are submitting the plans for the route between Westport and Turlough along the N5 to An Bord Pleanála. Our next main initiative following planning permission is to get this route constructed. My colleague, Mr. Michael Nolan, will comment on the planning work on other parts of the N5.</p>

          <p eId="para_55">Deputy Feighan mentioned developments relating to the N5 from Longford to Westport. Mr. Barry mentioned the Westport to Turlough scheme on the N5 which has gone to An Bord Pleanála recently. Aside from that, we have some developments there. We have finished the N5 bypass to Longford, which was opened last year. Between that job and Frenchpark, the Ballaghadereen bypass is under construction. The contractual timescale is that it should be open by the end of 2014. The contract has initiated and with the bounce it got this summer, I would be surprised if it is not open by next summer.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">That is the current state of development on the N5.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_27">

          <p eId="para_57">I mentioned the smaller schemes, one of which is the N16. The second phase of development will be the next piece of work on the N16. Our side of the N16 certainly needs improvement but the likelihood is that the improvement will come by means of a series of connected but smaller schemes rather than one very large scheme doing very large lengths of the route. I do not see the money being available to do 20 km or 30 km lengths at once. However, we will continue to work and I am sure that over time, everyone will see progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_58"> On the questions about connections to the A5, connections at Strabane are well advanced and we are ready to begin the work just as soon as the A5 proceeds with it. With regard to the northern end of the N2 I understand there is a concern that we should ensure that we advance our planning at the least on our side of the Border to ensure that lack of planning on our part does not in any way hinder developments on the far side of the Border. I will undertake to ensure that this happens. I understand that the current position is that we are sufficiently advanced and in tune with what is being done on the far side to allow the scheme on the northern side to progress, but we will check into that and if anything needs doing on our side to allow it to happen, it will be done.</p>

          <p eId="para_61">I will add that the European Commission has agreed with the Council and the Parliament to turn the TEN-T guidelines into a regulation, which means the provisions will be binding on all national governments. The TEN-T network includes the N2-A5 as one of the roads designated as being of European importance. That will add significant impetus and support to the concept of developing the road, particularly if there are second thoughts in any quarters as to whether the route should be developed. I regard this as a very positive development.</p>

          <from> Mr. Fred Barry<recordedTime time="2013-10-24T11:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_63">A network of roads in Europe have been designated for decades as being of European importance. The European Commission has produced guidelines as to how they should be developed. These guidelines are very useful but guidelines are not mandatory. Earlier this year the Commission, the Council and the Parliament agreed that the TEN-T provisions would become regulations. They agreed a network of roads to be included and the N2-A5 route is included.</p>
          <p eId="para_64"> In reply to the Chairman's question, a subsection of the comprehensive network is the core network, which includes Belfast-Dublin-Foynes-Cork. The comprehensive network - which is the TEN-T - is inclusive of the N2-A5 route. I have no idea how this will pan out but it is the practice that EU measures come with funding support. It may well be that funding support will be provided, given the cross-Border nature of the scheme.</p>

          <p eId="para_66">Our PPPs are always supported by the European Investment Bank, which provides a significant level of low interest funding to PPPs. If a scheme is on a TEN-T route it will at least be eligible for a consideration by the EIB for support funding, whereas if a route were not a TEN-T route it is much less likely that the European Investment Bank would support it. Having the N2-A5 designated as a TEN-T route is quite positive from the perspective of at least allowing the possibility of PPP developments.</p>

          <p eId="para_68">I regard this issue as my priority. I thank Mr. Barry for arranging the signage indicating the ancestral home of President Obama in both directions on the road to Limerick. This means so much to the people in Moneygall and in the wider region. I applaud his decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_69"> I refer to the sad fate of the Dublin-Derry economic corridor. I have spoken about this issue many times at this forum. On Monday of this week a total of £115 million was reallocated which had been earmarked for the upgrading of the Dublin-Derry corridor. This project is now stationary. I believe it is probably one of the most important infrastructural developments in the country and is needed for the economic and social welfare of the people who live on the corridor between Dublin and Derry. It takes three and a half hours to get from Dublin to Derry. It is the most tiring and stressful route in the country. It is now much quicker to travel between Dublin, Limerick and Cork. It used to take nearly a day to get to Cork. Mr. Barry said the Derry to Dublin route was in limbo. The development of this route has now gone into limbo. I raised this issue at a previous meeting. I believe sincerely and passionately that Monaghan County Council should be allocated €1.5 million to prepare for the planning and there should be a definite indication of where the road will be. If the funding for the road is provided sooner rather than later, it will be necessary to go through this process. Pre-planning should be done so that when the funding becomes available to the NRA the project can go ahead. In my view it is an appalling lack of action that the Government cannot come up with €1.5 million. I do not wish this to be a criticism of my colleagues in the Government party but in my view there is a lack of commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_70"> I hope the Chairman, Deputy McHugh, does not mind me saying it, but in my view the Government is not engaged adequately with what is happening in the North. High-level meetings have always been held but I do not think there is any thrusting energy going into maintaining the peace process by means of economic development. The Northern Government and its representatives on this committee have also slipped up in this regard, because it is also in their bailiwick. I have very passionate views on this issue. The Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement do not seem to matter a damn, and this road is just lying there. I cannot understand it because so much depends on this road. The biggest issue in the North is employment creation, and here is an opportunity to develop the road and the infrastructure. </p>
          <p eId="para_71"> Mr. Andy Pollak has set up a new project to develop a form of cross-Border economic development unique to the Irish Border region. Its aim is to create a Border development zone. This innovative research and conference project will explore the potential of the joint economic development approach across the whole Irish and Northern Irish cross-Border region.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">I am not being too personal but my husband chairs this in a voluntary capacity. Many people are very excited about this development, and they are dedicated and sincere about the development of cross-Border regions. I spoke to Mr. Barry on the margins of the region.</p>

          <p eId="para_77">We should write to the Minister and seek an explanation as to why they are not here today. All of us are making a significant effort to try to drive the project forward, and part of it is a cross-Border aspect that regards the roads service from the North of Ireland and the National Roads Authority here. It is very disappointing that representatives have not turned up and I am concerned about political interference in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_78"> The A1 and Narrow Water bridge issues have raised. I assumed until recently that they were a priority so when were they deprioritised? We have debates about them recently. There were also plans to develop the Ballynacarrick bridge linking south Armagh and County Monaghan. Could we get an update on where that project stands? There is a question of funding for projects, many of which have been put on the backboiler. I understand there is a shortage for many projects in the South but does the same issue apply in the North? Is the funding in the South the problem? Is there anything we can do as a committee committed and dedicated to the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, of which this is a part?</p>
          <p eId="para_79"> I would not like to see this committee politicised and everybody is doing their best in that regard. As a committee we are working across all parties, so perhaps we make representations to the relevant Minister or the Taoiseach, as it could be a big help in trying to get those projects over the line.</p>

          <p eId="para_80">I thank the Chairman for giving me the opportunity to address the meeting. I welcome Mr. Barry and Mr. Nolan. I met Mr. Barry in the past when I spoke to him about an issue relating to the N4, particularly the stretch from Colloney to Castlebaldwin. I acknowledge that the issue was helped along the way and it got to An Bord Pleanála for approval under an environmental impact statement compulsory purchase order. Perhaps Mr. Barry could update us that. When I travel every week from Sligo to Dublin, I can see the motorway, and the stretch from Mullingar to Dublin was mentioned. A new part was recently opened. People in my constituency have serious difficulty commuting from Sligo to Castlebaldwin to Boyle, for example, and there is also the potential to bring entrepreneurs and investors to Sligo. When they see the 27 or 29 white crosses along the route from Castlebaldwin to Colloney, it indicates there is a major issue. They highlight the number of fatalities that have taken place over a number of years. There is a committee working well with Sligo County Council to try to resolve these issues. Mr. Barry has indicated that motorways were completed during the boom years but the poor relation has been the N4 to Sligo.</p>
          <p eId="para_81"> There is also an issue with the N16. There have been negotiations between the National Roads Authority and Leitrim County Council about phase 2 of the N16 at Cornacloy to Sradrine. The matter was discussed and there is funding for additional works to be carried out. Will the witness provide an update on that? Sligo County Council is required to develop a proposal for a minor on-line realignment scheme and the matter is with the NRA. It is the worst section of the N16, from approximately the townland of Lugnagall to the Sligo-Leitrim county boundary at Gortnagrelly. I am sure the witnesses are familiar with it as I had a meeting with officials from Sligo County Council, who are very concerned because the N16 forms part of the east-west corridor linking Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland, or more specifically, linking Sligo and much of Connacht in the west with Belfast, Larne and Dundalk on the east coast. The EU has designated the road as an east-west link forming part of the trans-European road network. A route selection process for the section within County Sligo around Glencar was carried out in the mid 1990s and Sligo County Council is now attempting to develop a proposal involving a minor on-line realignment scheme of 3 km of the worst section of the existing N16. It heads from Lugnagall to the Sligo-Leitrim county border at Gortnagrelly.</p>
          <p eId="para_82"> I am highlighting these serious issues for cross-Border co-operation. The volume of traffic has increased substantially on this route over a number of years and it is vital that the NRA takes the responsibility to prioritise these roads, and particularly the areas of which I have spoken. These sections have been highlighted by officials with Leitrim and Sligo county councils.</p>

          <p eId="para_84">I welcome Mr. Barry and Mr. Nolan and I thank them for the presentation. Most of the points I wanted to raise concerned the N16, which has been covered by Deputies McLoughlin and Feighan and Dr. Alasdair McDonnell, MP. The Glenfarne part of the N16 is very important for us; I live in north Leitrim and travel the route regularly. As Deputy McLoughlin has stated, the Sligo side has a couple of very bad bends and it is important to get an update on what is happening in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_85"> The N4 is very important to all of us and the Dublin to Sligo stretch is bad. It is disappointing to see all the crosses at the roadside but they demonstrate that there is an urgent need. It is good to see the matter going to An Bord Pleanála but we want to see funding to move it on. The Belturbet bypass is a great job but is it on target and is it almost complete? I spoke to somebody yesterday who wanted a sign on the Dublin side to direct people to the village. After building a good road, it may be more sensible to get people to come in from the Enniskillen but the person to whom I spoke was anxious that a sign be provided on the other side.</p>

          <p eId="para_86">I thank Mr. Barry and Mr. Nolan for attending. It is disappointing we do not have some Northern representation. I would like to mention some of the issues raised. There have been problems along the A5. We should apply pressure to get them addressed, pending funding becoming available. The Taoiseach said he would start to make money available in 2015 or 2016, so it is very important we overcome all the problems and objections.</p>
          <p eId="para_87"> I refer to the N16 and the A4. There is a suggestion that the Sligo to Belfast <i>via</i> Enniskillen road has been removed from the 2021 plan. I do not know if that is true and I would like to know where we stand with that. Could we have got TEN-T funding for work on that road? We seem to very slack in terms of chasing European funding. Is that funding being chased North and South for some of these bigger projects?</p>
          <p eId="para_88"> I would like to ask about the N4, the Castlebaldwin-Cloonamahon road. As we know, almost 30 people have been killed on that 9 km stretch. The Minister indicated he has a design, etc. When will the work commence? The Minister said he was ready to deal with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_89"> I refer to the Narrow Water Bridge. As far as I know, there was an issue about funding, tendering and so on. We need to get moving on these projects because these links are vital. Many of these are major cross-Border links. The Good Friday Agreement is about getting the infrastructure North and South, in particular to the north west and links taking in Donegal, Derry and places like that. They are fundamental links which need to be established. There are links throughout the rest of the country. The only main roads which seem to be left out are the links to Derry and Donegal. They seem to be more isolated than anywhere else.</p>

          <p eId="para_90">I thank the member for the kind words about the signage. On the Derry corridor, I completely agree that a good road corridor has proved important for economic growth everywhere. We have seen the changes on the M1-A1 since the roads were upgraded and the difference it has made. Equally, the lack of connectivity to the north west is definitely a restraint to business travel, social travel and so on. Whether it is to Donegal, north-south or to Sligo, improved road connections are absolutely essential for economic growth and competitiveness, both to sustain what is there and for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_91"> In regard to the possibility of the Border crossings being, in any way, a constraint on the A5 going ahead, I would like to repeat what I said earlier. We think we have it in hand but I will check with Mr. Nolan. If anything further needs to be done to ensure the state of planning on our side of the Border does not become a constraint in any way, we will get it taken care of.</p>

          <p eId="para_93">There is a much bigger problem but the issue has been raised. We will make sure we do not do anything to prevent it from going ahead. In terms of going beyond that to doing works or planning, I have spoken about the funding situation. In the absence of change to that funding situation, we will not be able to do a whole lot more than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_94"> I discussed the Narrow Water Bridge while some members were voting. The Narrow Water Bridge is on a regional road, so it concerns Louth County Council and County Down. We do not have any role in this development and we do not own or manage the roads which connect into it. It is not for us.</p>

          <p eId="para_96">I would say to members that their colleagues in the North would probably give them a better picture than I could of the situation for funding North of the Border. I would not have anything to add to that. That leads to Deputy Ellis's question on TEN-T funding and European funding. The TEN-T regulation is a proposed one, which has not been passed, so whatever funding measures come with it will not be there yet. When the regulation goes through, we will see what funding goes with it. To some extent, I am sure it will draw on existing funds, such as the Cohesion Fund and the various other funds already in place, and perhaps direct them towards TEN-T projects. To the extent that there is additional funding, we will flag it internally with the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform and will go from there in making applications for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_97"> Deputy McLoughlin asked about the Colloney to Castlebaldwin road. That is with the local authorities at the moment and we expect it to be in the hands of An Bord Pleanála by year end. I mentioned earlier that An Bord Pleanála typically takes a year and a half to two years to deal with a scheme. We expect, all going well, to have An Bord Pleanála approval for it in 2015. The question of funding for it to go ahead arises at that stage. </p>
          <p eId="para_98"> The next work we will do on the N16 will almost certainly be phase two of the work which has been going on this year. It ties in with it and it is a longer section. It is ready to go. That will be the next section. It will not happen unless there is a change in arrangements. It will not happen in 2014 because although it is one of a number of schemes which we have taken through design and planning and is ready to go, it is ready to go when we are in position to do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_99"> We will talk to Sligo County Council about its realignment scheme. I am not in a position to comment on it more than that. I know the section of road generally, as does Mr. Nolan, but if it is developing a scheme, we will certainly talk to it about it. </p>
          <p eId="para_100"> The comments I made about the N16 and the N4 related to Senator Comiskey's questions as well. Belturbet is well behind schedule in terms of completion. There have been various difficulties with the scheme, including one of the construction companies, which was part of the consortium to build it, going into administration at an early stage of the construction and so on. There are a lot of issues and disputes there. Most of it is now open to traffic.</p>

          <p eId="para_120">I am not speaking for the Government or getting into that arena. Normally the Government does not direct us as to whether we put money into a section near Aughnacloy or in some other place. In some cases it gives us a specific direction on larger schemes. It has strategic plans such as the national development plan which pick out the larger strategic developments, and in this respect it tells us what we need to do. On other issues we are left to use our own judgment as to whether we should do A or B. In this case I am saying very openly to everybody that we have insufficient funding next year to carry out basic rehabilitation and maintenance work on the national road network, to the extent that if any additional money comes our way, unless it comes with a direction to use it elsewhere, it will go, in the first instance, to managing what we have.</p>
          <p eId="para_121"> The Aughnacloy project is undoubtedly very worthwhile - there is no issue about that - but it is one of very many worthwhile and necessary schemes throughout the country. To advance such projects involves much more than €1.5 million.</p>

          <p eId="para_133">I seek clarification from Mr. Barry. He stated no work will proceed on the N16, or on the Sligo County Council end of it. I mentioned some areas that have been highlighted. Has the NRA told Leitrim County Council it will fund going to the compulsory purchase order, CPO, phase for the scheme, but not for construction? There is a short section at Cornacloy.</p>

          <p eId="para_134">That is on the N16. We told the council to go ahead with phase 2 and go to CPO stage with the lands so that the project will be shovel-ready. We will get the documentation work done and have the lands lined up but we do not have funding to go to construction. However, it is another significant step.</p>

          <p eId="para_136">I thank the delegates. It is important to point out that this occasion was not only about a meeting today. We appreciate that our visitors attended and we acknowledge their input to the conversation. It is also important that we express the viewpoint of the committee on Transport NI, which has nothing to do with the delegates. That message can be conveyed. I ask the members from the North to work with us and try to explore the possibility of having a meeting with their colleagues in the North.</p>
          <p eId="para_137"> I will pick up on Senator White's point although I will not get into the areas where I disagree with her. In regard to forward planning, there are great examples where the national roads design office, NRDO, is doing its work, especially in Donegal town. I remember that in the early 1990s, the NRDO had a design ready for the Clar-Barnesmore project. This point can be clarified but I understand that €7 million was supposed to go towards a project in Dublin which was not ready. The next thing we knew was that Clar-Barnesmore was ready to go because the design had been done. The Deputy's message is the right one. Obviously the delegates are working within funding constraints. However, we could try to lay out a vision, have the design made and the preparatory work done. For example, there is a design for the Letterkenny-Lifford-Strabane section. Everything is a precursor to something else happening. The Lifford-Strabane bridge is ready to go but the A5 project must be done first. This is where the political fear creeps in. If one big project is not ready to go, what happens to the rest of the funding?</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> As a committee, we ask the delegates to stay in touch with us and help us to try to arrive at a degree of consistency in developing a vision. A vision is quite simple. We can look at all the inter-city connectivity from the capital to areas throughout the country and see all the good work the NRA has done, providing fantastic roads to Galway and Limerick, the south east and Cork. Then we look at the missing pieces of the jigsaw. This is not about entitlement. There may have been a bit of parochial politics today but this is more than that. It is about disenfranchisement, neglect, partition and all those elements of an entire geographical section of our country that was isolated as a result of lack of connectivity. We want to work with the delegates. If they can help us then we, as a committee, will help them to work towards their ambitions and aspirations.</p>
          <p eId="para_139"> I ask the members to use their influence in their own positions, even if only to create public awareness of the work going on behind the scenes. I am aware that officials are meeting at very high levels within Departments and local authorities, but the public must be made aware of this work. Members of the public will say these roads are not going to go ahead simply because the funding is not available. There is a negative attitude towards the ambition that we, as politicians, are trying to realise. Whatever the visitors can do to help is welcome, even if it is only to raise more public awareness about how the committee could act as a facilitator. We have met on this issue before. It is important to keep them alive. It is about fairness, justice and equality and about looking at the benefits of opening up an entire section of this country that was never opened up before. We are all singing from the same hymn sheet in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_140"> We will not suspend the meeting but will take the next part of the session. We invite the delegates from InterTradeIreland to take their seats.</p>

          <p eId="para_141">I apologise for the delay in starting this part of the meeting. I am sure the members of the InterTradeIreland delegation, and those they represent in the work they are involved in, will have been interested in the subject matter of the first part of the meeting. On behalf of the committee, I welcome the officials who are in attendance at this meeting to discuss the issue of all-island economic development. I welcome Mr. Thomas Hunter McGowan, who is InterTradeIreland's chief executive officer; and Mr. Aidan Gough, who is the organisation's strategy and policy director. The members of this committee are familiar with Mr. Gough because we have bumped into each other before. We look forward to hearing more about the work that InterTradeIreland is involved with at local level, with particular reference to the global and cross-Border implications of that work.</p>
          <p eId="para_142"> Before I invite Mr. Hunter McGowan to make his presentation, I advise him and Mr. Gough that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at this committee. However, if they are directed by it to cease making remarks on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their remarks. They are directed that only cognisant evidence on the subject matter of this meeting is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I ask Mr. Hunter McGowan to proceed with his opening statement.</p>

          <from> Mr. Thomas Hunter McGowan<recordedTime time="2013-10-24T12:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_143">As our submission was circulated in advance of today's meeting of the joint committee, I will not go through all of it in detail. I will pick out a few important highlights. InterTradeIreland has been tasked by both Governments with boosting North-South economic co-operation for the mutual benefit of Northern Ireland and Ireland. In the last 14 years, some 25,000 small and medium-sized enterprises have benefited from our cross-Border information and advice service. Almost 5,000 companies have taken part in our all-island programmes. These companies have generated €725 million worth of trade and business development value. More than 3,000 jobs have been created in these small and medium-sized enterprises. The value of cross-Border trade is estimated to be approximately €2.5 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_144"> Our vision<b>
						</b>is to create an environment in which Ireland and Northern Ireland co-operate to ensure businesses are making full use of cross-Border opportunities to drive competitiveness, jobs and growth. Our research has shown that 70% of all exporters took their first steps in exporting by trading with the other jurisdiction on the island, which indicates that there is a pathway to exporting. Our supports focus on two key pillars, which are trade and innovation. The demand for our programmes is very high. We recently received 920 inquiries for the 60 places on our Fusion programme and 770 inquiries for the 60 places on our Acumen programme. The 50 places on our pilot Elevate programme were easily filled. It is clear that there is a demand for an Elevate programme that serves between 75 and 100 companies per annum. It is clear that there is a substantial supply-side deficit for the programmes we deliver.</p>
          <p eId="para_145"> Our performance is measured by reference to very stringent key performance indicators that are subject to tough assessment. So far, we have exceeded the performance target that has been set for us in every corporate plan. Between 2008 and 2010, the return on our expenditure was 10.6:1, which means that for every €1 we spent, there was a return of €10.60 in business value. Our projected out-turn at the end of this year for the 2011-13 period is 15:1. We had 200 first-time exporters and 92 first-time innovators in the first period. We have had 195 such exporters and 235 such innovators in the second period. Clearly, there has been a focus on innovation. The jobs impact in the 2008-10 period was just over 500 jobs. We estimate that the equivalent figure for the current period will be between 1,300 and 1,400. In the 2011-13 corporate plan, we had to make cumulative efficiency savings of 3% per annum. The number of companies we engage with has increased from approximately 8,800 in the first period to over 9,000 in the current period. The business value generated - the extra sales and efficiencies achieved, or the extra investment made in the companies we are involved with - has increased from €232 million to €321 million. At the same time, our budget has decreased from €23.3 million to €21.8 million. It is clear that we are doing much more with much less.</p>
          <p eId="para_146"> One of the reasons for our success has been the companies we seek to work with. Our programmes focus on small firms that aspire to grow but have suffered from the decline in the domestic market. As such companies are small, they have often gone off the radar of the larger development agencies. We also focus on building companies that are sustainable by providing them with the capabilities and opportunities for sustained growth. Companies that export or innovate are three times more likely to have grown over the past three years. This fact, coupled with the convergence of business activity across the island at a level where only one in five businesses across the island are reporting increasing sales, points to an economic imperative to increase the number of businesses exporting and innovating.</p>
          <p eId="para_147"> InterTradeIreland has shown that cross-Border co-operation has a clear and positive role to play in this sector. In the last three years, we have assisted 235 companies to become first-time innovators and 195 more businesses to become first-time exporters. As I have said, some 70% of off-island exporters took their first steps into the export market by starting with cross-Border sales on the island. The benefits of close co-operation for mutual economic benefit have been shown in the research and development partnership between the United States and Ireland and the strength of North-South partnerships participating in the seventh EU framework programme. There is a strong foundation in place for participants in the upcoming Horizon 2020 programme. Our strategic priorities are to stimulate more job creation and job retention by increasing the numbers of businesses that benefit from our programmes, and to do this in the most efficient manner by ensuring the non-programme costs of the organisation are kept constant or reduced where possible. I will welcome anything that the members of the committee might want to say.</p>

          <p eId="para_148">I welcome the delegates. I am glad to be here. Before I ask a few questions, I want to say that I am big supporter of InterTradeIreland. I sometimes hear criticisms of the body, however, or have questions about it thrown at me. It seems from what Mr. Hunter McGowan has said that he believes things are working. When does he think the body will have reached its limit and fulfilled its mission? People sometimes say to me that InterTradeIreland is just doing what other groups should be doing in the North or in the South. In that context, can we get things working better? I believe some of the criticisms of those who are asking questions about InterTradeIreland are unfair. Some people say that the things it does would happen spontaneously anyway. I am inviting Mr. Hunter McGowan to flesh out the specifics a little more for those of us who support InterTradeIreland and are keen to better make the case for its work.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_88">
          <from> Mr. Thomas Hunter McGowan<recordedTime time="2013-10-24T12:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_149">When we evaluate all of our programmes, we take account of dead weight, which is very important. I refer to things that would have happened anyway regardless of whether we were involved. We make sure to remove that element from all of our programmes. We do not report the full value of those elements relating to companies that would have proceeded to do things in a certain way. The question of when we will reach our limit, or when our mission will be accomplished, is a difficult one. The sands are shifting as we move into the new territory on this island of the innovation model. That is a shifting concept because new innovation is rolling out all the time. One might think one has mastered something, but something new will come along. We are going through a whole range of new technologies that are coming at us. We are stuck now with new challenges that people would not have anticipated a decade or 20 years ago. When the entire domestic market suffered as badly as it did, it put pressure on companies to find new markets. Our role was to try to give them the capabilities to try to make sure they could do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">Everything we do is about providing capability. We give sales capabilities and science, engineering or technology ability to companies. We provide innovation capability within the company. We provide assistance, but until the companies have those abilities and are able to export and innovate we will not reach an end. However, there may come a point where the general dynamic of the economy comes into play and our system functions well and works strongly.</p>
          <p eId="para_151"> Mr. Gough may wish to speak about a recent cross-Border study in which the OECD looked at innovation on a cross-Border and regional basis and came up with some interesting findings.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_89">
          <from> Mr. Aidan Gough<recordedTime time="2013-10-24T12:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_152">Before I talk about that, I agree we have come a long way in the 14 or 15 years InterTradeIreland has been operating. When we started off, we found the biggest barrier to fulfilling the remit we were given was that the business and university communities basically did not know each other. The networks one would expect in an area with a Border the size of ours did not exist. We have spent a lot of time developing those networks and as we have developed them, it has become clear that a host of new opportunities are coming about as a result. We are facilitating those opportunities so that they deliver value for both economies. For example, in the area of public procurement, last week over 1,000 business came together to look at opportunities to enter the all-island public procurement market. We had buyers and SMEs from all over the island at this event.</p>
          <p eId="para_153"> We have also seen clearly from other research that the Border is an opportunity in itself to help develop the export potential of the economy. We know exports are driving growth and we also know, from our research, that 70% of exporters from this island took their first step into the export market by exporting into the other jurisdiction. There is a clear pathway therefore for InterTradeIreland to help increase the export potential of the two economies by providing more SMEs with experience of exporting.</p>
          <p eId="para_154"> The OECD report in which we have been involved looked at cross-Border co-operation in the area of innovation. We are one of six regions examined. The final draft of the report is not available until publication some time in November but it highlights the importance of cross-Border innovation ecosystems and the potential that can come from operating on a cross-Border basis, in terms of the resources it opens up to firms within the two regions.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Smith<recordedTime time="2013-10-24T12:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_156">I welcome Mr. Hunter McGowan and Mr. Gough and compliment them on their work. They say that InterTradeIreland is 14 years in existence. The Acumen programme was running in Ballyconnell more than 14 years ago, so it probably predated the political progress made at the end of the 1990s and the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> I am glad the witnesses have highlighted the significant potential and value of North-South business and co-operation. This presentation dovetails with our earlier discussion on the need to improve infrastructure. Most of us have had the opportunity to attend different events and to meet different companies. I am aware of companies in my area of Cavan-Monaghan that have worked with InterTradeIreland through different programmes and that they value its contribution strongly.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> A number of North-South implementation bodies were established by the Good Friday Agreement. We need to progress this in the all-island context for the good of the people of the 32 counties. What potential is there or what is the next step required for InterTradeIreland, or a similar venture, to develop business and trade? At this stage, some 15 years on from the Good Friday Agreement, we should be moving towards additional North-South bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> We recognise the potential for further co-operation in the food sector. Over the years in the agriculture sector, even before the valuable progress emanating from the Good Friday Agreement, there has been huge co-operation on the island of Ireland between the two Departments and the agencies. This co-operation is ongoing in the farming, food and agri-sector. Therefore, there may not be a need for a formal structure as the agencies North and South work well together. We need greater emphasis on exports. As mentioned, the pathway to exporting for many of our SMEs is to our neighbouring jurisdiction. This message must be delivered and supported. </p>
          <p eId="para_160"> Mention was made of programme 7 of the EU. We are all aware that substantial funding over the past decade or 15 years has gone into research, innovation and development, but there is not a quick return on that investment. A return on such investment takes time and some of the investment that took place eight or ten years ago is only paying dividends today in areas of business and economic activity. I am aware from our Departments and statutory agencies that they have been successful in sourcing funding from programme 7 and its predecessors. However, some of the schemes and funding are only available when two jurisdictions or separate Administrations support the application. In some cases three different member states must support applications.</p>
          <p eId="para_161"> Is InterTradeIreland satisfied enough is being done to source additional funding from Europe for our island? The President of the European Commission has often emphasised the need to fund adequately the research and development programme Commissioner Máire Geoghegan-Quinn has charge of. This is an opportune time to emphasise the need to ensure the potential draw down for our country is maximised through co-operation North and South and between the different statutory agencies.</p>

          <p eId="para_162">I thank InterTradeIreland for its presentation and have three questions for the witnesses. The organisation's ongoing budget reductions are bound to have some effect on its work. Will the witnesses explain how these reductions hamper their work and explain how their relationship with their sponsoring Departments is working? Deputy Smith pre-empted my other questions but I will put them anyway. What additional powers or areas of work would InterTradeIreland like to develop and what outstanding barriers does it see for all-island or all-Ireland trade? How do they think these barriers can be tackled?</p>

          <p eId="para_163">I thank Mr. Hunter McGowan and Mr. Gough for their presentation. There are differentials with regard to excise, VAT, other taxation measures, compliance issues, environment and the labour force. How can we overcome the differences between the two jurisdictions? How does InterTradeIreland work percentage wise between take-up in the Six Counties and the 26 counties and with regard to the development of SMEs?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_94">
          <from> Mr. Thomas Hunter McGowan<recordedTime time="2013-10-24T12:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_164">I will try to deal with the questions in context, but will begin with Mr. Doherty's question on budget reductions and whether these have hampered us in any way and what our relationship we have with the sponsoring Departments. We have an excellent relationship with both sponsoring Departments. Our relationship works smoothly and we have no difficulty in getting what we require.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">Unfortunately, the economic problems facing North and South have put significant pressure on everyone to make some contribution towards the effort required to get budgets back into balance. There is continuing pressure on the Northern Ireland Executive to get the cost of the public service down. Every part of the public service has been affected by this in Northern Ireland, where there will be efficiency savings of 4% for the next three consecutive years and where there has been 3% savings for three consecutive years already.</p>
          <p eId="para_166"> Previously, I outlined how we have a significant demand for our programmes but reducing budgets. We are devoting all the resources we can directly towards small and medium enterprises. We are not too concerned about the administrative budget and we can take a reduction there easily enough, but when we have to cut back on the companies we have to manage demand carefully. To that end, we are trying not to generate too much fervour for the programmes because, as I have shown previously, having 900 applications for 60 places is a recipe that could cause much disenchantment with the body and a perception that we are not fulfilling our requirements. We must be careful to keep the pipeline controlled in order that we do not over-press for it. The main difficulty we have is trying to meet as many of the requirements as we can with out over-egging the demand put towards us.</p>
          <p eId="para_167"> The sponsoring Departments have been very helpful to us. We have good relations with them and we meet regularly. There are no issues arising and we have never had a conflict about the things we wanted to do. The Departments have been very supportive of the things we want to do. However, we are all hampered by the overall efficiency drives that are needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_168"> A question was asked about outstanding barriers. In our recent reports we have found that there are no regulatory barriers anymore. The most important thing is to get the drive and ambition into the management teams of companies in order that they can export and grow and trying to engender that into companies is important. That will be the real barrier because even though we say that up to 70% of companies export off the island of Ireland, over 60% have never exported - the figure may be even higher - or looked outside the domestic market. We are actively encouraging companies to try to move up to that next step.</p>
          <p eId="para_169"> Deputy Smith asked about new powers and where we can go. We are an implementation body and we can only follow whatever policy is put towards us. We are policy takers rather than policy makers. To that end, we will do everything that is assigned to us. We have developed some new elements for dealing with micro-businesses in sales in cases where they are unable to meet the full requirements of our Acumen programme. We have had a closer look at micro-companies that do not have the same resources as medium or larger companies and we have tailored a new sales programme for them. There is certainly a benefit for them and they can take it up readily.</p>
          <p eId="para_170"> There was a question about getting innovation into companies. We do not charge companies for the capability-building that we run. We simply look for ambitious companies and try to get them to get at it. These are two new areas we have gone into. We are also looking at extending the public procurement process. We have done a number of go-to-tender and meet-the-buyer sessions where we train people how to fill out procurement documents. We have introduced small and medium enterprises to the buyers. The next stage is to try to get SMEs to collaborate with each other to make joint bids. Consortia building is becoming important. The next big task is to try to get consortia building going among SMEs for public procurement.</p>
          <p eId="para_171"> We have enjoyed excellent success for companies under the European Commission seventh framework programme. A minimum of three companies is required for applications. We are in a good starting position because anyone leading with us is already in two jurisdictions. We have had a high success rate, considerably higher than most other bodies throughout Europe, at approximately 30%. We have also developed a user-friendly app, due out shortly, which will help companies with Horizon 2020 funding. It helps to demystify some of the parts that were rather difficult for some companies. We have an excellent working relationship with Invest NI and Enterprise Ireland in working to ensure that everything integrates well. We have a good network in operation on the island and that will assist the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_172"> Deputy Ferris asked about the split and where our programmes fall. One third of the entire operation and the companies we assist are in Northern Ireland and two thirds are in the South. We tend to match it according to the funding we get, which is in the same proportions.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> I did not pick up the question on the labour force properly.</p>

          <p eId="para_175">One of the advantages for companies is that there is a low sunk cost. A company can almost operate from one jurisdiction in the other jurisdiction. However, where there are variations, whether in labour law, VAT or whatever, we provide innovation vouchers to help companies get the legal advice they need so they can decide whether to set up an office in the other jurisdiction or be registered for VAT in the other jurisdiction depending on what is most beneficial to them. The advice can help to point out the differences in labour law or the minimum wage or whatever the various elements. Companies are aware that different rules and regulations are in place and this has not presented as a problem for us. They have found our intervention beneficial. We give a small voucher but the advice we get is excellent as well because the people we use as advisers are expert in all these areas. The initiative has been useful for companies and, to date anyway, it has not presented as an issue for us.</p>

          <p eId="para_176">I have two questions. Deputy Ferris alluded to some of the issues that could cause difficulty in trade across the Border. What are the greatest difficulties, whether VAT or otherwise, coming from the republic face in accessing Northern Ireland markets?</p>
          <p eId="para_177"> Mr. Hunter McGowan remarked that InterTradeIreland was a public policy taker, not a policy maker. Will he elaborate on what we could do in both jurisdictions to help InterTradeIreland in the task of increasing the amount and volume of trade between North and South in particular and with the rest of the world as well? What can be done from a public policy perspective to help the organisation in its task?</p>

        <speech by="#MaryMWhite" eId="spk_98">
          <from>Senator Mary M. White<recordedTime time="2013-10-24T12:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_178">I acknowledge the great work that InterTradeIreland does North and South. Another lady and I started Lir Chocolates in 1987. Mr. Hunter McGowan is correct. Our first exporting steps were into the North. It is a great experience to go into a different culture and jurisdiction. It is a different world and there are different ways of doing business. The professional culture in the North is different. It was my job in the company to do the initial exporting steps and I fully appreciate what is involved. I have it to say, in front of my political colleagues from the North, and I have absolutely no doubt from my experience, that business people in this part of the country, the Twenty-six Counties, were ahead of the politicians North and South on relationships. The business people were ahead of the politicians. It used to fascinate me that people were doing business under the radar while there was still a distance to go in resolving the crisis in the North.</p>
          <p eId="para_179"> The point that annoys me most is that the British Government will not support or even come closer to the 12.5% corporation tax. A short time back, Prime Minister David Cameron said that he will not have any further discussions or decision on it until after the Scottish referendum. It is very disappointing. It is a terrible waste. Over the years, it has been the politicians in the North who have held back working with us. I know that from my own information. The politicians and the DUP in the North were very reluctant to work with the IDA here but there is now no doubt that things are changing.</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> I thank InterTradeIreland for its participation in the steering group on the initiative for the centre for cross-Border studies, which is launching an exciting new project towards a Border development. Getting employment going North and South is high on the agenda of this committee. I started a business here when the unemployment rate stood at 17%. Becoming unemployed is the most serious thing that could happen in a person's life. Getting jobs for people is critical. I compliment InterTradeIreland on its great work. The witnesses are correct that 70% of exporters take their first steps by starting cross-Border sales. </p>
          <p eId="para_181"> Mr. McGowan said that InterTradeIreland is trying to encourage more companies here to export but if the person does not have the fire in their belly Mr. McGowan will not make them do it. To become an entrepreneur and develop a business outside one's safe home zone one has to be a risk taker and have no fear. One cannot drum that into people, if they do not have that fire for their businesses. It has to come from within one's soul that one wants to bring this business to an export level. Enterprise Ireland has come a long way in helping companies and giving them contacts around the world. That was not available in my time. I made the steps into the North. I subsequently became very politically involved in the North. I thank the witnesses and wish them the best of luck.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_99">
          <from> Mr. Aidan Gough<recordedTime time="2013-10-24T12:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_182">We published a report last week that exactly endorses Senator White's last point. A key criterion for us in working with companies is that the attributes and ambition of the key decision-maker within a small business are absolutely critical to how far that company wants to go. We recognise through our work that there are many small and medium sized businesses across the island where the key decision-makers do have that ambition and we are giving them supports to take that ambition and the potential of their companies as far as it can go. The first step is exporting across the island. We fully agree with Senator White.</p>
          <p eId="para_183"> There are still barriers to cross-Border trade. There are regulatory differences but by and large, when businesses are aware of them, they can navigate the differences. We see opportunities through much more enhanced co-operation. That is what we are working on. We are trying to create an open system of innovation across the island with the business at the centre. A business in Ballymena may have an idea but it may need research expertise that resides in Cork, or venture capital investment, or some other technical or marketing expertise, to bring that idea to the market. We are trying to put in place the schemes and the facilities to support that business, no matter where it resides on the island so that it can get access to whatever it needs to become more innovative or competitive. We see that through the demand for our programmes. We also see it through the FP7 that was mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_184"> We set up an all-island steering group approximately two years ago that brings together the key agencies across the island to co-operate on enhancing North-South participation in FP7. Approximately €80 million has been drawn down for North-South participant programmes under FP7. As a result of that co-operation that draw-down rate has increased substantially over the past two years. We believe that there is a very strong structure in place across the island to improve the North-South participation in Horizon 2020. It is a key objective of our organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_185"> We talk about opportunities rather than barriers. The committee will see, in the paper that we presented, reference to the US-Ireland research and development partnership. This concept was talked about and developed 10 or 11 years ago. Now we see the fruits of that, as it has funded over 15 projects. That brands the island and research on the island as world-class.</p>

          <p eId="para_187">Those barriers are not different. There are regulatory barriers but the scale of the opportunity is probably slightly less for southern companies going North. There is, however, substantial demand for our programmes from companies south of the Border to access the Northern market. We work primarily with the small to medium-sized business that has not exported before.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_102">
          <from> Mr. Thomas Hunter McGowan<recordedTime time="2013-10-24T12:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_188">We are very supportive of corporation tax and would like to see that happen but it is on hold until after the Scottish referendum on independence. One other issue that comes up often is access to finance and the availability of finance. We will publish a report on that at the end of this month. One of our findings is that SMEs over-rely on overdraft to fund their working capital, up to around 91%, compared with 61% for their European counterparts. That is effectively caused by the lack of other opportunities to get venture capital or equity sharing. We will raise that issue later. We will publish the report in two or three weeks' time. There has always been a great deal of attention given to that area. The supply side is alright. We have serious concerns that companies are not investing in growth finance to upgrade their equipment and their capabilities for future growth but are trying only to deal with the debts that they have on hand. That will become a major issue as we go along. Many have cited it as a difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_189"> We would like to develop all of our programmes and deliver more of what we do because we have recently completed a full strategic review of what we do with all the major strategic partners with whom we deal, as we prepare our corporate plan for 2014-2016. Generally SMEs, sponsoring Departments and all interested agencies have said that we are on the right track and that we are doing the kind of things that they would like us to do. There are a few bits of filtering here and there that we have considered. </p>
          <p eId="para_190"> One of our biggest programmes is Innova in which we get two companies, one North and one South, to collaborate on a joint project. It has become very difficult for us to support as many projects as we would like, simply because of their size. It is an area that we would like to grow. We have some marvellous examples such as a company in Carlow called T.E. Laboratories, TelLab, collaborating with Williams Industrial Services in Newtownabbey to develop a portable water pollution monitoring device. If successful, this could be very important in the world market, never mind in the Irish market. We would like to see more of that but there are limits to what we can afford in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_191"> We have to remain in the space of being policy-takers. If we expand the boundaries of what we do in the areas we are in that will keep us busy enough, without becoming something completely different.</p>

          <p eId="para_192">I thank the witnesses. I have had positive feedback from businesses that have been in contact with InterTradeIreland, which itself may not always get feedback. The organisation is based only in the Six Counties as a service provider. It does outreach work and comes to different counties and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">From an organisation point of view - the witness need not answer if he does not wish or if it is politically difficult to do so - would it be of value to have a foot in some form of structural sense outside of Northern Ireland? </p>
