            <p eId="para_3">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. The Action Plan for Rural Development 2017-2019 was a whole-of-government initiative to support the economic and social progress of rural Ireland. One of the objectives of the plan was to support enterprise growth and job creation in rural areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_4"> A key target of the action plan was to increase the number of people in employment outside of the Dublin region by 135,000 by 2020, using 2015 as the baseline. Between 2015 and 2019, employment in the regions increased by 222,400 outside of Dublin, greatly surpassing the target in the action plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_5"> Specific figures for employment by county are not captured in the quarterly labour force survey of the Central Statistics Office, CSO. However, the CSO's data show an increase in the number of people in employment in the NUTS 3 western region, which includes counties Roscommon, Galway and Mayo, of 41,800 between quarter 1 of 2015 and quarter 4 of 2019. That is the number of extra people who have been employed in those three counties.</p>
            <p eId="para_6"> Over the period of the Action Plan for Rural Development 2017-2019, the enterprise development agencies successfully focused on growing regional employment. In 2019, 66% of new jobs created by Enterprise Ireland client companies were outside the Dublin region, while 57% of jobs in IDA Ireland's client companies have been created outside the Dublin region. Regional jobs growth was also achieved through the work of Údarás na Gaeltachta and the local enterprise offices, while my own Department contributed to job creation in rural areas through programmes such as LEADER, the town and village renewal scheme, and the rural regeneration and development fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_7"> I will shortly be publishing a new rural development policy which will succeed the Action Plan for Rural Development 2017-2019. This policy will place a strong emphasis on supporting job creation and maximising the potential of remote working. </p>

            <from>Deputy Claire Kerrane<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_8">Go raibh maith agat, a Aire. The creation of more than 222,000 jobs between 2015 and 2019 is welcome, as is any job. However, stating that those jobs are outside the Dublin region does not narrow it down. I appreciate that the Minister has given a figure of 41,000 jobs for Roscommon, Galway and Mayo but we need to see more of a breakdown of those numbers for job creation, particularly in regions such as the west. The west is already in trouble because its EU status is now that of a region in transition and no longer developed.</p>
            <p eId="para_9"> The Minister cited the new rural development plan. Can she give us an indication whether that will be published before the end of the year? Will it include specific targets for job creation? The Minister referred to the IDA but in counties such as Roscommon we tend not to see the IDA too often, which is a major problem. Can we see more targets for job creation per county?</p>

            <from>Deputy Heather Humphreys<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_10">The northern and western regions have been recognised as regions in transition and I was glad to receive conformation from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, that the Northern and Western Regional Assembly will be implementing the relevant funding on behalf of the Government. That is important because we want to see funding targeted at the area. It is also important that local people are involved in that because they know where the funding needs to go and what difficulties need to be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_11"> I am currently working on the rural development policy and hope to have it published by the end of this year or early next year. That is my plan. It is at an advanced stage and will look at things like optimising the opportunities for rural communities through high-speed broadband, supporting improved quality employment and career opportunities in rural areas, assisting the regeneration, repopulation and development of rural towns and villages, and enhancing the participation, leadership and resilience of rural communities.</p>

            <from>Deputy Claire Kerrane<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_12">Will the developmental plan for rural areas include more specific targets for job creation? I presume the plan was supposed to run from 2020 to 2025 but given that we are now at the end of 2020, will it roll over into 2021? It sounds as if it might.</p>
            <p eId="para_13"> It is important when we look at job losses in counties such as Roscommon and Galway to note that many rural towns have lost major industries. Aptar is closing its facility in Ballinasloe. A cigar factory and Dawn Meats factory closed in Ballaghaderreen in years gone by. Those jobs have never been replaced and that is a problem. There is a quality of life in the likes of counties Roscommon and Galway that is second to none but we must have the basic infrastructure, including broadband, to attract people to live and work in those areas in the western region and to attract emigrants to come home.</p>
            <p eId="para_14"> The Northern and Western Regional Assembly has put forward positive ideas for job creation. Will the Minister engage with its representatives? Will she confirm job creation targets? We need better data collection on employment in the regions.</p>

            <from>Deputy Heather Humphreys<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_15">On a local level, I can tell the Deputy that in Galway alone, 1,182 jobs were supported by local enterprise offices in 2019. A total of 897 jobs were supported by local enterprise offices in Roscommon. I do not have the figures for Enterprise Ireland and the IDA.</p>
            <p eId="para_16"> The regional enterprise development fund, which comes from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, is specifically targeted at strengthening the regions. Some €16.7 million was invested under that fund since late 2017, early 2018. All that funding has gone into providing the right infrastructure to attract investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_17"> The record of the IDA in Galway is very good. I do not have to tell the Deputy that. Only last week, in the middle of the pandemic, 200 local jobs were created across several business functions in diligent co-operations in Galway. Those jobs were a boost to Galway and will lead to add-on jobs. It is not just those direct jobs but also those that accrue as a result of their creation. There has been much investment in Galway city. We must feed off those good job announcements and create ancillary jobs in the rural parts of Galway and Roscommon.</p>

            <from>Deputy Heather Humphreys<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_20">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue which is something that I have a keen interest in.</p>
            <p eId="para_21"> While many people are currently working from home to reduce the spread of Covid-19, recent research by the Western Development Commission, WDC, and the National University of Ireland Galway, NUIG, has highlighted a growing interest from people in continuing to work remotely in the longer term, at least part of the time availing of co-working facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_22"> Remote working has the potential to transform rural Ireland, allowing people to pursue careers in good quality jobs while continuing to live in their home place. It also has the potential to encourage more people to move to the regions to provide increased trade for local businesses and to revitalise our rural towns.</p>
            <p eId="para_23"> Over the last number of years my Department has invested significantly in remote working facilities through programmes such as the town and village renewal scheme and the rural regeneration and development fund. My Department has been working with the Western Development Commission to develop an integrated network of remote working hubs along the Atlantic economic corridor, AEC, region from Kerry to Donegal, with shared back-office services. The WDC has identified and mapped more than 100 remote working hubs that serve that region. In addition, since 2016 my Department has been working on the broadband connection points, BCPs, initiative, which is now rolling out countrywide. Many of the BCPs will be in a position to provide remote working facilities in isolated rural areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_24"> An additional €5 million was allocated to my Department in budget 2021 to develop a national network of remote working hubs based on the AEC model as well as to upgrade existing facilities and BCPs throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> An interdepartmental working group chaired by the Secretary General of my Department has been established to progress this project.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#ClaireKerrane" eId="spk_9">
            <from>Deputy Claire Kerrane<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_26">Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire. I welcome that the interdepartmental group has been established. Can the Minister give me some more information as to when she expects this group to come back to her as to how we roll out the remote working hubs? I welcome the €5 million that was announced in the budget which will really make a difference. It will allow people to remain and work in their communities and to spend in the local economy. It will also significantly reduce the commuting of people out of their areas to bigger urban areas for work.</p>
            <p eId="para_27"> The Minister may be aware that the regional assemblies together published a report last month identifying how one in four private sector workers could be targeted for remote working. That would of course be a much larger figure when it comes to public service workers. What these assemblies have found is that over 40,000 people in the west and north west alone, private sector workers, will be in a position to work remotely. This means 40,000 less commuters and 40,000 more people at home in their areas spending locally. The concern is that while we have funding, we need a strategy urgently so that we are not just investing in hubs but we have a strategy for this. My question therefore relates to the interdepartmental group.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#HeatherHumphreys" eId="spk_10" as="#Minister_for_Rural_and_Community_Development">
            <from>Deputy Heather Humphreys<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_28">The interdepartmental group has had its first meeting which I attended as I wanted to show the importance that I place in ensuring that we grasp this opportunity. As the Deputy and I are aware, remote working was a concept and aspiration this time last year. In fact there was a Cabinet meeting that was specifically looking at jobs and a big part of that was trying to get companies and people interested in remote working. Covid-19 has given us this opportunity which we really need to grasp and run with to ensure that the right strategy is in place for it.</p>
            <p eId="para_29"> The working group has had its first meeting and has a body of work to carry out and I assure the Deputy that we are doing everything we can to ensure that the group reports back to me as soon as possible. There are a number of things it needs to do including research work.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#ClaireKerrane" eId="spk_11">
            <from>Deputy Claire Kerrane<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_30">I would greatly appreciate if the Minister could give me figures as to how many remote working hubs could be established with this €5 million and if the group could look at the use of the already established premises that are perhaps vacant, or even the use of community centres as these hubs could act as a source of income for them. We know that many of them are struggling right now, especially in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
            <p eId="para_31"> There is a commitment to broadband in the programme for Government that does not necessarily fall under the Minister's remit but it is to accelerate the roll-out of broadband in rural areas. We could really do with seeing a plan on how we intend to accelerate that roll-out because it is so important. So many people have struggled during Covid-19. While it has been great that they have been able to work from home they have struggled in respect of broadband. We also know that children of school-going age have struggled with this.</p>
            <p eId="para_32"> On immigrants coming home, in my small village and on our road a house has not been built since I was a child. Three planning permissions have been made by people who are coming home, are able to work from home and build a life back where they grew up. That is so important.</p>
            <p eId="para_33"> I wish also to note that Arranmore Island has a new digital hub and it is the first to be established on an island off the coast. Is there any intention to roll out further such facilities in respect of our islands?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#HeatherHumphreys" eId="spk_12" as="#Minister_for_Rural_and_Community_Development">
            <from>Deputy Heather Humphreys<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_34">I thank the Deputy. My Department estimates that there is likely to be in excess of 350 hubs in operation across the country. Validating the number of hubs is one of the first tasks of the interdepartmental group which, as I said, is being chaired by the Secretary General of my Department. A number of other Departments are involved in that group.</p>
            <p eId="para_35"> This group will focus on collecting the data on the number of hubs that are in operation and it will be building a composite map of networks. This work is expected to be concluded in early to mid-2021. I take the Deputy's point on the islands. Some very good work has been undertaken on Arranmore Island in increasing its conductivity. I want to see more such focus on the islands because there is no reason why one cannot live on an island and work remotely for a multinational enterprise. This is now possible and this is a great time to capitalise on the opportunities that we have.</p>

            <p eId="para_37">One fear that many people have facing into difficult economic times is that schemes such as the LEADER funding programme would be abandoned, suspended or reduced in value. I know the Minister is aware that the LEADER programme is a vital tool which allows many organisations in rural Ireland to develop. What is the status of the LEADER funding programme and are there plans to run this programme or have it extended to 2021 and beyond?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#HeatherHumphreys" eId="spk_14" as="#Minister_for_Rural_and_Community_Development">
            <from>Deputy Heather Humphreys<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_38">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. The current 2014- 2020 LEADER programme will come to an end this year. Under the seven-year programme, €168.7 million was allocated to the local action groups, LAGs, which deliver the programme at local level, for project approvals up to 31 December 2020. As of November, 3,530 projects with a value of over €139 million have been approved for LEADER funding by the LAGs. A further 341 projects requesting over €21 million in funding are at various stages in the approval process.</p>
            <p eId="para_39"> Proposals for a successor LEADER programme at EU level are intrinsically linked to the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, which co-funds the LEADER programme. Proposals for the post-2020 CAP were launched in June 2018 by the European Commission. However, given the lengthy nature of discussions on the CAP and the wider EU budget at EU level, there has been a delay in adopting these proposals. This means that the next LEADER programme will not commence until January 2022 at the earliest. </p>
            <p eId="para_40"> The programme for Government includes a commitment to prioritise a State-led programme to bridge the gap between the current LEADER programme and the next EU programme. The objective of this commitment is to allow local-led rural development projects to be delivered under a transitional programme until the new EU programme commences.</p>
            <p eId="para_41"> An extra €4 million has been provided for LEADER in budget 2021, to bring the total allocation for next year to €44 million. This allocation will be used to fund a combination of existing projects as they come to completion, for new projects to be approved under the transitional programme and to support the administration costs of the LAGs in closing out the existing programme and delivering the transitional programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_42"> It is important to recognise that LEADER is a multi-annual programme and that payments in respect of projects which are approved in any given year are generally not drawn down until subsequent years, as and when they are completed. In this context, costs related to projects under the transitional programme are also likely to be met from the provision in my Department's Vote in 2022 and 2023. I hope to be in a position shortly to announce the details of the transitional programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_43">I am delighted to hear that. LEADER is a French acronym which, when translated, means links between actions for the development of the rural economy. It is an initiative to support rural development and projects initiated at local level to revitalise rural areas and create jobs. I understand that the LEADER programme is co-funded by the EU under the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, but it has benefited Wexford to the tune of €10 million over the 2014 to 2020 period. That is greatly appreciated but I am not sure that we can do without it in this torrid time and in terms of what is to come. In the current climate, many enterprises in rural communities will end up closed permanently but job creation and enterprise development will be more crucial than ever before. I ask the Minister to take that on board. I would like further clarification on the transition period but she said she might write to me in that regard. With regard to some of the funding that is ongoing, can the Minister tell me when that will be decided or some of the programmes that are in train?</p>

            <p eId="para_44">I thank the Deputy. It is important to say first that there will be a transitional programme but there are many projects and therefore the LEADER companies will be very busy over the next year or year and a half in terms of finishing the projects. They have until the end of this year to make the further announcements. In terms of the figures, there are 3,500 projects approved to a value of €139 million. A further 341 projects are requesting more than €21 million in funding and they are at various stages in the approval process. There are more projects to be announced. They have until the end of the year to announce them. They have another year and a half to make sure these projects get the funding, to work with the promoters and to ensure they are delivered in terms of what they are trying to achieve on those projects. There is a good deal of work to be done by the LEADER companies in the next year and a half. In addition, I have committed to providing a transitional programme. I am working on those details and I will have the information in a short time. There is no particular panic at the moment because they have a fair bit on their plates. I am very conscious of the good work they do. In Wexford, their budget is €7.5 million. A total of 153 projects have been approved to date worth €5.9 million and more than €2.7 million is being paid out in respect of completed works. There is a good bit of work to be done so they will be kept busy.</p>

            <p eId="para_45">They can be assured that they will be kept busy and that is where I am coming from. We have two well-known food businesses in Wexford that were helped through the LEADER programme to the tune of approximately €250,000. They are Kelly's Bakery in Wexford town, which is now a household brand, and Wexford Home Preserves in New Ross. In the climate of Brexit that is about to be upon us, these companies need as much help as possible to be able to market their product in the future. To clarify, did the Minister say the transitional funding will be €4 million?</p>

            <p eId="para_48">I know there is no provision for the grouping of questions but this is the exact same question. I ask the Minister about the development of a State-led rural development programme to bridge the gap. To save time, she might depart from her script because she has read it. I have three specific questions on that. Funding has not been provided for new LEADER projects in 2021. Funding has not been identified for the delivery and administration of the LEADER programme for 2021. There is no interim national rural development plan although I hear the Minister intends to publish it. Would she please address those three questions?</p>

            <from>Deputy Heather Humphreys<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T10:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_49">To clarify for the Deputy, funding is provided for 2021. That assumption is incorrect. There is €44 million in the budget for 2021. That €44 million will be used to fund existing LEADER commitments and provide for a transitional programme. The current LEADER programme comes to an end in December this year, but due to delays in agreeing the Common Agricultural Policy and the budget at EU level, the programme will not commence until 2022 at the earliest.</p>
            <p eId="para_50"> The Government has committed to prioritising a transitional programme to bridge the gap between the current programme and the next one. The duration of the transitional period at EU level has not been agreed so we are therefore planning that Ireland's transitional programme will run for an initial period of 12 months but with the scope to extend, if necessary, to align with the outcome of the discussions at EU level between the Commission and the Parliament. As EU co-funding may become available for the transitional programme, our intention is that the programme will be subject to the current operating rules for LEADER and the existing LEADER structures will be used for the delivery of the programme. This will involve the continuing role of the current local action groups, LAGs, and the implementing partners in each LEADER area. The transitional programme will provide funding for new projects and for the administration of the programme. The cost of the transitional programme will be managed within the Department's budget. As I said, we have €44 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_51"> LEADER is a multi-annual programme and payments in respect of projects which are approved in any given year are not generally drawn down until subsequent years. Costs related to projects under the transitional programme in 2021 are therefore likely to be relatively low, but the overall project costs will be met from the provision in my Department's Vote in 2022 and 2023, as required, as well as in 2021.</p>

I understand that there is a delay because of the CAP negotiations, but if we look back to questions asked by Deputies previously, culminating in Deputy Martin Browne's yesterday, going back to December 2019 when the Minister was on notice that there would be a transitional phase, almost a full year has passed and a transition plan has not been published.

A further 341 projects requesting €21 million in funding are at various stages of the approval process. They have not been completed yet. On the payment side, 1,800 project promoters have now received a final payment. There are 3,841 projects. Only 1,800 of them have been finished. There is a lot of work to do for the next year in terms of just over half of them. They will have plenty to do. There will be a transition programme which I will announce in a number of weeks. I can assure the Deputy there will be sufficient funding to allow them continue to operate. I have been in this space before. In 2016, it was the same story and there was a big furore which was sorted out amicably in the end. I want to work with these LEADER companies.

In fact, it should be reinforced and resourced with extra money. There is uncertainty over the €44 million. How much of it was available for new projects or to keep the scheme going for the year?

Therefore, there are a number of players. I accept that they do great work and I want to engage with them but I want to review the scheme. It is timely that we look at what they achieved in the last programme and determine how we can improve on it in the next one.</p>

            <p eId="para_77">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. The increased shift to remote work in the past six months as a result of Covid-19 has given us the opportunity to reimagine the possibilities for a greater regional distribution of jobs and to support better quality of life for many who previously spent many hours on long commutes. Remote working has the potential to transform rural areas, allowing people to build careers in good-quality jobs while continuing to live closer to home. It also provides an opportunity for those who moved away from home for work reasons to return to their roots to raise their families.</p>
            <p eId="para_78"> Since 2019, my Department has been working with the Western Development Commission, WDC, to build an integrated network of remote working hubs along the Atlantic economic corridor, AEC, from Kerry to Donegal. The WDC has identified and mapped more than 100 remote working hubs that serve that region. The approach to building this network and shared back-office services will serve as a model that can be replicated in other parts of the country. Budget 2021 allocated an additional €5 million to my Department to support the expansion of the AEC hub network model into a national initiative. An interdepartmental working group, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, has been convened to make progress on this work. My Department invests significantly in remote working facilities through programmes such as the town and village renewal scheme, the rural regeneration and development fund and the libraries programme.</p>

Can the Minister tell me what community centres have already been allocated funding for the broadband upgrade? What can community centres in the constituency of Limerick City, which covers east Limerick and north Tipperary, including Newport, Ballinahinch and Birdhill, do to make an application to access funding from the Minister's Department to facilitate remote working? I want people be able to go to towns such as Castleconnell, Murroe, Caherconlish and Newport to work remotely in their local community centre, where they know the people. It is a return to a very good model, which involves living and working in the community and rearing one's family there. What can people in Limerick and north Tipperary do to gain access to funding to facilitate the creation of remote-working enterprise centres in local community centres?</p>

            <p eId="para_80">We will have 200 broadband connection points rolled out before the end of this year, and the remaining 100 or so will be rolled out by the first half of next year. We are rolling them out as quickly as possible. The way it works is that the broadband officer in the local authority identifies certain communities that have poor-quality broadband. We have worked with Vodafone and National Broadband Ireland to install high-speed broadband in the relevant community centres. I now have the funding. I want to make sure that if a community hall needs to install some equipment, such as a desk or two, fit out a room or do something that improves its quality, we want to work with it. We have been rolling out the initiative, working with the local authorities so they will be able to identify changes that need to be made. It will not involve big money. We would like to be able to help in this regard. In addition, there is the initiative concerning remote working or co-working spaces in towns and villages.</p>

A major issue in rural east Limerick and rural north Tipperary is that Eir might have broadband available at both ends of a road but no coverage in between. I ask that local authority broadband officers take into account in their analysis and appraisal the locations that cannot access broadband but where it could be made available in the local community centre. In this way, the centre would qualify under the scheme on the basis that there are areas nearby that do not have access to broadband. I ask that the criteria be expanded. The measure is very welcome. When does the Minister expect to have the scheme up and running so relevant communities can apply for broadband in their community centres through their local authorities, such as Limerick City and County Council and Tipperary County Council?</p>

            <p eId="para_84">The local authorities are certainly working with communities across the country. They are happy to work further with them. If there are other connection points that we need to consider, I will be happy to work with the local authorities in that regard and get feedback from them.</p>
            <p eId="para_85"> Let me state what the €5 million is for. We need a mapping exercise because we need to find out where all the hubs are and account for the broadband connection points. There are all sorts of names in use, including "co-working spaces" and "digital hubs". We are going to put them all on one big map and see where the gaps are. We will also be able to provide a platform or app so a person will be able to find out where remote working is possible in his or her local area. We are considering town and village renewal in the sense that there might be a premises in the middle of a town suitable for a co-working hub. I am very keen to have the hubs in the middle of towns because it revitalises them. If a community centre needs to buy a desk or kit itself out, that will not be a problem; that is what the money is for.</p>

            <p eId="para_88">May I mention the "D" word, namely, decentralisation? It has been out of favour. Previously, decentralisation involved moving whole sections of Departments, but my idea involves a different type of decentralisation. Working from home is fine for many people, but people need socialisation at work. It is also important for the workplace. Instead of bringing people back to their parent Departments, could there be Civil Service offices, perhaps in premises currently held, where people from different Departments could work and be overseen by a principal officer? People all over the country could work remotely near where they wanted to live. Has there been any discussion on this suggestion, including with the OPW on utilising underutilised properties in the new regime? The post-Covid world will not be the same as the pre-Covid world.</p>

            <p eId="para_89">I agree. For that reason, there will be a focus on remote working under the rural development plan. Co-working is better because people need social interaction. I have already spoken to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, about co-working spaces specifically designed for public servants so that they can go to towns with facilities that have been kitted out with, for example, the right Internet connections and IT security, and are good work environments. Public servants could have the contact they need because I do not believe that working from home all the time is a good idea. People need to get out. It would also encourage creativity and connectivity between different Departments and ideas could thrive.</p>
            <p eId="para_90"> I could talk all day about the Annaghmakerrig centre in County Monaghan. The guy who left it to the arts placed one condition on it - the artists could go about their business on their own all day, be it writing books, painting or whatever, but they had to have dinner together in the evening. A connection whereby people sit down together and have a bit of lunch or a cup of coffee allows an exchange of ideas and encourages creativity.</p>
            <p eId="para_91"> I would like to think that if we design such facilities, we could also have a space for an artist. We will work on these matters.</p>

            <p eId="para_92">There is nothing stopping people from multiple Departments going to the same building if the broadband connection is good. Remote working is great and co-working is the key.</p>
            <p eId="para_93"> I will finish on this point. All politics are local. Murroe is in my constituency. It is the home of Glenstal Abbey. Murroe has the Muintir na Tíre Hall, which was founded by Canon John Hayes, who promoted the idea of people working and thriving in their communities. I am not saying we are going back to that exactly, but we are going back to it in a digital age. It should be supported. We have to think outside the box and it is a good initiative.</p>

            <p eId="para_97">Go raibh maith ag an Deputy for raising this issue. As she will be aware, the pier on Inis Meáin is listed among the capital development projects referenced in the national development plan. To date, approximately €14 million has been spent on the project's first two phases. Users of the pier, including a number of State-subsidised ferry operators, have highlighted issues with capacity at the harbour as well as with currents around the harbour mouth. I understand that the next step is for Galway County Council to review the draft business case, setting out the options for further development, including options to address the issues regarding access to the harbour.</p>
            <p eId="para_98"> In June 2020, my Department provided funding to Galway County Council to commission the preparation of a simulation model of the harbour by the National Maritime College of Ireland, NMCI. This modelling will examine a range of designs to address the problems and provide guidance for vessels accessing the harbour. Covid-19 restrictions have meant that access to the NMCI facility has not been possible in recent months. However, Galway County Council is making arrangements with the NMCI to progress the work, having regard to public health guidelines and travel restrictions. Once the NMCI has completed its work and Galway County Council has incorporated the findings into its draft business case, the Department will evaluate the options in line with the public spending code and available funding. At that stage, the finalised plan for the pier will be prepared.</p>
            <p eId="para_99"> It should be noted that all requisite permissions and assessments will need to be undertaken once the final plan has been scoped out and agreed.</p>

            <p eId="para_100">Mothaíonn muintir Inis Meáin go bhfuil forbairt na céibhe tar éis titim idir dhá stól. Ní raibh an chéibh críochnaithe amach riamh, mar atá luaite ag an Aire. Tuigim go bhfuil taighde á dhéanamh i gCorcaigh ar ábaltacht na céibhe stoirmeacha a sheasamh, rud atá fíorthábhachtach don oileán. Tá staidéar á dhéanamh ar thomhais na céibhe freisin, le fánán. Níl aon cheo déanta air seo ó 2008. Teastaíonn freagraí ar an bhforbairt thábhachtach seo. Bhí an taighde ceaptha a bheith críochnaithe anuraidh.</p>
            <p eId="para_101"> I understand it is intended to progress phase 3, which will address issues such as pier capacity and the provision of an enhanced slipway, but the final phase has been delayed while the study on the project has been under way in Cork. That study was due for completion last year and has been delayed further by the pandemic. This project has been ongoing for 12 years. Is there a timeline for its completion?</p>

            <p eId="para_102">My Department has given funding to Galway County Council with advice on preparing a draft business case. The Department has also provided funding of €39,360 to Galway County Council for the preparation of the modelling simulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_103"> The project will take some time, but progress has been made. The key aspect is that there is co-operation between the county council and the NMCI. There are problems with the harbour, for example relating to boat capacity and access issues due to currents. The council must develop a business case and the Department will have to evaluate the final plan. Other elements will also have to be considered when developing the plan, for example, environmental impact assessments. It is a complex project, but it is good that the council is working with the NMCI. That will allow the council to model a simulation and find out exactly where the problems are and how to address them.</p>

            <p eId="para_106">I imagine that Galway County Council has been engaging with the community on Inis Meáin. Some of the Deputy's colleagues have raised the matter with me numerous times. I am sure they have been in contact with the community as well.</p>

I wish to reassure the Deputy the national development plan is up for review. We want to ensure this project is in it - it is absolutely essential. We are talking about what will probably be a five-year project. I am happy that my officials can engage with the island community. There is some work to be done to get the right solution. There is no point building something that will not work. I have seen where other new piers have come up but they have created more problems when they have not been investigated fully.</p>

            <p eId="para_108">When the pier went in, it was a revolution on the island. If the Minister knows Inis Meáin or visits the island she will understand. It was built at the only place on the island where it was possible to create a harbour. It was known from the beginning that phase 1 would not do the full job. However, it has made it possible for the passenger ferry to go in, even though there are some issues at the mouth - we understand that. Yet, the cargo boat does not go in. I have raised with the Minister previously the critical importance of the cargo boat not only for bringing goods into the island but because of the significant manufacturing facility, Cniotáil Inis Meáin, based on the island. The company needs constant supplies in and out. It is doing well business-wise but it is totally dependent on getting the raw material in and the finished material out.</p>
            <p eId="para_109"> This project has been progressing, or so we are told, for a long time but it seems at times to be going nowhere. I know about the National Maritime College of Ireland. Will the Minister organise to give us all the steps that will have to be taken between now and the completion of this project, as well as the project on Inis Oírr? They are both equally important. Will the Minister give us an estimated timeline for each step? We need to see the timescales and we need to be able to measure progress. The county council and the Department tend to tell us all the time that the other group has the ball.</p>

I understand the difficulties with the cargo ship - that it cannot get in and out - and that it is badly needed.</p>
            <p eId="para_111"> My officials are keeping in contact with the island committee. My officials will be happy to meet them again to discuss progress on the project. I am happy to provide the Deputy with an outline of where this project is and where it needs to get to.

            <p eId="para_116">I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 12 and 18 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_117"> The programme for Government includes a commitment to prioritise a State-led programme to bridge the gap between the current LEADER programme and the next EU programme. The objective of this commitment is to allow a local-led rural development project to be delivered under a transitional programme until the new EU programme commences.</p>
            <p eId="para_118"> The next EU programme will not commence until 2022 at the earliest. In recent months, my Department has listened to the views of several stakeholders involved in the delivery of the LEADER programme in respect of the proposed transitional programme. This includes local authorities and the local development companies. The design, duration and composition of the transitional programme is currently being finalised. I hope to be in a position shortly to announce the details of the programme that will come into effect in 2021.</p>
            <p eId="para_119"> An extra €4 million has been provided for LEADER in budget 2021 to bring the total allocation for next year to €44 million. I can confirm that the allocation will be used to fund a combination of existing projects as they come to completion as well as new projects to be approved under the transitional programme. The funding will also support the administration costs of local action groups in closing out the existing programme and delivering the transitional programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_120"> It is important to recognise that LEADER is a multiannual programme and that payments in respect of projects which are approved in any given year are generally not drawn down until subsequent years, depending on the nature and scale of the projects concerned. In this context, overall costs related to projects under the transitional programme are likely to be met from the provision in my Department's Vote in 2022 and 2023 as well as in 2021.</p>

            <p eId="para_121">I thank the Minister for her detailed response. I wish to acknowledge the excellent work she has done in her Ministry to date. She has built on the progress made since the establishment of the Department of Rural and Community Development in 2017 by the former Minister, Deputy Michael Ring.</p>
            <p eId="para_122"> I thank the Minister for her comments on her work alongside the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and the confirmation that the Northern and Western Regional Assembly will continue to be used as a vehicle to support EU-backed projects for the north-west region. That is crucial. It is a vital step for rural development in the west and north west.</p>
            <p eId="para_123"> In my constituency we have the South West Mayo Development Company and the Mayo North East company. They support vital jobs in Ireland as well as social and economic development within the county. The Mayo Local Action Group is one of the top-ten performing local action groups under the leader programme. The additional allocation of €4 million in the budget recently was vital and welcome. We need to continue with the work and with the LEADER programme. The Minister's support in this regard would be valuable and greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p eId="para_124">I know the Mayo local development companies do good work. I wish to continue to support the companies in finishing off this programme. The end of this year is the end date for announcing new projects. Some of the companies still have several projects and applications to which they have yet to allocate funding. It will take some time for these projects to draw down the money. The local development companies will be fairly busy in the coming year and a half or so in ensuring these projects are delivered. They will be working with the promoters. I can assure the Deputy that there is €44 million in the budget for next year. That will cover the existing projects that have been approved. It will also include a transitional programme. I will be announcing details of that in the coming weeks and I will be engaging with stakeholders.</p>

            <p eId="para_126">As the Minister has said, there was a commitment in the programme for Government to have the transitional programme.

            <p eId="para_128"> In the post-Covid environment LEADER may be the only show in town for a lot of organisations and a lot of major development. During 2021 how much of the €44 million will be available for new projects and new calls? Will there be any prospect of new calls for new projects launching in 2021?</p>
            <p eId="para_129"> I join others in paying tribute to all the LEADER staff, particularly those in the LEADER companies in Mayo and the Department's staff in Ballina, where the programme is headquartered. We look forward to welcoming the Minister to Ballina when conditions allow in order that she can see for herself the superb team she has there.</p>

            <p eId="para_130">I agree with Deputy Calleary that the staff in Ballina do really good work there, work extremely hard and engage a lot. I have spoken to them on a number of occasions via the Internet, on Zoom, Webex or whatever else they are using, but I hope to visit Ballina as soon as I can.</p>
            <p eId="para_131"> As for the Northern and Western Regional Assembly, I was delighted to work on that matter with Deputy Calleary and the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, who gave approval for the funding to be rolled out. That is extremely important.</p>
            <p eId="para_132"> I am continually speaking to different people individually about the LEADER companies. I have not met them as a group yet but it is my plan to meet them very shortly. To be clear, they have until the middle of 2022 to complete these projects and there will be a fund for a transitional programme. I am considering that and will announce it in the coming weeks. I am happy to engage with the Deputies on this matter and I will also engage with the stakeholders. I wish to support them in the good work they do while bearing in mind that I will carry out a review of the programme. That is the right and wise thing to do. We want to see what has and has not worked well and identify the weaknesses and address them. I look forward to working with the LEADER companies in that regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_135">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. The Department leads on the implementation of the public library strategy, Our Public Libraries 2022, which aims to improve access to, use and visibility of the library as a community hub and a focal point for cultural development. In 2020 alone my Department has allocated over €8 million to support public library services. This includes the libraries capital programme, which will invest some €29 million in 18 projects and in the My Open Library service over the next few years. The programme has six completed projects and five more under construction. The My Open Library service, which in normal circumstances allows access to the library on a self-service basis from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., 365 days per year, is available in 19 branches and is under development in a further 49 branches. In addition to this, nine new libraries are being funded through my Department's rural regeneration and development fund. Earlier this year almost €700,000 was approved to support the provision of sensory facilities and equipment in libraries and last month I approved over €713,000 for the provision of library supports for marginalised, socially excluded and disadvantaged communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_136"> I have also provided significant funding to public libraries during the Covid-19 pandemic. In September I approved €3 million for a small-scale capital works programme that will help adapt libraries to facilitate social distancing and other measures in order to comply with Covid-19 guidelines. My Department also provided funding of €400,000 to support the provision of additional online ebooks and e-audiobooks.</p>
            <p eId="para_137"> Libraries the length and breadth of the country are doing an absolutely wonderful job. There are so many more people using their local libraries, which is really encouraging. I compliment the staff in every single library. They really are a credit to us all in the great service they provide. Libraries are innovating, adapting and evolving and my Department is delighted to support them on this.</p>

            <p eId="para_138">I appreciate the Minister's answer, particularly insofar as it relates to the strategy outlined in Our Public Libraries 2022: Inspiring, Connecting and Empowering Communities, to which she referred. Libraries are closed now, however. I know she is a very keen supporter of libraries. I do not think there is a public representative who is not. The library has always been one of our favourite community hubs. The view of communities, however, is that local retail stores and supermarkets are open and people are stacking shelves in them and customers are going into them in large numbers. There are never large numbers in libraries, a fact which should be taken into account in anticipation of any future lockdown, semi-lockdown or other measures that may have to be taken. Libraries play a critical role. The Minister knows that many people sometimes cannot afford to buy a daily newspaper. They call into the local library to read their daily newspaper and for the opportunity to interact with other people. They were denied that during the previous lockdown. It was a sacrifice many of them made. What is the Minister's thinking in this regard? When we come out of this, hopefully on 1 December, and if we ever have to restrict movement again, will libraries be pinpointed as one of those public places where we can be a little more flexible and a little more agile in enabling public access?</p>

            <p eId="para_139">I take the Deputy's point that libraries can be controlled fairly well and I know that the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, and the local authority chief executives have asked for libraries to operate contact and collect at level 4. They have made proposals and we are happy to bring those proposals to the Department of the Taoiseach and NPHET for consideration. I absolutely accept the point the Deputy makes, that it is hard to see the risks in click and collect. Since the beginning of the pandemic the Department has provided €400,000 for the purchase of additional ebooks and e-audiobooks to meet the rising demand for these services. Library users now have access to an extensive online catalogue: more than 48,000 ebooks and 33,000 e-audiobooks, 4,000 magazines, 2,400 online newspapers from over 100 countries, more than 500 elearning courses and more than 100 online language courses. I myself did not realise the libraries were offering such a wonderful service - it is fantastic - but I take the Deputy's point that not everybody is online.</p>

            <p eId="para_140">I thank the Minister for that and I hear her openness to my suggestions. I think we can see the sense in this, as she said, given the low risk and somehow analysing it. She announced €3 million to support a small-scale capital works programme in some of the public libraries. Given that they have been closing, is progress being made on that during their closure? In addition, the Minister's strategy, which I very much welcome, sets out an ambition of increasing library use and growing active membership from 6% of the population to 30%. Has she any update or news on reaching out to an increased membership?</p>

            <p eId="para_141">Library membership has gone up considerably since the lockdown and that is really good. As for online material alone, in March 2020, 17,865 new users registered to use the online BorrowBox service, which provides access to ebooks. That was a 702% increase in the number of new users. There has also been a 122% increase in the number of ebooks borrowed this year and a 111% increase in the number of audio ebooks borrowed. We will continue to engage, particularly with those marginalised communities to try to get them to use library services more. As I said, when I was reading out the list, I thought, I must go online and look up some of these wonderful services the library has. I know libraries are doing great work but sometimes, as Deputy Calleary and I know, we just do not have as much time as we might like to avail of their services. I know the Deputy is a big supporter of the libraries in his own area. In his constituency €1.9 million has been allocated to libraries.</p>

            <p eId="para_147">I have a prepared response but I will leave it because it is similar to what I said earlier. This is it; this is our opportunity. Remote working, or as I prefer to call it, connected working, will be a game changer not just for rural Ireland but for the urban areas as well. Many people living in the Deputy's area get on a train, bus or whatever to come into the centre of the city when, in fact, they could be working in a co-working space close to their homes and in their community. That is what I mean by connected work. A person can connect to his or her employer easily.</p>
            <p eId="para_148"> As I said last year, remote working was a concept. Now, because of Covid-19, it is an everyday working reality for thousands of workers. There are huge opportunities here for regional development. One only has to look at the major companies, such as Indeed and Microsoft, which have told their staff they can work remotely for longer terms. That is hugely positive. We must enable and facilitate that and make sure it happens. There are benefits right across the board. People can live and work in their own locality. It enables young people to avail of cheaper house prices, particularly in the countryside. Less time is spent computing and that is good for the environment. The reality is, therefore, that if an office worker has good phone and broadband coverage that person can do the same job in Ballybay as he or she can in Ballsbridge.</p>
            <p eId="para_149"> We must seize this momentum around remote working. My Department, therefore, is investing in the development of remote working hubs through schemes like the €1 billion rural regeneration and development fund and the town and village renewal scheme. As I said earlier, we secured an extra €5 million in funding for the town and village scheme and part of that budget, specifically, is for the development of remote working facilities in our town and villages.</p>

            <p eId="para_150">I thank the Minister for her helpful reply. I strongly support that particular initiative. I believe Deputy Ó Cuív and others mentioned earlier the benefits of a community working together and the benefit from an employment and social point of view as well as from the point of view of having the names of some of our major players in industrial parks or similar in cities and towns throughout the country, where adequate communication facilities have been laid on.</p>
            <p eId="para_151"> Will a specific plan be pursued in that area with a view to making it attractive for the major players in the services and manufacturing sectors to have several locations throughout the country, bringing jobs to communities and community life to local communities? It must be taken on board that young people want to associate with each other in a work environment. That is good for them, the community and the employer.</p>

            <p eId="para_152">The Deputy is absolutely right. There is a broad consensus across the House that this is the time to do it and this is the right opportunity. I discussed public servants earlier. We need to facilitate our public servants to go into designated co-working spaces in towns across the country. We must have it mapped out and planned. That is why we have the interdepartmental group led by my Department. I am aware the Tánaiste's Department is leading a policy on remote working. I am looking after these hubs and an interdepartmental group has been set up. First of all, we are mapping it out. We have approximately 350 hubs across the country but some are more suited for community use than remote working full-time. My long-term plan, therefore, is to do that exercise right across the country and develop an app so any worker will be able to log on and find the closest hub.</p>
            <p eId="para_153"> Of course, the Deputy is absolutely right. That will be a big boost to the IDA when it is trying to attract some of the big tech companies. We already have a top class network of these hubs across the country. We will be able to say here is the skill set and here is the area. It is about the clustering as well as about bringing this information together. It is about putting it on a plate for them and saying we have all that they need. It is important to say that other countries across Europe are doing this as well but I want us to be at the head of this and to make sure we are not left behind.</p>

            <p eId="para_155">The Deputy is right. When I was Minister with responsibility for business, a young lad with a wife and children said to me it is a no-brainer. He said people need to be able to work in their communities and said it makes such a difference to his home life. It is true. Many people have now discovered they are able to spend more time with their families. It is a better quality of life at the end of day but it is also good for communities and for the environment. We will certainly look at the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_156"> Let us face it that the one good thing is that we have signed national broadband plan. That was the best thing we ever did. It is not a question now of whether we should have it but when we will get it. The most frequent representation in my constituency office these days is on when people can get broadband. Of course, we are working on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_157"> In Deputy Durkan's constituency, I notice that under the town and village renewal scheme hub investment in County Kildare and the 2020 accelerated measure, which was to cope with Covid-19, a nice application came in for the kit-out of a broadband connection point. The applicants got €9,900 to renovate and decorate rooms in Bigstone, Crookstown, County Kildare. They will renovate and decorate rooms for remote working to provide seating desks and IT equipment so sites can be used for remote working and learning. The learning is the other bit and we can have education rolled out in these centres.</p>

It says a new company has been drafted in by the Government and yet nothing is happening. Please, get people working.

            <p eId="para_160">The responsibility for the roll-out of the national broadband plan falls within the Minister, Deputy Ryan's, Department. I know he is working closely with National Broadband Ireland, NBI, in an effort to try to roll this out as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_161"> In the meantime, however, the good news is my Department has a number of broadband connection points in the local community halls. A person can go in there and get the high-speed broadband he or she needs. That is why I have provided money. I just mentioned one in County Kildare and I am sure County Kerry was not left out. I do not have the list here but County Kerry certainly was not left out when it came to the broadband connection points. The purpose of those is that if a person does not have good broadband in his or her house, he or she can go down to the local community centre and get that connection he or she needs. A person can either get it outside in his or her car or go into the community hall. The local broadband officers in the local authorities have been working extremely hard right across the country. They identified the areas which needed that and asked us to get those connected.</p>
            <p eId="para_162">We will have 200 connected by the end of the year and another 100 will be connected early next year. That will give another 300 connection points throughout the country.

            <p eId="para_167">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. The Government is aware of the challenges facing community and voluntary organisations and is committed to working closely with the sector in managing those challenges, recognising that it will require a whole-of-government approach. The community and voluntary sector Covid-19 stability fund provided €35 million initially from the Dormant Accounts Fund. It was intended to be a targeted once-off cash injection for organisations and groups currently delivering critical front-line services to the people most at need in our society and which are in danger of imminent closure due to lost fundraised or traded income as a direct result of restrictions to counter the spread of Covid-19.</p>
            <p eId="para_168"> My Department received 1,060 applications during the application periods. To date, four tranches of successful applications have been announced, allocating funding of more than €30 million to 568 organisations. This funding is supporting the delivery of many critical front-line services in every part of the country. Though the fund is now closed to new applications, additional checks are continuing on a small number of applications and remaining outcomes will be communicated on an individual basis. Lists of successful applicants are available on my Department's website. </p>
            <p eId="para_169"> An additional €10 million has been provided for the stability fund under budget 2021. My Department is currently finalising plans for the distribution of this funding and I expect to be making an announcement in that regard very shortly. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, also has responsibility in this area and he is working on how the additional €10 million will be allocated. The extra funding is very welcome.</p>

            <p eId="para_170">I thank the Minister for her answer. As she knows, community and voluntary sector organisations and social enterprises throughout the country have been hit very hard by the Covid-19 crisis. Nevertheless, many of them have been at the coalface of the response to the pandemic, whether through the Community Call or other initiatives. I acknowledge, as I am sure does everybody in the House, their efforts over the past nine months.</p>
            <p eId="para_171"> The Government's Covid-19 stability fund has provided significant assistance, as the Minister said, to more than 560 organisations impacted by the pandemic. I acknowledge, in particular, the allocation of €2 million for disability services in Dublin, which was targeted at services for people most at risk. It is critically important that we help these organisations with their short-term cash flow and it is good to know that funding is being prioritised for that purpose. I understand that a total of €30 million was allocated in four tranches since June. Can the Minister provide more details on the additional allocation of €10 million? If she does not have the information to hand, she might pass it on to me later. The organisations we are talking about really need to know where they stand in order to make plans for 2021 and beyond.</p>

            <p eId="para_172">The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is looking at how best to administer the €10 million allocation. It has been assigned to us and we are very pleased to get it. He is working with stakeholders and officials to ensure it is targeted where it is most needed. That process will be completed very shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_173"> In terms of the €5 million that was not spent by my Department, there are a number of instances where applications were submitted but certain information was not included. There is an appeals process and some projects have availed of that option and been successful. We want to engage with the applicants to make sure nobody is left out. Sometimes, what is happening in reality may not be reflected on the paper application. It is important that we engage with the organisations concerned.</p>

The additional €10 million announced in budget 2021 is important to the organisations looking to access it. Their future is uncertain, particularly in the event of another wave of Covid infections and if a vaccine is not forthcoming. As I said, it is very important that we provide them with information as soon as we can in order to assist them as they plan for 2021.</p>

            <p eId="para_175">I take the Deputy's point that the organisations want to get the details of this funding as quickly as possible. We are very conscious of that but we also want to ensure that it is properly targeted. It is a once-off cash injection for the organisations and groups that are delivering critical front-line services. They include disability services, meals on wheels, mental health services, addiction supports, residential care centres and services for older people. There is a range of services that are targeted in this initiative and the organisations have been really grateful for the support the Government has been able to give them. We will continue to engage with them and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, will announce the details as soon as he has finalised them. The additional funding was only announced in the budget two weeks ago and the Minister is working on it.</p>

            <p eId="para_177">What is the timeframe for the completion of the planned remaining broadband connection points in County Kerry? Since the Covid crisis, the plan has changed. While there were initially 12 places nominated as BCPs in County Kerry, it seems now that only eight are to be completed. People living on the road between Lyracrumpane and Duagh have contacted me many times about the lack of broadband. Perhaps a BCP is not really appropriate there and what is needed is for more wiring to be laid on the road, up by the post office and down by the church.</p>

            <p eId="para_178">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. Broadband connection points will be among the first sites connected under the national broadband plan. They represent a collaboration between my Department, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, local authorities and the communities that will host the BCP services.  At present, there are more than 200 public access BCP sites scheduled for connection in 2020, in addition to 75 BCPs located in schools. Up to 100 more public access sites are planned for connection in 2021.</p>
            <p eId="para_179"> As of 23 October, 68 public access BCPs throughout the country had been installed with Wi-Fi equipment, with new sites being added every day. Included in those 68 sites are two public access BCPs in Kerry, namely, the Cable Station and Chapeltown community centre, both on Valentia Island.  It is important that we do not forget about the islands. The Cable Station at Valentia is of historic significance, being considered by many to be the birthplace of global telecommunications. It was the site of the first transatlantic telegraph cable between the American continent and Europe. It is very appropriate that it is now home to a BCP that will facilitate connected workers employed by companies both here and overseas.</p>
            <p eId="para_180"> In total, there will be nine public access BCPs and three school BCPs connected in Kerry this year. Details of the locations of all BCPs which have been, or are due to be, connected are available on the website of National Broadband Ireland, <i>www.nbi.ie</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_181">Broadband coverage is very patchy in the whole of County Kerry, including in Lispole, Sionnach, Brandon and Cloghane, beyond Dingle, and in the Lyracrumpane area, where it is difficult even to get telephone coverage, never mind broadband. Given the peripherality of County Kerry, the fact there are three peninsulas and that only eight out of the 12 BCPs have been taken up, will the Minister look again at the provision for some of these rural areas? The whole of west Kerry does not have one BCP beyond Inch. Will she look at getting some extra wiring into some of these roads, given the bad state of the coverage there?</p>

If Deputy Daly wants to write to me specifically about the problems that are being encountered on the connection point he is talking about, I am happy to follow that up.</p>
            <p eId="para_185"> The best thing we ever did was sign up to the national broadband plan. There was a good bit of opposition to it at the time but nobody is asking for details about the broadband plan. They want to know when they can get it. That is all they want to know. I am sure all the Deputies here have questions coming into their constituency offices wondering when they can get this. The good news is it is coming. The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is working with National Broadband Ireland to move it along as quickly as we can because Covid has shown us how important broadband is for communities and for businesses right across rural Ireland. As a Government, we are totally committed to making sure it is delivered.</p>

          <p eId="para_188">Le cúplá lá anuas, tá admhaithe ag an Tánaiste gur thug sé cáipéis rúnda dá chara ina raibh 130 leathanach agus achan cheann dóibh marcáilte mar rúnda agus nach raibh cead ann é a thabhairt d'aon duine. Tá a fhios againn, agus ag madraí an bhaile, anois go raibh an rud a rinne an Tánaiste contráilte ach tá níos mó eolais de dhíth orainn faoi seo. This week, the Tánaiste admitted to leaking a confidential document, marked "Not for circulation", to a friend of his. The Tánaiste admitted that he was wrong to do so. The Tánaiste's rationale for doing so was debunked here in the House on Tuesday night and there are a number of issues I want to return to because the Tánaiste has not provided clarity on all the matters surrounding this.</p>
          <p eId="para_189"> I have looked through both documents and I have found that there are at least 35 changes between the one that the Tánaiste provided to his friend, the president of the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, and the one that was subsequently published by the Department of Health. The reality is that discussions were still live and ongoing and that this part of the Tánaiste's argument simply does not stake up to scrutiny. Every one of the 130 pages of the agreement that the Tánaiste gave to his friend was marked "Confidential: Not for circulation". It had that stamp on every single page. Can the Tánaiste explain why there was another document attached to the one he provided to the president of the NAGP? I refer to a six-page document that is not marked "Confidential: Not for circulation". Each page of this document is marked "Working draft: Confidential".</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> It was widely reported last night that the Tánaiste told those present at a meeting of his parliamentary party that they should be careful with the friends they choose. That does not sound like the words of someone who is sorry for his actions. That sounds like the words of someone who is annoyed that he got caught. Is that not the reality? Instead of accepting responsibility for his actions, the Tánaiste threw Dr. Maitiú Ó Tuathail under the bus and then decided to reverse over him. I want to put on the record that Dr. Ó Tuathail is not to blame here. Dr. Ó Tuathail was within his rights, as president of the NAGP, to seek out this document, either from the then Minister for Health or from the then Taoiseach. He was acting in the interests of his members as he saw it and he was perfectly entitled to ask the Tánaiste for this document. The wrongdoing here is that the Tánaiste was not entitled to provide this document, or indeed the other document marked "Confidential", to the president of the NAGP, a friend of the Tánaiste. It was the Tánaiste who made that decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_191"> Will the Tánaiste answer me this? On Tuesday, he told this House that he spoke to Dr. Ó Tuathail in recent days to try and verify when the Tánaiste sent the document to him because, as the Tánaiste said to the House on Tuesday, "I did not have that WhatsApp message any more and I wanted to check the exact date on which I sent the document." Can the Tánaiste explain what he means by this? Has the Tánaiste deleted these messages? Has he deleted these communications from his phone? I am sure the Tánaiste will be aware that these contacts fall under the scope of the Freedom of Information Act if, as he claims, this document or these documents were provided to Dr. Ó Tuathail as part of an agreed strategy or in the Tánaiste's then capacity as Taoiseach. Did the Tánaiste delete official records of this exchange?</p>

          <p eId="para_192">In my statement on Tuesday, I clearly and definitely accepted responsibility for this. I used the term "sole responsibility" and therefore I have not sought to blame anyone else. I have apologised for it, I have accounted for it and I have said that I accept responsibility for it. I have not been equivocal about that in any way.</p>
          <p eId="para_193"> I do not have a copy of the document that I sent to Dr. Ó Tuathail. I do not know how it is possible for the Deputy to make those comparisons because I do not have a copy of it. I am not sure how the Deputy can make that comparison with a document that we no longer have. Perhaps there was a version at some point in time that the Deputy is making the comparison from but it may not be the document that I sent to Dr. Ó Tuathail.</p>
          <p eId="para_194"> As I said in my statement on Tuesday, any changes that were made subsequently were minor. This was agreed on 3 April. As the Cabinet memorandum says on 9 April, engagement had concluded with the IMO, and it was publicly announced on 4 April and launched on 6 April. Any changes were so minor that they did not require a return to the Cabinet. They were of that nature. If they were of significance, they would have required a return to the Cabinet.</p>
          <p eId="para_195"> My contact with Dr. Ó Tuathail over the weekend related to the fact that Deputy Paul Murphy had claimed in a tweet that I shared the document on 2 April. I believed that to be untrue and I wanted to check with Dr. Ó Tuathail that it was not the case because the screen grab that was there said it was 17 April. That was closer to my recollection that I gave him the document in the days before that, and that was correct.</p>
          <p eId="para_196"> When I checked my WhatsApp messages, it was not there. I do not, as standard, keep all text messages. I have a personal email address. Anything on that which could constitute a public record I then forward to my official account but I do not, as standard, keep text messages.</p>

          <p eId="para_197">Somebody requesting a confidential document is an official request to the Taoiseach. The Tánaiste was the Taoiseach at the time. It falls under the Freedom of Information Act and it is very clear. There has been a judgment in relation to this in the past. Therefore, it is an official record.</p>
          <p eId="para_198"> There was not just one communication the Tánaiste had with Dr. Ó Tuathail in relation to this document. The Tánaiste had at least one more communication that we know of. Are both records deleted from the Tánaiste's phone? Were there other records in relation to seeking this document and the Tánaiste providing this confidential not-for-disclosure document to his friend? Were those records also deleted from the Tánaiste's phone? It is important that we know this.</p>
          <p eId="para_199"> We have requested that the documents - the one that the Tánaiste received from the Minister, Deputy Harris, as he claimed, early in April and the one that the Tánaiste asked of the Secretary General of the Department of Health on 10 April - would be published with all communication. Will the Tánaiste makes sure that happens straightaway so that everybody can scrutinise those documents because it is hard to follow some of this? The Cabinet agreed this on 9 April, but on 10 April the Tánaiste looked to the Secretary General for another copy. At 2 p.m. on 10 April, the Tánaiste looked for Dr. Ó Tuathail's address. Can the Tánaiste also talk to us about whether there was a second document, one that was stamped not "Confidential: Not for circulation" but "Working draft: Confidential"?</p>

          <p eId="para_200">I do not recall there being a second document. I only recall there being one document. As I have said, I do not, as standard, keep all of my text messages. I do not think most Members of this House do. Obviously, anything I consider to be a public record - for example, if somebody sends an email to my personal account, which happens from time to time - I forward to my official account, which is in line with the Department of the Taoiseach's policy on email.</p>

          <p eId="para_201">Before last week's recess, I raised my concerns with the Taoiseach in relation to putting in place a robust contact tracing system. We had seen a spectacular failure the previous weekend, when thousands of people who tested positive had to trace their own contracts. We cannot see a repeat of that. When I raised this at Leaders' Questions, I was told that there would be 90 people recruited each week and up to 800 overall would be recruited on the contact tracing side. We were looking for a gold standard in relation to this. It is absolutely vital. Can the Tánaiste give us an absolute commitment that this will be in place before the level 5 restrictions end?</p>
          <p eId="para_202">In addition to the testing and contact tracing we know we have to mitigate risks. Meat plants are a risk and work practices are part of that. What is happening in relation to that? Direct provision centres are a known risk and if there was a will, something could be done about that. Is there such a will?</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> International travel is a known risk. Dr. Holohan was before the transport committee this week and he said that movement of populations around areas with high incidences of the disease, particularly in Europe and North America, are not safe. He said the vast majority of countries are red and getting redder. We are due to adopt the EU traffic light system for international travel this Sunday. The Minister, Deputy Ryan, told us on 4 October that a senior cross-departmental group was working on a report and on a plan and that that report would be available on 10 November. Are the report and plan still due on that date?</p>

          <p eId="para_205">It is for testing at airports. The traffic light system requires a domestic approach to the wider European system. If we are going to open up on Sunday under this traffic light system, is that plan available now? How long will it take us to put that plan in place in a practical sense? The airline sector is very damaged and this sector is also vital for the connectivity of our country as an island nation. Some 400,000 Covid locator forms were submitted between 1 September and 30 October. That is a considerably reduced level of traffic movement but it is still a significant number of people. However, in the absence of testing at ports and airports, we are effectively taking a fingers-crossed approach. We need to know what is going to be put in place. We cannot come back in a number of weeks' time, having discovered that this is a known risk that we have not properly mitigated and that we have not put systems in place where we know a risk could be mitigated and we could reduce the problems. There are a number of questions there on the testing and tracing system and the mitigation of risks.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_111" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T12:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_206">On the meat plants, we very much acknowledge they are high risk environments. It is to do with the temperature, the airflow and so on and that is why there is a surveillance programme of testing in meat plants. Thankfully, the percentage of results coming back positive has so far been very small.</p>
          <p eId="para_207"> On international travel, I confess I am not across things as much in the past few days as I should be but this is an issue the Minister, Deputy Ryan, is leading on. I understand we are very much advising people that we are in a level 5 period. Under level 5 restrictions a person is not supposed to go more that 5 km from his or her home, except for work, education or compassionate reasons such as caring for a relative. That applies to international travel too, so if people are travelling internationally it should only be for work, education or a compassionate reason which may involve, for example, having to care for a relative.</p>
          <p eId="para_208"> We have adopted the European traffic light system whereby once a week the European Centre for Disease Control, ECDC, produces a green, red and orange map of all the different regions of Europe - it is done by region rather than country - and that determines the rules around foreign travel. We are in level 5 but there is no requirement to quarantine or test for travel into Ireland from a green area. As I understand it, people travelling from an amber area can avoid the 14-day restricted movements requirement if they have a prior negative polymerase chain reaction, PCR, test. People travelling from a red area must restrict their movements for at least five days and then have a negative PCR test at that point. The whole idea of bringing in testing related to travel from amber and red areas is to reduce the risk of the virus being reseeded into the country. That is going to be particularly important given that as we get the numbers down the risk of reseeding becomes higher and we want to avoid that.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> At the moment we are up to 120,000 tests per week. This compares very favourably with other countries. Of 23 western European countries, we rank eighth out of 23. We are ahead of places like Germany or New Zealand. We are behind Denmark, which is doing a lot more testing than we are but now has a higher incidence of the virus than we do. That indicates that it is not all about testing, although testing is extremely important.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> On contact tracing we are trying to ensure that is up to a higher level at the end of level 5. We are trying to use level 5 to put in place even more robust testing and contact tracing regimes than we had before. Testing is going extremely well. We have the capacity to test 120,000 per week. We are really trying to scale up the number of people working in the tracing centres. I am told there are 650 people working in the tracing centres at the moment, of whom 344 are new recruits. The rest are staff redeployed from other areas.</p>

          <p eId="para_211">That was an incredibly disappointing response. This is a known risk and it has been talked about for a considerable time. We cannot take the fingers-crossed approach to international travel. We saw one instance where 56 cases resulted from one case. We must put systems in place that are about more than having our fingers crossed. This system is to be introduced on Sunday. The Government must put systems in place domestically to match the traffic light system. We have not put those systems in place. We are just hoping people will comply rather than having a means to ensure they comply with those systems. We cannot switch our economy on and off with lockdowns in the way we are doing. If we are going to live with this virus, we absolutely need to put those systems in place where there are known risks. This is a known risk and Dr. Holohan pointed to it in recent days. We need to know what is planned and when it will be put in place. Will the gold standard be place with testing and contact tracing system before we end this lockdown?</p>

          <p eId="para_212">One of the issues we are going to have to consider is enforcement. As the Deputy knows, at the moment the requirement for a person to restrict his or her movements having come in from abroad is not mandatory. It is very highly advisory but not mandatory. Neither is it mandatory, however, for a person to restrict his or her movements if he or she is a close contact, which is a much higher risk than international travel. One thing we are giving consideration to as a Government is whether we need to make mandatory and make legally enforceable the requirement for a person to restrict his or her movements or self-isolate in certain circumstances. It would not make sense to apply that to international travel which is actually a lower risk than somebody who is positive not self-isolating or somebody who is a close contact not restricting his or her movements. We need to be proportionate in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> International travel is a risk but we also need to be realistic about that too. We are an island country but we are not an island state. We share a land border with Northern Ireland that is wide open. There is a relatively liberal regime in Northern Ireland for international travel. There are no restrictions on travel to Britain and a very extensive green list, much more extensive than ours. We do not detect an appetite from the Northern Ireland Executive to change that. We need to be very realistic about that. We could have very strict rules at our airports but they could be made a mockery of by virtue of the fact that we have open travel with Northern Ireland which obviously we are not going to restrict.</p>

          <p eId="para_214">I raise the adverse affect the coronavirus is having on people with various other illnesses or health issues in County Kerry and around the country. At present there are no orthopaedic procedures being carried out in Tralee General Hospital unless they are emergencies due to fractures or something very urgent. People are being told that routine procedures will take four to five years and it is two years for elective procedures. Sick people cannot visit GPs or GPs cannot visit them. Consultations are mostly by phone and this system does not help the confidence of patients in terms of recovery. There are bed reductions in our community hospitals. Killarney Community Hospital closed 15 beds. Perhaps consideration should be given to opening up the single beds in the Kenmare hospital which is a new hospital that does not have wards but single rooms. St. Columbanus Home, a public nursing home, is to close 27 beds.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">This is impacting badly on people in the Killarney catchment area. Patients in hospitals or homes cannot have visitors, which is very hard on elderly people. We should be able to facilitate one or two family members every four or five days. I know of a family who brought their father home because they could not bear the thought of not seeing him in Tralee general hospital. More likely than not, elderly sick people do not have time on their side. The primary medical certificates required by disabled people, children and the elderly, including people who have had strokes, to adapt their car or help them to buy a modified car are not being processed. Where are all the billions been given to the HSE? If the HSE allocation was doubled, I do not believe it would or could deliver a proper service.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> People in Kerry cannot get the flu vaccination. Doctors have only a small number of vaccines and have to decide who needs it most. People are ringing every day for more than a month and they cannot get the vaccine.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> Depression and suicides have increased because of the virus. It is very clear that even before the virus Kerry did not have adequate facilities to admit patients with mental health issues. Dr. Finnerty has said that patients who have repeated admissions because of a lack of adequate facilities have to be let out and brought back in again. She calls it the revolving door of admissions. I know of one person who has been waiting in constant pain since 1 March and had a pre-operative assessment on 12 August.</p>

          <p eId="para_224">The Deputy has raised a few important issues. With regard to the flu vaccine, there is very high demand for it at present, which is encouraging. People who did not seek the flu vaccination in previous years are seeking to be vaccinated this year and this is a real positive. Supply is short, not just in Ireland but internationally. There is more on the way. No matter what happens, we will vaccinate many more people against the flu this winter than we have in any winter in the past. Important progress is being made. We do need to prioritise and it is those who need it most who are being prioritised, including healthcare workers, older people and those with chronic conditions, and children between the ages of two and 12 years using the nasal spray to vaccinate them.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> With regard to suicide and deliberate self-harm, we recently had a discussion on the mental health impact of the pandemic and the lockdown at the Cabinet committee on social policy. The evidence and research we have so far does not show any increase in suicide or in deliberate self-harm during the pandemic period. Please God this will continue to be the case and will continue to be true. It is certainly the case that the pandemic and the lockdown are having an impact on people's mental health and we are seeing an increase in calls and inquiries to mental health services and resources are being increased precisely because of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> With regard to waiting lists, I totally appreciate what the Deputy has said, and far too many people are waiting for too long in Ireland for the operation or appointment they need. The health budget for 2021 is €4 billion higher than this year, which is an extraordinary increase in the budget. It is ten times the type of increase we might have seen in the past. Of this, €2 billion is for Covid and €2 billion is for non-Covid. I hope this will allow us to make real inroads into the waiting lists in 2021.</p>

          <p eId="para_227">The Tánaiste has spoken about health service workers. A young fellow told me that he is lame since February and was told today he will have to wait three years before he is seen to. The people of Kerry and Ireland want to know who is responsible for giving the order to specialists, consultants and hospitals to cancel or defer appointments and defer elective procedures. Is it the Government, the Minister for Health, NPHET or Dr. Tony Holohan? What will these specialists be doing in the meantime? People can die from other illnesses and diseases as well. Just because the coronavirus arrived does not mean people will not get other illnesses or suffer great pain and, indeed, die from other illnesses.</p>

          <p eId="para_230">We do recognise that and I know the chief medical officer recognises it also. One of the real concerns we have during the pandemic is what people call secondary deaths, for example, people who have a heart attack not going to the hospital because they think it is overwhelmed and they do not want to bother the doctors and nurses, and perhaps people who have stroke symptoms delaying seeking medical help because of the pandemic. This is a real worry we have, which is why we are sending out the message that everyone who needs medical attention should seek it. We have 800 more beds, including 400 acute and 400 subacute, than we had in March, and many fewer than this number of patients in hospital with Covid. If we look at the level of overcrowding and the number of trolleys, people on trolleys in our hospitals has not been lower since records began. We have capacity and we are saying to people that if they need medical help they should seek it. On occasion, hospitals do have to cancel operations and there may be various reasons in different cases why this is. It could be because of a lack of beds but it could also be for other reasons.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T12:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_231">Over the past ten years, the national broadband plan has been spoken about, and last year the Tánaiste and other Ministers signed the new contract, which is welcome. The questions with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, we were dealing with prior to Leaders' Questions were about broadband. Work on this has started in various parts of the country. Some people will say the main contractors got a heavy price or a good price, and it probably is, but I would always say that we need to get broadband in rural Ireland and that is the bottom line.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> Worryingly, over recent days in different parts of the country we have heard there have been stand-offs with the polers, who are the people who put up poles. Some of them are back on site again today. Ironically, the first thing that is done in going from pole to pole is to clip the top of hedgerows, the 6% of which we left out of our climate mitigation plans, to make sure the wire does not get cut. Unfortunately, 80% of the contractors throughout the country have pulled off site. They tell us the surveying has been done wrong and the way it has been added up is completely wrong compared with the other providers we have in the country, and we all know them. This is bread-and-butter stuff and there are already stand-offs. There are some parts of the country where a few contractors are working. Other than this, they have all pulled off site. If this has cropped up already, at the beginning of the roll-out of broadband, what measures has the Government put in place to make sure there is oversight of what is going on?</p>
          <p eId="para_233"> From what I can see, we seem to have a main contractor that does not seem to have a lot of gear or machinery and subcontracts it down, and then it is subcontracted down again and then subcontracted down again. Is there anything in place to make sure the ordinary contractors at the bottom of this ladder are protected and get the proper price for the work they are doing, or is this a big figure for broadband and screw everyone down along? What has the Government put in place to make sure these people are protected?</p>

          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T12:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_234">I thank the Deputy. I am genuinely not aware of the dispute with the polers that the Deputy has mentioned. I will see the Minister, Deputy Ryan, this afternoon and I will mention to him that it was raised in the Dáil and he might be able to inform me, or inform the Deputy directly, as to what is the difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">As the Deputy knows, the contract is given to National Broadband Ireland and it will employ and is employing subcontractors to do a lot of the work on the ground. There is an oversight mechanism in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications which is responsible for communications networks to make sure this is project managed, driven and delivered. We would expect that if the main contractor, NBI, is getting paid by the taxpayer, it should honour any agreements it has with subcontractors to make sure the money goes down the line. It should honour any contracts and commitments it makes with subcontractors, so we would expect that to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_236"> I think it is good that the national broadband plan is now a reality. I remember being in that school in Wicklow and being present for the signing of the contract and I remember somebody saying to me that despite all the controversy, I would never regret the day the contract was signed. I do not think we will regret it. I think it will come in cheaper than the price, by the way. It is the reverse of the children's hospital contract. It can go down and it cannot go up, so I think it will actually come in at a lower cost than the €3 billion which was quoted at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_237"> As the Deputy said, the work is now under way and it is going to connect 1 million people across rural Ireland to high-speed broadband and over 500,000 homes, farms and businesses. If the pandemic has taught us anything, it is how essential this service is because people living in rural Ireland, running a business, running a farm, trying to access education or attending college from home, need this service. It is as essential as electricity, water or landline phone lines in the old days. I think we made the right investment and it will pay off. </p>

          <p eId="para_238">I thank the Tánaiste. I fully agree. I am a supporter of broadband right around rural Ireland, especially with Covid, given the number of people who are able to work from home. The quicker we can roll it out, the better and if we could roll it out twice as fast I would be in full support of that. I want to be very clear on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_239"> The Tánaiste said it may go down in price and it is great if it does. The problem at the moment is that there are subcontractors who have basically gone away from it because they could not survive or make money on the rates they were being offered. The surveys done seem to be ludicrous compared to what has already been done with providers each year going back the years where broadband has already been done. There are standards that are needed. There is no point cutting something 3 inches below if we have to go at it again next year. Certain standards are needed to make sure that we only have to go along, say, every five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> The way this is starting at the moment, I worry about it. This is the beginning of it. Funnily enough, the hedge cutter that goes along is the beginning of putting up the wire that will bring this to every home in the country. If we cannot get that simple bit right, and if we have contractors who are walking off because of the prices involved, there is something seriously wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_241"> I will give the Tánaiste the information later. I ask him to talk to the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to make sure there is oversight for these people. They are entitled to make a living as well. </p>

          <p eId="para_245">I want to raise an issue but first let me make this point. It is not a joke. When somebody requests an official secret document from the Tánaiste and he decides to destroy or delete that record and not pass it on to his Department, it is not a joke. I just want to make that point. It is not finished yet. We need those records released: the contract the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, gave the Tánaiste, the contract he got from the Secretary General and all communication. It should be done at this stage. We have been requesting it for the last 48 hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_246"> We have been contacted by numerous people who have lost their jobs and have been denied the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, by the Department because the Department has no record of their PRSI contributions. These are people who previously lost their jobs during the first lockdown and were in receipt of PUP. Deputy Claire Kerrane has been informed that over 4,000 applicants were denied on this basis last week alone. I am aware of people who lost their jobs as a result of Covid public health restrictions almost a month ago whose cases were only resolved this week and after a month they only got one week's payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_247"> I am asking for three things: to establish the number of applicants who were denied PUP due to this issue, to conduct an urgent review of all these cases and ensure they get their payments quickly and then to publish guidelines to employees, employers and departmental staff so there is clarity in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_250">We are now going into our third week in level 5 and many people are trying to plan for the unique period around Christmas, which is not something we have experienced before. While the R level is coming down and the numbers are changing, I do not expect the Tánaiste to be in a position today to be able to advise businesses, workers or families as regards what we will be able to do on 1 December when level 5 ends. At this juncture, can he give us an indication on what date the Government will be in a position to give us that indication? It would be very helpful for businesses, workers and families.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> Let us be realistic. People who are living in Dublin who have family down the country, possibly fathers or mothers who are living on their own, will travel for Christmas.

          <p eId="para_253">I thank the Deputy. On the second point, HIQA has done a health technology assessment on rapid testing, which the Deputy may have seen. It was not as positive or favourable as I might have hoped it would be. There are definitely pros and cons to rapid testing and NPHET is very much working on that at the moment. I cannot say it will be ready by 1 December and that is probably unlikely, but it is being worked on.</p>
          <p eId="para_254"> In regard to the first question, things are going very well. The number of new cases is falling faster than we thought it would, and the positivity rate is falling faster than we thought it would and it was down to something over 3% the other day, which was really encouraging. What we are saying very definitely is that level 5 is for six weeks. We want to get the number of cases down as low as possible before easing restrictions. We do not have a decision date yet to tell people what we move to on 1 December. I take the Deputy’s point that businesses need to prepare and families need to be prepared and they will need a few days’ notice, but we have no date as yet. </p>

          <p eId="para_255">In accordance with the Equal Status Act, all children should have equal access to courses and facilities in schools where they are available to others. There are approximately 500 teenagers and children across the country who themselves are healthy but who live with medically very high-risk, VHR, parents or siblings. These VHR forgotten families have been lobbying the Minister, Deputy Norma Foley's Department, looking for that equal access to remote learning for their children. Many children do not want to go to school because they are afraid their sibling or their parent might get very sick with Covid if they bring it home, yet they are being denied remote learning.</p>
          <p eId="para_256"> Can we get this sorted out? It is a case of equality. We are talking about 500 children and, as I said, they are scared to go to school. According to the Department guidelines, they themselves do not have to self-isolate, they have not tested positive for Covid and they do not have serious underlying conditions, but they live with those who do.

          <p eId="para_259">There has been a 33% increase in the reports of thefts of pets to An Garda Síochána this year. Under the current law, pets are considered property and they are treated in the same way as someone stealing a mobile phone. We all know that pets are much more than property. They are very much part of the family in homes throughout this country. They are sometimes the only friend for someone who is isolated and a guide for someone who is blind or has sensory issues. This needs to be clearly reflected in much stronger legislation, especially with the increased demand in the run-in to this Christmas, in particular. The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences)(Amendment) Bill is going through the Seanad at the moment, and I ask the Government to table an instruction to committee motion under Standing Order 187 to allow the laws of this country to act as a real deterrent against this growing crime and make it clear that we will act to ensure significant penalties are put in place for people who attempt to resell pets or to exploit a vulnerable owner who offers a reward for the return of their pet.</p>

It is appalling to see an increase in this crime of people stealing pets off other people, often older and vulnerable people. I do not have a pet but I know many people who do and I do not think anybody regards their cat or their dog to be property in the way they would a mobile phone or something like that. It is almost like a member of the family being stolen. It is a serious offence and needs to be treated that way. I will speak to the Minister for Justice about it and see if we can strengthen laws in those areas.</p>

          <p eId="para_261">I have written to the Taoiseach and Deputy Michael Collins and I raised the issue of people not being allowed to attend mass. There is a limit of 25 for a wedding or a funeral and nobody can go to the church for mass. There is a penal provision in the new Act to prosecute priests. This is the month of November, traditionally a time of the year in the Catholic faith where people pray for their dead and have masses. All other denominations are denied their right to worship as well. Will the Tánaiste please look at the regulations in view of the mental and physical health of people?</p>
          <p eId="para_262"> People need to be able to go to church. For elderly people, especially, it is their only outing. They love it and they can meet their friends. I do not know whether they can walk in and say a prayer but they cannot have a physical celebration of mass. The archbishops met the Taoiseach but it is falling on deaf ears. Will the Tánaiste please reconsider allowing people attend mass? Most churches are as big as this Chamber. Some of them are huge and there is good ventilation. Churches have made huge provisions for dealing with Covid, which have cost them a lot of money and for which they have got no support. People need to be allowed back to worship in all faiths, but I am talking today about the Catholic Church, especially in the month of November.</p>

We are reluctant to change any of the regulations at the moment. I understand the point the Deputy is making about people being able to attend mass. In most countries it is allowed, for obvious reasons. It is allowed north of the Border but nearly every day there is one group or another making a good case as to why the rules should be relaxed, whether it is hunting, coursing, tennis, golf, gyms or children's clothes. We feel that if we start relaxing regulations on a piecemeal basis at the moment, that will undermine what we are trying to achieve and we do not want to do that, certainly at this stage. Level 5 is for six weeks. We made provision to allow people to visit graves. It is November, many people want to visit graves, and that is permitted, even if it is beyond 5 km.</p>

However, these people are left in a situation where they need to have a plan in place for recruiting new people. They are afraid to take people on because they do not know what will happen for Christmas. I know it is difficult for the Tánaiste to look into the future, but when will there be guidance for the likes of the hospitality sector? Will it be next week or the week after? When will there be guidance on what is going to happen for Christmas and what level they will be at? My understanding of level 3 for the likes of the hotel sector is that it is hardly worth their while opening for Christmas. That is what they are saying.

This virus can change very quickly. We have seen in the course of a few days or a week the numbers increasing dramatically, and as the CMO explained at the committee the other day, it is just too far away from Christmas or from 1 December for us to be able to give a reliable indication as to what level of restrictions there will be from 1 December. The only thing worse than giving people information is to give misinformation, and if we gave people an indication now as to where we thought we might be on 1 December, there is a good chance that in two or three weeks we might have to turn around and say we cannot do that. When we do give that indication, we want it be one we can stand over, and that is probably going to be nearer to the end of November, unfortunately.</p>

Pieta House was awarded millions in funding this year after it found itself in financial difficulties, with threats of redundancies hanging over staff. It has been brought to my attention by concerned members of the public that the Fine Gael Leader of the Seanad, Senator Regina Doherty, is now a board member of Pieta House. Senator Doherty, according to Pieta’s website, is also a former member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform. The website states that this will provide Pieta House with insights that will be valuable assets to the organisation. Does the Tánaiste believe that the Senator’s membership of a board that receives vast amounts of public funding is a conflict of interest? Is this a paid position? Was the Tánaiste aware of this?</p>

I was not aware of that, but Pieta House is a mental health charity that provides excellent services and help for people who need help around mental health and suicide, in particular. As a Senator, Senator Doherty has no role in deciding what funding a charity receives. She is not a Minister and does not hold executive office. I do not think there is a conflict of interest there but perhaps the Deputy will say otherwise. I am not on any boards but I imagine there are many Deputies and Senators who are on boards and I do not think that in itself is a conflict of interest.</p>

          <p eId="para_268">I was contacted this week by the family of a 93-year-old woman who is living alone in a house which is extremely damp and necessitates keeping the heating on constantly. She applied to the better energy warmer homes scheme but she was refused because she had the attic in her house insulated about 20 years ago. This is a very good scheme which aims to improve the energy efficiency and warmth of homes for pensioners and those on lower incomes, and it is also beneficial for the environment. However, it should be on a needs basis and someone should not be refused based on the fact that they applied for a grant and got some work done years ago. If the house is damp and needs work now, that should be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_269"> This is compounded by the fact that fuel costs have risen due to the increase in carbon tax, which is penalising people who have no alternative. There is also a waiting list of 7,300, which equates to about two and a half years of a waiting list, going by the current work rate. The Government announced millions in the budget towards retrofitting and that is welcome, but it is no good if the work is not being done on the ground. Can this be addressed so that work is done as a matter of urgency and that second applications are considered?</p>

          <p eId="para_270">This is really a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who administers that scheme through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI. As is always the case with a grant scheme, there is a budget limit. There is no grant scheme that I am aware of where money is not limited. There has to be a limit on the budget and, therefore, there have to be some rules.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">Those rules might be around a needs test or means test, or they might state that somebody who has already received a grant should not be given priority over somebody who has not yet received one. We need to be realistic about what is possible in that regard. I will take it up with the Minister.</p>

The Government's solution was this increased leave. Any leave is welcome but there is little detail about when parents can actually take it. I understand that legislation is required. Can it be brought forward this year, given the difficulties faced by parents in accessing childcare and needing to return to work? Can the relevant Department publish information in the meantime to allow parents to plan for what this three weeks' additional leave means?</p>

As the Tánaiste is aware, the Debenhams workers have been protesting for 211 days because of their unfair treatment by Debenhams Ireland and KPMG, and a lack of action by this Government. Those workers are only looking for a fair and just redundancy. We are now in the middle of a second lockdown but those workers are still on picket lines in the rain and freezing cold. Is the removal of the stock from the store by KPMG considered an essential service? Can it take place during a level 5 lockdown?</p>

As has been reported, efforts were made last week to resolve this dispute. The Workplace Relations Commission, which is an office of my Department, hosted talks involving the trade union, Mandate, and the liquidator, KPMG. Unfortunately, those talks did not come to a successful conclusion but we will continue to try to broker an outcome or compromise, if we can. We all know the fundamental problem is that Debenhams Ireland is gone, went bust, and has many more debts and liabilities than it has assets. For that reason, the money is not going to be there to give everyone what they deserve or should get. That also includes the taxpayer.</p>

          <p eId="para_282">I will ask about FreeStyle Libre. There are 20,000 people in Ireland living with type 1 diabetes. They have been calling on the Department of Health and HSE for years now to reimburse people who wish to use a FreeStyle Libre device to best manage their condition. The device consists of small, round sensor that is worn on the back of the upper arm. A handheld reader or application on a smart phone can be used to scan the small sensor. This will provide the individual with an immediate reading of their glucose levels. It takes less than one second to do and there is no need to draw blood. It is faster and far more practical. This device has been described as a life-changer by those who use it. The starter kits cost €170 and the sensor costs €120 per month. It does not cost any more than the finger-prick kits that the HSE already covers. At the moment, only people under 21 with type 1 diabetes can get these costs covered by the HSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_283"> Ireland is the only country in the world that limits those who can access this life-changing device based on age. I ask the Government and HSE to review that.</p>

I am glad that it is available for people under the age of 21. I do not know why it is not available to people over 21. Perhaps there is a reason for that. The Deputy is suggesting it is not a financial reason because the cost is much the same. It is something that I hope can be done but I do not know the reasoning behind it.

Over the past few years, there has been much posturing from Deputies and the HSE which has led to confusion and anger in Roscrea. I am calling on the Minister to clarify the long-term plans for the staff and patients at the nursing home. This is a major issue for people and they claim that there seems to be no plan for the future of the patients of the home. Indeed, two members of the present Government parties, while visiting the home last year, described it as a lovely caring environment where the residents are surrounded by family who can visit them with ease because the facility is in their time. Those were the comments of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath.</p>

          <p eId="para_295">I raise the issue of the dental treatment services scheme. We have heard from the Irish Dental Association this week that 260 dentists, that is, private practitioners, have disengaged from the service where people with medical cards can get dental care. It seems that it is now the case that 200,000 medical card holders will have difficulties or will not be able to receive timely care. My fear is that this will put additional pressure on the HSE's own services. We need a short-term solution as quickly as possible. I have also had people speak to me who operate in a residential care setting which deals with people with disabilities who are also impacted by this. We need a short-term solution and a wider solution for dental care across the board.</p>

          <p eId="para_297">I thank the Ceann Comhairle. The Tánaiste will probably know that the Central Bank reported this week on motor insurance. It gives us a welcome transparency on this sector. For standard injury cases, it shows that the cost of litigation is ten times the cost of going through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, yet we see litigation on the increase and the PIAB losing a share of those injury cases. It also shows that even though three quarters of the cases over €40,000 are going for litigation, litigation actually does not deliver for the claimant any more than going through the PIAB. A big amount of money is going into the legal pot. Are there ways that we can drive up the numbers going through the PIAB which will bring down premiums and give a better deal to people who make claims?</p>

          <p eId="para_298">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and, as he may know, I am head of the ministerial committee on insurance that is trying to deal with some of these issues. The report from the Central Bank that came out this week is very welcome and is helping to give us more transparency about the pricing of insurance. It is a matter of concern that the cost of claims has not gone up as much as premiums. Claims have gone up but premiums have gone up by more.</p>
          <p eId="para_299"> There is also the issue that the Deputy has identified where more and more people are not settling at the PIAB but are going to court, which is resulting in higher legal costs but not higher awards. The Minister of State, Deputy Troy, who is in my Department, has responsibility for the PIAB, and as part of our reform programme, we are considering mechanisms to strengthen the PIAB and make it the place where more people settle their claims.</p>

          <p eId="para_302">I want to discuss a measure that shows the Government was unfair and underhanded in the 2021 budget and that has been enacted in legislation. Everyone knows that Sinn Féin opposed carbon tax. We believe that climate change can only be addressed by holding big business to account. I am not sure whether someone from Fine Gael is now in charge of the lobbying for big business and corporations but whoever is in charge they are doing a very good job with this.</p>
          <p eId="para_303"> In 2009, the Institute of Public Health in Ireland found a direct association between fuel poverty and poor health. People living in fuel poverty have greater healthcare needs. They cannot afford to keep their homes warm and they suffer because of that. They suffer in the short term but also in the long term.</p>
          <p eId="para_304"> In 2019, the EU SILC, statistics on income and living conditions, analysis showed that almost 400,000 people in Ireland suffer or experience fuel deprivation. Shockingly, we are among the top five countries for energy price hikes. How can the Government justify adding to that fuel poverty? Instead of sneaking in carbon taxes that will increase every year for the next ten years, this Government should focus on bringing forward Sinn Féin's legislation that would ban winter disconnections.</p>
          <p eId="para_305"> I have already made my feelings on carbon tax known. The carbon tax increases are harmful, nasty and most unfair on those who cannot afford to pay them. Children will suffer the most from fuel poverty. That is according to the ESRI's own statistics. Children who are already suffering will suffer more and that is a direct result of a decision taken by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party.</p>
          <p eId="para_306"> We can talk all we want about climate change and the need for action but that does not need to be action directed at ordinary people who are struggling to survive. This Government is so out of touch with ordinary workers and families that it cannot even imagine how harmful this policy is for people. It would do the Government good to take a minute to listen to ordinary people, step away from cronyism and big business and look at the impact of its decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_307"> On 25 March, I raised the issue of student nurses not getting paid even though they were working on the front line. At the time, they had lost their part-time jobs, which we know students need to pay their way through college, but because they were front-line workers they could not work. The then Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, announced that student nurses would get paid and I, along with the student nurses, believed that the matter had been resolved. It turns out now, however, that it has not been resolved and, once again, student nurses are being exploited. The hypocrisy shown by this Government is a disgrace. It is protecting banks, vulture funds and large corporations but there is no protection for student nurses working on the front line in our healthcare service.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">The scheme established to ensure student nurses would be paid as healthcare assistants recognised they were expected to work as full-time workers, but now it has been disbanded. Where is the recognition? I ask that student nurses be paid directly because they are doing vital work.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jim O'Callaghan<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_309">I am sharing time with Deputies Carey, Christopher O'Sullivan and Richmond.</p>
          <p eId="para_310"> I want to address four issues related to the Finance Bill and the budget. The first concerns youth unemployment. The biggest threat to this country's economy in the short and long terms is long-term youth unemployment. We are aware from other economies, our history and the history of other countries that it can destroy not only an economy but also a society. I welcome the fact that the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, has been reintroduced at the high level to ensure anyone who has lost a job recently may benefit from it. The Government needs to be commended on the employment wage subsidy scheme. It is an important piece of our armoury to protect young people who are in various vulnerable jobs but who can be protected by the State's stronger financial arm to ensure their jobs persist. We need to ensure this continues to operate for as long as we are introducing restrictions. The Government, however, needs to consider whether companies in receipt of the payment under the scheme are at the same time paying out dividends to their shareholders. This would be against the spirit of the scheme. I raised this with the Minister for Finance in a parliamentary question but I did not get a full answer.</p>
          <p eId="para_311"> A second issue we need to discuss and keep a close eye on is the continuing role of foreign direct investment, FDI, in Ireland and its importance to our economy. We can see that as a result of the downturn because of the pandemic and the associated restrictions, the domestic economy has suffered significantly. What is noticeable, however, is that the multinational sector, the FDI part of Ireland's economy, has continued to operate very well. We see this in the fact that the revenues coming from the FDI companies are continuing. This underlines the importance of the sector to our economy. The Government should be aware of it. We have to be careful to ensure we protect that aspect of our economy. In that regard, it is noticeable that in the budget, an immediate change was introduced to the capital allowances regime under section 291A of the Taxes Consolidation Act. Irrespective of the merits of that change, we have to be careful about introducing changes that affect FDI investment that are immediate or unannounced. There should be greater engagement with the sector to ensure we can retain the large amount of Exchequer revenue that comes from it, which supports the Irish economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_312"> The third point I want to make concerns the employment investment incentive scheme. A strange feature of it is that investors in a qualifying company can get 40% tax relief provided they are not a connected party. The effect is that tax relief is available to those with surplus income in respect of such investment but not available to a person who has developed a small business and wants to develop it further by investing his earned income in it. The scheme should be amended to ensure small businesses can secure investment from those most interested in developing. Why not encourage someone who has invested in a small business to develop it further? The Government should look into this in respect of the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_313"> The fourth and final matter to which I want to refer concerns the help-to-buy scheme. We need to recognise that for people earning €40,000 per year or less, it is still very difficult to avail of the scheme because of the requirement to get a mortgage. We need to recognise that we should not have circumstances in which purchasing accommodation is beyond the means of those earning a standard or average wage of €40,000, or, rather, a low wage, because that is what it is. We need to examine the scheme to ensure house ownership is available to persons at the lower end of the income ladder and to ensure our economy can progress by having people operating within it who have the stability and security of a home that they know they will own owing to their hard work and investment.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeCarey" eId="spk_175">
          <from>Deputy Joe Carey<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_314">I support the Finance Bill. Budget 2021 is designed to protect the lives and livelihoods of our people and to help the most vulnerable in these uncertain times by investing now in public services and infrastructure for the future well-being of our country. In my limited time, I will focus on a number of areas, including Shannon Airport, tourism and the opportunities presented through remote working.</p>
          <p eId="para_315"> The €10 million package to assist Cork and Shannon airports is a welcome aspect of the budget. When the €5 million earmarked for Shannon is coupled with the €6.1 million allocated earlier this year, it amounts to €11.1 million for capital investment in the airport, which would otherwise have to be covered using Shannon Group's own resources. We need to build on that progress by ensuring the Government now takes vital steps to include Shannon in the regional airports programme, thus providing operational and capital funding to the key economic driver in the mid-west region. Without the vital global connectivity delivered through Shannon, many of the FDI companies in the mid-west simply would not have located in the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_316"> Last year, I visited Jaguar Land Rover with the then Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe. The facility does cutting-edge research on driverless and electric vehicles. It is located in the Shannon industrial zone. It is just one of many leading companies located in Shannon. There are 10,000 people employed in the industrial estate and 80 aviation companies located there. There are also aircraft leasing, maintenance, repair and overhaul companies in Shannon. It is my strong belief that the Government needs to step in to provide supports directly to airlines to ensure that strategic routes, such as those to Heathrow, New York and Boston, are underpinned by Government support to provide vital global connectivity. A key principle in the forthcoming national economic plan must be to realise the potential of all our island. Due recognition must be given to the mid-west region and Shannon Airport as a catalyst for economic development. With Brexit looming, there is an added need to provide the financial supports necessary for both capital and operational expenditure, along with the finances necessary to facilitate the reintroduction of the strategic routes I have mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_317"> The tourism sector has suffered greatly as a result of the pandemic. Prior to the outbreak of Covid-19, tourism across County Clare supported 12,000 jobs and generated €266 million in revenue annually for the local economy. I welcomed the reduction in the VAT rate and the extension of the rates waiver scheme. As part of the recovery strategy after the last recession, the Government introduced several innovative schemes and ideas, including the Wild Atlantic Way and the Gathering. We need new ideas of this kind. I call on the Government to organise a new-ideas forum in that regard. It might be possible to have transition year students come up with suggestions through Fáilte Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_318"> Remote working is the new norm. The nature of office-based work has changed dramatically during the course of the pandemic. With that in mind, I believe we need to encourage businesses and employees with tax incentives, allowances and grants. We also need to accelerate urgently the national broadband plan while creating a necklace of community digital hubs to allow people easy access to the digital world, thereby breathing life back into rural towns and villages. I acknowledge the funding provided in budget 2021 to start this process. I also welcome the progress on formulating a national remote-working policy, for which I pushed in my time as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Rural and Community Development.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">If we as a nation were to embrace remote working in a co-ordinated way, it would have many positive aspects. It would lead to a better work-life balance, cut out the need to commute, which would be good for the environment, and free up our time so that we could spend it with our families and give back to our communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_320"> I look forward to the Minister of State's response to my proposals.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ChristopherOsullivan" eId="spk_176">
          <from>Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_321">I welcome the Bill and congratulate the two Ministers on the monumental and significant budget 2021. The Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, played his part as well and I thank him for attending. That said, I wish to discuss elements of the Bill and the budget that need tweaking.</p>
          <p eId="para_322"> The Bill will legislate for the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS. A brilliant scheme, it has already been broadly welcomed by businesses. It will provide a business with up to as much as €5,000 per week. However, be it the restart scheme, the restart plus scheme or the CRSS, the same businesses are falling through the cracks.</p>
          <p eId="para_323"> I wish to speak on behalf of sound engineers and lighting engineers. They constitute one of the business sectors most impacted by the restrictions. I have spoken to industry representatives. These engineers are struggling and many are fearful that they will not see past the lockdown and the end of this recession. To qualify for the CRSS, a person has to have a fixed premises. As can be imagined, not all sound and lighting engineers have such. Some have an element of warehousing and pay rates on it, but that is not considered a premises under the scheme. This needs to be fixed. These are the people who are involved in many of our favourite productions nationally, be they festivals, television productions or so on. We will need sound and lighting engineers after the pandemic.</p>
          <p eId="para_324"> We need to expedite payments under the CRSS. My understanding is that it will be the end of November before the first payments are made, but they need to happen earlier because businesses are screaming out for that funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_325"> The VAT reduction has been broadly welcomed by the tourism industry. Along with other measures taken in respect of tourism, it is a major step. However, it will only be effective for businesses that are in a position to reopen and trade. Although all of this is pending figures, it is important that we prepare now for the end of level 5 restrictions. Thankfully, the figures are going the right way and the R number is reducing, so we must prepare for level 3 restrictions come the start of December. We cannot permit a situation where restaurants and pubs that serve food will have to rely solely on outdoor dining. It would not be practical in the middle of winter. It would not be an option. I ask that the Minister of State bring the message to the Cabinet that we should consider how to tweak the level 3 restrictions to allow some element of indoor dining, perhaps with a few extra measures in place. It will be vital if the hospitality sector is to avail of the VAT reduction.</p>
          <p eId="para_326"> I wish to make a case for the funding of voluntary organisations. The Irish Red Cross is one of the most important such organisations. In my home town of Clonakilty, the Irish Red Cross is on standby at every festival, event, parade and race meeting. It provides a vital service, but it relies heavily on the fees it is paid for those events. With the events not happening, the income of our local Irish Red Cross has been decimated. We need to step in and bail out the Irish Red Cross. In my town, it might have to vacate its premises because of funding issues. It also has to maintain vehicles. An intervention is necessary so that the likes of the Irish Red Cross in Clonakilty can survive and see out the pandemic.</p>
          <p eId="para_327"> The best way for the carbon tax to lessen the impact on those with lower incomes is through social welfare, as is being done in the budget, but also through the warmer homes scheme. There are still considerable delays in rolling it out and allowing people to access its financing. We need to sort that out straight away.</p>
          <p eId="para_328"> I thank the Government for introducing this Bill.</p>

          <from>Deputy Neale Richmond<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_329">It is difficult in five minutes to give a frank overview of the Bill, but like other Deputies, I will try to adapt one or two important points. I appreciate the Minister of State taking the time to take the Bill through the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_330"> I welcome the Bill and the budget, which have clearly been crafted to face the two most difficult threats faced by our nation and economy now and possibly in our history, namely, Covid-19, a pandemic the likes of which has not been seen in a century, and the sometimes forgotten or occasionally remembered threat of Brexit. The negotiations are ongoing and we are still unclear on whether there will be a deal. There is no such thing as a good Brexit. Anyone with half an economic sense in his or her body would know that Brexit was a terrible idea, not just for the UK, but also for those around the UK, like us. That is why the €3.4 billion Brexit and Covid recovery fund included in budget 2021 and the specific €100 million allocation for businesses to prepare for Brexit are so important.</p>
          <p eId="para_331"> Many people are understandably worried about these twin threats. Thankfully, budget 2021 includes no income tax increases. This is very important, as is the increase in the USC thresholds contained in section 2. We should be cognisant that we cannot tax our way out of economic difficulty. Putting additional strains on households through income tax increases would not be appropriate during what is a difficult time for many. Permitting people to retain more of their incomes, thereby allowing them to inject those funds back into the local economy and support small businesses, will help to see our communities and businesses through Brexit and Covid-19. Therefore, I welcome the specific sectoral measures in the budget that will allow our businesses to get through these challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_332"> Like Deputy O'Callaghan, I welcome the new CRSS for businesses whose premises are affected by restrictions and that have experienced significant reductions in their turnovers. It is right that the Government has included in the scheme businesses that are still trading at less than 25% of their previous turnovers, allowing restaurants and cafés that have switched to takeaway services to participate. It is good to see that more than 1,000 businesses have already registered with Revenue for the CRSS. I urge businesses, particularly those in my constituency of Dublin Rathdown, that have been impacted by the restrictions to seek out these supports to see them through this difficult time.</p>
          <p eId="para_333"> I welcome the targeted approach to supporting sectors that the Government has adopted throughout the pandemic, in particular in this budget. I strongly welcome the return of the 9% VAT rate, which is allowed for in section 37 of the Bill. The estimated €401 million cost of the reduction will be vital to many businesses that have been badly impacted by the pandemic, be they restaurants, hairdressers or cinemas. Whether they pass the reduction on to their customers or retain it in-house is up to them. It is understandable if they are not in a position to pass it on, given how important it is that they be able to reopen when the restrictions are lifted.</p>
          <p eId="para_334"> I welcome the contents of the Bill, which rightly address the many difficult challenges facing our country. The Bill and the budget to which it largely gives effect have been crafted in the most difficult circumstances, unimaginable to many a year ago. As a country, an economy and, most importantly, a people, we face the twin threats of Covid-19 and Brexit as best prepared as possible thanks to this Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_336">I welcome the Bill and its many measures. The Finance Bill gives us an annual opportunity to reflect on the budget and the measures contained therein, but also on issues that we need to consider.</p>
          <p eId="para_337"> This is my first time to speak in the Chamber with the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, present in his new role.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">I congratulate him on his position and wish him well. I listened intently to his passionate discussion on the issue of insurance. I know he will make a major impact on that area and I wish him well on that. There are many issues and challenges in that area. The credit unions are also under his remit. How the credit unions go forward, how they will trade and the many issues facing the credit union movement will have to be monitored. The credit union movement has been a bedrock for people in society, including the less-well-off, over the years and since the foundation of the movement by Nora Herlihy from Ballydesmond. We are all proud of that and of how she started the credit union movement. I wish the Minister of State well in his role. I know that he will bring his years of valuable experience in finance and from being in Leinster House to bear on the portfolio.</p>
          <p eId="para_339"> There are several things I wish to clarify or ensure are clarified in the Finance Bill. These include the new incentives for first-time buyers and those that were to come to a conclusion at the end of 2020 and are being rolled over. It was decided earlier in the year that the first-time buyer's grant would be rolled over to 2021. The Finance Bill has to be passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas and has to be signed into law before the Revenue systems are in place to ensure people can avail of it throughout 2021. It is important that clear guidance is given by the Minister or the Government representative in the wrap-up to the effect that this measure will be available throughout 2021 even if people have no portion of the mortgage drawn down in 2020. It is important to ensure that.</p>
          <p eId="para_340"> Several measures are rolled over in agriculture, including the consanguinity relief and other measures that continue the 1% allocation. These are important measures. When a farm or business is being transferred from one generation to another there is considerable activity prior to the budget. Will the stamp duty changes remain? Will the stamp duty changes be carried over for several years? Invariably, in the years I have been here, the changes have always been carried over. It is important to have clear guidance. Farm families are making decisions about transferring to the next generation. Clear guidance should be given to ensure these measures will be continued in future. All parties, but especially our party, are engaged in trying to ensure the viability of the family farm and that the family farm survives. It is the bedrock of the agriculture industry and the rural economy. It supports many jobs not only at the farm gate but throughout the agriculture and food industries. It also allows us to be absolutely confident that the food we are eating is produced to the highest level and to the proper regulations. It is important to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_341"> There are challenges in the agriculture industry, in particular in respect of the beef industry. I note in the budget there is a pilot scheme to look at calf to beef and the beef coming off the dairy industry. We should look at that. I have reflected on the farm-to-fork projects of the European Commission and the recent document that came out from Teagasc on the challenges facing the industry, not only in biodiversity but in respect of antibiotics and antimicrobial traces as well. There are many issues in these areas. The farmer - the person producing the food - has been engaging singularly with the vast body of science that is developing to ensure we have a proper food industry. We need to encourage Teagasc and the private advisers who are doing such an excellent job in encouraging, advising and directing the primary practitioners in farming to work in a safe environmentally friendly manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_342"> There are several other issues. In the budget it was welcome that the disability sector got €100 million. There is not one person in this House or outside it who would not accept that the entire disability sector is in crisis. The challenges that have presented heretofore have been reflected on. Anyone listening to the Order of Business not only since this Dáil was formed but during the past 12 months will be aware of the issues of respite and the challenges in the disability sector. It is in poor shape. Many challenges face us in the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_343"> I am delighted to be Chairman of the relevant committee and I will work hard with the committee members. We have had several meetings. I am positively enthused by the passion and commitment of the members of the committee. I believe we will be able to shine a light on the challenges. Moreover, I believe the additional €20 million announced last week for the disability sector is most welcome. We must accept that there are major challenges in the sector relating to work practices and we need to ensure the right outcomes. I have been saying this in the Chamber and elsewhere for some time that I believe that what has been happening in the disability sector will mean that a future Taoiseach will have to apologise for the way the sector has been treated.</p>
          <p eId="para_344"> I calmly listened to the radio on Saturday or Sunday morning. I do not get too involved in it but I was absolutely frustrated last Sunday morning when I heard Miriam O'Callaghan interviewing the former Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Katherine Zappone. She talked about writing a book on her time in government. Was she elected to the Government to make things better for the people and children or was she elected to write a book? Over four years the services for children and people with disabilities went backwards and nothing was achieved. I was absolutely fuming at the radio when I was listening to it. Another book is coming out of it. We are here at this point. We are elected to do the best we can for the people we represent in the time we are in Leinster House or in any other elected position. It is sickening in the extreme to listen to people commentating and going on. They are there to make a difference but to my mind that particular Minister did nothing to advance the causes of children or people with disabilities or anything else under her remit. I have to say that.</p>
          <p eId="para_345"> I also want to bring up several issues that have been discussed. Primary medical certificates have been stopped completely since the court case earlier this year. That is completely unacceptable. Many people, including many public representatives across the floor of the House, are unable to get a decision on primary certificates. I want all the Ministers involved in this to bring clear guidance. It is in need of overhaul. This is not the first time I have said as much. It needs to be practical and tailored towards the needs of people. I call on the Government to look at this as quickly as possible to ensure we have the right outcomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_346"> Since the pandemic struck eight months ago we have seen the way life changed for people. People are working from home and things have changed far beyond what the political system could even possibly have contemplated in that period. It is time to revisit a serious decentralisation of Departments out of Dublin. Any such changes that were put in place in the past 20 or 25 years worked well. We all know that when we are interacting with Departments outside Dublin, they are excellent. I am not saying those in Dublin are not excellent, but it does work. It can work now more than ever. The Government needs to look at a vast programme of decentralisation to ensure vibrancy in rural communities. It is time that we looked at the post office network in terms of digital hubs and a new vibrancy in the rural towns and villages with all the Departments.</p>

          <from>Deputy Fergus O'Dowd<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T13:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_347">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit go dtí an díospóireacht seo. Ní raibh go leor ama againn, i ndáiríre, nuair a bhí an buiséad ann chun labhairt faoi. Tugadh dhá nóiméad domsa ar 9 p.m. oíche Dhéardaoin. Tá sé an-sásúil, má tá an t-am againn, go bhfuil an deis ag gnáth Bhaill na Dála labhairt ar feadh deich nóiméad, más mian leo, ar rudaí tábhachtacha cosúil leis an mbuiséad agus leis an mBille seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_348"> This is a very important debate. The Bill gives effect to the budget, which governs how the State will be financed and run, as far as taxation and supports for communities and businesses are concerned, for the next 12 months. What is particularly important at this time in the Bill is the recognition that Covid is dominant in the thinking of the Government and the Opposition, and indeed right throughout the world, and that it has had a hugely complex impact on all aspects of our society. It is, unfortunately, responsible for us all being this very day on level 5 in Ireland, with tens of thousands of people unable to work and businesses in a very difficult trading position, some of them facing actions from banks, creditors and so on. Therefore, the supports in the Bill and the budget for businesses are hugely important.</p>
          <p eId="para_349"> In particular, the Covid restriction subsidy scheme is a lifesaver for many businesses. It is not the be-all and end-all but it means something to the businesses that have been significantly and adversely impacted in terms of the volume of business they have been able to carry out. Initially, in the budget, the threshold was at least 80%. I welcome the threshold now being reduced in the Bill to 75%. It will really support more businesses. It is hugely important that the enterprise culture in this country is supported fully. Over the years there has been a much greater recognition of the risk people take on in setting up their businesses. It is important that when we reach a huge national and international crisis such as Covid, the supports are definitely there. I am aware of many businesses in my town that have applied for this subsidy and they very much welcome it. The employment wage subsidy scheme is also hugely important, as was the PUP. I think it has given confidence to people and businesses, notwithstanding the very difficult position they are in, that there is a breathing space. It is really keeping the wolves from the door. It is dealing with the debts they have that they cannot meet because they have no income. It helps to relieve some of that pressure.</p>
          <p eId="para_350"> It is not in itself the only answer, however. The answer is the population taking on board all the protocols to reduce the transfer of Covid and not taking the risks that, unfortunately, some of us took. We drove the R-nought well below 1 - I think it was below 0.5 earlier this year - but it has, unfortunately, climbed back up again. I welcome very much the significant reduction achieved, notwithstanding the fact that no death is acceptable, obviously. There are significant changes taking place as we speak, and I welcome that.</p>
          <p eId="para_351"> I also welcome the support the State is giving in committing to not reducing the rate of corporation tax. We are all focused at the moment on the American presidential election. Mr. Biden has my support. I know he has the support of my family living in the United States. Mr. Biden hails originally from County Louth. His mother's family were Finnegans from Cooley, and we are all very proud that he has his foot on the threshold and hopefully-----</p>

          <p eId="para_356">I just wanted to inform Deputy Murphy. I know that things like that upset him, but I think it is great. Also, for the record, Mr. Biden has had a very important relationship with Irish America. My brother, who is part of the Irish-American business community in New York, is very proud to have been associated with him as well as Bill Clinton and others. The reason I raise this is that our corporation tax policy sustains the American investment in this country, with something like 155,000 people directly employed day in, day out. It helps to attract and keep industries and American investment companies, such as in the ICT, technology, pharmaceutical and medical appliance businesses. If we did not have that excellent relationship with America and did not keep our tax policy as it is, we would not have a lot of that investment. That is why it is hugely important that this was referred to specifically in the budget and the Minister's speech.</p>
          <p eId="para_357"> For smaller businesses the waiver on rates is hugely important. Small businesses find it very hard to meet their local tax bills. The commitment in the Bill to reduce the VAT rate is particularly important. We have suffered greatly as a result of this pandemic, particularly the tourist industry, the catering industry and the people who provide significant services and maintain excellent services in our community year in, year out and month in, month out. When they are prevented because of the pandemic from opening their doors, it is hugely important that this tax is reduced. I believe there is pent-up demand in our economy. It is clearly there in the level of savings, which, as I understand it, has never been higher. I refer to people's personal incomes, the banks and so on. That pent-up demand should be released and we will be able to visit our friends and relatives all over the country and spend our money in our hotels and restaurants. That is hugely important and gives an increasing confidence to business, notwithstanding the dark clouds under which they must operate at the moment. It offers them hope and the possibility, and the probability, that when we go back down to level 3 or, please God, even level 2, that we will release that pent-up demand into our economy, that the income that those companies so badly need will return to their coffers and that families' quality of life will return. It is exceedingly difficult on all families, on everybody, that we have these physical restrictions. They have a significant and adverse impact not just on people's bank balances or their capacity to open businesses but also on mental health. There are other social impacts which have to be ameliorated and dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_358"> I welcome what is in this Finance Bill. I welcome the opportunity to talk about it and to listen and learn. If we have learned anything in this country, and if we look at the rest of Europe, where Covid is increasing exponentially, it is that we are at least dealing with the pandemic medically and insofar as human behaviour is concerned. The core and the heart of our society is looking after all those people who have lost their jobs and businesses that cannot operate. At the heart and the very core of this legislation is support for our communities, particularly our business communities now in their time of greatest need. I welcome the Bill.

          <from>Deputy Paul Murphy<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T14:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_360">This Finance Bill underlines yet again that we have a Government of millionaires looking after the billionaires. Not only are we in the middle of a health crisis, but let us not forget the housing crisis. Yet in this Finance Bill the Government proposes to extend a tax break for major developers which actually encourages them to hoard land for even longer.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">The Government stamp duty refund scheme proposals will not only hand over more money to some of the richest developers in this country, it also allows them to continue to drag their feet on actually building homes on the land they own. This scheme refunds developers almost three quarters of their stamp duty costs. The Government now proposes to extend the scheme even further making completion dates as late as June 2025 eligible for this refund. This extension means developers can sit on their land even longer watching its price rise and even get a handout from the Government for doing so while the homeless figures rise and the housing crisis deepens.</p>
          <p eId="para_362"> We have seen again and again how this is a Government of the golden circle from schmoozing with lobbyists over golf at Clifden to Ministers becoming banking and corporate lobbyists and to the Tánaiste pulling strings for his friends. This proposal is a continuation of that approach. It is a law written for the property speculators and is being proposed here today by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party. The proposal has been largely missed by many Deputies and the media and, in fact, there has been remarkably little discussion at all about the residential development stamp duty refund scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> Even by the Government's logic, the idea of extending the deadline out to cover properties completed by mid-2025 makes no sense. We know developers are hoarding land and watching land prices rise. Extending this scheme gives them an extra year of hoarding. If the goal is to encourage developers to actually build, this extension will only do the opposite.</p>
          <p eId="para_364"> The same is the case with the so-called help-to-buy scheme which is also being extended. The Government is once again handing money to super-rich property developers and trying to tell us it is really about helping home buyers. The so-called help-to-buy scheme is really a help-to-profit for developers scam. It lets developers hike up property prices an extra €30,000 for first-time buyers. Government spin doctors like to present it as a stimulus to encourage developers or to help buyers, a sort of trickle-down economics idea where if one throws money at developers, hopefully, they will build houses. While I am sure it will make the Government popular among its friends in the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, it will only make the housing crisis even worse by making homes more unaffordable.</p>
          <p eId="para_365"> There should not be a penny more in handouts to those profiteering from the housing crisis. Instead, we need a left Government with socialist policies to take on the speculators, developers and big corporate landlords. The reliance on the market to deliver housing has succeeded only in making a tiny few wealthy but it has failed ordinary people abysmally and deepened the crisis. A left Government with socialist policies would build public homes on public land. It would nationalise land that is being hoarded and bring the properties of the corporate landlords into democratic public ownership.</p>
          <p eId="para_366"> I also want to talk about the changes to the carbon tax included in this Finance Bill. This proposed carbon tax increase has nothing to do with protecting the environment. It is an austerity tax with a thin coat of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan's, green paint. Now the Government is proposing to lock in a decade of carbon tax hikes right up to €250 on a tank of heating oil by 2030. That might be small change for Government Ministers but it is a major bill for ordinary workers. Hiking up these taxes does nothing to help someone reduce his or her carbon footprint. It does nothing to tackle the big business polluters who are responsible for this crisis. All it does is let the Government pretend it is doing something while undermining support for the real climate action we need.</p>
          <p eId="para_367"> Instead of a decade of rising carbon tax, we need a decade of a green new deal with socialist policies to achieve zero carbon emissions by 2030. We need investment in free, green and frequent public transport. We need investment in green jobs such as those in healthcare and education. We need to move to a four-day or 30-hour week without loss of pay. We need a just transition to a sustainable model of agriculture without small farmers being hit. Rather than hammering ordinary people, we need a Government that will stand up to big business polluters and bring the key polluting industries into democratic public ownership and in that way enable us to plan for the rapid and just transition we need.</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> Finally, I want to talk a little bit about a group of people almost ignored in this Finance Bill and in this budget, that is, the postgraduate students who are working in universities across the country. The Government is turning largely a blind eye to the fact they are being exploited under its nose. The Government gave them a fairly meagre €1,500 extra in terms of grants but that is it. It is completely inadequate while the Government benefits from their exploitation and refuses to allocate the extra funding needed for third level to raise these students and workers to a decent standard of living.</p>
          <p eId="para_369"> Many people have no idea thousands of unpaid workers in our universities are forced to work for free. People spend thousands of euros on some of the highest college fees in Europe and they do not even realise many of the people teaching their children in college are completely unpaid. The treatment of postgraduate workers in this country is a disgrace. Last month, the Minister with responsibility for higher education admitted in an answer to a question from me that it was common practice for PhD students to be required to do five hours per week teaching without payment. He seems to think it is perfectly okay for people to be expected to work for free. Right now, we are seeing how crucial these postgraduate students are to the running of our universities. Much of the tutorials, laboratories and other teaching takes place due to them. If, in the morning, they all withheld their free labour and refused to work, every college in the country would collapse and be unable to deliver their courses and yet the Government seems to think they do not deserve payment for their work. It is time to treat workers fairly. No one should work for free. They should be paid a decent wage.</p>
          <p eId="para_370"> A particularly shocking part of this is many of these postgraduate students are required to sign a declaration that there is no element of service between themselves and the university despite the fact they are being told they must work five hours per week without pay. Worse than that, National University of Ireland, NUI, Galway, reportedly one of the worst offenders in all this, even demands that students who receive Irish Research Council funding do unpaid hours despite the fact the guidelines for that scholarship clearly state that any teaching duties should be appropriately remunerated. It seems the colleges think they are a law unto themselves and think it is okay to exploit postgraduate students by making them work for free like this. It seems, unfortunately, that the Government is perfectly okay with that. I support those postgraduate students who are getting organised to fight for their rights and for their right to be paid for the work they do rather than being exploited and made to work for free.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BridSmith" eId="spk_188">
          <from>Deputy Bríd Smith<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_371">It must be difficult to try to balance all the factors that must be taken into account when pulling together a budget under the sort of economic, social and political system we live in, but no doubt, the Government is doing it. That is what it does all the time and it makes clear political decisions about where and what it targets in terms of revenue raising.</p>
          <p eId="para_372"> I want to put it into the context of the three crises we are facing across the globe. Obviously, the pandemic and climate change are massive crises and, as a consequence of those, the failure of the competitive and irresponsible capitalist system we live under, an economic crisis is looming large over us. With that trio facing it, the Government has designed a budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_373"> One thing stands out for me, however, and I say this mainly as somebody who participated for months on end in a special committee that was set up to look at how we deal with climate change. The climate action committee was given resources. People were employed to help, advise and work with us to work through all the modules and stuff we had to look at. We got experts in from around the world. We got financial experts and scientists in and we did months of work on the climate action plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">That plan is now being used as cover for what the Government describes as a "cross-party consensus" on how we should go forward with climate action. However, the main thing coming out of the Government's action plan is an increase in carbon taxes that is locked in, year-on-year, for ten years. The Minister of State was not a member of that committee but those of us who were will remember the long debates we had on this issue. We never reached a cross-party consensus on it. Instead, a number of us stood our ground and argued what we thought was the obvious point that carbon taxes would not help to reduce emissions and reliance on fossil fuels but would, in fact, function as a regressive measure directed at the wrong target. The increase in carbon taxes diverts attention away from the systemic nature of carbon pollution, which is rooted in the free market economy and the vested interests of fossil fuel corporations. Those corporations continue to profit from their reliance on oil, coal and gas, as do the companies that rely on the production of plastic. The Government is asking ordinary people to shoulder the blame for the climate action that has not been taken, when 71% of all emissions come from 100 global corporations. This approach is not only regressive but it is also dangerous. It ignores the rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented transitions in energy, land and urban infrastructure, including transport, buildings and industrial systems. We are told that the increase in carbon taxes will be ring-fenced and used to implement the plans that are needed around these transitions, including a just transition. In fact, that is exactly what it will not do.</p>
          <p eId="para_375"> In the course of the long and tedious committee debate to which I referred, we pushed very hard for the Government to commission a comprehensive inquiry into the extent and nature of fuel poverty across all cohorts of the population. We asked that the impacts of an increased carbon tax on all those cohorts in the short, medium and long term be considered prior to the introduction of any such increase. We did not get cross-party support for our proposals. As I said, however, there also was not cross-party support for the approach the Government is taking, which is to impose year-on-year increase in carbon taxes, for ten years, without first bringing in the measures that will help people to change their personal behaviour. Saoirse McHugh, a former member of the Green Party and candidate for the European Parliament, has spoken about the difficulty for her, living on Achill Island, of changing her personal behaviour when there are no buses to take her around and off the island. She relies on a diesel-fuelled car to get around. How can she change her behaviour when she cannot afford to retrofit the old and cold stone cottage in which she lives? The supports are not coming from the State to the people who need them most. At yesterday's meeting of the Joint Committee on Climate Action, Professor Kevin Anderson denounced increases in carbon taxes as a weapon that was being used to punish the wrong people. He pointed out that the very wealthy are the biggest consumers and producers of CO2 emissions on the planet. The people we should be going after, he said, are those who fly most often, live in bigger houses and drive faster cars.</p>
          <p eId="para_376"> There was one recommendation on which we did reach cross-party agreement in the Joint Committee on Climate Action of the last Dáil. Resources were spent on employing people and engaging experts from around the globe, the committee did its work and there was one priority recommendation we managed to get passed. That recommendation stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_377">That this committee recommends that the Department of Finance commission an inquiry into the revenue that could be realised through the introduction of a carbon tax on the profits of corporations and firms directly linked to the production and sale of gas, oil, coal and other fossil fuels. That inquiry should look at the revenue that could be realised from the imposition of a carbon tax on the profits of other corporations and firms linked to the high usage of fossil fuels, including aviation, shipping, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">What has become of that cross-party recommendation? Is the Minister of State aware of any inquiry in his Department into how we might raise what would, I believe, be far greater amounts of revenue by taxing the real polluters rather than ordinary people? I am sure every Deputy in the House has spoken to a plethora of people who have had to make the choice between having a hot meal or heating their home. Many of these people are only a few measly euro above the threshold that would entitle them to a fuel allowance. That is happening everywhere. Representatives from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul told the committee that, in their view, the level of fuel poverty in households throughout the country is significantly underestimated. They have done the research and they work at the coalface with the people they have to subsidise. They spoke about having given out some €4 million in subsidies to help people to pay their electricity and gas bills and buy coal, turf or sticks to heat their homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_379"> The Government has chosen to ignore that evidence and to impose increases that will penalise those who can least afford it. It has ignored the priority recommendation of the committee tasked with examining the issue, which points them in the direction of where they can raise the most revenue, namely, by going after the big polluters, not the people who will struggle to survive through this winter. I take this opportunity to raise an issue that really needs to be raised again. The same people are being penalised by the pay-as-you-go utility companies by the way in which the €100 subsidy that was given at the beginning of the lockdown is being clawed back. That money, which people used to top up their gas or electricity meters, is being taken back at a rate of 60%. If they top up their pay-as-you-go card by a tenner, for example, they will get €4 worth of heat and energy for it. That is happening everywhere and every Deputy in the House knows it. When people are dependent on this way of paying their utility bills, it means they are living hand to mouth and are struggling to pay their bills week by week. The people in that situation are mainly on social protection but they also include people on low pay, pensioners etc. This reality is being ignored by the Government. The utility companies should be brought in and told to stop this practice immediately. Indeed, in the case of any subsidy that has been given during this lockdown and any subsidy that is given during future lockdowns - I expect there will be more lockdowns because of the refusal to pursue a zero Covid strategy - it should not be permitted to recoup that subsidy, in a merciless and vulgar way, from people who can little afford to pay it back at the rate demanded. The Government must intervene on this issue straight away.</p>
          <p eId="para_380"> To reiterate, the idea that there is cross-party consensus for the raising of carbon taxes on ordinary people is absolutely false. There is no such consensus. In fact, the largest Opposition party is opposed to it. It is not just the socialists and parties of the left who are against it; Sinn Féin and other Independent and Opposition Deputies are also opposed. The Government is choosing to ignore what we are screaming at it. It is locking in the carbon tax for ten years without introducing a single measure to reduce CO2 emissions. The Joint Committee on Climate Action is engaged in pre-legislative scrutiny of the climate action and low carbon development (amendment) Bill 2020, which the Government wants to push through before Christmas. That Bill will define the governance structure around which we deal with climate change. One of the proposed provisions is that the Minister must have regard to 25 separate conditions before a single climate action is implemented. Those conditions include consideration of the specific and special nature of the cattle herd and the healthiness of the competition within the economy at the time. The Government cannot accommodate 25 competing interests and, at the same time, say it is taking the action necessary to bring us in line with the Paris Agreement requirement to bring down our CO2 emissions. All it is doing is punishing the most vulnerable and increasing the burden on those who are at least responsible for the disgraceful situation we are in.</p>
          <p eId="para_381"> As the planet hurtles towards more droughts, runaway fires, floods and starvation, which will mostly impact its poorest inhabitants, including the poor in this country who pay the most for flood damage to their homes and so on, the Government offers no solution other than to go after those people again and let the fossil fuel, aviation and shipping industries run as rampantly as they choose. The Government is barking up the wrong tree, not only by imposing carbon taxes on ordinary people but by locking them in for the next ten years. It is utterly outrageous, disgraceful and the wrong way to go about dealing with CO2 emissions.</p>

          <p eId="para_405">Bíonn deá-chomhairle ar fáil in aisce uaithi i gcónaí.</p>
          <p eId="para_406"> First of all, I would like to deal with some specific issues in the budget. In the second half of my contribution, I will talk about the wizardry of modern finance and how, as a simple person, I wonder at times how this magic money is always coming about. There used to be certainties. Matter could not be created or destroyed. Then it was found that if one split the atom, one could destroy matter but one could create energy out of it. Therefore, it became that energy could neither be created nor destroyed. There used be principles in relation to finance that there was no such thing as a free lunch but the world seems to be having a great free lunch at present. I wonder, if it is so simple, why it was not done before. It is something worth debating. Before we come to those issues, people have to live in the immediate and in the immediate effects of a pandemic.</p>
          <p eId="para_407"> The first thing we have to recognise is that a big slice of society, those whose incomes have stayed the same, because they have not had the same spending opportunities on holidays, on hospitality or whatever, will probably save more money or have more money for paying off their debts than they would have had otherwise because every time there is a lockdown or even a semi-lockdown, the opportunities for spending reduce. Then there is the other half of our society who have been impoverished by what has happened. Many of them, those in small and medium-sized enterprises who had never depended on the State and got on with their business, now find that the basis of business has disappeared.</p>
          <p eId="para_408"> In the main, I would have to say the Government has done a reasonable job trying to help a fair number of people with fairly accessible schemes. I do not get a significant number of complaints about accessing the schemes but we know there are significant sectors that the schemes keep seeming to miss. It is something we will have to look at again to see what sectors or types of business are still left out of the loop.</p>
          <p eId="para_409"> When the initial pandemic payment came in, because it was based on what one did in January, February and March, all of the seasonal industries in the west were left out. That was a considerable challenge because in the more rural parts of the country that depended on seasonal tourism, January, February and March is holiday time when they get a break from the hard work of 12 and 14 hours a day from St. Patrick's Day or Easter sometimes up to Christmas.</p>
          <p eId="para_410"> When one looks at the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, there are two conditions. A person's business has to be closed down by the closedown. The other condition I understand that is there in practice is that one has to have an office or some place of business. There are many businesses in this country that do not have a specific place of business. Their place of business is their own homes. There is nothing wrong with that because, if one went back 150 years, cottage industries were prevalent and farming was prevalent. Work was done from people's own homes. It is only in the more modern world we have insisted on everybody having an office, etc. That actually was a function of telecommunications. It is hard to believe that when I went to Corr na Móna the first shock was that it was hard to get a telephone. When we built the co-op, it took us a year to get a telephone and unless one was in the office, one could not be contacted. Now younger people have never experienced the world without the phone in their pocket so wherever they are, that is where their office is. We have progressed to a fantastic situation where there is no need for an office. With the CRSS, businesses that provide services, such as the limousine business, got caught out. Strangely, groups such as the small fishermen are not in a good way because there was a market collapse, and not that they were stopped fishing. For example, limousine owners were told that there are all these loans available, but they are only available if they buy an extra limousine. Who will buy an extra limousine at this stage? It is hard enough for them to pay for the ones they have. What they needed was help to pay back the money they had borrowed.</p>
          <p eId="para_411"> On a bigger policy level in regard to welfare, tax and so on, we seem to have moved into an as-you-were situation of no policy change. There were little bits here or there. The earned relief was brought up to €1,650, but that was going there anyway. There was no significant shift in how we do our taxes or where the burden of taxes lies, and these can be done in a cost-neutral way. I hope that is not a sign of things to come because we need changes in the tax system. As I often said, for the ordinary person living his or her life and trying to make tax returns, the tax system is inordinately complex and we need to look at making life simpler. The past ten years, with the introduction of the universal social charge, USC, and its multiple rules and crinkles, have added a third payroll tax. We would be better returning to the two-tax system of tax and PRSI contributions. The present one is merely ministering to a fetish of the Department of Finance that is a backdoor way of taking people on low incomes, which I disagree with.</p>
          <p eId="para_412"> For the past ten years the age exemption was reduced, and has stayed reduced, and the basic tax credits have stayed the same so while welfare has gone up - I counted seven or eight increases in the past ten years of €5 per year, or an increase of €35 per week - more people who have a small private pension or in small self-employment wind up in the tax net.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">That is a clear policy of the Department of Finance because it seems to me that it wants to take more tax off the low-paid.</p>
          <p eId="para_414"> I come to an issue that puzzles me. I wonder how it is that there is no comeback on it. Every country in the world has had a bad economic year, or to put it more precisely, their governments have had a bad economic year. There are sectors of economies which have had a great year, for example the high-tech companies that work online and sell all the programmes we all use every day, and anybody who sells Internet services. Most governments have wound up spending much more money than they are taking in and creating huge deficits. We are told, with justification, that there is no harm in borrowing €20 billion, €30 billion, or any figure one can name. We are told that we can keep writing the cheques because we can get long-term money for free, and that monopoly money is now the way the world is.</p>
          <p eId="para_415"> The House should remember that we are borrowing €30 billion but when one takes that across all the countries of Europe and all the countries of the world there is a massive amount of borrowing going on. In the old days of conventional banking, if one was borrowing a huge heap of money, somebody would have needed to have saved that money and to have put it in the bank before the bank could lend it. We have gone way beyond that in the sophistication of our systems, however. Consequently, this is not money that was saved, invested and made available for borrowing. I am very open to the Minister of State, who is an erudite man, explaining to me where all the money is coming from, why it is being given out for free and what effect it is going to have in the long term. Is somebody going to tell me this will have no long-term effect because free money can be created every year? It defies every rule of conventional economics that would have obtained here prior to the last two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_416"> Ten years ago, during the other crisis, if we had suggested to Europe that it should keep printing money all the time, it would have refused and insisted we borrow the money on the market. It would have argued that money must be real and said that we could not keep writing blank cheques. I much prefer this way of solving the problem than the last way, whereby we were paying between 8% and 10% for money at some stages. However, I still query that it is this handy, that we can keep doing this and that there is not going to be a sting in the tail somewhere. We would have been told that if we kept writing cheques and creating money out of nothing, and if central banks all over the world kept creating all this money out of nowhere, it would create rampant inflation. Now everyone is going to tell me that is not happening. It is surely not happening at the moment but maybe that is because there is a constraint on people's spending. I see very little commentary on this. I see very little questioning of how we have suddenly wound up in this utopia where we can keep writing money without it having an effect on inflation or the value of money. It seems that the answer to all of the world's finance problems was really handy all the time, but I am sure it is not that simple. Nothing ever is, if we look at all the downturns before. What happened in the 1930s in Europe was hyperinflation. Sometimes in Ireland, debate at the higher level is very much focused on today, on orthodoxy, on not rocking the boat and on not questioning the basic logic of the situations in which we find ourselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_417"> At the beginning of my contribution I said we have created two sections of society. The people in one section depend on subsidies from the State when they are lucky. When they are unlucky, they are told to suck it up even if they are facing dire financial and personal problems. The only thing they are being offered is new loans for new equipment; no help is bring offered with the debts they have. On the other hand, if the truth be told, there are many people in certain types of business that are much better off. My worry is that when things settle down and Covid disappears, which no doubt it will, we will get rapid inflation. When there is an overgenerous money supply, price inflation will happen. I am concerned that we will hit in a second whammy all the people who have been hit in the first whammy. The people who were not hit in the first whammy will be relatively better off because they will have much fewer or no borrowings and doubtless they will have invested in long-term savings at very low interest rates before the chickens come home to roost. If the interest rates go up, their money will go up because that is what happens. On the other hand, the people who must borrow to survive will find the interest rates on new borrowings for them will go up and they will not be immune.</p>
          <p eId="para_418"> Some people will speak about the assurances that the economists will give us. I am sure all the European economists and the people writing all this money are going to assure us that everything is under control. It is said that once bitten, twice shy. I sat in government in the 2008 period when report after report from the OECD and all the rest came in. There is no point in denying that although there were a few outlier economists, and a few people who questioned, the vast majority of reputable economists at the time told us that there would be a soft landing and so on. When Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac broke in America, I remember putting a phone call through to the Taoiseach's Department and asking a senior adviser if this had implications for Ireland. I was blithely assured that we did not have sub-prime lending in Ireland, that there was no issue and that everything was under control. I do not think I need to emphasise or go into any detail about what the real truth was: on that sunny day when the news broke about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the United States of America, we saw the beginning of a huge international financial turmoil which scarred and hurt many people.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">I hope that when the Minister of State is summing up, he will be able to explain to me in simple English how suddenly the world has changed so much because of Covid that we could start writing all of this money throughout the world and there is literally no downside to it and there will be no day of reckoning. If it is as simple as this, why did the economists not think it up a long time ago? We could have provided a lot of services that a lot of people needed and we need not have worried about the cost.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelLowry" eId="spk_211">
          <from>Deputy Michael Lowry<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T14:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_420">I receive daily queries from worried, uncertain, stressed and anxious people, each of whom wants reassurance and a flicker of light for the future. I want to raise a few particular issues with the Minister of State and I would appreciate if I could get a response in due course. Covid-19 has hit the bus and coach transport sector particularly hard. Since the crisis began, tourist numbers have collapsed, factories and offices have closed and the hospitality sector and all major events have ceased. The result has been almost total fall-off in passenger numbers, with a huge financial impact on transport providers. Private bus and coach operators employ 11,500 full-time staff nationwide and have a yearly turnover of €600 million. They operate 90% of school transport services and the vast majority of Irish commercial bus services. They also play a huge role in tourism provision. These are all services that will be needed in the future when the scourge of this pandemic ends. We look forward to the day when tourists will flock back to Ireland. We all know children will still need to get to school. People will want to attend events throughout the country. Everyone, once more, will be on the move. The question is whether the existing bus and coach operators will still be there to provide transport and assist in the revival of our economy. Under current circumstances, it is inevitable that many of them will be forced out of business.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> The sector is not seeking anything more than others. It is asking for the introduction of a turnover-linked direct Government grant to assist with liquidity. It requires the restoration of the fuel rebate. In addition, it has identified the need for reclassification of VAT status to harmonise the island's VAT system to enable operators in the South of Ireland to reclaim VAT. This is essential in light of Brexit. It has also highlighted the need for supporting scheduled services to help to ensure a sustained and professional delivery of services. It requires membership of the tourism task force and the initiation of a new public transport recovery task force with an independent chair and budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_422"> I also wish to raise with the Minister of State another travel-related issue. This is with regard to travel agents. While the Government is keen to move to the co-ordinated system to enable air travel to resume, medical advisers, as we have heard this week, are emphatic they do not recommend any non-essential travel out of the country. Airlines command most of the media coverage on this issue but travel agents throughout the country are hanging on by their fingertips. When I first raised the plight of these businesses back in July, there were 190 licensed travel agents operating in Ireland. This number has decreased considerably and many of them have ceased to exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_423"> While travel agents were initially relieved to hear they were to be included in the Covid restrictions support scheme, as many of them need capital to continue, I have been advised by several operators in Tipperary and other places that they are finding it impossible to get any banking support. One particular business has applied no less than three times for a bank loan to try to keep the business afloat. It has been refused each time as it is impossible for it to confirm to the bank when the business can resume normal trading. Will the Minister of State confirm that travel agents are in fact included in the Covid restrictions support scheme? There is still an element of doubt about it. The scheme opened last Monday and already more than 1,000 applications have been received by the Department. Will the Minister of State confirm the timeline for the decisions on these applications? Are there other plans under consideration to assist this business sector, which has been one of the hardest hit throughout the pandemic?</p>
          <p eId="para_424"> I wish to raise the concerns and plight of learner drivers who, through no fault of their own, are unable to sit a driver test at this time unless they are deemed to be an essential worker. While this is frustrating in itself, to compound it, and what is grossly unfair, is that the insurance companies are penalising them because they are still driving on a provisional licence. This situation is impacting on 85,000 mainly young people throughout the country. It is estimated the financial cost to each of them in terms of increased insurance premiums will be in the region of €600. This issue must be addressed. Insurance companies should not be permitted to profit as a result of this pandemic at the expense of people who are powerless to address their situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_425"> Another group that feels overlooked by the Government are those aged over 66 who lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic. Many of them have borrowings and financial commitments that were entered into because they had income from employment. Due to their receipt of the State pension, they do not qualify for Covid payments. They still have to meet the same financial commitments on a reduced income. Will those aged over 66 continue to be unfairly excluded from receiving a Covid payment?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanCanney" eId="spk_212">
          <from>Deputy Seán Canney<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T14:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_426">I concur with the remarks of Deputy Lowry on those aged over 66. It is very important that we do not leave out these people as they have surely contributed a huge amount. At the beginning of Covid they lost out in their businesses and were put to the pin of their collar to try to survive. They deserve more than this.</p>
          <p eId="para_427"> I want to raise a number of issues with regard to the budget. As we know, the LEADER programme, which is a rural development programme for Ireland, will finish on 31 December. Over the past five years, it provided €250 million in funds. However, the new programme will not be in place next year so we will have a gap. I am very surprised to see there are no plans in the budget to provide for transitional funding for next year. The fund itself provides for projects in community development, job creation and economic development in rural Ireland with a bottom-up approach. Over the past five years, we have seen what the benefits have been for rural Ireland. In these strange times, it would be very remiss of the Government not to take on board the fact we cannot have a drop-off cliff-edge point and wait for another 18 months to start a new scheme. It is very important we have some way of providing continuity to this sector over the next 12 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_428"> I want to raise the issue of young people who want to buy homes. I welcome the continuation of the help-to-buy scheme for first-time buyers of new homes. I believe the scheme should be extended to include first-time buyers of second-hand houses. Likewise, the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme also needs to be expanded to allow first-time buyers of second-hand homes to get mortgages for the refurbishment of these homes. In our budget submission, the Regional Group asked for an incentive for young people to be able to purchase vacant houses in towns and villages.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">This was an incentive of approximately €15,000 per house. That has been ignored, and in these times when we are all talking about building houses, at the same time we talk about the number of vacant houses in towns and villages throughout the country. I see these small but very effective schemes as a way of delivering homes and incentivising young people to buy homes in the towns, refurbish them for modern living and bring life back into the towns. Anything we put into this will give a dividend back and will also help us take care of the many people on the housing list.</p>
          <p eId="para_430"> As the Minister knows, the post office network is under very severe pressure. The prospect of unrestrained closures is facing us next year, given the existing supports will be running out in June of next year. We had a debate in the House last week on this issue. Grant Thornton, in its analysis, reckons that what is required is a €70 million intervention to keep the post office network operational. Again, I would argue this subvention will only add to the prospect of the post offices delivering between €334 million and €776 million annually in social dividend to this country. We have seen through the pandemic the amount of engagement post offices have had with people in isolated areas, where to have the post office van call is the only contact for people who are living on their own and vulnerable. </p>
          <p eId="para_431"> Beyond that, the post offices have lost 25% of their turnover between 2019 and 2020. There is a crisis facing us in the coming months and I would like to see the budget take into account the fact we need to do something. The budget as it is framed is putting a lot of money into the economy, and it is good we are putting money into people who are putting it into the economy so the economy will continue to survive. It is also important, however, that we are not just throwing money at problems. From a budgetary point of view, we need to see that the money we put in is spent wisely and it is important we make sure, whatever we put in, that the outcomes are being delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> With regard to health and the issue of disabilities, we have a lot of work to do in these areas and we are putting a lot of money into these budgets. My fear is that we are putting in so much that we do not know how to account for it at the other end. How are we making sure it is filtering down to the people who need it most? How do we make sure it gets to the front line, to the people with disabilities, to give them the transport, services and home help they require?</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> In that vein, it is important that we prioritise delivery and investment in the bottom-up approach. Carers, who are trying to keep people out of nursing homes, thereby saving the State millions of euro, should be dealt with in a way that is fair and reasonable. It is very important that we should not stand over the fact it takes 15 weeks to process a carer’s allowance application, and then maybe another five to six weeks if a person is under review, and even longer if a person is going for an appeal. All through that time, the carer gets no return and no support. I ask the Minister to bring that back to the Cabinet table.</p>

          <from>Deputy Cathal Berry<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_434">I welcome the publication of the Finance Bill. I know it is not a perfect document but there is quite a lot of good stuff in it and, on that basis, I am going to support its passage through the Dáil. In the time I have available, I want to focus on one specific provision at the bottom of page 11, the Naval Service seagoing personal tax credit, which is very important. I very much welcome the fact this tax credit is going to be included in the 2021 fiscal year as well. This year, 2020, was the first year it came in, and I am very happy to see it is going to be rolled over. It would be very useful if we could get clarity in regard to this tax credit. Is it going to be continued to be rolled over into the future or is it just for a couple of years? Any kind of clarity or certainty the Minister can bring to the question would be much appreciated.</p>
          <p eId="para_435"> I welcome the very small increase in the tax credit for 2020, given it was €1,270 per annum and has been increased to €1,500 for 2021. That is a good thing, but again, the scale of the increase does not match the scale of the problem at all. Nonetheless, it is progress in the right direction. I acknowledge the contribution of the Ministers, Deputies Coveney and Michael McGrath, in organising these schemes. In isolation, they are not going to make a massive difference, but as part of a cumulative effort to improve things in the Naval Service and across the Defence Forces, it should have a sizeable impact over time.</p>
          <p eId="para_436"> From a Defence Forces perspective, we still have exactly the same problems. They are still the lowest paid public servants and there is only one reason for that, namely, they will not strike or cannot strike. As a result, they have almost no bargaining power and no leverage when it comes to pay negotiations and, in fact, they are practically laughed out of the room, if they even get into the room. That is an area we need to work on. In 2017, when the naval commanders put in a request to the then Minister to bring in a tax credit, they were not looking to peg the Naval Service tax credit with the fisher tax credit but to peg it with the seafarers tax credit, which is a far bigger credit, four times larger than the one that is on offer at the moment. The seafarers tax credit is €6,350 per annum and that is where we need to aim for in regard to the Naval Service. The seafarers credit is for people who work on ferries, merchant vessels, offshore oil and gas rigs or any kind of drilling platform. To me, the Naval Service is the nation's primary seagoing service. I cannot think of any agency that would be more worthy of such a tax credit than the Naval Service and it is something we should certainly opt for.</p>
          <p eId="para_437"> An increase in the credit is very important and it would have five very positive effects. First, it would assist with the retention crisis in the Naval Service, which is very important, particularly on the eve of a hard Brexit, which is only weeks away. Currently, the situation is that we have very highly qualified, highly experienced people who wish to remain in the Naval Service but who just cannot afford to stay because the pay rates are so low. It would be similar to anybody in this Chamber buying a very expensive sports car and then just giving the car away for free three or four years down the line. It makes no commercial, practical or financial sense whatsoever.</p>
          <p eId="para_438"> The second advantage is that there is no risk of contagion if we increase the tax credit to the Naval Service. There are very few public servants who work offshore and, in fact, so few employees work offshore in this tax jurisdiction that any additional tax credits given to Naval Service personnel would have almost negligible or minimal second-order effects.</p>
          <p eId="para_439"> Third, generally speaking, it is the lower ranks who tend to travel on the high seas more than the higher ranks, so if a tax credit is given for sea travel, it will disproportionately and preferentially support lower paid personnel. That is precisely what this Chamber should be about, that is, identifying pressure points where the more needy people are and then supporting them. </p>
          <p eId="para_440"> Fourth, seagoing is quite difficult, particularly from a family-friendly perspective. It is important from a tax credit point of view that we focus on and support the people on whom the burden of work on the high seas falls. That is another advantage to giving a tax credit in that the people who actually travel at sea, and who are often away for three or four weeks at a time from their families, will get rewarded for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_441"> Fifth, this tax credit is available to all personnel. Unlike the service commitments scheme that was announced only a couple of weeks ago, if a tax credit is increased over the next few years, it is available to all personnel, and it would not have the same divisive effect that the service commitments scheme has started to have in the Naval Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">I thank the relevant Ministers for bringing in these two measures. They will make a small bit of progress. It demonstrates that the trajectory we are on is progress but much more needs to be done. I would like to see this tax credit move from €1,500 per annum towards the €6,350 seafarers' allowances. Our Naval Service protects us every hour of every day and the least they deserve is for us to reciprocate and protect them as well.</p>

          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T15:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_443">I concur with the remarks of my Kildare South colleague on the Defence Forces in general. The issue of the Defence Forces has been with us for a long time. Hopefully, it is not being ignored. I am told that it is not and I hope matters will develop in their favour in the not too distant future.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> The Finance Bill gives statutory effect to the provisions of the budget and I congratulate the Ministers and the Minister of State for the provisions they have introduced so far. This is a challenging time in which we find ourselves. Challenging times have not gone away, nor are they likely to in the short, medium or long term. I am strongly of the opinion that the Government should remain alert at all times over the next 12 months to issues that may arise and situations, as have been referred to by a number of speakers, of people who fall through the cracks of the system and who, despite the best efforts of the Administration, find it difficult to survive. Those issues develop as time goes by in a negative and particularly incisive way for the people who are affected. Points have been made by previous speakers on all sides of the House on this situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_445"> Covid and Brexit present huge challenges, not only for the Government of this country but for those of other countries as well. That is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. The sad and unfortunate part is that these two issues have been outside the control of any government in this country and, as far as Covid is concerned, is outside the control of any government across the globe. </p>
          <p eId="para_446"> It is timely to reflect on the situation that has been referred to in respect of housing. A huge demand has been creating a backlog for some time and it has not been addressed because it could not be addressed - first, because of the lack of resources during the economic crash and, now, followed by the challenges of Covid, which again put huge stress on the wherewithal to make substantial provisions to address these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_447"> A number of speakers referred to the length of time it takes to process applications for various types of assistance at present. That does not apply to everything but it certainly applies to some things. For example, there were the local authority small dwellings Act loans under the 1966 Act which people below a certain income limit were entitled to in years gone by. It can now take up to six months to process the equivalent of one of these loans through the local authorities. I am told the reason is the number of provisions and requirements and that it is not possible to produce the approvals any quicker. I remember when it was possible to bring one of these applications into the local authority on a Monday morning and have it approved on Thursday. That day has long since passed but if we want to put our finger on a button, that is one that needs to be looked at as a matter of extreme urgency. There is no sense in standing idly by and saying this is terrible and that we need to do something about it. We need to do something about it and it has been done before. I remind myself and everybody else that the local authorities are not banks but a housing authority. Housing is a huge issue at present, has been for a number of years and will remain so for the foreseeable future unless something dramatic is done to address it. </p>
          <p eId="para_448"> The other thing I will say on housing is that this impacts largely on young people and first-time buyers, who are at a huge disadvantage at present. They cannot compete in the market with those who have direct access to more liberal financial institutions or whatever. The simple fact is that house prices in this country are way too high. There is no sense in people pretending that that is what they are valued at or whatever the case may be.</p>
          <p eId="para_449"> I carried out an experiment over the past ten years along with a number of other councillors whereby we thought it was possible to build houses and make them available to people who were financially qualified. We proved it was possible to provide a house for first-time buyers at less than half the cost of houses on the market at the same time. They were brand new houses and we went through all the procedures and bought the sites. What happened after that was ironic. If circumstances change, as they will, and people have to move on and sell, there is a clawback from those people as these were allegedly subsidised sites. No reference was made to the fact that they had bought the sites as well. It annoys me intensely that we have not been able to do anything about this over a long number of years. It is no good blaming the present Government or the previous Government: it is over a long number of years. </p>
          <p eId="para_450"> There was a system called the shared ownership scheme which was intended to assist those on an income below what would gain them a loan in the commercial market and above what would get them a local authority house. There was a provision whereby roughly half the mortgage was on rent and the other half was on the mortgage - half the value of the house and half the equity. What happened was that somebody decided to improve the situation. There was a system whereby the rental part of the equity was approximately the same as a local authority differential rent. However, somebody decided to increase it by 4% per annum. Ten years in the position left them with a 40% increase which meant they could never get out of that spot and would always have to remain where they were or rent from some landlord somewhere else. Many people objected to it, as I did. Whoever the person was who put that barb into the housing situation has much to answer for because it created a huge housing problem which continues in this country and will continue for a considerable time. </p>
          <p eId="para_451"> A time when we can all make a constructive contribution to economic thinking in this House is budget time and the time of the Finance Bill. It was always the case that the Minister, and I am glad to see the Minister of State present, took into account the issues raised by Members and these were brought to the Department and acted on. Sometimes they were acted on quickly and sometimes they were not. That was the system and it worked extremely well. I have severe doubts as to whether it applies in the same way nowadays.</p>
          <p eId="para_452"> We also have Brexit and it is not on its own, as we all know. It is Brexit along with Covid, and the two together is a double whammy.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">It is one of the biggest challenges we are ever likely to face. We have all discussed this and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I do not agree on some of the issues, as we pointed out to each other yesterday evening. We have a responsibility to the health of our population in the first instance, the people who are here now and their children. We have a responsibility to children, the middle aged, the elderly and the vulnerable. We have a first responsibility to those people and it is our duty, as caring citizens, to make sure that we do the best that we can to look after their interests. Restrictions have been identified as necessary, as I believe they are, but we have a choice. We can ignore these restrictions and go about our business as if there is no threat at all. We can continue to consort and fraternise as if there is no challenge. If we do that, we will pay a price for it. If we ignore the issues raised by our health services and experts, we will pay a higher price. It is important that we recognise that it is possible to fight this pandemic voluntarily by simply following the restrictions. If we do that, we will not need lockdowns and shutdowns. We will not need to impose penalties and the Garda will not have to enforce restrictions. It is in our own hands. It is voluntary, highly effective and efficient, and workable. It is a matter for ourselves to take it into account. To follow the restrictions would be beneficial to the entire community from an economic point of view.</p>
          <p eId="para_454"> I hope we can continue in this vein. This is now an economic and budgetary issue. It will impact not only this generation but future generations. It will seriously affect the well-being of this country's economy. If we do not look after the well-being of our economy in the next two, three or four years, the children who are now being born may have to carry the burden for that in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_455"> I will issue a slight warning to us all that we have to pay back the moneys that we are now borrowing. The simplest way to do that is to achieve economic growth in the interim whereby our debts in proportion to our economic development come together, as it were, or merge. We do not want to start to recover money by imposing steep and sharp penalties. I have noticed that my colleagues from around the House have referred to draconian issues but few people refer to what happened before Draco. Poor old Draco gets blamed for everything now but before he introduced his system, a long time ago now, the alternative system was much worse and involved execution, beheading, garrotting and major slaughter. Draco is now reviled and I am not suggesting that he be brought back, but I remind people that things were an awful lot worse before his time.</p>
          <p eId="para_456"> We want also to recognise that the threat of Brexit is not of our making but is of the making of another country. For some unknown reason, right across the globe, we are going through a period of renationalisation and a reassertion of nationalistic values that is not welcome. I and people of my generation thought that we had overcome those issues because of factual experience and unfortunate developments that took place throughout the 20th century. Unfortunately, people's memories are short enough and we are where we are. There is a series of stark questions in front of us now. We must ask ourselves have we the resolve, resourcefulness, ability, courage and stamina to tackle this matter head on because it is a big challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> We were reminded, some time ago, by a minister in another jurisdiction that a little touch of starvation might bring us to our senses. I do not think it is necessary to go down that road. That is an unfortunate road on which we dwelt for many years. I will simply say that I support the Government's efforts to bring about an ordered withdrawal of the UK from the EU and an amicable resolution to Brexit, although I do not know whether it can happen or not. I am worried, as the deadline comes closer and closer that there is a danger that the small player in such a field can get squeezed. I acknowledge the support that this country has received from our colleagues across the European Union. I am conscious of the fact that we owe them a great deal for their solidarity towards us. It would have been just as easy for them to walk away and pretend it was not happening. They did not do that. They stood up to their commitment. They are still doing that and I hope they will continue to do so. </p>
          <p eId="para_458"> I also hear people expressing the sentiment that we will have to do something. We will have to do something but the danger is that, when we are in a tight corner, we might do something that is not in our best interests. We should recognise that we are equals in this debate and that, as equals, we stand our ground, do what we have to do, hold our heads up and maintain our position. That is the way to get the best possible result. That is still available to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> I am not making a political point when I say the following, but we have all had occasion to point out the advantages of the all-Ireland, all-island economy and the way it has operated. We know that for the past 25 or 30 years, we had all of that. We have been free of the Border and able to travel from one end of the island to the other without restriction on investment or jobs, or access to those things, and it has worked extremely well even though we had emerged from a difficult era for peace on the island. It has been without a doubt the best of provisions and it was there in the nick of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_460"> I do not accept the notion that we should not offer to our colleagues on the other half of this island an alternative to a united country. We should not tell them, "A united Ireland, or else." I know that is not what is intended. There are some times when it is insensitive and not a good time to face one's opponent with an obligation to concede or leave the field. That does not work and has not worked in the past. We have a tragic history in that regard in this country. We need to be conscious of that as we move into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_461"> We also need to make provisions to be able to sell our goods and services unimpeded right across the globe as members of the European community. As time passes, obstacles that we have not foreseen may arise. I compliment our negotiators, the former Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the current Taoiseach and other Ministers on the manner in which they have handled Ireland's position through the EU and the way that the EU has responded. It is in stark contrast to other issues that have arisen in other countries all over the world. We have shown solidarity. We have stuck and stood together and supported each other in a time of crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> I hope this Finance Bill meets its targets in full. If it does not, and if a need for modifications arises in the course of the year, we should address that. We need to look again and again, as time goes by, to see where the Bill has had a negative impact and do something about it as required. There is not much sense in waiting for a year or two before we wake up to those impacts. I believe that we have the wherewithal to do these things. I believe we have the resilience and determination to do these things. I also believe we have an obligation to do these things, not only for ourselves and the present generation, but for future generations.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">We must also invest now in the youth of today, the young home buyers and householders who are entering the phase of their lives where they have significant responsibilities and challenges. We need to support them in the ways I and others have referred to. If we stand together and recognise each other's position and the challenges faced and we address them, we will prevail.</p>

          <from>Deputy Matt Carthy<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T15:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_464">This is the Finance Bill which followed on from the budget. We will recall the budget announcement when we heard one Government spokesman person after another cry out that this was the largest budget in the history of the State. We were all deafened by the assertions of that statement and yet it is ironic that that statement has been met by the numbers of people who have told us in the days and weeks since that the only thing the budget did for them was to make them poorer. It was a completely missed opportunity on so many fronts, particularly for those from rural communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> The Government did not just decide that in the middle of a pandemic that it would move forward with the very tokenistic and regressive measure of increasing the carbon taxes. It actually went so far as to state in legislation that it was going to increase the carbon tax every year until 2030. We have never seen before such arrogance from a failed position. The Government did not introduce legislation to say that old age pensioners, for example, would secure increases for every year until 2030, or that pharmacy payments would increase in line with the cost of living up until 2030. The only measure that the Government categorically committed both itself and future governments to was an increase in a policy and a taxation that does not work. The reason that it does not work for people in my constituency is that this is an unavoidable tax, despite the assertions by others. If people need their cars to get to work in my community they have no alternative whatsoever. They have to drive their cars. Essentially, the carbon tax increase is a tax on people for trying to do their best and to make a life for their family. There was very little of significance in the budget for rural communities or the farming community.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> The major announcement was a new Covid-19 so-called support scheme of €40 million for farmers. That has since been revealed as being simply an extension of the beef scheme. There is nothing new in it. Sinn Féin had rightly advocated that all Pillar 2 schemes, including environmental schemes, should continue through the transition period but we do not wish to laud or seek plaudits for simply asking to continue some schemes that take a little bit of the burden off our spending. This Government has been very willing and able to regurgitate previous failed policies on countless occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> The Minister here is a Fianna Fáil representative. Prior to the election, Fianna Fáil committed to an additional €45 million for our suckler farmers. Where is it? I asked the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine if he has managed to find that because it is not in the budget and it is not in this Finance Bill. Sinn Féin had advocated a new dispensation for our farmers recognising that they are the heartbeat of our rural communities and local economies. We had proposed a funding stream to ensure that we could deliver a suckler payment scheme of up to €300 per cow. We saw what the Government offered our suckler farmers in the early hours of Wednesday morning, when we were here discussing such issues as the closure of marts and the 30-month and four-movement rules with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. We saw a Minister who was completely out of touch.</p>
          <p eId="para_468"> Since the budget we have returned to level 5 restrictions and we have seen families, communities and businesses under increased stress. What we have not seen are increased supports, which are badly needed, particularly for those in rural communities. Can the Minister evaluate the impact of the carbon tax? That has a big impact on the families and communities I represent. I ask him to re-evaluate that and to be a sane voice in government and to tell it that in the interests of the environment and of our communities, it needs to change tack. </p>

          <from>Deputy Paul Donnelly<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T15:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_469">The programme for Government committed to support and enable a strong community sector. However, at the first hurdle of the 2021 budget, this Government has stumbled at the first fence. It is important to put into context the contribution the community, voluntary and charity sector makes in Ireland. It comprises 34,842 charitable organisations, 86,481 volunteer directors and trustees, directly employs 165,000 people and manages a turnover of €14.2 billion. These organisations raise more than half of this income themselves, subsidising in a major way the cost of public services in Ireland. Indecon Economic Consultants, estimate that the total direct and indirect value of the work of Ireland’s charities exceeds €24 billion per year and supports 289,000 employees and yet the funding of one sector, the community development sector, has seen a drop of 16% in funding in this budget which is completely shocking. During the Covid-19 crisis, the success of the Community Call and the initiative of bringing local organisations together to support communities in each local authority area was acknowledged by everyone as a completely wonderful service.</p>
          <p eId="para_470"> It is imperative that we build on the incredible work and success of the Community Call initiative. As an organiser in my community with our local GAA clubs, I saw the impact that had on people within our local community, on those who were older and vulnerable. The social networks during this Covid-19 crisis pandemic had fully collapsed and it left people, like senior citizens and those who were vulnerable, completely isolated. Were it not for Community Call, we would have seen really catastrophic situations. I know there has been an impact on the mental and physical health of people but the Community Call initiative certainly helped many people. That is why we need to look at this Covid-19 pandemic and the impact it has had on people and at what we do at that community level to support people as we move forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_471"> I wish to talk about the community services programme, CSP. There has been a fundamental failure to keep up with the basic costs of the community services programme. We have projects which are dealing with vulnerable people, Travellers, people with disabilities, recovering drug users, ex-prisoners, meals-on-wheels, shops, cafés, community centres, etc., under the community services programme. The funding that was initially allocated when this programme started covered the basic cost of the minimum wage. It has not moved a single cent since then. These projects now have to fund the gap between what is given through the CSP and the minimum wage and quite a number of these projects try to reach what we might call “the living wage”. It is very important that we look at this. Unfortunately, this budget was another missed opportunity to bridge that gap to support this sector. Bear in mind that during this crisis the community, voluntary and charity sector lost upwards on €500 million in fundraising and other ways in which it raised money itself, including by renting buildings. It is important to say again that the Indecon report stated that 57% of the projects that were receiving the CSP payments could not proceed without that funding. This will have a catastrophic effect on our local communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> I will deal briefly with community centres. We are facing a time bomb in the coming years with regard to capital funding for community centres, particularly those not owned by local authorities. It is critical that we look at providing multi-annual funding for them because those are the projects that provide services such as dancing, bingo, youth services, meals on wheels, arts and music. They provide all those services to our local communities at an affordable cost. If the community centres are not available, those other services will not be available either. It is unfortunate that we have not had the same amount of funding for the community, voluntary and charities sector that we have had for the business sector.</p>

          <p eId="para_473">Budget 2021 will be judged by the way it impacts on citizens' lives, whether it improves, disimproves or has no impact on them. It is important that we talk about real citizens. I want to give the Minister an outline of a letter I got today from a constituent. He says that he is in agony. He has problems with his cervical spine, which he says is busted, and his lumbar spine. He has been told by neurology and rheumatology that he needs a scan but he has also been told that he may have to wait years for that. If he had money - he is on a disability payment while his wife has a long-term illness also - he would probably be able to get a private scan tomorrow. Two private scans would cost €700 but it may as well be €7 million because this man does not have that money. He has been forced to go to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to see if it will cover some of the cost. I asked him if he was in pain. Doctors normally ask patients to describe their pain between one and ten, one being an ache and increasing to ten depending on severity. This man says he is in agony, and he is looking for help in that regard. That is an example of one section of our population that we are failing.</p>
          <p eId="para_474"> The Covid-19 pandemic should have been a wake-up call for the Government to see that our health service was woefully under-resourced and unprepared for a major crisis. It highlighted a weakness whereby politicians, but also senior management, seemed unable or unwilling to change elements of policy that were not working or needed immediate attention. We have seen that with the private hospitals not being fully utilised or put on hold during the early days of the pandemic. We saw the expensive accommodation and facilities in Citywest not being used in any serious way. There was no flexibility in that regard. This is a facility that has to date cost up to €21 million. When the owners bought the hotel it cost them €24 million. Again, we see an issue with the use of public moneys. In terms of moneys allocated to the health service in budget 2021, it is simply noise until we hear the detail on how it will be spent, or misspent. I refer again to the man who wrote to me and the difficulties he is experiencing.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> No one would have foreseen the extent of the Covid pandemic but we had warning signs in previous years. Swine flu and bird flu caused health professionals to highlight the weaknesses in our system. Even the seasonal flu outbreaks caused major strain in our capacity to provide healthcare to our citizens, with accident and emergency departments filled to brim every year with people on trolleys for days at a time.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> We need a budget that is fit for purpose in terms of building up our hospital bed capacity, not only to deal with the realities of Covid but with a growing and ageing population. Budget 2021 provides for an additional 66 ICU beds but that is only one quarter of what we need to put into the system to be at a proper bed capacity level. That is not a new figure. In 2009, 11 years ago, the HSE commissioned another expensive report that told us we would need 579 ICU beds by 2020. When Covid struck, we had only 255. The Minister was in the House the other day and he said that additional beds will be provided. We know that a lack of ICU beds is not just a problem during the pandemic but is a bottleneck within the system where critical care is needed for elective surgical procedures. Far too often we hear constituents talking about life-saving elective procedures being cancelled at the last minute. What is happening to people is cruel and wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_477"> I cannot understand the reason medical cards for the terminally ill were not provided for in budget 2021. There is support in this House from all parties, and none, for that measure, which was promised last year by the previous Minister for Health, Deputy Harris.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> In my constituency, surgeons from Tallaght hospital have been taking to the airwaves to plead with the Government to build up facilities and support with regard to ICU beds. We cannot wait years for that. People cannot wait much longer. We need changes now.</p>

        <speech by="#DarrenORourke" eId="spk_218">
          <from>Deputy Darren O'Rourke<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_479">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill. I want to raise two issues, the first of which is the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS. Under the CRSS announced in the budget a business that is impacted by Covid-19 related restrictions, including closure, can make a claim to Revenue for a payment for each week it is affected by those restrictions. That is a welcome support given the massive impact Covid-19 is having on certain businesses across the State. While most businesses have been impacted in some way this year, certain businesses have been severely affected from day one back in March. It has not been a case of one size fits all.</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> Travel agents have been one of the worst impacted sectors. Given the collapse of international travel due to the pandemic, their entire business model has fallen off a cliff. Despite that, however, travel agents have had to stay open throughout the pandemic to process refunds and vouchers for customers even though they have had no income coming in. When the CRSS was first announced, travel agents were not included. That was a major blow to the sector. They are permitted now to apply for the scheme under level 5 but this is set to be removed when level 5 restrictions are downgraded. The fact of the matter is that there is no level 1, 2, 3 or 4 for travel agents. There is only level 5. The financial hardship and the impact of Covid-19 will not stop for them on 1 December. It is incredible and unacceptable that the Government will remove the support from this severely impacted sector. These are often small family businesses. I know personally of cases where the families have remortgaged the family home to stay afloat. We will need these businesses in the future when the Covid pandemic comes to an end. I ask the Minister to reconsider his decision in that regard. It is a very serious matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> Another sector that is excluded from the CRSS is the bus, coach and chauffeur service sector. In a reply to a parliamentary question recently, the Minister stated that where a business does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises located in a region that is subject to restrictions, such as coach or bus operators whose business is ordinarily operated from mobile vehicles, that business will not meet the eligibility criteria. That is an incredibly unfair position to take. Many bus and coach operators who usually ferry tourists to every corner of Ireland have had no business at all this year due to Covid. There are no gigs, festivals, events or tourism. These companies often carry wealthy tourists to remote corners of Ireland and encourage spending in small craft shops and little cafés in rural villages, which supports thousands of jobs. When tourism starts to recover next year we will depend on those companies to ferry tourists around the country again. Bus, coach and chauffeur services have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. I ask the Minister to reconsider immediately his decision to exclude them from the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_482"> School bus transport is an issue I have raised consistently with various Ministers but it is still a matter that is unresolved. I welcome the additional funding for the sector but figures I have received from the Department of Education show that 97,644 tickets have been issued for school transport this year. That is far short of the 130,144 applications.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">There is a shortfall of 32,500 seats in the school transport system, meaning one in four children has not got a place on a school bus this year. That is worse than in any other year. There should not be an annual struggle for places. It is not fair on families or students. School transport is vital and needs to be properly resourced. This year's shortfall has caused serious disruption for parents and working families who rely on school buses to bring their kids to and from school. Parents are left cramming their children into people carriers and following the bus to school, often with the children's siblings in the bus. It makes absolutely no sense. I ask that the various Departments and the Minister act on this immediately.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MarianHarkinIND" eId="spk_219">
          <from>Deputy Marian Harkin<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_484">I am sharing time with Deputy McNamara.</p>
          <p eId="para_485"> I agree with many of the proposals in this Finance Bill. In the current context, the IMF has told countries that can borrow that they should do so to provide a safety net for citizens and businesses. In that context, borrowing is not only necessary but it is also prudent.</p>
          <p eId="para_486"> Any finance Bill has to provide a safety net for those who need it and fund essential services, including social services, in addition to providing supports to businesses in all sectors and investing in them. It has to take into account the impact of Brexit and ensure that our healthcare system can work at full capacity to meet both Covid and non-Covid healthcare requirements. The measures, in addition to being financed by borrowing, should also be financed by a progressive tax system. With regard to many of those requirements, the Finance Bill delivers.</p>
          <p eId="para_487"> There are gaps, however. Some essential sectors have been left out or are not adequately supported. Early childcare services comprise an example. These are essential. The rest of the economy cannot function without quality childcare that is accessible and affordable. More supports are needed to put the sector on a firm footing.</p>
          <p eId="para_488"> I have spoken about this matter before but really want to speak about it again because it is so important. Just as childcare is an essential service, the work of family carers is simply indispensable. Our society could not function without family carers. Our health system would be overrun and our social welfare system would collapse, yet it is incredible but true to state carers are worse off after the budget than before. Although there was a €150 increase to the carer support grant, most carers do not receive this grant. For those who do, it will not be in place until July 2021. Also, the fuel allowance has been increased but the carer's allowance is not a qualifying payment for that allowance. Most family carers will not receive it, therefore. We all know the extra expense associated with heating a home when caring for somebody.</p>
          <p eId="para_489"> While I am happy that an additional 5 million crucial home care hours were provided, this has to be considered in light of the fact that only 40% or, at most, 50% of day services for adults with disabilities have not been reinstated. The income disregard for the carer's allowance, which is means tested, has not increased in 13 years. People will not believe that the carer's allowance was worth a little more in 2011 than it is now. I am not talking about taking inflation into account; I am talking about hard cash.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> Another area that I want to draw the Minister's attention to concerns the employment wage subsidy scheme. It is a very good scheme but it needs to be revised because there is a cliff edge for some businesses. If turnover is down 30%, the scheme can be accessed. It cannot be accessed, however, if the turnover is down 25%, 15% or 28%. A more graduated approach is important. For example, if a business's turnover is down by between 20% and 30%, it might get the €200, and if it is down by an amount between 10% and 20% it might get a different sum. If a business's turnover is down 25%, it is really not in its interest to try to push it up. If it closes for an extra day, its turnover will be down by more than 30%, and that is not good for it, its workers or the economy. Therefore, we need to get rid of the cliff edge. The scheme is good but there should be nuance in how it is managed.</p>
          <p eId="para_491"> I disagree with the Government's policy on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, in that the highest rate of payment, €350, should have been maintained. While payments should have been graduated, the highest rate should not have been reduced to €300. We must not forget that those accessing the payment have outgoings based on their previous income for rent, rates, the costs of childcare and food, and, basically, living. I am aware that €350 will not allow people to continue to live in the way to which they were accustomed. Nonetheless, the cut of €50 per week is really heartbreaking for many. It should be remembered that the money will be spent on food in local businesses, so it will circulate locally. Some of it will make its way back to the Exchequer through VAT, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_492"> In that context, I echo the words of Deputy Ó Cuív, who spoke earlier. The problem in question is not the fault of the Government as such, because it is matter of circumstances, but we need to do something about it. We are creating a two-tier society. Many people, including all in this House and other Houses, continue to receive their salaries but many others, because certain sectors have been closed or have collapsed, often quite rightly by order of the Government, have seen their incomes drop significantly. That is one reason the upper rate of the PUP should be €350, not €300. The €50 in the difference would not solve all the problems but it might take the edge off some of them. We are all in it together so the rationale rings a bit hollow for people who have seen their PUP cut. I ask the Minister to reconsider reinstating the higher rate, at least when we are in level 4 or level 5.</p>
          <p eId="para_493"> On the taxation of the PUP, we need clarity. Will the Minister confirm that any payment under the scheme was not taxable before July of this year? The payment was classified as an urgent-needs payment under section 202 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005. It seems, however, that this was changed during the summer through the Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Bill. The Finance Bill has added the payment to the list of welfare payments, which means it is taxable. First, we need clarity. We need to be sure there is a legal basis for what the Government is claiming. We are talking about 600,000 people. If the payment is taxable, some of them will have tax bills. This is my third time to raise this matter, having raised it before in July and in April or May.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">I was told that Revenue would work it out and so on, but we should remember that these people will have lost income and will be scrimping and saving. The last thing they will want next year or in subsequent years when they still have not caught up will be to face a tax bill or have their tax credits reduced, which essentially have the same effect. We need to clarify the situation and people need to be made aware of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_495"> I will quickly make three final points. According to Revenue, a young farmer is 35 years of age. If someone over 35 years of age buys a bit of land, he or she will pay stamp duty. According to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the EU, however, young farmers can be aged up to 40 years. This difference needs to be straightened out.</p>
          <p eId="para_496"> The Government has rolled over a number of agricultural schemes, but the money allocated to the new pilot rural environment protection scheme, REPS, is insufficient for the numbers exiting the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, and the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, which could amount to 20,000 or 25,000 farmers. Only €79 million or €80 million has been allocated. That is not good enough and is a real problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_497"> I wish to discuss community businesses briefly. These centres generate income for their communities and are run by volunteers. I have spoken to many of them. They have made application after application for some assistance in dealing with their costs, but if they are not open and providing services, they will get nothing. Will the Minister of State examine this issue?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcNamara" eId="spk_220">
          <from>Deputy Michael McNamara<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_498">I also wish to refer to Deputy Ó Cuív's speech, which I found interesting and impressive. I hope that all of these references to his speech by members of the Opposition do not land him in trouble within his party. Somewhat unusually for a politician, he demonstrated an ability to learn from the past, including mistakes, when this country relied on an orthodoxy and a group mentality. The Minister of State will recall that voices questioned the orthodoxy at the time. Indeed, very few of us who were involved in politics at the time will forget it. Those voices were drowned out and told that there would be a soft landing. People who questioned whether putting all our eggs in the property basket was wise were advised by the then Taoiseach that perhaps they should go and kill themselves. Others were described, not by the then Taoiseach, but by his Minister for Finance, as pinko liberals. Unfortunately, the pinko liberals came to dominate, but they were not Irish ones. They were sent in by the troika when we lost our financial independence. Like me, the Acting Chairman will clearly recall having to implement budgets on the advice of the IMF. Based on that experience, I view advice from the IMF with a little more caution than perhaps Deputy Harkin would. They were savage budgets because no one would lend to us, owing to us being broke. That is where we are heading now with our current borrowing.</p>
          <p eId="para_499"> Like other Deputies, I accept that businesses have been affected considerably by Covid-19. Covid-19 is a virus, so I do not buy into the wartime phraseology. It is a virus, no more, no less, but it is a serious virus and one that is affecting our economy. Our reaction as a State and as an economy to Covid-19 is doing even more damage, though. Not only are we borrowing money to seek to stimulate the economy to pull out of this, but almost uniquely in Europe we are actively closing sectors of our economy and borrowing money to compensate them for the fact that we have done so. I disagree with Deputy Harkin because I do not believe this is right. While I accept that there would be a significant downturn in many sectors of the economy without Government action, actively closing sectors of the economy and borrowing money to compensate them is economic suicide. The pandemic will cause a recession in every country in the West. Keynesian economics would suggest that the way to deal with a recession is to borrow money to generate growth again, but we are nowhere near that point. We are still at the stage of trying to deal with this situation. Borrowing money to compensate is not feasible. I share Deputy Ó Cuív's concern that, in the long term, there is a risk of hyperinflation. I look forward to the Minister of State addressing this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_500"> We see the graphs and are told that Ireland is fine. We are in the middle of the borrowings table in the eurozone at 6% of GDP, which places us alongside countries that we want to be like, but we are not in the middle in the real picture. If one views our borrowings as a percentage of GNI, they represent 11%. One could say that we were comparing apples and oranges. Spain would be the next highest country, but its GDP and GNI are not very different. It is in the Netherlands, Ireland and Luxembourg where there is a massive disparity between GDP and GNI. No matter which way we look at the situation, our borrowings as a percentage of GNI are at the top of the list in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_501"> It is not as if our GDP will not come under pressure as time moves on either, given that multinationals will come under pressure. Where the sweetheart deals that we offer multinationals are concerned, one can only eat someone else's lunch for so long. My wife tells me a funny story. She is slightly older than her younger brother and kept eating his sweets. Her father talks of her shock when she pushed her brother but he said she could not eat his sweets anymore. That is what we in Ireland are doing. We have to get real about that. What we are doing is not popular. No more than toddlers eating one another's sweets, countries eating one another's lunches is not popular.</p>
          <p eId="para_502"> Brexit will bring major difficulties, but when it is out of the way, there will be a move on our corporate tax base, in particular the earnings of companies that operate digitally. Countries are going to want a share of the revenues that are generated in their territories, be it a large economy like France, Germany or Spain or a smaller economy. Everyone will want a fair share of the revenues, and we will have to give the other EU states their shares eventually. That debate has largely been had and lost. We are not seeing its effects yet, but we will.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> I am concerned about where we are heading economically, but that is the macro picture. Let me revert to the micro picture. We are spending vast sums of money, some of it necessarily, large amounts of it unnecessarily, to deal with Covid-19 and its effects. The arrival of Covid-19 is not within our control and I will not pretend for a moment that it is, but how the State reacts to it is. There was a committee of 19 Deputies that I had the privilege of chairing. It made a number of recommendations on how to deal with this matter. It was generally accepted that Covid-19 had laid bare structural weaknesses in our State, one of which was the over-reliance on institutional and congregated care for our elderly. We are not unique in that over-reliance, given that many other countries have the same problem, but we need to move away from the only option being care in a nursing home or other congregated setting and towards care in the community. I welcome the allocation in the budget of 5 million additional hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">Like all headline figures, it sounds absolutely fantastic. It is a major inroad but let us break it down. A full home care package is 21 hours per week. It is not unreasonable to take the 21 hours per week and multiply it by the number of weeks in the year, since most people have home care packages for 52 weeks per year. When we do that, we find that the package provides home care for 4,579 extra people. That is welcome - I welcome it. However, at the start of this year we had 8,000 people waiting for home care packages in the State. While the measure will have an effect, it will not deal with the necessity to provide home care packages to people.</p>
          <p eId="para_505"> The issue of the fair deal has not been properly dealt with in respect of farm families or businesses more generally. That is an omission from this budget. People correctly expected that something might be done by this Government given the noises made in the last Dáil. I do not mean that in a pejorative way, rather I am referring to the advances that were made in the last Dáil towards having a fair deal package. Of course there is no fair deal package for people in respect of home care. There is an incentive to put people into an institution or a congregated setting rather than dealing with them in their communities. That was certainly something those in Fianna Fáil, when they were in opposition, made considerable noise about. I have heard far less about it, unfortunately, since they came to the Government. Anyway, it remains a priority for this State, one that needs to be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_506"> I wish to move to an issue that I highlighted during the budget. A total of €38 million was allocated for additional mental health services during the budget. Again, I welcome that, as I welcomed the additional 5 million home care hours. However, like the home care hours, it is not quite what it seems, because €38 million was allocated for additional mental health services but only €12 million was allocated for the existing level of services. Everyone knows that the existing level of services costs far more than €12 million to provide. In fact, the €38 million is not for additional services. Some of it will be used to provide for existing services, but not all of it, so there is an additional spend on mental health. I wish to be clear that I welcome this. I look forward to hearing the Minister of State deal with the macro points I have raised.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AlanFarrell" eId="spk_221" as="#Acting_Chairman">
          <from>Deputy Alan Farrell<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T16:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_507">I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to address the Finance Bill. I welcome the Minister of State. I find myself wanting to start where I had planned on finishing, that is to say, talking about the long-term sustainability of budgets of this nature. This is so given the volume of borrowing that will be necessary to fund expenditure in 2021 in addition, no doubt, to voluminous amounts of borrowing next year to meet the demands of subsequent years. It would be unfortunate if Deputy Ó Cuív mentioned all of this already. I heard the beginning of his contribution and then I took a telephone call. By the time I got off the call, he had finished. I am unsure whether he went down the same road I wish to highlight, that is to say, I believe we have to be cautious about what it is and how it is we propose to fund this.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> That being said, the budget is obviously a three-pronged approach. The first is Covid-19, the second is Brexit and the third is the day-to-day running of the country. I accept that all three are absolutely necessary. If it had not been for the actions of this House in the past decade we would not have been in a position to borrow as we have done and will continue to do in the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_509"> I wish to take the opportunity to comment on several sections of the budget and the Finance Bill and indeed in general terms in respect of a couple of Departments. One has to accept the vast increase in expenditure in all Departments, including, to name a few, the Departments of Health, Social Protection, Business, Enterprise and Innovation and Finance in the context of future provision for public expenditure and pensions and the steps that are being implemented in the context of the budget. We should consider what this will mean for taxpayers and citizens throughout the country in light of the decision of the coalition Government to adhere to the commitment given by the then Opposition to amend our existing legislation. I understand that today the commission on pensions was formally established. It is important that we recognise the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Finance will have a major role to play in that process in terms of financing future pension provision. The findings of the commission might change future budgets as a result of the political commitments given. I accept this.</p>
          <p eId="para_510"> I wish to talk about the Department of Social Protection. I commend the former and current Cabinets on the steps they have taken with the pandemic unemployment supports across various Departments. I am referring not only to the pandemic unemployment payment but to those supports offered to enterprise as well. It is important to acknowledge that some of the schemes are not perfect. I can think of examples, including the State-backed loan guarantee that is being offered. Some firms complain that they are unable to access it because financial institutions are not taking the risk, even though there is an 80% risk on the part of the State. Of course, it is unfortunate that while the State may be backing some of these companies, there has to be acknowledgements of risk. Certain firms, unfortunately, have been unable to avail of such provisions and have had to rely on restart grants from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation. This is in the context of the fact that they have had to shut down, primarily because they were not seen as viable financial entities beyond the shutdown. That is unfortunate but, having worked in the sector many years ago on the analysis side of creditworthiness, I recognise that the financial institutions should perhaps take a greater risk. Yet, there are concerns about the long-term economic impact of Covid-19 and the undoubted recession that will follow. The concern is this may have an impact on the longevity of certain companies, regardless of whether they receive State-backed loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_511"> I welcome the debate that has started again on the minimum wage. The reason I mention this is because the Covid pandemic unemployment payment has highlighted the disparity between what we need to do and what we have done thus far. I recognise that in the past decade the minimum wage has increased seven times. I recognise that in the past decade the minimum wage has increased by 25%. I also recognise that the cost of living in this country has always been higher than in our near neighbours. Therefore, we must recognise that our minimum wage should reflect that.</p>
          <p eId="para_512"> The pandemic unemployment payment also highlights another thing. It is the disparity between the payment of €350 and the unemployment payment of €203. The question is whether some form of tapered system can be introduced in future, perhaps after Covid. This could permit us to recognise that an individual who loses his job should in fact be supported more than someone who might be on welfare support for three months or six months after losing a job. Maybe some form of enhanced payment system should be introduced. As a legislative body, we need to have that discussion, perhaps at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach or at the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands. This should be the start of the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_513"> Deputy Harkin has raised a particular point in the House previously. Coincidentally, I was in the Chair the last time she raised the point. She referred to the potential tax burden of the pandemic unemployment payment. I echo her concerns. Individuals who find themselves on the pandemic unemployment payment are, by and large, those who are on lower income. This was the case prior to the recent move to level 5, but certainly before then, statistically, many such persons were on lower pay. Are we really looking as a Legislature at that sector with a view to insisting that they have a tax bill in a year or two? These individuals are most certainly not self-employed.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">They have never done this before. Most of them are probably PAYE workers. Now we are asking them to file tax returns. I think that will present a difficulty. I have stated this before in another forum but it is something we should consider.</p>
          <p eId="para_515"> I mentioned that the budget's three main targets were Covid, Brexit and the day-to-day costs of running the country. I recognise the very significant increase in budgetary allocations towards various Government Departments, one being the Department of Health, which of course will be at the forefront of our response to Covid-19. However, the allocation to that Department must also address the chronic deficiency in primary healthcare and recognise our ability to meet the demands of our society in the context of our inability to hire relevant experts and consultants, for instance. I will not talk about the GP contract, but we must recognise that there has been and continues to be a difficulty in rural Ireland in promoting a sufficient number of GPs to cater for the community. The difficulty is not limited to rural Ireland. In parts of my constituency one has to wait three, four or five days to get a call back from one's GP for an appointment. These are medium-sized towns. It must be recognised that if this were a normal budget, the Department of Health would not be getting nearly as much and we would not be tackling those issues. Therefore, while healthcare is in focus, we have to recognise what the next step is in order to meet the demands of the Irish citizen.</p>
          <p eId="para_516"> Staying with healthcare, I acknowledge the changes to the prescription charges and the unjust and unfair levy applied to people with medical needs. Like Deputies McNamara, Durkan and Fleming, I was here pressing buttons when that levy was introduced, but it should have been abolished years ago. I recognise and acknowledge that it is moving in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> I also wish to refer to the likes of the fuel allowance to offset part of the cost of the increased carbon taxation that has been applied and the supports in that regard. I hope that in 2021, as we head towards the budget for that financial year, we recognise that we have not adjusted headline social welfare rates for our pensioners in particular. We should do that because we know that the fuel allowance does not cover the costs of carbon taxation and will not in the future. As a Legislature, we have to recognise that and ensure that the safety net is there and that we are not simply piling costs onto persons on fixed incomes. They cannot go off and get a job and earn a few bob to cover the extra costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> I recognise with appreciation the additional supports being issued to the Department of Education, in particular in respect of the pupil-teacher ratio and children in special education. The allocation of these allowances in budgets through the Minister, Deputy Foley, and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, is really welcome and a step in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_519"> Finally, I recognise the unprecedented nature not only of our budget but also of our capital budget, which in one financial year is €10 billion - €10.1 billion, I think. This has to be recognised and has indeed been acknowledged. The scale of the work ahead of us across most Government Departments to ensure we meet the demands of Irish society in 2021 is enormous. It would be a real struggle to spend it all but it would also be a real struggle not to recognise that the level of infrastructural deficit that has been present in this country for many decades has to be bridged. We need, however, to do this in a sustainable way that recognises our ability as a State to fund such provisions and ensure we recognise that while we have a responsibility to try to modernise public services and the capital infrastructure surrounding those services, we also have to do so in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way. That means we need to make sure we hit our targets in our climate action plan. I refer in particular to public transport in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_520"> Considering where we were this month 12 months ago in the context of implementing budget 2020, little did we know we would find ourselves 11 or 12 months later in a world turned upside down, dominated by the attempt to control a global pandemic where hundreds of thousands have died and 3,000 members of our society have, unfortunately, succumbed to its effects. I therefore commend the Government. I also acknowledge some of the work of Members of the previous Dáil, in particular the previous Cabinet, on framing all this, and indeed I recognise members of the Opposition for forcing the Government to frame it in such a way. It is really important we recognise that there is a requirement of all of us sometimes to put down the party flag - or the non-party flag, as the case may be - and get behind a concept. In this instance the Department of Social Protection in particular has to be recognised as having responded amicably and appropriately to the pandemic. I commend the Ministers, Deputies Michael McGrath and Donohoe, and the Ministers of State in their two Departments for the enormous volume of work they must now go through to ensure we as a society are able to tackle this issue together and come out in the end, I hope, stronger for it. I thank the Acting Chairman for affording me the opportunity to speak.</p>

        <speech by="#CatherineConnolly" eId="spk_222">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Connolly<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T16:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_521">Is fada an lá ó bhí 20 nóiméad agam chun páirt a ghlacadh i ndíospóireacht, so déanfaidh mé mo dhícheall an 20 nóiméad sin a úsáid go héifeachtach, ag díriú isteach ar na laigí atá sa reachtaíocht seo agus, níos tábhachtaí arís, an deis caillte ag an Rialtas athruithe cuimsitheacha a dhéanamh. Níor thapaigh sé an deis dul i ngleic leis na dúshláin atá os ár gcomhair maidir le hathrú aeráide, le Covid agus leis an mBreatimeacht, srl. It is a long time since I had 20 minutes to make a contribution in the Dáil. I think the last time the system allowed me 20 minutes was on the O'Higgins report. I made use of that time and hope I make effective use of these 20 minutes.</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> I wish to make two preliminary comments before I go into the bulk of the few words I wish to say. I was not expecting to speak today, which brings me to my first comment, on the changes to the speaking arrangements. My colleague, Deputy Pringle, sits on the Business Committee and he and the other colleagues on my left have fought a great battle not to change the arrangements. In spite of that, the majority of members of the committee changed the arrangements so the lesser parties have less time - not less time as such but less time by default because they are pushed down the pecking order. I am now up the pecking order today because, interestingly enough, many backbench Government Deputies, who cry out for more time, did not come in and use that time. I could not let the moment pass without saying that because this Bill was to go into another week of debate and not be completed today. It is very important because the Government has been disingenuous in saying there is not less time for the smaller parties. Actually, there is, and it is by default we are speaking today. I welcome that. As they say in Latin, <i>carpe diem</i>, seize the day, or seize the opportunity. I will do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_523"> I wish to make a second preliminary comment. In the rough and tumble of politics things are said, but earlier today Deputy Michael Moynihan talked about the former Minister, Ms Zappone, and singled her out.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">I believe the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, was there. I rarely do this but I am in my capacity now as an Independent Deputy. It really captured why we cannot make the transformative change necessary, which I will come back to, that we single out one Independent Deputy for failing to deal with disability at a time where Fianna Fáil supported the Government. Was it confidence and supply? I am not going to score political points but that is the fact. Fianna Fáil supported the Government at that time. To give one example, that Government withdrew the miserly €31.80 rehabilitative training allowance. It was not, however, miserly to those affected who received it. The Minister of State will remember we all got representations at the time. That Government, of which Katherine Zappone was just one member, was supported by Fianna Fáil. She was not the Minister with responsibility for disability so I could not just let it go. I was certainly, I hope, constructively critical of Katherine Zappone but that attack allows the Government, and the supporting Government at the time, which was Fianna Fáil, off the hook.</p>
          <p eId="para_525"> I have welcomed the good things in this budget. If the Minister of State will forgive me, I will not repeat them today because I want to zone in on a bigger issue. There are certainly good things in the budget and I highlighted some of them in my previous contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_526"> This, however, is a budget like no other because it is a budget facing a time like no other. It is a time to make transformative change. That word "transformative" has become almost a cliché but we make it a cliché at our peril. We need to make it a reality if we are going to survive the challenges that face us captured by climate change and biodiversity emergencies, Covid-19 and Brexit. I do not say it lightly but Covid-19 and Brexit pale into insignificance compared with what we face with climate change and flooding which we discussed yesterday and the day before.</p>
          <p eId="para_527"> Deputy McNamara raised the matter of his committee. I want to praise the Deputy McNamara for the Trojan work he and the cross-party members did on that committee. This is what is important and this relates to the budget. In a short period, they brought experts in before them and produced and published a report that was promptly ignored. They actually managed to put Irish into it as well. Bhí píosa trí Ghaeilge istigh ann. Ní raibh sé go léir iomlán dátheangach ach rinneadh iarracht an Ghaeilge a chur isteach. They published that report and it was absolutely ignored. As the Deputy said, they highlighted the structural weaknesses in the system and they were obvious.</p>
          <p eId="para_528"> When we stood up for the first time back in March to talk about the emergency legislation, I referred to a letter we received from a particular union before Covid-19 started highlighting the serious situation in the health service. This is my fourth time referring to it. We did not need a letter from the union but the contents were stark regarding the situation there and the lack of primary care.</p>
          <p eId="para_529"> We went into Covid-19, therefore, with huge structural difficulties and huge equality in our health system. That did not happen accidentally. That happened as a result of Government policy. I spent approximately ten years of my life on a health forum and I saw at first hand what happened when the Progressive Democrats were in coalition and led the privatisation of our health service, which comes back to the point Deputy McNamara made. I am not saying he agreed with me but it did not happen by accident that 80% of our nursing homes became private. That just did not happen. That happened as a result of Government policy and, in fact, there was a time not too long ago when it was the other way around. I do not believe it was Fianna Fáil policy but, unfortunately, Fianna Fáil was led by the nose by the Progressive Democrats and it instituted a policy that ran down the public health system and absolutely resourced the private system. I saw this at first hand. I saw this in 2007 and 2008 when reports came back from the HSE saying the cost of refurbishment was why beds were closed. Beds were closed in 2006 and 2007 before the crash as a result of policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_530"> We can fast-forward to Covid-19 and NPHET. I am not here to criticize NPHET but from day one it did not have a broad representation. It did its job as it saw fit as a group of medics but there was not a broad representation. There was, therefore, no voice for the nursing homes, meat factories or direct provision centres. Afterwards, a narrative was given that there was a voice but there was not. I checked all the minutes until I ran out of energy. I did not see a discussion of the nursing homes or meat factories in March or April certainly but by May they were being mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_531"> Covid-19 highlighted our structural inequalities and the resources were used for that as opposed to looking at the nursing homes which we knew were in crisis. We have had years of HIQA reports pointing out the good things, absolutely, but also highlighting the problems in terms of infection control, the lack of staff or not enough mix with the staff or the absence of care plans. We went into Covid-19 and HIQA knew exactly what was going on in the nursing homes. I am not sure if anybody in NPHET asked HIQA in the beginning about the state of nursing homes or if HIQA would like to tell it. I am not sure. Perhaps, the inquiry Deputy McNamara's committee asked for will happen in due course regarding what happened the nursing homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> We can play with figures but I am not going to because the Minister of State is very good at figures. He did tremendous work on the Committee of Public Accounts. I am not someone to argue with him about figures. This is not about figures, however, this is about what budget is necessary at this point in our history where we have all agreed there is no going back. From day one, two messages came out of Covid-19. We seem to have lost them now. One was that we are all in this together and the second was that there is no going back. We simply cannot go back because our economy and the way we were doing it was not sustainable.</p>
          <p eId="para_533"> If we say that, and if language is to mean something, we need a budget to reflect there is no going back. Without a doubt, the Minister did the right thing with the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and with the wage subsidy scheme. I have praised him for that. Yesterday, however, we looked at a sunset clause and I will bring it straight back to the topic. The sunset clause for the extra draconian powers we gave to the Garda to close down public houses was due to run out on 9 November. The Government came forward and asked the Opposition to extend that because we insisted and forced the Government to come back before the Dáil. The Government accepted that and came back in and had some measure of debate. Then, it asked that the clause would be extended until next June without any evidence or any basis and won by a majority.</p>
          <p eId="para_534"> In a nutshell, the Government extended the powers to the Garda in a time when the pubs were closed which is quite ironic. All the pubs were closed and we gave it extra powers to go in and inspect them. In the period since September before the pubs closed, the Garda never once needed those powers. That is a strange type of narrative to come in and say the Government needs to provide draconian powers, although the Minister said we were honestly never going to use them, but it was a deterrent.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> It is the same thing with climate change. Rather than bringing us all on board together, and recognising that we did not lead but the people on the ground and the children led us when we declared a climate emergency and a biodiversity emergency, what do we do? We associate climate change action with a carbon tax, and not just a once-off tax but one tied in for the next few years. I have my own views on it but whatever about the pros and cons of the carbon tax, it is not a good message and it is not effective to associate the need for behaviour change with carbon tax. I could not put it any better than my colleagues. Deputies Bríd Smith and Paul Murphy spoke excellently this afternoon about how we are not taxing those who are polluting the most. Now we have a Bill that ties in a carbon tax which will affect the poorest and those most disenfranchised by our unequal system. That is not a good message.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">Equally, it is not a good message to send out in this time of Covid that people will be punished if they do not behave. What is needed is not punishment but education, encouragement and leadership. That leadership has been sorely lacking.</p>
          <p eId="para_537"> I will turn now to some of the provisions in the budget. When the Government introduced the PUP of €350 per week, it received support and praise from us all. The level at which the payment was set was a recognition that this was the minimum needed by the people who had lost their jobs during the Covid crisis. That recognition should have spurred the Government on to consider whether the others who are unemployed might also need €350. It should have spurred the Government into looking at what might be the basic wage that people need to live. The Government should have given its consideration to those questions in the context of the salaries of people in this House. I make no apology for earning a salary for the work we do. However, it is a relevant consideration when thinking about what would constitute a basic living wage that would allow everyone to participate in society. Not only did the Government not give any consideration to those questions but, as quickly as it could, it reduced the rate of the PUP. There followed a welcome U-turn in that regard but now the Government is going to tax the payment. It does not make sense to do so when so many people are depending on it to stay afloat.</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> The 10 cent increase in the minimum wage is an insult. There was no movement in the budget on social welfare payments and pensions. I welcome the increase in the annual allowance for carers and the introduction of additional home care hours. However, while the provision of 5 million additional hours looks good when I am standing here, I am left wondering, when I go back to Claddagh or Galway city, what it will actually mean for people. A previous speaker mentioned that the basic home care package is 20 plus hours per week. I do not know anybody in Galway who is on that care package. I know families who are getting ten or 12 hours. I know there are families caring for people with dementia, morning, noon and night, who get 12 hours a week. The Tánaiste has spoken about the people who get up early in the morning. Some of these people hardly get to bed because they are engaged in caring duties all the time. They might get a nap during the day. I am not exaggerating when I say this and I am only using the anecdote to illustrate the general point. If we are asking people to perform a caring function and giving them only ten or 12 hours of home care provision, after a lengthy waiting time, then it puts the extra 5 million hours into perspective. Who will that additional provision help? Will it be used to clear the backlog or will it do something else? Does the Minister of State accept that when somebody is caring for a person with dementia 24-7 and is getting only 12 hours of home help a week and no other respite - there is no respite in these Covid times - then there is a problem? These people are a fundamental part of the economy. Without carers, the economy cannot thrive. Significantly, the majority of carers are women, which tells its own story. That is in no way to diminish the work of the men in caring roles but it does give added significance to our failure to treat carers with respect in order that they, in turn, can treat the vulnerable and sick with dignity and respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> It is nothing short of shocking that the help-to-buy scheme is being extended. I am no expert on figures, so I will turn to the experts to illustrate my point. The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has described it as a "poorly targeted policy likely to fuel house price growth". This is the scheme the Government is extending. The ESRI points out that it has cost more than €300 million to date as against an anticipated cost of €130 million. The Minister will be very familiar with those types of cost overruns from his time as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts. Social Justice Ireland has said that the scheme "artificially stimulated the property market by providing a benefit to those who need it least." A boost is being given to those in least need of it and, meanwhile, the word "crisis" does not capture what is happening with public housing. Taking Galway as an example, I know of somebody who has been on the housing waiting list since 2003 or 2005. I cannot get an answer as to why this person has not been offered a house in 15 to 17 years. That is the extent of the dysfunction and crisis in the housing situation in Galway and the service being offered to people. At the same time, there is, of necessity, huge expenditure on homelessness. On my walk every day to and from the accommodation in which I am privileged to live, I see people sleeping in doorways. This morning, I saw somebody doing fantastic work tending to these people and checking that they were still alive. I do not know how the Government can say there is a thriving economy when that is going on. The two simply do not go together.</p>
          <p eId="para_540"> More than €1 billion is being put into various schemes to support people to make rental payments. How can the Minister of State, with his background, justify that amount of money going into the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and long-term leasing, and claim it is not boosting prices in the private market? We must do away with the HAP scheme but it cannot be done overnight. I ask the Minister of State not to waste time by claiming that I have called for it to be got rid of overnight. That is not what I am saying. I wish the scheme was not in place and that the State had built houses instead, but that is not what happened. Fine Gael and the Labour Party enshrined the HAP scheme in housing legislation and said it was the only game in town. That was in 2014 or 2015 and, since then, the HAP scheme has indeed been the only game in town. I see colleagues nodding in agreement. That is the language that was spoken in Galway city. From 2009 until a year ago, no houses were built in Galway because, we were told, the HAP scheme was the only game in town. Simon Communities of Ireland have told us that most people were priced out of the rental market as a result. The policy is sick but it has been enshrined once again in this budget with the increased allocation for the various schemes, including long-term leasing. When I read the newspaper, I see properties being singled out for long-term leasing back to Dublin City Council instead of public housing being built on public land.</p>
          <p eId="para_541"> I have two further points to make before my time runs out. The first relates to the Office of Public Works, OPW, which does great work and for which I have great admiration. I see no reason that it could not be used more effectively to deal with the housing crisis, rather than relying on the Land Development Agency, which does not have the same background and statutory underpinning. I ask the Minister of State to reflect on the potential role for the OPW, with its vast experience, in tackling the housing crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_542"> My final point concerns the situation of people aged over 66, as referred to by a number of speakers. The ESRI has indicated that there were 65,000 people over the age of 66 engaged in some form of paid work in the final quarter of 2019. They have been given nothing under any of the schemes the Government has introduced. We encourage them to work and, in some cases, make them work, but then we do not provide for them.</p>

        <speech by="#KieranODonnell" eId="spk_223">
          <from>Deputy Kieran O'Donnell<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T16:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_543">I am pleased to contribute to this debate. The Finance Bill is always introduced after the budget and is a key component of the budgetary process. This year's budget is akin to a wartime budget. The deadly Covid virus has had a huge impact on how the economy functions and how people go about their daily lives. Its impact on businesses and on people trying to do their jobs has been immense.</p>
          <p eId="para_544"> I want to touch on a number of key points in my contribution. As a Deputy for the Limerick City constituency, I see the issues that affect my constituents in their daily lives. The Finance Bill includes provision for the introduction of the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS. It is extremely important that sufficient consideration is given to the different elements of this scheme and the provisions it needs to include. Many business people are saying they will be excluded from it. I hope that these issues will form part of the consideration of the Bill on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> Finance Bills are typically used to give effect to provisions that have huge significance.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">The Minister of State will be well aware of the recent Supreme Court ruling on primary medical certificates. That is causing considerable difficulty where the HSE locally is not able to process these applications. I ask that consideration be given to expediting the amending of the relevant legislation in the Finance Bill itself to enable the processing of the primary medical certificates. It is hugely important.</p>
          <p eId="para_547"> In a Georgian Limerick context, the living city initiative has come up for review on a number of occasions. It is a welcome scheme but a body of work needs to be done around it. This is something I have called for. Limerick city has the largest footprint of Georgian buildings in the country. It runs all the way from Nicholas Street down as far as Barrington Street, encompassing virtually the entire footprint of the city centre. I believe it should be the catalyst to enable people to start living in the city. It needs to be looked at again to see how it is working. It is a tax-based scheme. It would be hugely important.</p>
          <p eId="para_548"> I welcome the fact that €10 million was given towards Shannon and Cork airports in the budget. Shannon is vital for the region. I also welcome that funding has been provided for transport initiatives and it is hugely important that we get it right. A draft transportation strategy for the Limerick-Shannon region was published recently. Public submissions were made up to 30 October. I held a virtual public meeting a week ago in which 70 to 80 people took part. I have asked that the National Transport Authority, NTA, would pause, revisit and revise the scheme. We want something that works and that enables Limerick city to do what it is being asked to do under Project Ireland 2040, which is have an increase in population of over 50% by 2040. To enable it to do that, the road system is very much endorsed within the plan: the northern distributor road, the N20, the Adare bypass and the upgrade of the N69 to Foynes. The fact that we are linking both Limerick city and Shannon Airport is hugely significant and I welcome that funding. However, we have to get it right whereby we have a rail network that effectively uses the existing rail network around the city and where we link up the likes of the Parkway and link into Moyross and then onwards to Cratloe from where we can complete a spur to Shannon Airport. These are all hugely important.</p>
          <p eId="para_549"> I will put in context what I believe a budget should do. A budget should be fair. A budget is basically the overarching financial roadmap for the following year that the Government lays down. I want to see the details of the economic plan. That will be hugely important. When does the Minister of State expect that plan to be announced? It must be, in essence, a mini-national development plan for the next year. I would like to see it in terms of Shannon Airport and the cities.</p>
          <p eId="para_550"> On Covid, we are now in level 5 and the number of virus cases is coming down. Come 1 December, I want us to be able to move into a level where people can function over Christmas and where people can fly home. I brought the latter point up at the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications Networks, which I chair, with Dr. Tony Holohan recently and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, all public health permitting. Covid has been very difficult for business people. We must ensure we support them. That is why the business support must be strong enough to ensure businesses can come through level 5, that they can retain their employees and that we get the economy back up and running.</p>
          <p eId="para_551"> As a Deputy representing the constituency of Limerick City, which includes Birdhill and Ballinahinch in north Tipperary, I believe it is hugely important that we come through this crisis. The key will be the Finance Bill. In the context of the Finance Bill, the primary medical certificates need to be looked at. Does the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, cover everyone? We need to look at how the living city initiative in Limerick city can be reviewed in order that we can make it the real gateway to get people back into living in the city.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanFleming" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance" eId="spk_224">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Sean Fleming)<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T16:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_552">I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate. I will respond, inasmuch as I can, in the short time available.</p>
          <p eId="para_553"> I will make one overall point, which is that one must bear in mind that we are responding to the Covid-19 crisis, the threat of Brexit and the longer-term but not any less urgent issue of climate change and the Finance Bill must necessarily take account of all of these issues. All three are important. All three must be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_554"> The issue that was probably raised most frequently here during the debate is a difficult one but it is clear. I genuinely believe that most Deputies knew from the day it was announced that the pandemic unemployment payment is and always was taxable. The Minister for Finance has said so repeatedly since its introduction. The effect of section 3 of the Bill is to designate the pandemic unemployment payment in the tax code as an emolument to which Chapter 4 of Part 2 of the Taxes Consolidation Act applies and, accordingly, charged to tax under Schedule D to the Taxes Consolidation Act. While that language is somewhat technical, if this requires ordinary traditional PAYE workers to file a tax return, I understand the complications of that. It is not something they would normally have had to do and that is a valid issue which, I am sure, will get discussed in detail on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_555"> From the very beginning, the Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020, the legislation for the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, referred to that payment as a payment made under section 102 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, and that section was used only as a convenience to get money out in a hurry. That is normally what people might use for supplementary welfare payments or emergency payments. The onset of Covid was an emergency and that section allowed payments be made in a hurry, immediately, quickly and promptly. That is why we used that particular section of the Act to make this payment through.</p>
          <p eId="para_556"> It was never a payment, such as the supplementary welfare allowance, that normally would go through that section of the Act because supplementary welfare allowances by their nature are normally a once-off payment. The PUP payments that were made between 13 March and 15 August were not once-off payments. They were made week in, week out on several occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_557"> The PUP is an income support and shares the characteristics of jobseeker's benefit. Everybody knows jobseeker's benefit is taxed. To give a layman's version, payments through social welfare, such as supplementary welfare allowance and jobseeker's allowance, are not subject to tax. Payments in relation to income and contributions, such as jobseeker's benefit, have always been taxed. If somebody was in employment for a month or two or three during a normal year which had nothing to do with Covid, and he or she was on jobseeker's benefit drawing on his or her contributions - the PUP relates to people who were in employment as it is employment related - it was included in the person's total income at the end of the year. The simple rule of thumb - not precise but the one that most people will understand - is that if the payment is akin to a jobseeker's benefit payment, it is subject to tax like jobseeker's benefit already is and always has been, whereas if it was akin to jobseeker's allowance, a long-term social welfare payment or supplementary welfare allowance, it normally would not be subject to tax. There is a complete difference. There is a Schedule to the Social Welfare Act - it has been there for a long number of years - and unless something is listed in that particular Schedule, it is subject to tax. The Schedule lists mainly issues such as allowance payments and jobseeker's allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_558"> I know Deputies are disappointed with that reply. There was much discussion over many months about when this tax comes to be paid. The question is, will people get a shock at the end of the year - several Deputies on all sides of the House were involved in this discussion - and when would they have to pay it back. Deputies were told the Revenue will come to an arrangement. Now the Minister has agreed it does not have to be paid or commenced if there is tax due and the Covid payment results in a person having to pay tax, which includes the tax on the employment they are already in.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">If somebody does not go back to work and is not in a taxable situation, then this payment may not bring them into the tax net. For those who do go back into employment and have other taxable income, this will come into the reckoning in that situation. The Minster has said that can roll out for up to four years, to pay it back. I raise this because there were several debates in the House about when the tax was going to fall due and some Deputies are almost suggesting they never knew it was taxable, despite us having discussed the arrangements for the payment and the tax on the PUP all along. I just want to be straight on that. It might not be the easy thing to say but if Deputies check the Official Report, they will understand. I am trying to be straight with people because the last thing I want is for people to have the wrong impression and to then get a shock. I do not want to sidestep the issue, I want to make it crystal clear that that is the actual situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_560"> There was a lot of discussion about the carbon tax. Many Deputies have referred to the tax, particularly the increase to €100 per tonne by 2030, suggesting that it was the wrong approach. Across a series of studies dating back to 1992, independent modelling undertaken by the ESRI has confirmed that a rising carbon tax is likely to be the single most effective climate policy that can be pursued by Government. In order to protect the most vulnerable from the impacts of these increases a targeted package of social protection interventions has been developed. The package is informed by the ESRI research that was commissioned to specifically address this issue. It includes an increase in the fuel allowance by €3.50 per week, an increase in the qualifying child payment of €2 for children under 12 and €5 for those over 12 and an increase in the living alone allowance worth €5 per week. Therefore, there are mitigating measures acknowledging that people in those categories will suffer most. The point that a carbon tax can hit people on lowest incomes the most is well made, well accepted and well understood. That is why we have put these balancing mitigation measures in place. The point is accepted across the board and there is no dispute on it. It would be very unfair to increase the carbon tax without these extra compensatory measures. They might not be as much as everybody would like but they deal with those who are in the front line as far as extra costs are concerned. I hope the measures will be of benefit when they come in early in the new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_561"> On the CRSS, a number of Deputies mentioned that businesses that do not operate from a fixed premises are not eligible to participate in it. Support provided under this scheme will be in the form of valuable upfront cash payments which will enable eligible businesses to meet costs associated with their premises, such as rent, insurance and utilities, at a time when, because of the specific terms of the restrictions announced by the Government, they cannot provide goods or services to their customers or can only do so to a limited extent. To increase the scope of scheme to cover any businesses impacted by Covid-19 would fundamentally change its targeted nature. It is important that most schemes the Government will be operating now will take sectoral and targeted approaches rather than be across the board for every business, some of which might not need the support as much as others. The Government understands the difficulties faced by businesses and there are a number of other measures of which Deputies will be aware. The Covid pandemic payment can help in some of those as can the employment wage subsidy scheme. There are also schemes for businesses to warehouse VAT and PAYE debts. The temporary wage subsidy scheme can be of help to some people in these situations also, and arrangements are in place for warehousing of unpaid income tax for 2019 and preliminary tax for 2020 for self-assessed taxpayers, if applicable. I understand that the scheme has just opened up and over 2,600 businesses have registered nearly 2,900 premises for the CRSS revenue in recent days. Payments will hopefully be made as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_562"> The issue of coach operators was mentioned and they may be able to avail of the coach tourism business continuity scheme. There are a large number of schemes available through Fáilte Ireland which are specific to the hospitality, catering and tourism sector. Schemes are also available through local authorities. If I have one criticism it is that there are so many schemes out there from so many organisations and State bodies that one would need a compendium to put them all together. Some people might feel they are excluded from this scheme but in many cases there are other ones that can help them, so it is important to say that.</p>
          <p eId="para_563"> Several Deputies made the point about the help-to-buy scheme that 40% of applicants have a loan-to-value ratio of less than 85%. The Deputies might appreciate that they may have been referring to houses that were purchased rather than those which were self-built. There are different metrics applied to both because the value of the site does not come into account with the loan-to-value ratio when we are dealing with this scheme for people who are self-building normally on their own sites. It is important to say that. On this scheme, most people understand that the State has always helped people who are in a position to do so to buy their own homes. We had the mortgage interest relief scheme for decades upon decades. Most houses in Ireland were bought under that scheme and most of us were reared in houses bought under it or in social houses owned by local authorities. The concept of the State giving some little help through the tax system to people who are going to house themselves is almost part of the DNA of the people. Frankly, I am shocked that there are so many Deputies against the concept of the State helping people buy their own homes. I just cannot understand it. One may say that the builder might make a few bob out of it and argue about the statistics but the essence of the scheme is that first time buyers own their home. It is a great thing that the State should support people in this. We have done it for decades and I hope it continues. Maybe some Deputies do not like people owning their own homes and have a different political agenda. That is a matter for another day, however. I have made the position very clear on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_564"> Deputies Mairéad Farrell and Pringle referred to the provisions of the Bill in respect of NATO and the EU member states. I had to look this one up; it is definitely an interesting issue. It concerns member states undertaking a common defence effort. Ireland has a legal requirement to transpose the provision of the VAT and general excise directives to apply a zero rate of VAT and exemption for excise to certain supplies of goods and services with effect from 1 July 2020 to forces of the member states undertaking a common defence effort under the European Union's common security and defence policy. As such, failure to do so would be an infringement by Ireland. We are required to do that as a result of our involvement in the European Union's common security and defence policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_565"> The issue of corporation tax was raised, with some Deputies suggesting we move to have an effective rate of 6% imposed. Deputies will not be surprised when I say this Government certainly has no plans to change the current 12.5% rate. We know the importance of corporation tax and the major multinationals in Ireland because they pay very high salaries and wages compared to those paid to people in Irish-owned companies. They are normally nearly double the amount. The employees pay nearly twice as much in income tax as people working for Irish companies because the multinationals pay such high wages. That is one of the main reasons income tax receipts have remained high during the pandemic. Higher-paid workers have continued paying tax even though many people have lost their jobs and are now on the PUP and the TWSS. Due to the progressive nature of the Irish tax system, those on higher wages and salaries pay a very high level of income tax and many of those are still on the books and being employed by their companies and that is why the income tax has kept up so much.</p>
          <p eId="para_566"> Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned the issue of the film industry. It is indeed a requirement that for people to benefit from this scheme, they must be in compliance with the relevant employment legislation in order to claim film tax relief. I think people would accept that that is only fair. We cannot be giving tax incentives to people who do not meet the normal employment conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_567"> I refer to the disabled drivers scheme. There was a Supreme Court decision on this matter recently. The Department is currently examining a range of options, including amendments to the regulations and the primary legislation. The Minister is anxious that this be done as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_568"> Finally, Deputies Paul Murphy and Mairéad Farrell implied that the increase in time allowed under the stamp duty refund scheme is a gift to developers. This is a particular section in the Bill and the Deputies were the only ones to mention it.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">Nothing could be further from the truth. This is not the case. It is a limited measure in the legislation that takes account of the impact of Covid 19 measures and the ability to complete development in the time allowed. It also seeks to address issues with the completion of large-scale multi-phased developments, mainly for apartments. Covid has slowed down the development of some of these. It is only right the stamp duty legislation reflects this but obviously somebody has a different view on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_570"> I have tried to deal with most of the issues that have been raised as best I can. Several Deputies asked me to comment on free money and whether we are spending a lot of money, and the Deputies understand that. Deputy Ó Cuív had a 20-minute philosophical discussion on the matter and a few other speakers contributed on the topic. All I will say is there is no free money. Every penny we get has to be paid back. The reason we call it free is that interest is low at present. When the time comes to be repaid, interest rates may have risen. Calling it free money implies we are getting money for nothing and that it is like a grant. No grant is being given to Ireland under these measures. We are borrowing and every euro we borrow ultimately will have to be paid back, and the interest on that debt is an issue that may arise in due course. All of this money has to be paid back. I will be happy to continue the philosophical discussion with Deputy Ó Cuív on another occasion outside the Chamber.</p>
          <p eId="para_571"> I thank all of the Deputies for their comments during the debate yesterday and today. As the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has already said, we will consider any suggestion made during the Committee Stage debate, including amendments that are proposed. I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to Committee Stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_575">I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to deal with this important issue, which concerns the midwifery-led unit in Cavan General Hospital. I am sure he has been briefed on the background to this unit, which was established back in 2004. Sixteen years on, it has delivered many babies to many happy mammies and daddies across the Border region and the midlands area.</p>
            <p eId="para_576"> In 2016, the national maternity strategy was launched and, as part of that, there was huge emphasis on promoting the importance of midwifery-led units. The strategy clearly states that there should be an emphasis on supported, assisted and specialised care pathways for maternity services. Its key goal was to develop an expansion of midwifery-led services. I cannot emphasise enough the importance of this service, not only to Cavan General Hospital but also to the whole of this island. If we are to make a comparison with the North, it has eight midwifery-led units whereas we have just two in the Republic. As I said, the first was established in Cavan General Hospital in 2004 and then a second unit was developed at Drogheda. I understand both units are out the door with bookings from eager parents and expectant mums and dads who want to use the service. We know the service is extremely professional and is an holistic and unique, natural pathway of care for parents.</p>
            <p eId="para_577"> It was disappointing that, in June, deep concern was raised that the service might be in any way diminished or pared back because, as I said, it is a very significant part of the maternity services in Cavan General Hospital. This came about in a very curious way and in a way that any of us would find concerning. It did not come in writing and nobody can tell me who gave the order, or anything like that, but a directive was given last June to staff within the midwifery-led unit to stop taking bookings. I raised this at the time with the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and he picked up the phone and met with the midwives in the hospital. He gave them assurances that it certainly was not part of his or his Department's plan that there be any diminution of service in the midwifery-led units.</p>
            <p eId="para_578"> At the time, the Department requested a review of the service and I hope any review would seek the expansion of the capacity of the service. As I said, there are only two such services in the Republic and, therefore, the significance and importance of this cannot be overstated. In June, when there was concern that the service might be in any way diminished and the Minister got involved, the directive that had been given evaporated. While all of us would say that was a good thing because it removed the uncertainty for the staff and parents, nonetheless, the review was left hanging there. Clarity, guidance and direction are needed in terms of where that is going, what is its purpose and who has requested it. As I said, the Department seems to have taken this route after that particular incident in June. The review was promised for the end of September and it is now November, but the review has not happened or has not been published. I hope that, today, the Minister of State will be able to provide clarity on that.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Frankie Feighan)<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T17:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_579">First, let me thank the Deputy for raising what I know is a very important issue. I fully understand how important the midwifery-led unit at Cavan General Hospital is to the women and families who access maternity care there. In that regard, on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, I would like to commit to ensuring that midwifery-led services will continue to be available at the hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_580"> Last June, the Department of Health became aware of reports in local media referring to the planned merger of the midwifery-led unit and consultant-led services at Cavan General Hospital. The Department was not advised of any intention to merge the services at the hospital or, indeed, of any intended change to the arrangements that had been in place. I should be clear that the programme for Government contains a firm commitment in respect of the implementation of the national maternity strategy. Therefore, current Government policy is to provide and expand midwifery-led maternity care right across the country, including in Cavan.</p>
            <p eId="para_581"> I should remind the House that budget 2021 provided new funding of €12 million for maternity and gynaecology developments. This significant funding will ensure a renewed impetus to the implementation of the national maternity strategy and the roll-out of the new model of maternity care. In particular, the funding will help to build capacity in the maternity services workforce and further develop community-based midwifery services.</p>
            <p eId="para_582"> With regard to the situation in Cavan, the Deputy will recall that the Department requested the national women and infants health programme to engage with the RCSI Hospital Group to provide a report on the matter. Assurances were also sought that maternity services within the RCSI Hospital Group are, and will continue to be, developed in line with Government policy. The Department has recently been advised by the HSE's chief clinical officer that the RCSI Hospital Group has undertaken an initial assessment of the Cavan midwifery-led unit. I understand that the findings of that assessment indicate that if the service is to continue and, indeed, expand, the input and support of a senior external clinician will be required. I am pleased to confirm that a clinician has been identified from within the existing Rotunda Hospital consultant complement and will commence working and attending at Cavan General Hospital for an average of two days per week in the coming months. In the meantime, the Department has been assured that the midwifery-led service will continue operating as normal and that bookings are being accepted from women wishing to avail of it.</p>
            <p eId="para_583"> I assure the Deputy that the Department will work with the national women and infants health programme to ensure that any additional supports required to secure and expand community midwifery services in Cavan will be put in place. This will ensure that midwifery-led services at Cavan General Hospital are supported, strengthened and expanded, in line with the national maternity strategy.</p>

            <p eId="para_584">I thank the Minister of State. I cannot help having a suspicious mind as to why a review is being held in the first place.</p>
            <p eId="para_585">That said, the Minister of State's response is welcome. I sense that he, the Minister for Health and the health team are fully behind the midwifery-led unit, and that is clear in the response. This is an issue I feel passionate about. This is a terrific service which provides an option for women in maternity care, not just in County Cavan but throughout the Border region and in the midlands. As the Minister of State knows, it is Government policy to roll out midwifery-led units throughout the country. I have always had a sense that the midwifery unit in Cavan General Hospital does not have the support it should have, the backing the staff need or the promotion it deserves. I hope the Minister of State, Minister for Health and Department will do everything they can to close gaps that exist in terms of promoting the service, informing women and encouraging GPs to inform women to consider it as an option. It has been my sense heretofore that that has not been the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_586"> As is evident from the national maternity plan, and as the World Health Organization has stated, midwifery-led units provide good maternity care. I am all for women having options. There are eight midwifery-led units in the North. We should have quadruple that number on the island of Ireland. I will fly that flag for women in this country. </p>
            <p eId="para_587"> The Minister of State's response is welcome. I will follow up with him and the Minister for Health to ensure extra staffing is in put place to benefit the midwifery-led unit in Cavan General Hospital. I encourage the Minister of State to do anything he can to ensure the unit gets the support, backing and promotion it deserves because the staff there are second to none.</p>

            <p eId="para_588">I thank the Deputy for her passionate work and support on this important issue. Much good work has been done since 2004. The programme for Government commits to the implementation of the national maternity strategy, which recommends the development and expansion of midwifery services through the provision of a midwifery-led model of care within a multidisciplinary team for pregnant women deemed to be at normal risk. Good progress has been made since the strategy's publication in 2016, with midwifery-led care and community-based maternity services increasingly available across the country. The significant funding provided in budget 2021 will facilitate the further expansion of midwifery services next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_589"> I assure the Deputy that the Department and Minister will work closely with the national women and infants health programme to ensure that any supports required to secure and expand community midwifery services at Cavan General Hospital will be put in place. This will ensure that midwifery-led services at the hospital are not only supported and strengthened but expanded and developed in line with the national maternity strategy.</p>

            <p eId="para_590">As I am sure the Minister of State is aware, there have been difficulties with the local authority veterinary service in recent years. The county veterinary officers do much of the veterinary work in the counties around the country. Until now, they have been funded by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, through a service level agreement with each local authority. In the past three or four years, there has been a reduction in the funding and a pull-back from the FSAI. Although the central funding going to the FSAI has increased, it has tried to cut the funding given to the local authorities to provide this vital service.</p>
            <p eId="para_591"> There was a dispute which would have caused the county veterinary officers to withdraw the service to local authorities at the end of this month. That would be detrimental to many small businesses around the country but I understand a crisis was averted in the last ten days when an interim agreement was reached for 2021, which will ensure the service continues. After that, however, we will not know where we are. We have an opportunity over the next 12 months to ensure a proper service level agreement is put in place for three or five years, as would be the norm, to ensure the current level of service is maintained.</p>
            <p eId="para_592"> One of the key roles the local authority veterinary service carries out relates to small abattoirs and food production companies that use meat as one of their core elements. The local authority veterinary service has to carry out inspections of these premises and ensure all the regulations are adhered to. If the service were to withdrawn, it would throw all these businesses into crisis. I mentioned this a few weeks ago and the Ceann Comhairle remarked that the Christmas turkeys could be in danger if the service were withdrawn. That is exactly what the county vets do. The people who produce turkeys, including small producers of a couple of hundred turkeys, must have the local county vet come to inspect and ensure everything is done properly. It is a vital service. Its role expanded in recent years as small food start-up companies are often referred to the local veterinary service and these vets then go out and work with them. The local enterprise offices, LEOs, in many local authorities work closely with the local vet to develop small businesses in the food sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_593"> This is a vital service. It is a retrograde step that this dispute went so close to the line that the service was about to be withdrawn entirely coming up to Christmas. We have a stay on that for 12 months and there is an opportunity to ensure the service is bedded down properly and made sustainable into the future through a three-year or five-year contract that would guarantee the service. I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.</p>

            <p eId="para_595">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for that and I thank my colleague, Deputy Kenny, for raising this issue of funding of the local authority veterinary service. I know how important these services are in our local areas and the work they do. The FSAI is the competent authority with overall responsibility for the enforcement of food safety legislation in Ireland. Enforcement is managed through service contracts between the FSAI and a number of official agencies, including the local authorities, as the Deputy said. Local authorities are responsible for food law enforcement at over 500 small food businesses, including small meat processing plants and more than 170 slaughterhouses. Activities undertaken by the local authority veterinary services, LAVS, on behalf of the FSAI under the service contracts are legally required under EU food law.</p>
            <p eId="para_596"> County veterinary officers also perform a range of other functions and services such as the enforcement of animal health and welfare legislation at slaughterhouses, on-farm emergency slaughter and verification of competence to slaughter by plant operatives. They also have statutory responsibility in relation to dog and horse controls, dog licensing and the regulation of dog-breeding establishments.</p>
            <p eId="para_597"> The FSAI and the County and City Management Association, CCMA, on behalf of the local authorities, have been engaging for some time regarding the funding and effective delivery of the FSAI service contract. Both parties have agreed to work together to introduce a new, more efficient model of service. The local authorities are seeking additional funding for 2021, which is expected to be reduced, with the introduction of the new service model. The annual funding provided by the Department of Health to the FSAI is inclusive of funding to the local authority service contracts and, while funded by the Department, the FSAI is independent in the exercise of its functions. Notwithstanding the need for a more efficient model of services, additional funding is being made available by my Department to the FSAI in respect of LAVS service contracts for 2021 to provide stability to the service and the businesses which would have been impacted by the cessation of the local authority service contracts, which was being proposed by the CCMA for the end of November 2020. The FSAI is working closely with all parties to ensure a system of food safety controls is in place in local authority supervised premises from 1 December 2020. In this regard, I have been advised that the FSAI has in recent days had positive engagement with the CCMA regarding the extension of the current service contracts.</p>

            <p eId="para_598">I thank the Minister of State. I was aware of most of what was in his statement and the proposals to upgrade and modernise the system to ensure that efficiencies can be brought in all seem well and good but we want to make sure that does not mean a reduction in the funding the veterinary services receive. Those kinds of terms are often a cover for a reduction in funding and we would be concerned about that.</p>
            <p eId="para_599"> We are also conscious that we are facing Brexit and everyone knows that the amount of food that we import and export within the island, North and South, and across to Britain, will be impacted if we do not get the kind of Brexit deal that we want. It is looking increasingly as if that is going to run into more difficulty. This service would absolutely have to step into the breach if that were to happen and it is vital for us to have a sustainable future and pathway laid down to ensure that will happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_600"> The Minister of State mentioned issues around animal welfare and all of that. Vital services are provided by the local authority veterinary services on the ground. For many people when they have a problem in an area with stray animals or whatever, the veterinary service is the first port of call. They provide a vital service in that respect.</p>
            <p eId="para_601"> The Minister of State raised the issue of the sustainability of services and the fact that business would be impacted by their cessation. To allow the service to arrive at the level where it was only a couple of weeks away from being withdrawn was a mistake that has undermined a lot of trust among the service providers here. There needs to be a re-establishment of that over the next year while we have this interim arrangement in place. I invite the Minister to inform the Dáil that a long-term contract will be put in place to make this sustainable for the next five years because that is what needs to happen so that local authorities know they are on solid ground and will get the money they need to develop a service the way they need to and that it will be in place come what may, Brexit or otherwise.</p>

            <p eId="para_602">I again thank the Deputy for raising the issue of funding for local authority veterinary services. As I said, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, and the County and City Management Association, CCMA, have been engaging for some time on the official food controls carried out by the local authority veterinary service under service contracts with the FSAI. It is accepted that the service model required review and the FSAI and CCMA, on behalf of the local authorities, have been in discussion over a new model to reform the service.</p>
            <p eId="para_603"> The FSAI has provided an increase in funding for 2020 and notwithstanding the work that is to be done to address the current service model's inefficiencies, it has offered further additional funding to the CCMA in respect of 2021, subject to a number of conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_604"> On 28 October 2020, the CCMA agreed to the FSAI's offer of additional funding and associated conditions. The FSAI will now send contracts to the local authorities with a view to having them in place by 1 December. It is important to emphasise again that the current service model requires improvement and the FSAI needs to assure itself that the service and funding levels are appropriate and that the service provides value for money and fulfils EU obligations in an appropriate manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_605"> I welcome the fact that there has been positive engagement with the CCMA regarding the extension of the current service contracts and I am confident that the FSAI and the CCMA will work constructively together to ensure that a new service contract model is developed in 2021.</p>
            <p eId="para_606"> Deputy Martin Kenny has rightly outlined the wide range of services that are provided. I hope that when level 5 lockdown ends in the next few weeks, the Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Kenny and I can find a locally-sourced turkey and share it for a dinner shortly before Christmas, perhaps with some other accoutrements.</p>

          <p eId="para_609">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_610"> I will be sharing time with Deputy Ó Ríordáin if he arrives in time, or I would appreciate it if the Ceann Comhairle would put him on the slate for contributions. The Labour Party has presented this short, simple Bill which we believe to be very important. We are disappointed that the Government has chosen to submit an amendment to further consider it because that will kick it down the road for 12 months. We do not see a need for that. We feel that is a device that has crept into how the Government is reacting to good, well thought out Bills. This legislation has been designed to attack and change something that is at the very heart of Irish society, that is, the issue of privilege as it relates to education.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">As the Minister is aware, the Education Act 1998 provides that 25% of places for any given year can be held for the children and grandchildren of past pupils of a particular school. I deal with a number of schools in my own constituency, including community schools, Educate Together schools and Gaelscoileanna. This admissions policy is never used by those schools but is used predominantly by fee-paying schools. It is about intergenerational privilege and about passing down the school tie and crest. The knock-on effect of this policy when it is applied in a school in Dublin, for example, is that people who move to Dublin from anywhere else in the country, or from another country, are automatically at a disadvantage if they would like to send their children to such a school.</p>
          <p eId="para_612"> This is something that needs to change and should change. We feel that such a change would have broad support. We hope it will have broad support across the House. This kind of privilege and elitism needs to be tackled anywhere we find it. We spent the majority of this week dealing with issues of privilege and access. I refer to the discussion about the Tánaiste and GPs, which came up today on Leaders' Questions. Privilege was at the very heart of that debate. When it comes to our schooling and education system, and I am not an expert on this, we know that there is privilege within it. This Bill, as short and succinct as it is, goes a long way in tackling that.</p>
          <p eId="para_613"> In proposing this legislation, the Labour Party is asking the Minister to withdraw her amendment and to allow the Bill to advance to Committee Stage. The Minister is proposing her amendment on the basis that it will allow the Government to consider the Bill and bring it back in a year. This Bill, like other Bills, can be considered on Committee Stage. Schools will still be able to consider their own admissions policies for next year. We are under no illusions that this Bill will fly through the House. There is nothing flying through the House from the Opposition during this Dáil. We are all aware of that. I ask the Minister to allow this Bill to go through, to be put in the queue, to proceed to Committee Stage, to be thrashed out by the education spokespersons at the Select Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and to go through due process. I ask her not to continue this new Government device of kicking things nine or 12 months down the road. This will create backlogs that the Government will not be able to clear and will make for bad Parliament, substandard procedure and poor legislation. I will be interested to hear the thoughts of the other spokespersons in the House and of the Minister.</p>

          <p eId="para_614">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_615">To delete all words after "That" and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_616">"Dáil Éireann resolves that the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2020 be deemed to be read a second time this day 12 months to allow for a review of the impact of the provision of section 62(10)(b) of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 to be undertaken and for that then to be taken into account in the consideration of this Bill."</p>
          <p eId="para_617">I fully appreciate the intentions of Deputies Duncan Smith and Ó Ríordáin in bringing forward this Bill. I do not dispute that they mean well. However, the timing of this Bill would have serious unintended consequences for schools that are currently undertaking their admission processes for the 2021-22 school year under the existing legislation. </p>
          <p eId="para_618"> As the House is aware, the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 was signed into law on 18 July 2018. The overall objective of the Act is to provide a new framework for school enrolment that is designed to ensure that every child is catered for and that the way in which schools decide on applications for admission is transparent. The measures provided for in the Act make the admissions process transparent and consistent for all. The Act creates confidence for parents that the admission criteria laid down by schools and the procedures used by them are visible and legitimate.</p>
          <p eId="para_619"> The 2018 Act is part of a suite of measures that seek to take greater account of the needs of parents and students in the school system. It provides for schools to state explicitly in their admission policies that they will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the Traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion, while including provision for single-sex schools and denominational schools to reflect in their admission policies the exemptions applicable to such schools under equality legislation. The 2018 Act also sets out certain criteria that schools cannot take into account when deciding on an application for admission or considering an offer of a place, such as consideration of a student's academic ability, skills or aptitude, or consideration of a parent's occupation, financial status, academic ability, skills or aptitude, apart from exceptions provided by the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_620"> On 14 January 2020, certain sections of the Act were commenced in order to be operational in time for the admission processes for the 2021-22 school year. From February 2020, all recognised schools in Ireland were required to draft a new school admission policy in accordance with the Act's requirements. The Act was commenced earlier this year to allow sufficient time for consultation with the patron, the staff of the school and the parents of the children attending the school, as required by the Act. The new admission policies which have been approved by patrons are now published on individual school websites. These policies will apply for admission to school for September 2021 and onwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> Schools have worked extremely hard to develop, consult on and draft these new policies. The Act requires that any subsequent changes to a school's admission policy requires the consultation and patron approval process to be undertaken once again before the policy can be published by the school. Given that schools have just completed this process for admission to school next September, any changes required midstream would be hugely disruptive to schools, particularly at a time when they are contending with the current Covid-19 challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_622"> This Bill proposes to delete section 62(10)(b) of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018, which allows schools if they so desire - and this is an important consideration - to take into account a student's connection to a school by virtue of a parent or grandparent having previously attended the school when deciding on an application for admission to that school. This is subject to a limit of 25% on the number of available places that can be filled by a school using this criterion. Schools continue to have discretion in their admission criteria and how they are applied, as long as they are non-discriminatory and transparent.</p>
          <p eId="para_623"> There is no evidence available at this time that indicates that the provision the Bill before the House is proposing to delete is subject to widespread use, or indeed that any difficulties are posed for those seeking admission to schools where it is in use. Schools that are not oversubscribed must accept all applicants.</p>
          <p eId="para_624"> Rather than opposing this Bill outright, the amendment I am proposing allows time to review the use of these admission criteria by schools in order that an informed and considered view of this proposed legislation can be formed, based on our knowledge of the use of these criteria and their impact, if any, on school admissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_625"> Importantly, the approach I am proposing avoids disrupting and delaying the school admissions processes for 2021-22 which are already under way in schools. I am sure the Deputies will agree with me that schools and school leaders are working tirelessly at this time to lead our school communities through the challenges of Covid-19. This timed amendment avoids unnecessarily adding to the workloads of schools at this time. This is a reasonable approach given the challenges that schools are operating in at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_626"> Information on how many schools will choose to invoke this 25% provision and its impact or otherwise on school enrolment will only become apparent when it becomes operational in September 2021. This amendment seeks merely to provide for an opportunity to review the use of these admissions criteria in order that an informed view of this proposed legislation can take place.

          <p eId="para_632">I appreciate very much Deputy Ó Laoghaire's accommodation. I appreciate very much the opportunity to propose this Private Members' Bill. It is good that Opposition Members get an opportunity to bring forward legislation on this matter and to engage with the Minister on this basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_633"> The Labour Party feels very strongly about this Bill. We feel very strongly about education and equality. When one campaigns for equality one is not campaigning because one thinks it is fashionable. One campaigns for equality because one believes in one's Republic. The word, "Republic" is tossed around a lot. People call themselves republicans all over the world. A republic does not mean the absence of a monarchy. A republic means that every child has the same opportunities regardless of who they are or where they are from. Everybody knows that in the past 100 years of this Republic, we have not lived up to that. That does not mean we should not try. </p>
          <p eId="para_634"> There is no greater thief in Irish society of the Republic than poverty and disadvantage. Poverty steals childhoods. It steals dreams. It steals aspirations. It steals futures. The great liberator from that theft is education. People will ask us and other political parties here why we felt so strongly about school profiling when the leaving certificate controversy was happening. The Minister, in fairness to her, moved on the issue of school profiling because what was in essence at stake was the beautiful anonymity that a young person had of walking into a hall with a student number and nobody knew who they were, the accent they used, their address or who their parents, or grandparents, were. </p>
          <p eId="para_635"> There is a sense sometimes in Irish society, which may be more powerful than people in this Chamber are willing to admit, of the old school tie. I refer to the question, "What school did you go to?" and the identity, the power and the influence that comes with that. It identifies one as somebody. In some circumstances, that identification lasts for life. For others, it is not that important but how can a school admissions policy be fair to a child whose parents did not go to secondary school - I know people think that is something that happened in the past but it is not true - or somebody whose parents did not go to a secondary school in the locality or in the country when, in an over-subscribed scenario where a school has to choose between that child and another, that the school the child's parents, or even grandparents, went to will come into consideration?</p>
          <p eId="para_636"> Every time we talk about educational disadvantage or reforming education or look around the world for better standards of education or changing things in Irish education in terms of literacy, equality or standards, we always look to Finland. The difference with Finland is not just about the money they put into education or the resources available to them. It is that they fundamentally believe that equality should underpin their system. </p>
          <p eId="para_637"> Nobody separates children like the Irish do. We are obsessed with it. We have 4,000 schools in a country with a population the size of Manchester. We separate them by religion, by gender, completely disproportionately in the European context, and by income in certain circumstances. This section of this Act means we can separate on the basis of parents and grandparents. That does violence to the idea of a republic.</p>
          <p eId="para_638"> I appreciate the Minister's words but it is not good enough to say that there is no evidence that anybody has used this section of the Act and that we do not know if anybody is doing it. If that is the case, why is it in the Act? It is in the Act because of the lobbying of a certain section of the education system. We know this to be true. There are certain vested interests in Irish education, particularly at second level, who want this section in the Act because they want to keep the royal bloodline of succession within their schools. They want to be able to count on the income of the parents, and the grandparents, of past pupils for fundraising. It is as stark as that. They want to keep the identity of their school in Irish society. It is the reportedly old school boy phenomenon, although it is a old school girl phenomenon as well. "What school did you go to? My father went there. My grandfather went there."</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> If a child's father, mother or grandparents did not go to second level, why should they be at a disadvantage? The system should almost turn itself over to facilitate somebody whose parents or grandparents did not go to second level. Surely a child whose parents are from outside the area, or the country, should be at the top of our priority list in terms of cherishing and lifting that child because that girl or boy lives in a republic. A republic means it does not matter who their parents or grandparents are.</p>
          <p eId="para_640"> There are many issues we will talk about in these Chambers when it comes to education. There are many issues on which we will agree and disagree. There are many issues we will try to promote. We will have many justifiable arguments but surely, some of the basic things we should agree in this Chamber is that we live in a Republic and we stand by that Republic. It is not just a word. It is an ethos. It is an ethic, and it goes through everything we do. Any section or subsection of any legislative measure that comes into this House should have the litmus test of standing by that Republic.</p>
          <p eId="para_641"> I know almost exactly what my colleagues are going to say. I know exactly what the Social Democrats and Sinn Féin are going to say. They are going to agree with this Bill. I appreciate the Minister is not coming in here to advocate for it to be voted down in its entirety but I submit to her that it would be in the proper republican tradition of her party, and of this House, for her to re-engage with her Cabinet colleagues to assess again the ethic behind the Bill and what we are trying to achieve and to realise that when it comes to trying to give children equal access it should appal us that there would ever be a legal right for any school to say to one parent over another, "I'm terribly sorry but this parent, and his father, attended this school and on that basis we can turn your child away". They should not have a legal right to do that. The Education (Admission to Schools) Act allows them to do that. The section of that Act should be deleted. The Minister probably agrees with me.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">Between now and Wednesday next, when we have the vote, it would be best if we all agreed the section needs to go and if we did not hide behind reviews, as the Minister is suggesting. The word "republic" is oft used and oft abused but it is something that is special and sacred and that we should stand by.</p>

          <p eId="para_643">Leaving aside the Bill, I want to mention how the Government is dealing with Opposition legislation. As far as I know, not a single Opposition Bill has been accepted without some amendment by the Government. So many good Bills have come before the Dáil since the Government was formed. What is happening speaks to me of an Administration that is not willing to listen to the Opposition, for all it might say otherwise. It is a very common strategy of the Taoiseach to criticise people whom he believes are not working with him or not being constructive but the Government needs to consider how it works with the Opposition when it introduces useful legislation. Its legislation is voted down or, as happens quite frequently, a rider is attached and it is kicked down the road for 12 months or subjected to some process whereby it is never really meant to be seen again. This approach is not unique to the Minister. In fact, the Bill before us is the first education legislation that has come to a vote this session. This is an issue for the Government as whole. What is happening is not good enough. There will be more legislation introduced, again containing good ideas, and I do not want to see it needlessly refused or delayed on the basis of a partisan point of view or, as is evident sometimes, the Government's desire to take credit for all the good things that come through this House. That should not be the way.</p>
          <p eId="para_644"> We are supporting this legislation. I commend Deputy Ó Ríordáin on summarising this correctly. It is very useful legislation. It is legislation that I would rather were not necessary. It was first proposed as an amendment to the Education (Admission to Schools Act), such as it is, which started out about four years ago. In fairness to the current Minister, she was not involved in it. It is difficult to comprehend why the former Minister, Deputy Bruton, took the attitude he did. There is no logical reason to have a number of places set aside for potential students who had a father, grandfather, mother or grandmother in a school. There are very logical and practical reasons for setting aside places for siblings but there are none for setting aside places based on parents or, much more tenuously, grandparents having attended a school. The former Minister's defence was that in the past there were no limits. Previously, there were no restrictions in any number of ways when it came to school admissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_645"> School admissions are uncontentious where schools are not oversubscribed but where they are, they are subject to scrutiny. Parents and, indeed, lawyers go through admissions with a fine-tooth comb and places are fought for tooth and nail. That is the reality, particularly in rapidly growing urban areas. It is an unfortunate reality. There are still parts of the State whose rapid demographic growth is such that the Department is struggling to meet demand. Admissions policies make enormous differences. Where there are restrictions of the kind in question, children who live close to or only a few doors from a school that is the natural place for them to attend – it is typically a post-primary school – are kept out by virtue of parents who were former pupils pushing successfully to have their children placed in the school, even though there is no practical reason they should go there and even though they may not live in the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_646"> Deputy Ó Ríordáin is correct that the old school tie does matter. It matters in this institution; we all know that. There are many backgrounds represented here with connections that do matter. They matter in business and in all walks of life. It is true that people from certain schools have more access and influence and more of a say than others. Sadly, parents decide on the schools their children should go to not only on the basis of the quality of the education there but also, and very often, on the basis of the networks that will be available to the children and the lives they will be set up for by virtue of having attended them. I could name schools, of course, but I am not going to get into that because this is an issue of policy. There is no good reason to have the artificial number set aside. The Minister said she will go away and gather evidence but there was no evidence behind what was done. There was lobbying from the fee-paying school sector to do it. Bhí siad tiomanta don áit a bhí acu sa chóras oideachais a choimeád go daingean agus go dlúth. Bhí siad ag iarraidh a chinntiú go bhfanfaidís sna scoileanna sin, go mbeidís in ann mionlaigh agus daoine ó chúlraí áirithe ar nós an Lucht Siúil a choimeád amach, agus go mbeidís in ann an stádas láidir uachtarach atá acu a choimeád. Níl sé sin ceart ar chor ar bith.</p>
          <p eId="para_647"> It is also the case, through this and other means, that school admissions policies are used to exclude people from minority backgrounds, particularly ethnic minorities and Travellers. Class is also a consideration. I urge the Minister to reconsider her position ahead of the vote and reconsider the Government’s philosophy on Opposition Bills. It is really not good enough. Many more good policies will come before the House and I hope the current approach will not obtain all the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_648"> While I have the opportunity, I want to raise two more issues relating to school admissions. School planning areas are an enormous source of frustration. School planning areas were first drawn up in 2008. They are bluntly drawn. They were never subject to public consultation and they are not subject to it now. Most people do not know what they are or the areas they take in. Some of them are extremely large and some are quite small. In many ways, they seem very abstract, considering that they are not publicly advertised. Where a school is located on the periphery of a school planning area, there are very real practical effects. I raised this before with officials in the Department and the former Minister and they said there were no plans to review it. This needs to happen. I can think of three schools in my county, two in my constituency, where people from the adjoining communities are accorded a lower admissions priority because they are just beyond an arbitrary school planning line. I am sure there are more examples. In one example, a new and growing suburb will have a school but about one third of the area in question will not have priority or be considered part of the key catchment area for the school. The affected pupils are connected to a school planning area that is connected to a town 12 km or 13 km away where they are not going to go to school. They will be lower down the food chain if the nearby school is oversubscribed, which I very much expect. Children will very likely be denied the opportunity to go to a school that is less than 1 km away. That is not good enough but it can be solved. It means that the Department needs to examine the concept of school planning areas and engage in public consultation. The areas should be drawn in a way that reflects real communities. Perhaps there should be some flexibility whereby schools could tell the Department what their natural catchment area or community is if it does not correspond with the school planning area. This should not be difficult to resolve but it should be resolved. It is causing difficulties in Cork and I expect it is causing difficulties in Dublin, Kildare and other rapidly growing urban areas. I ask the Minister to examine this.</p>
          <p eId="para_649"> The main school admissions issue raised in my office, not in my capacity as a justice and education spokesperson but as a constituency Deputy, concerns autism spectrum disorder, ASD, units and special schools. It is heartbreaking when parents produce 12 letters of refusal or waiting lists for places. They might have been looking for a place for three or four years before coming to us. I am aware there are efforts to increase the number of units – I have seen some evidence of this at primary level, at least, in my constituency – but they need to go a lot further. We also need many more special school places. We come across children for whom the ASD unit is just not a fit.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">They need special school places.</p>
          <p eId="para_651"> There is a significant gap in the number of ASD units at post-primary level, particularly in my area of Cork city. It is leading to parents and SENOs scrambling. They are doing their best, but they cannot work the miracle of the loaves and fishes. If there are no places, there are no places. That leads to children being home schooled when they could be in schools and other children being in units when they should be in special schools. All in all, it leads to a great deal of trauma, difficulty and educational loss.</p>
          <p eId="para_652"> Regarding the specific issue of school admissions, I urge the Minister to support this legislation. There is no logical reason not to do so.</p>

          <from>Deputy Louise O'Reilly<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T18:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_653">I thank the Deputies for introducing this timely and important Bill. With respect, it is difficult to believe that the Minister does not support it. It has a basis in equality and I do not know what possible reason she has to object to that. She did not outline any when she spoke. Perhaps she might enlighten the House at some stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_654"> School places are at a premium in my constituency. In population terms, my constituency is the youngest in the State and one of the fastest growing. Building has not kept pace with demand. In Swords, for example, it is almost as if school admission policies exist to keep pupils out of schools. Every year, we get letters from parents who are frantic because they have one child in a school and have been told that they might not get a place for a younger child. That is frustrating. The Bill is timely because, in examining admission policies, we also need to determine what capacity is required to meet demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_655"> There is no justification for the current rule. The idea that one can be denied access to a school merely because a parent or grandparent did not attend it is abhorrent. It is shocking that the Minister does not find it abhorrent and that she seems to be okay with the old school tie network. We know why the old school tie works. Recently, we saw in the Dáil how privilege brought with it access, in some instances to the highest levels of government. Despite that, the Minister is prepared to do little to tackle the notion that a child can be denied a place in a school simply because his or her parent did not attend it. Plenty of people have parents who did not attend secondary school. My Dad did not. My Mam did, but if I had needed to rely on that, where would it have left me? Someone could be excluded. That is not right. It surprises me that the Minister can support not taking action. As has been mentioned, even if this legislation is passed following next Wednesday's vote, it will not be rushed through in the blink of an eye. There will still be time to deal with all of the matters the Minister outlined. I find the idea of the old school tie network, the nod and the wink and so on abhorrent. I urge the Minister to join me in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_656"> The impact of this system on a person whose parents were not educated in Ireland or were members of the Traveller community or another ethnic minority serves to exclude people who are not from what might be called the right class, estate or bloodline. That is incredible. I join others in urging the Minister to consider this matter and try to work with those of us in opposition who want to work with the Government, be constructive, use our time in the House wisely and be able to make a real difference. That is why we were elected. We were not elected to sit by and watch while the Government passed its own legislation. We have been elected to work hard for the people we represent.</p>
          <p eId="para_657"> I will use a minute of my time to raise a local issue with the Minister. I have written to her about it. Will funding be released to St. Nicholas of Myra National School on the Malahide Road? It needs a recreation and physical education hall. It has planning permission. The Minister has often stated that she wants to see shovel-ready capital projects. This is one, but for some reason she is not providing funding. In the middle of a pandemic, it is essential that there be a place for children to gather in their pods. I urge the Minister to reconsider her decision and revisit the idea of providing funding. It is not a large amount of money. The kids need a recreation and exercise facility, particularly in the middle of a pandemic. If the pandemic has shown us anything, it is how overcrowded our schools are and the need to change same.</p>
          <p eId="para_658"> There has been a great deal of discussion in the Chamber, the media and all around about how privilege operates in this State. The Minister will be aware of how it operates. No more than me, she has had a chance to observe it. She has seen how it operates. This Bill is an attempt to break that chain and disrupt the old school tie network. For the life of me, I cannot understand why she does not support it. It would not be enacted overnight, so there would be time to make all of the arrangements that she rightly outlined needed to be made. I urge her to reconsider her decision between now and the vote on Wednesday.</p>

          <from>Deputy Martin Kenny<recordedTime time="2020-11-05T18:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_659">I listened to the Minister's speech. She stated that her legislative measures would come into effect next September and that they would apply new regulations on school admissions, but I cannot understand why she said she needed a year for that to happen and that this Bill would somehow mess up what she was trying to do. There is nothing in it that contradicts the Act at all. Instead, it is complementary of the Act's objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_660"> I compliment Deputy Ó Ríordáin and the wider Labour Party on introducing this Bill. It goes to the heart of what we are about. I listened to other Deputies, mainly from urban backgrounds, talking about overcrowding in and pressure on schools. I come from the opposite end of the scale and a place where we only wish we had more students. There are three-teacher schools shrinking to two-teacher schools in rural areas because we cannot get enough students. In fairness, we have high achievers and children who progress well. Unfortunately, they must go further afield to attend university, particularly those from the north west where there is no university. They have to go outside the region and very few return because there are few jobs for graduates there.</p>
          <p eId="para_661"> All of these issues are linked. Deputy Ó Ríordáin discussed poverty and what it does. Poverty is not just the absence of money. It has other aspects. It engenders an absence of ambition, of possibilities and of looking forward to a brighter future. We see that around us everywhere. We come across people who are struggling in life and for whom a little crisis will muck up whatever future they have. Something as simple as a washing machine breaking down could be a crisis in their household because they live week to week and only have enough to get by. They and their families live under stress, and it is difficult for a family living under stress to have the mental capacity to plan for a positive future.</p>
          <p eId="para_662"> Education is the one thing in the country that we have always said is free. It goes back to Donogh O'Malley and the concept of free education, particularly at second level. That was revolutionary and magnificent.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">Bit by bit, we see it creeping back. In recent years,more charges have come in for children going to school. It may be the pressures of the capitation grant, whereby schools do not get enough money and then they put a little pressure on parents to try to come up with some. All of that leads to a withdrawal of free education replaced by partially free education. That needs to end and the Minister seriously needs to examine that.</p>
          <p eId="para_664"> I have in mind situations involving school buses. When I was going to school, we got the school bus and there was no charge for it. Now there is a charge for it. Now there are numerous rules relating to it, including how close a student is to the school and how many children are in the catchment area. If the number is insufficient, the bus will not go down a given road. Where the bus stops is another issue. If it does not stop at a student's door, the student has to go so far to get the bus. If a family has to put a child into the car to go to meet the bus, they may as well go the whole way to the school because it would save the €600 per year it costs to pay for the bus.</p>

          <p eId="para_666">I understand that. I will come back to it, but it is all part of the same point. The point is that all of these issues are related to where we are in society. From the end of society I am talking about, I am referring to my experience in my area but I am looking at another Bill coming through the House, which is about looking at the opposite end of it. I refer to the fee-paying schools, the elite of the elite. Even at that, there is extra privilege added. Not only do people have to be able to pay to go to these schools, they have an extra advantage if the family that came before them came from a wealthy privileged background. It sets out the haves and have-nots in society. We need to sit up and take notice of other countries in the world. We have all been sitting up late at night looking across the Atlantic at a nation that has set itself up on the basis of have and have-nots. Where does that lead? The essence of what that Bill says is not appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_667"> We need to come back and look at reality. We need to look at the experiences of real people. We need to recognise that, as was said earlier, we are in a republic. In that republic all children should be treated equally. All families should be treated equally and should have equal access. Those who are at the bottom need to get an extra lift up. Those who are at the very top certainly do not need additional privilege built into the system to assist them. That privilege needs to be taken away. The effort and energy should be to ensure that everyone gets a clear and better possibility of making a better future.</p>
          <p eId="para_668"> The Minister has brought forward the idea of putting this out for a year to consider it. As Deputy Ó Laoghaire said, that is part of what the Government strategy seems to be with every Bill that comes forward, no matter how positive it is. The idea seems to be that the Government will push it on a little further and push it out. The Government will not simply say it is a good idea and agree to it and implement it. Yet, in the same breath the Government will ask why the Opposition is not more co-operative and does not try to help and so on. We want to help. We are coming forward with good ideas and proposals. Sometimes they may not be perfect. That is why we have a committee system. The Bill will go into the system and be thrashed around. Spokespeople and experts will be brought in, including people from the fee-paying schools. If they want to send in their organisations, the people who represent them can come before the committee and put forward whatever good or logical reasons they have. The matter is then in the open and debated. Then,we can progress things. However, to say that we are going to put it out for a year before we do that is simply kicking the can down the road. It is not a good idea. It does not reflect a Government that is about looking after everyone equally and cherishing all the children of the nation equally. That is what needs to happen. That needs to change.</p>
          <p eId="para_669"> I hope that by next Wednesday, when it comes to the vote, the Minister and her colleagues can re-examine this and recognise that there is merit in doing it now. It will not go through Committee Stage in a matter of weeks. It will take months and possibly more than a year. The Minister is talking about postponing this before it gets through a committee. We all know that. We have good legislation that is simply being pushed to one side because it is coming from the wrong place. That is most unfortunate and it is a poor reflection on Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_670">We must attend to a little housekeeping. Given that we started at 5.55 p.m. the debate must conclude at 7.10 p.m. At the end I must give five minutes to the Minister and ten minutes to Deputy Ó Ríordáin to sum up. That means we have a little over ten minutes for Deputy Gary Gannon and Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú. Deputy Gannon is up first. If he takes all ten minutes, there will be nothing left for Deputy Ó Murchú.</p>

          <p eId="para_671">I was planning on going on some wanderings but I will not do that now.</p>
          <p eId="para_672"> What we are talking about today, if we cut out the substance of what I was going to say, is power, privilege and the manner in which they replicate. This happens not only in the Irish education system but in Irish society as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_673"> Education in Ireland is defined by many characteristics. It is full of decent people, including principals, special needs assistants and teachers. Many of our schools have become places of sanctuary for students. These places are not only about educating them. They are places where students go to get fed and where they find a place of comfort and people to whom they can speak. That is very much part of our education system.</p>
          <p eId="para_674"> Yet at the heart and foundation of our education system, we find the manner in which power and privilege replicate. This happens in a manner that is stark. Every year we see it in our institutions and universities. We see that the people who get to go to the most elite universities are predominantly from the schools that are fee paying and that have elitism factored into them. We cannot deny that. I cannot get a parliamentary question answered on it. Yet if I pick up <i>The Irish Times</i> feeder school list, I will see it spelled out clearly in the list. The people who get access to the best courses come from the best schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_675"> We have a situation in Ireland where we have a pupil-teacher ratio of 26:1. I hope this will reduce to 25:1 in accordance with the budget but that will only happen in some schools. It does not happen in all schools. It happens in schools that are national or State schools. However, there are other schools where that would not even be considered. They have far lower pupil-teacher ratios. That gives people greater access to teaching times, supports and all that comes with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_676"> Then we see the starker manner in which power and privilege replicate. They are protected by a law that has been enshrined since 2018. Some 25% of school places have to be reserved. Their allocation depends upon whether a parent or grandparent went to the school. It is nonsensical and it lacks any sense of justice. The issue of access lacks any sort of basic justice and common decency and there is no reason this should be protected in our law. If we went back to 2018 to look at the groups advocating and lobbying for that Bill, we would not find Pavee Point, the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, the National Women's Council of Ireland or SPARK, which advocates on behalf of one-parent families. We would not find any of those institutions that try to protect and enhance the rights of people. Instead, we would find other institutions. I have no wish to cast aspersions on their characters but they are often places where people pay money to replicate privilege. That is what we enshrined in law in 2018.</p>
          <p eId="para_677"> This Bill was brought forward by my colleague, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, from the Labour Party. It is succinct and short and seeks to address that. In 2020 in the Irish Republic is there any reason we cannot simply accept the fact that this is a good Bill? It is based on decency. It is not going to have major ramifications for the society we live in other than simply making it a little fairer. If that is not what this Chamber is about, then I am unsure what else we are trying to do here.</p>

          <p eId="para_678">The glorious thing about coming in at the end is that all the good points have been made and I can steal one or two of them. I commend Deputy Ó Ríordáin. This is simple legislation. It has been said by almost all speakers that we are talking about equality. This is a small move. It is a step in the right direction and we could easily do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_679"> It was said by some of my colleagues earlier that we could simply let this go from Second Stage to Committee Stage and then deal with any issues. At that stage all stakeholders would have an opportunity to come in. It is difficult to see this as anything other than a scenario where those who are already ahead ensure they stay ahead. The reality is that there are schools that use this 25% rule as a means of ensuring that the right people go to the school. That means the wrong people do not but they may already be in a situation where they have had to deal with fewer opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_680"> My father was a principal in Dundalk at St. Joseph's National School in Muirhevna Mór for many years. From time to time, he would refer to the issue of teachers who would try to do their best. They would be all into ensuring that they were getting the best results from the children and all the rest of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">However, he said that very quickly they needed to realise that sometimes there were kids in class who did not necessarily have all the supports and opportunities they should and that there was absolutely no point in having a row with a kid about not having homework done or not having a pencil when the kid might not have had breakfast for a couple of days. This Bill will not deal with those sorts of problems but it is a step in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_682"> We have had other difficulties as Teachtaí Dála in our constituencies. We have often had parents come to us about not being able to get their kids into particular schools. They fall on the wrong side of a line on a map that was decided arbitrarily and sometimes does not make a lot of sense. I ask the Minister to examine the rules and protocols in respect of all that with a view to allowing for something more sensible.</p>
          <p eId="para_683"> I do not need to continue in that vein. This is a straightforward ask. Should this not happen? Should we not give people opportunities as opposed to giving an added benefit to those who already have it and do not necessarily need it? Do we make our society slightly fairer? As I said, this Bill will not deal with all the inequalities we have. We need to consider a greater level of early interventions. It is not just that we need more SNAs and need to ensure we have early diagnoses; we need to ensure we provide all these added supports such as breakfast clubs that people may need when we are dealing with cases of sometimes multigenerational trauma. Here we all deal in other parts of our work with the outworkings of this. We work with children who were never given the supports they required and who then, later in life, due to bad choices that are, in turn, down to bad opportunities end up in bad places. We have all dealt with these sorts of circumstances. The drugs problem and other societal problems all stem from this. We, therefore, need to deal with the very simple issues we have here. If it is something like this, straightforward legislation that will introduce a level of equality that will make some people's lives better, we should do that. We then also need to consider major interventions that are required to give those supports to those children, communities and parents with a view not just to equality of opportunity but to equality of outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_684"> It is in the Minister's hands to deal with this one simple request, and there is absolute agreement in this Chamber that it would be very simple. It would also be a message about how we in this House can work together and about bringing about the best results for the people we represent. Once again, I ask the Minister to put aside the general politics and to consider offering something that will make this world a little better. I commend Deputy Ó Ríordáin on what is a very straightforward request that may just make things a little better.</p>

          <p eId="para_685">In Deputy Ó Ríordáin's absence, I absolutely accept his bona fides in introducing this Bill and his good intentions. In the interest of fairness, my motivation in moving this amendment is equally well intentioned. I have listened to the Deputies with interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_686"> I must point out and, indeed, take exception to remarks that have been made about not alone my party but also the Government in which I serve in respect of the value and importance we place on education. No one recognises or prioritises more the importance of education than the current Government. That is an indisputable fact, considering the package of resources and measures it has put in place. In excess of €400 million has been put in place for Covid measures within our schools. A budget just short of €9 billion in resources is being introduced for the benefit of our schools. The measures included in the budget, as Deputy Gannon mentioned, ensure that the pupil-teacher ratio will fall from 26:1 to 25:1. The budget also caters for a reduction by three points in the enrolment entitlement to retain a teacher. Equally, 1,065 additional posts are being made available, 400 of which will be for teachers who will work with children with special educational needs, to which Deputies have referred. There will be almost 1,000 additional SNAs, bringing the number within our school system to a record high of 18,000. A sum of €740 million is being made available to provide 200 building projects and an additional 145 projects, 200 of which will be completed in 2021, a further 145 of which will begin by July 2021. There are other supports I could mention, such as a package of DEIS supports, but I will not go on. I wish to make clear, however, the determination and focus of the Government on education. It has been alluded to on numerous occasions by the Government that it is a number one priority. That can be seen in the delivery even thus far, in the early stages of the Government that was formed on 27 June.</p>
          <p eId="para_687"> Specifically, I have moved this amendment because schools are currently undertaking their admission processes for the 2021-22 school year in accordance with their agreed and published admissions policies. It would, therefore, be hugely disruptive to schools and their communities to delete the provision as proposed in the Bill at this time. As I have previously outlined, the Act requires that any changes made to the published admissions policy of a school require consultation within the school community, redrafting and approval and publication by the board. At the current time in particular, this would cause an increase in workload for schools, as I am sure all the Deputies would appreciate.</p>
          <p eId="para_688"> Equally, it would be premature to accept the Bill, which proposes to delete section 62(10)(<i>b</i>) of the Act, without undertaking a review of the impact and use of the provision. The amendment I have moved represents a fairer approach that allows time to assess the impact of this section on school admissions. Again, it is worth noting that schools may choose to invoke the 25% provision and we will not know that until it has kicked in in September 2021. In allowing time for review, we will then be in a better position to make an informed decision rather than a rushed response at this stage, which would have the unintended consequence of causing disruption to schools and increasing their workload when they are operating under other significant challenges at this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_689"> To reiterate, information as to how many schools will choose to invoke this 25% provision and its impact or otherwise on school enrolment will only become apparent when it becomes operational in September 2021. This amendment seeks only to allow an opportunity to review the use of this admissions criterion in order that an informed and considered view of this proposed legislation can take place.</p>

          <p eId="para_690">I wish to state genuinely my appreciation to my colleagues from Sinn Féin and the Social Democrats who have attended this evening for taking part in the debate and, indeed, my colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith, who proposed the Bill. It is gratifying to know that people feel similarly across the Opposition benches about an issue of equality and of education. I very much appreciate the Minister's attendance. There has been a practice sometimes of Ministers of State coming in for such business. The Minister is present and I very much appreciate that. It would have been illuminating, possibly, to hear other Government voices and their views on the Bill, but that is how it is.</p>
          <p eId="para_691"> Part of the reason we have such an objection to this part of the Act is because of who is asking for it. It is being asked for by a particular vested interest group, the fee-paying second level sector. They are the ones who asked for it, and they got it. It goes against any sense of justice I have that a particularly powerful vested interest gets what it wants when it comes to Irish education in the form of an admissions Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">That is wrong. It was stated eloquently earlier that one might imagine a disadvantaged child who has all these things to overcome, whose parents are early school leavers and who battles his or her way through the DEIS system. The Minister mentioned DEIS and I just want to remind her that her cut in pupil-teacher ratio does not transfer automatically to all DEIS schools. I hope she rectifies that between now and next September.</p>
          <p eId="para_693"> Some children have oral, language and dietary issues. There are also the drugs issues that are sometimes in their communities, the housing issues and the way society looks down upon the way they speak. Some children and the way they speak are depicted in the media as if they are either untrustworthy or stupid. Children know and feel this and are aware of it from an early age. They battle their way through primary school and all those obstructions between them and maximising their potential, a lack of resources, etc. They finally make their way to secondary school and a scenario can legally exist whereby a principal can say to the parents of that child that he or she is terribly sorry but the school has 25% of its intake set aside for the children and grandchildren of past pupils. What kind of message is that to send to that family? It is a pretty powerful message that it does not really matter what a person tries to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_694"> There will always be a State-sanctioned legal reason to put a person back in his or her box. The Minister can say that we do not know how often it is being invoked and that it may be too difficult to take it out. If we have learned anything from the past number of months, however, it is that it actually is not that difficult. I know from my time in government, and it was brief enough, that if it is important enough and the people it affects are powerful enough, it can be done immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_695"> The Minister is not criticising the ethics of or intention behind Bill. I appreciate that. I appreciate her bona fides when it comes to education but can we agree this should never have been inserted in the first place? We are just trying to take out something that should not have been there. That is all. They came, they asked and they got their way. That is all, except they should not have got their way.</p>
          <p eId="para_696"> As I said before, in a republic or in any sort of admissions Bill or legislation that tries to enhance the opportunities of children, it should not matter where or if a person's parents went to school. There is a list of minority groups set down in the existing legislation against which a school is not allowed to discriminate. There are, however, a disproportionate number of Traveller children whose parents did not attend secondary school. Of course, there are a disproportionate number of migrant children whose parents did not attend secondary school in the State, never mind those from disadvantaged backgrounds whose parents or grandparents may not have attended secondary school. There are three groups, off the top of my head, who need education more than anybody else because they have no other route out of poverty. Boys and girls who attend private schools will be fine. They will make their way and they will be grand. For the children to whom I refer, education is their one chance - it is the great liberator. The Minister knows that. Yet, children must compete for places in oversubscribed schools with those whose parents or grandparents attended such schools. The Minister knows and I know that is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_697"> This Bill will not change the world; that is not the intention behind it. What it tries to do, however, is call out over-influence in these Houses by a group of people who get what they want. They come to these Houses, ask for something and get it. They expect to get it. As Deputy Gannon quite rightly said, if Pavee Point, the National Women's Council of Ireland, Migrant Rights Centre Ireland or another interest group that tries to advocate for the rights of those who do not have the same power walked in and asked for something like the admissions Bill, would they get it as readily and as quickly? Could they walk into the corridors of power and get a section into a Bill as readily and as easily and then have somebody like the Minister stand up and defend it? That was the interesting thing about the Minister's contribution. She did not actually defend it, she just stated that it would be too difficult or too onerous to take it out immediately. That is her defence. There is, therefore, no defence for the relevant section. The Minister does not have a defence for the section.</p>
          <p eId="para_698"> This is what we are talking about here. There is a wider issue in Irish society that relates to influence and power: who has it and who does not; who uses it and who wields it; and who gets it and who gets things done because they can. It is not just about politics, it is about businesses. As Deputy Ó Laoghaire stated, these are all facets of Irish life. The people to whom I refer know each other. They play golf together. They talk about the old days in school together and ensure that they enshrine in legislation that this can continue from one generation to the next. We are suggesting that we must focus our attention on the children and families that do not have this kind of power. That needs to be the cornerstone of our belief system in the Republic. It is offensive to me that such a moneyed, influential and powerful education lobby gets its way. The existing legislation was passed by the Dáil and the Seanad. We put down the amendment at the time that was supported in the Seanad by Sinn Féin and other Opposition groups - not the Minister's party, I must say - in order that this would not be enacted in the first place. We outlined to the then Minister the reasons we were against it. We told him why it was wrong. Our argument was dismissed and the legislation was enacted.</p>
          <p eId="para_699"> As others have stated, politics does not have to be this way. It does not have to be about us versus Government and having a row and scoring points off each other. It does not have to be about bringing in other issues and trying to pretend to the public we have all the answers and that the Minister is making nothing but mistakes, because that is not true. It is just not accurate. The Government works hard and has decent people within it trying to achieve things for the people. I absolutely accept that and people in opposition are similar when legislation that is well-intentioned is brought forward by the Social Democrats, Sinn Féin or the Labour Party. As one accepts, not every item of legislation from Opposition is well-intended. Obviously, sometimes there is game playing and grandstanding. That happens a lot. We accept that. The Minister has accepted, however, that is not the case here. She must accept that when it comes to Sinn Féin, the Social Democrats or other groups in this Chamber, it is often not the case. She has accepted this evening that it is not the case. In light of that, would it be possible, between now and next Wednesday, to come to a position whereby the Minister will take a different approach to the Bill, namely, that the relevant section of the Act can be deleted because we are starting afresh and because, in post-Covid Ireland, we will have a different mindset about how our public institutions and schools can be run?</p>
